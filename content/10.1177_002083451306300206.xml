<p>63.2559 ABDELRAHMAN, M. — <bold>A hierarchy of struggles? The “economic” and the “political” in Egypt's revolution [2011].</bold> <italic>Review of African Political Economy</italic> 134, Dec. 2012: 614–628.</p>
<p>Egypt's revolutionary process is facing serious challenges, not least of which is the absence of a broadly based movement that can harness the energy of the masses. The forces of the counter-revolution are using all means to derail the process especially by effecting a schism between “economic” and “political” demands where the former is portrayed as extraneous to the course of the revolution. The article demonstrates how this separation in any struggle is falsely conceived and in the case of Egypt is being used as a deliberate tactic to protect the interests of the capitalist state and its agents.

<p>This article [examines] the perceptions of citizens of Kyrgyzstan in terms of how the memory of the legacy of the Soviet era lingers on and is re-evaluated in their minds in the post-Soviet era on the one hand, and how the developments of this new era shape their perceptions of democracy on the other. The analysis reveals that the developments of the independence era both resulted in a re-evaluation of the Soviet past and shaped to a large extend relatively optimistic perceptions of democracy in the country.

[Résumé en français]</p>
<p>Building on field research among Syrian refugees in Cairo, the paper investigates the shifting understandings of state and regime among participants of the Syrian protest movement. It maps the various efforts by the protest movement to deconstruct the regime's “language of statehood”. Institutional state formation in Syria has been coupled with various techniques of meaning-making, to normalize the regime's position as indispensably bound with the state. The regime's capacity to control the producton, circulation and consumption of signs, symbols and discourses has been used as an instrumental power technology. A central strategy of the protest movement is therefore is to disentangle the regime from the wider state by exploiting the fissures between the regime's techniques of self-representation and its everyday manifestations. This strategy include the subversion of the presidential personality cult, the appropriation and reorganization of the regime's rhetoric, mocking and cursing the regime, and a re-evaluation of its authority.

<p>What are the deep roots underlying the wave of religious movements in the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean countries? It is the blow to identity and social values that the secular groups which ruled these countries since independence have constantly inflicted on major sectors of their societies. The Islamist parties, strongly fought by the ruling classes supported by the West, exploited this deep resentment electorally. The author analyzes the past decade of Islamic ruling power in Turkey and elaborates on the future of societies in this region. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article discusses the support and satisfaction with democracy in the economic, institutional and political context in one of the worst economic crises suffered by a democratic country, using the <italic>Barómetro Latino</italic> data for the years 1997 and 2001.

<p>The narrative of American decline reflects an overreliance on evanescent economic trends and a lack of appreciation for the cultural factors that nurture the processes of globalization and innovation. Despite political dysfunctions, the US's demographic and cultural assets are uniquely suited to these processes. Meanwhile, challengers such as China and India must navigate even more serious political, economic, demographic and environmental challenges — and they may face cultural backlashes within societies that are ambivalent about their future direction. Globalization may well be a pernicious process, one that bleeds the planet's resources; yet as long as it represents the main arena of international competition and collaboration, reports of American decline may be as premature today as they were in numerous other moments over the past half-century.

<p>This study classifies and explains democracies in the 47 Muslim countries between the years 1998 and 2008 by using liberties and elections as independent variables. Specifically focusing on the context of the Muslim world, it examines the performance of civil liberties and elections, and democratic transitions and patterns that followed. Based on the quantitative data primarily collected from Freedom House, it demonstrates: (1) the “not free, not fair” elections, “limited” civil liberties and the “Illiberal Partial Democracy” were the dominant feature; (2) [most] Muslim regimes remained without any transitions to a better or worse level of democracy; and (3) a slow, steady positive transition of both elections and civil liberties occurred in the Muslim world with changes in the nature of elections becoming much more progressive compared to civil liberties transitions.

<p>The author argues that the Islamic mainstream has effectively adapted to the globalized world and will shape the future of Islam in ways open to principled accommodation with the West. Mainstream assertiveness, unencumbered by Western interference, provides the most effective way to counter destructive radicalism. [R]</p>
<p>63.2567 BANSAL, Alok — <bold>Iran: its strategic importance.</bold> <italic>Strategic Analysis</italic> 36(6), Nov.-Dec. 2012: 848–858.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult tasks facing the foreign policy-makers in India is the requirement to balance the relations with Iran while enhancing proximity with the US. This invariably raises questions over the importance of Iran. An ancient civilization, Iran is located at the crucial junction of South Asia and the Middle East. It also links the Central Asian Republics and the Caucasus region to the Arabian Sea. Historically, it has influenced its neighbors, irrespective of the type of government in power. One of the oldest continuously inhabited civilizations, it forms a bridge between the Semitic world and the Indo-Aryan civilization of South Asia and has had strong historical linkages with India. This article looks at the strategic importance of Iran for India. [R] [First article of a thematic issue on “India-Iran relations”, edited and introduced, pp. 837–847, by P. R. KUMARASWAMY.

<p>During the first decade of the 2000s, Bolivia occasionally turned violent. Yet the causes of these episodes of sustained violence have not yet been identified. This article tests which mechanisms theorized by existing scholarship produced two prolonged episodes of violence. It concludes that both episodes emerged from the same causal pathway: the national government provoked violence by seeking to raze the economic foundations of well-organized sectors — sectors that represented the mass bases of ascendant political oppositions. This finding not only sheds light on political order in Bolivia, but also opens up new directions in research on violent confrontation in Latin America. [R]</p>

<p>For the past two decades parts of southern Europe have turned out to be the least secure area of the continent. Political conflicts in Cyprus and Moldova, between Serbia and Kosovo, between Macedonia and Greece underline the incapacity of the Balkan elites to reach pragmatic solutions to strengthen regional security. Unfortunately, hatred, nationalism and intolerance also provide a groundswell of instability. At the same time most countries in the region have managed the transition from authoritarian or totalitarian rule to various forms of democratic governance.</p>
<p>63.2570 BIZIOURAS, Nikolaos — <bold>The formation, institutionalization and consolidation of the LTTE [in Sri Lanka]: religious practices, intra-Tamil divisions and a violent nationalist ideology.</bold> <italic>Politics, Religion and Ideology</italic> 13(4), Dec. 2012: 547–559.</p>
<p>Utilizing the case of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, I make a three-part explanation for the critical role that religious organization, ideological fitness, and state capacity played in the formation, institutionalization and consolidation of the LTTE in the Tamil ethnic mobilization process. First, the Tamil religious re-awakening during the British colonial period enabled the emergence of low-caste groups such as the LTTE in the 1970s. Second, the LTTE's ideology privileged its nationalist goals over Marxist doctrinal purity, an ideological approach which increased the LTTE's legitimacy within the Tamil community. Finally, the intense intra-Sinhalese elite-level bidding wars, driven by the partisan competition for power, reduced the autonomy and capacity of the Sri Lankan state and enabled the consolidation of the LTTE as the leader of the Tamil ethnic mobilization drive.

<p>For 20 years, the Hungarian political system was a liberal democracy and incumbent governments lost every election with the notable exception of 2006. The media criticized politicians heavily, democracy was consolidated and, in 2004, Hungary joined the EU. Hungary thus remained — until the eve of 2006 — a success story of democratic consolidation. By 2011, however, Hungarian society was forced to realize that the system that had become increasingly freer over the decades had come to a standstill and was turning in an autocratic direction. This raises questions whether it is possible to roll back history and to return to an autocratic system as a fully-fledged member of the EU.</p>

<p>Protection has risen to prominence over the past decade in fields from humanitarian practice to military operations. Its rise, however, has been characterized by a lack of clarity over what it means in practice. This article discerns the politics of protection by examining a specific case: the international effort to protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army. It argues that the initiatives being mounted to protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army should be seen as efforts to constitute and experiment with new forms of transnational political authority, specifically unaccountable, militarized administration networks that bring together state, international, and substate actors and institutions.

<p>Institutional and economic development has recently returned to the forefront of economic analysis. The use of case studies (both historical and contemporary) has been important in this revival. Likewise, it has been argued recently by economic methodologists that historical context provides a kind of “laboratory” for the researcher interested in real world economic phenomena. Counterterrorism economics, in contrast with much of the rest of the literature on terrorism, has all too rarely drawn upon detailed contextual case studies. This article seeks to help remedy this problem. Archival evidence, including previously unpublished material on the DeLorean case, is an important feature of this article. The article examines how an inter-related strategy, which traded-off economic, security, and political considerations, operated during the Troubles. Economic repercussions of this strategy are discussed. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Georgia has been displaying the characteristics of a failing state since the early 1990s with its weak political structure, lack of a national financial system, rampant ethnic strife and illegal armed groups. To complicate the matters more, the control of state over its national territory was compromised and the involvement of foreign powers worsened the situation. The main problem in current Georgia is the lack of opposition and the emergence of strong presidential candidate alternative to M. Saakashvili. Georgia's short-term political future depends on the 2012 parliamentary elections, and the 2013 presidential elections. The new constitution will come into force after parliamentary elections. The new political order, Saakashvili's political attitudes, opposition's structure and other ethnic and political problems would be the main issues in Georgia's political agenda. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Why was [the Tunisian] Mohamed Bouazizi — neither an educated blogger, an Islamist, nor an industrial worker — an important icon in the Arab uprisings of 2010–2011? This article ties his iconization to the failure of the <italic>Gesellschaftspolitik</italic> of neoliberalism. It argues that Bouazizi exemplified the hitherto invisible struggle of the provincial and urban survivalist poor — who as “microenterprise” had been promised prosperity, civil society and democratization by neoliberalism. Instead they struggled daily against deteriorating economic conditions and official corruption. The resonance of Mohamed Bouazizi's plight mobilized millions in the region who had hitherto concentrated only on getting by. [A]</p>

<p>This article conceptualizes the multifaceted concept of national identity in Taiwan. The prevailing measures on national identity were ubiquitous, one-dimensional, and categorical, forcing people to choose between being Taiwanese and being Chinese or opting for independence or unification. Conceptual haziness leaves us ill equipped to examine the essence of Taiwan's identity politics. Hence, this article goes beyond national identity to explore the dimensionality that underlies its nature. [R]</p>

<p>This paper explores the growing trend in income inequality in [South] Korea and Taiwan. The two recent East Asian democracies have witnessed rising inequality since the 1990s but with cross-national differences. We find that market inequality is higher in Taiwan than in Korea, yet the Taiwan government's efforts to reduce this disparity are stronger than similar moves in Korea. By applying the logic of economic, social, and political effects, we find both similar trends and divergent paths in the politics of inequality in the two countries. [R]</p>

<p>This article questions the possibility of democracy in Africa by analyzing the reasons for successful democratization of Senegal. I examine the structural factors and strategic processes which allowed this country to deal with traditional African constraints such as colonial legacy, the difficulty in the formation of stable nation-state, ethnic rivalry which often turns into confrontation, and economic fragility. I emphasize Senegal's status as semi-periphery in the colonial period, the elaboration of a Wolof-Islamic center of nation-state identity, and the proud consciousness of Senegalese people as the leading civilized and democratic nation in Africa, as the main structural factors for democratization. I underline the cumulative effect of semi-democratic elections, the division of the incumbent camp and the unity of oppositions, the massive mobilization of citizens, and the two-round runoff electoral system imported from France.

<p>Fatah activists in Jerusalem did not initiate suicide attacks during the second intifada (which began autumn 2000), as opposed to Hamas activists in the city and Fatah activists all over the West Bank and Gaza. I suggest that one of the main reasons for this unique behavior is the tradition of the joint non-violent Palestinian-Israeli struggle in the city against the Israeli occupation and the settlement project, which was the strategic choice of Fatah leadership in Jerusalem under F. Husseini since the mid-1980s. I argue that it is not the contact between Israelis and Palestinians by itself that has led the latter to avoid killing civilians, and some of the former to refuse serving in the Israeli army, but the joint vision of the relation between the two people.

<p>Since 2011, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have been confronted with increasing challenges stemming from the Arab uprisings. Internally, they have had to face popular mobilization and discontent, triggering a mixed reaction, including economic handouts, patronage, limited political and economic reforms as well as military intervention and repression. Externally, they have actively intervened in support of the protest movements in Syria and Libya and enthusiastically facilitated President Saleh's departure from Yemen. At first sight, these responses may seem schizophrenic. Upon closer inspection, however, managing instability by shoring up friendly regimes on the inside and expanding the GCC's influence outside represent two sides of the same coin. [R]</p>

<p>Recent political science literature has made an exhaustive study of civil war violence, especially concerning the causes of such conflicts. Often, two different approaches prevail: the first focuses on macro variables and cross-country (and cross-time) analyses, the second on thorough within-case analysis and attention to various mechanisms and processes. This study blends insights from both approaches, building and analyzing a dataset of major violence-related variables collected at the local level during the 1992–1995 war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<p>All the authors in this collection of essays on Ukrainian politics stress the lack of improvement in the political situation in recent years. They identify a range of reasons including pre-Soviet history, the Soviet legacy, national identity, and political gridlock. While they disagree slightly on the extent to which change is impossible or merely difficulty, none is hopeful. The challenge for scholars is to avoid moving from objective analysis to assigning political blame. Some authors identify specific political actors on whom they fix blame, while others focus on less personal structural factors. The relative weight of structure-based and agent-based explanations is important in assessing the prospects for change in the future, and the possible paths to it.

<p>This paper traces the changes to the domestic politics of Arab states following the 2011 uprisings and places them in a continuum depending on the degree of internal conflict and contestation they have engendered. It also outlines the uprisings' effects on the three strands of Islamism-radical, Salafi and moderate-across the Middle East. The paper assesses the uprisings' impact on the confrontation between the Iranian-led and pro-Western camps. It argues that ideological and sectarian considerations in the post-2011 Middle East subtly interact with but tend to be trumped by the realpolitik calculations of the various players, which are defined by regime and state interests.

<p>The specter of Chinese nationalism, often invoked to explain the country's conduct, remains poorly understood. Its roots actually lie in the early 20th c. thought of Sun Yat-sen, who sought to “rejuvenate” China following its 19th c. humiliations. Today's leaders embrace this theme, nationalism produces a potent mix of confidence and insecurity in Beijing, complicating US efforts to manage this critical relationship. [R]</p>

<p>We examine here, between 2001 and 2009, the specific and dynamics of national systems of governance (NSG) of Mediterranean Arab countries (MA), when compared to countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). By NSG, we mean the combination of features of the system of governance of their firms and of their state. We emphasize the role of the EU in the process of acceleration (CEE) or delay (MA) in institutional change in these countries towards NSGs that are more respectful of the law. We attribute this delay to MA elites tempted by the introduction of a “limited access social order”. Do recent events in MA mark a popular political and economic transition in favor of an “open access social order”? [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2601]</p>

<p>The UK-Argentinian dispute regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands has been central to public debate in this the 30th year since the Falklands War.

<p>Russia looks at regime-change in Syria, which will bring Islamists to power and probably divide the country, as an extremely unwelcome prospect. Radical Islamism will consolidate its positions in the region; the considerable Syrian arsenals will be captured by extremist structures to be used against the CIS countries and Russia; Russia's economic and military-political interests will be crippled (the Libyan events cost Russia over $4 billion of economic losses). This is not all: Russia will lose its only ally in the Middle East. [R]</p>

<p>Analyzing the existing historical linkages between development dynalics and the nature of institutions, the neo-institutionalist economic literature highlights the role of cultural and religious beliefs, in locking economic expansion within the Arab-Muslim world. The hypothesis underlying this work emphasizes twi essential factors: on the one hand, the predominance within Muslim countries of personal and informal links, and on the other hand, the predominance of collectivist behaviors, whereas the individualistic orientation of the western medieval world helped to ensure its superiority. This contribution endeavors, in reference to Ibn Khaldun's intuitions, to show that, far from being attributed to cultural factors, the limits of economic development are reated to the institutional rigidification process that the Arab-Muslim world has experienced since the 12th c.

<p>Tunisians were the first in the region to oust a long-time dictator, one who had ruled the country for twenty-three years. It was a genuine popular revolution, started without a leader, and was nonpolitical, nonideological, and nonreligious. After toppling President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's regime, new political parties were established and free and fair multiparty elections were held, a giant step forward in the march toward democracy. The economy continues to be a deep source of discontent, however. Youth blame the government's inaction for continued unemployment. The Ennahda-led coalition needs to get the right mix of resources to make progress in reducing unemployment. Tunisians cannot do it alone; external assistance is badly needed. [R]</p>

<p>The global success of the film <italic>KONY 2012</italic> by Invisible Children, Inc., manifests far greater magical powers than those of J. Kony and his ruthless Lord's Resistance Army, which it portrays. The most prominent feature of the Invisible Children lobby is the making and constant remaking of a master narrative that depoliticizes and dehistoricizes a murky reality of globalized war into an essentialized black-and-white story. The magic of such a digestible storyline, with Ugandan rebel leader Kony as a global poster-boy for evil personified, not only plays into the hands of the oppressive Ugandan government but has also become handy for the US armed forces as they seek to increase their presence on the African continent.

<p>While a consensus is emerging about the importance of state-building and state capacity for democratization in both post-communist and developing countries, comparatively few explicit attempts have been made to provide empirical support for the relationship between the two concepts. Even more problematic is to find an explicit causal mechanism linking high state capacity with democracy. State capacity can be understood as the capability of the state to penetrate society, regulate social relations, extract resources, and appropriate or use resources in determined ways. In other words, strong states have high capabilities to complete these tasks, while weak states struggle to compete with private actors over extraction and appropriation of resources. But what makes strong states more likely to be democratic and, in turn, weak states less likely to be democratic? [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article reviews the literature of oligarchy in Indonesia, which offers a distinctive interpretation of political change in Indonesia [and] invites rethinking the ways in which authoritarian regimes fall. In the mainstream literature of democratization, the fall of authoritarian regimes is often portrayed as the triumph of pro-democratic civil society mobilization. Whereas many Indonesianists embrace this mainstream account in explaining the fall of the Suharto regime, the oligarchy literature suggests that its fall was driven not so much by the rise of civil society forces as by tensions between Suharto and oligarchs, in which the former was abandoned by the latter. The oligarchy literature also compels a reappraisal of the nature of Indonesia's new democracy. It sees political transition in Indonesia as a journey to an illiberal type of democracy: oligarchical democracy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Pakistan's inability to sustain a transition to democracy is especially puzzling given that India, which also emerged from the collapse of British rule in South Asia, has experienced only a brief bout of authoritarian rule (1975–77) and has managed to consolidate democracy — even though the quality of its democratic institutions and their performance leaves much to be desired. Many scholars have proffered explanations for Pakistan's failure to make a successful transition to democracy. This essay argues that all the extant accounts are partial and incomplete. The roots of Pakistan's propensity towards authoritarianism must be sought in the ideology, organization and mobilization strategy of the movement for the creation of Pakistan. This essay focuses upon the failure of civilian democratic institutions to fully abandon authoritarianism even when the military is not in power. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The elitist theory of democracy implies that elites are more committed to democracy than ordinary citizens. We test the theory in both democracies and non-democratic countries in Africa, using two different data sets: one of elites and the other conducted of general public. We base our analysis on two main items: abstract support for the democratic forms of government and confidence in state institutions as a measure of specific support. Evidence supporting the elitist theory of democracy is found in both indicators, suggesting that advocates of the theory under review are correct. Furthermore, in trying to explain the elitist theory of democracy, we discredit the social learning theory which states that elitist support democracy more than the masses because they are more exposed to democratic norms. We also find the argument that education accounts for the differences in elite-mass support for democracy weaker than theorists suggest. [R]</p>

<p>Although Western scholars almost unanimously agree that [the “Arab Spring”] will have an enormous impact on Al Qaeda and other groups that share its ideology, the voice of the jihadis has not been examined in detail. This article addresses this critical gap through an analysis of 101 significant documents produced by jihadi thinkers within a year following the movement's very first statement on the uprising in Tunisia. These include statements released by jihadi spokesmen, interviews with the movement's intellectual leaders, and discussions on jihadi Web forums. The article concludes that Al Qaeda and the jihadi movement largely believe that the uprisings provide them a great deal of new opportunities, and outlines the movement's developing strategy to capitalize on rapidly changing events on the ground.

<p>The Tunisian revolution had economic and social causes. it was carried out against exclusion and crony capitalism. It can be apprehended by a political economy approach, apt to explain the collapse of authoritarianism. The latter was able to remain in place thanks to compromises that linked the state to the poor classes, to labor and to capital. Nevertheless, the insertion of the Tunisian economy into globalization “from the bottom”, its inability to absorb graduates and the unjustified enrichment of clans upset the equilibrium of the system, and especially the social contract based on ascendant social mobility and the ideal of meritocracy. These ruptures helped social groups to unite in calling for the departure of Ben Ali and his family.

<p>In post-revolutionary Iran, the Basij militia group has helped the leadership of the country maintain political control by recruiting, indoctrinating, and organizing Iranians. As a semi-official pro-governmental militia, the Basij has controlled Iran's society by (1) engaging in local defense, (2) conducting surveillance, (3) policing society, and (4) suppressing dissidents. The militia group has also participated in national defense operations. Today, Basij members are organized into a clustered network of Basij bases, which are spread throughout Iran in order to control the society. Through eighteen branches, the Basij enrolls and organizes the Iranian population in three different levels. The reasons why the Basij became engaged in controlling Iran's population are discussed.

<p>In the context of the widespread “resurgence” of traditional authorities in Africa, increasing attention has been devoted to the manner in which the institutions of the state combine with those of non-state authorities. While much debate has focused on the implications for democracy, this paper addresses the relationship between traditional resurgence and violent conflict. An analytical framework that distinguishes between “institutional hybridity” and different forms of “institutional multiplicity” is presented. This is then explored through a case study of the Buganda Kingdom in Uganda, where institutional disputes over land and decentralization can be linked to the violence between state forces and Kingdom supporters that erupted in 2009. The analysis underscores the importance of careful institutional analysis in cases of traditional resurgence in order to mitigate violent conflict outcomes. [R]</p>

<p>In March 2012, a group of young military officers overthrew Mali's president, A.T. Touré.

<p>This paper studies power through data focusing on gender-age relations gathered ethnographically among the Acholi of northern Uganda. It analyzes these data through a framework combining M.

I suggest using ethnographically collected data makes an important contribution to studying power and propose replacing the idea of gender and power as a simple binary relationship with the concept that genderpower relations are always crossed with multiple modalities, among which, for gerontocratic settings like most in Africa, age holds particular significance. I conclude that gender analysis based on the local habitus is critical for empirical explorations of social interactions. [R]</p>

<p>The momentous 2005 Liberian elections followed a devastating civil war. Remarkably, the winner of the presidential race was a woman, E. Johnson Sirleaf, and the second-placed was a footballer, G. Weah. In addition, in stark contrast to many African elections, voting patterns were fragmented: voters often chose President, Senators and Representatives from different parties or independents. Much can be explained by a remarkably level playing-field delivered by an interim coalition government providing no incumbent. In 2011, the Johnson-Sirleaf incumbency stood to significantly change the dynamics. This article [examines] whether Liberian elections maintain their unusual patterns, whether Liberia has joined the ranks of African patron-clientelist, dominant-party or two-party systems, in particular compared to that of Sierra Leone, or whether there are new twists in its democratic development.

<p>Local ownership [is a] term neither clearly defined nor thoroughly implemented. Two main ambiguities remain: one relates to the counterparts chosen by the international community when promoting ownership and the second to whether ownership should be fostered over the design and/or the implementation of peace-building programs. The article depicts the practical consequences of these ambiguities at the example of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: a peace-building strategy overlooking local perceptions on the central state and sources of authority as well as a lack of attention given to local conflict causes and resolution mechanisms. It argues for a more nuanced relationship between international actors and their local counterparts that is constantly reassessed in order to include marginalized voices as well as an iterative approach to the promotion of local ownership.

<p>This article posits that ideology still plays an indispensable role in the quest to legitimize authoritarian rule in contemporary China, and that it does so precisely due to its high degree of adaptability. Based on D. Beetham's theoretical model of political legitimacy, three legitimizing functions of ideology that demand the constant adaptation of party theory and official language are introduced. Presenting various examples of reformulations of party theory and official language [since] the beginning of the reform period, the article demonstrates how the party regime relies on ideology to constantly reproduce its legitimacy, as well as the pitfalls of this reliance. Ideology in contemporary China should be analyzed as a matter of playing by the rules of the official language game. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1513]</p>

<p>China's impressive growth record has been facilitated by a unique relationship between Beijing and the provinces that encourages experimentation and incentivizes officials for driving economic growth — and for the most part this helped maintain political stability. While these arrangements spurred economic liberalization, political liberalization was put on hold. But rapid growth has not spared China from increasing social unrest given frustrations over widening disparities both in opportunities and outcomes and mounting conflicts over use of resources. Some now question the regime's capacity to deal with society's concerns.

<p>This paper discusses the interface between violence in the Niger Delta, global energy security and amnesty granted to armed groups by the Nigerian government. I [examine] the impact of the violence on energy infrastructure and how [it] endangers energy security. A major concern is that the amnesty program will fail because it was not preceded by negotiations between the government and combatants. [However,] before the amnesty proclamation, negotiations through committees and commissions involving stakeholders had been done. The issue of negotiation cannot be as important as the failure of government to tackle the fundamental issues which triggered the conflict. The deepening of democracy to ensure that votes count at elections is seen as the most likely option to guarantee the success of the amnesty program and secure the region and energy security.

<p>In less than one year, Burma has gone from an isolated, ruthless military dictatorship to an internationally-fěted, reform-minded government with a veneer of democratic legitimacy. Yet fifty years of military rule, economic mismanagement, and civil war have undermined the foundations of the state and left Burma ill-prepared to manage the complicated transition process. In the next few years, Burma will play host to ASEAN, hold national-level elections, integrate itself into the global economy, and usher in new political leadership. This essay examines four scenarios for Burmese political development in the near- and medium-term.

It argues that the historical shallowness of civic notions of citizenship was compounded by the instrumentalization of religion by the secular establishment, the embedding of Islamist actors in the electoral politics of patronage and the consolidation of Islamic capital in the wake of neoliberal policies since the 1980s.

To address the underlying root causes of the conflict, economic aid through the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) and the EU Peace II Fund is aimed at facilitating sustainable peace-building, reconciliation and community development. In this study, 95 community group leaders, civil servants, and community development officers in Derry, Belfast and the Border Area were interviewed to explore their perceptions about the impact of economic aid in terms of fairness of the application criteria, awareness of both funds, trust-building and sustainability.

<p>Greece has one of the most sustained problems of political terrorism anywhere in the world.

<p>Iran's historical flirtation with democracy has been one of thwarted desires. The 1906 Constitutional Revolution introduced the concepts of liberal democracy to Iranian society, but success was limited by the lack of support from the <italic>ulama</italic> (clergy). After decades of authoritarianism, under both the Pahlavi family and the ayatollahs, Iran has little experience with modern democratic institutions. We argue that without a fully formed civil society, the lack of progress toward democracy will be prolonged, unless the religious elite come to consider democracy to be in Iran's best interest. Given the seemingly domino-like effect of the Arab Spring, the <italic>ulama</italic> of Iran may not have much time before the push for democracy becomes an issue. [R]</p>

<p>Focusing on Egypt and Tunisia, I first analyze the scope and limits of political change prompted by the large-scale protests that in early 2011 led to the resignation of the two presidents, Z. Bin Ali and H. Mubarak. I [then] examine some broader theoretical implications of popular contestation, government responses and processes of regime transformation in both countries. Events over the past 15 months further question dominant approaches to the study of collective action in authoritarian contexts; however, contrary to recent claims, they fail to invalidate — in part even confirm — structural non-culturalist explanations for the longevity of authoritarian regimes in Arab countries. Above all, I argue that some critical differences between the <italic>anciens régimes</italic> in Egypt and Tunisia account for the partly divergent dynamics and outcomes of change so far.

Have Southeast Asian countries sincerely pursued neoliberal policy reforms since then? To answer these questions, this study comparatively analyzes the policy responses and discourses found in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, all of which have played an important role in the evolution of the Asian value debate.

<p>In August 2012, criminal convictions [were pronounced] for three young civic activists in Moscow and a former revolutionary leader in Kiev. Anti-Putin performers share the intent to show local opposition activists the rising costs of staging acts of disobedience against the authorities. The signal might have been persuasive enough. Despite a clear condemnation of the trials by Western governments and an outcry in the international media, less than a thousand people protested in Moscow and Kiev, once focal points for mass protests. This tranquility, however, may be deceptive and short-lived. Three Slavic autocracies — Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus — have entered a phase of political turbulence, which may lead to a growing repression and, simultaneously, increasing pressure for regime-change.

<p>This article explains the emergence of competitive authoritarianism in the Andes. It argues that populism — the election of a personalist outsider who mobilizes voters with an anti-establishment appeal — is a major catalyst for the emergence of competitive authoritarianism. Lacking experience with representative democratic institutions, possessing an electoral mandate to destroy the existing elite, and facing institutions of horizontal accountability controlled by that elite, populists have an incentive to launch plebiscitary attacks on institutions of horizontal accountability. Where they succeed, weak democracies almost invariably slide into competitive authoritarianism. The argument is demonstrated through a comparative analysis of all fourteen elected presidents in Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela between 1990 and 2010.

<p>Since 2009, the radical Muslim movement in northern Nigeria known as Boko Haram has become widely known in Western media for both its militant actions and its ultra-fundamentalist program. This analysis examines Boko Haram from a historical perspective, viewing the movement as a result of social, political and generational dynamics within the larger field of northern Nigerian radical Islam. The contribution also considers some of the theological dimensions of the dispute between Boko Haram and its Muslim opponents and presents the different stages of militant activity through which this movement has gone so far. Movements such as Boko Haram are deeply rooted in northern Nigeria's specific economic, religious and political development and are thus likely to crop up again if basic frame conditions such as social injustice, corruption and economic mismanagement do not change.

<p>While the revolutions of the 2011 Arab Spring deposed and replaced previously embedded autocratic regimes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia remained largely trouble-free. This article examines how the ruling Al Saud family was able to prevent the violent manifestation of tensions within Saudi Arabia. In state-formation, mechanisms were created to ensure the stability of the regime, to protect it from <italic>coup d'états</italic>. The long-term application of coup-proofing strategies cannot successfully respond to the challenges emanating from non-military sources. This analysis concludes that the Saudi monarchy has avoided short-term instability, but longer-term pressures facing the Al Saud family necessitate domestic reform. However, regional dynamics, driven by fears of an expansionist, nuclear Iran, a changing regional balance of power, and an apparent American exceptionalism for Saudi Arabia, make this reform unlikely.

<p>The study of Latin American politics has always generated great new research questions, and within Latin America, no country's experience has generated more interesting questions than Venezuela since the election of H.

Contemporary Venezuela raises fascinating questions about the collapse of a highly institutionalized party system and the erosion or breakdown of what had been the third-oldest democracy outside of the advanced industrial democracies. What accounts for these stunning developments? What can we learn from them? These issues go to the core of important developments in Latin American politics, and they are major issues for comparative political scientists beyond Latin America. [R]</p>

<p>At the heart of the notion of the post-secular is an implied and largely under-theorized idea of resistance against the pathologies of modern secular formations. This article contends that this understanding overlooks more embodied forms of resistance to the effect that it curtails our capacity to conceptualize post-secular resistance in international relations. Following a contextualization of J. Habermas's approach in the broader Kantian tradition to which it belongs, the article develops a contending Foucaultian reading of the body as a locus of resistance and uses this framework to analyze some of the events leading to the 2011 Egyptian revolution. The focus is on the publication of images and videos of police abuses by Egyptian bloggers and independent media as a practice of resistance to the widespread and systematic use of torture.

<p>War, business, and democracy can intersect in complex ways. In India, mining companies operate throughout a warzone between the government and a Maoist insurgency. Mining companies promised that their activities would benefit local populations, but over-reliance on the government to implement development initiatives eroded public faith. The Maoists used the implementation gap to recruit fighters and build public support through an anti-state and anti-corporate ideology. While traditional political ecology interpretations often blame corporations alone for negative mining consequences, this article explores how governance failures can also act as conflict triggers in mining districts.

<p>Although there is agreement that the Arab Spring reflects a world in transition, it is still not clear if “Additive Globalization”, which strengthens democracy and expands choices, will emerge as a greater force than “Subtractive Globalization”, which ultimately diminishes choices and nourishes dictatorships. Numerous revolutions have toppled dictators without making the psychological changes necessary to remove the “springboard” that a potential dictator uses to leap to power, resulting in the replacement of one dictator with another. The “springboard to dictatorship” model highlights the need for citizens to acquire the basic psychological skills to participate in and sustain a democracy. Social programs are necessary to develop these skills in post-revolution societies; otherwise the springboard to dictatorship will once again enable the rise of another potential dictator.

<p>Political actors in Germany feel forced to answer demands for individual citizens' participation by offering more options to participate and to direct decision making. The effects of such reforms which concern the selection of candidates, decision making on policies and times of participation are evaluated by long term as well as by cross-national comparison. The major finding is that people do not value greatly most of the new institutional arrangements. Parties follow trends without trying to modulate them. Thus their own power is reduced and core values of democracy are endangered, while the belief in democracy is not strengthened. Confidence in democracy might be more improved by setting and implementing realistic policy goals, which are results of open discussions. [R]</p>

<p>This article highlights the centrality of gender to the liberal peace-building agenda in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It examines the discourses and practices of liberal interventionism, focusing on the Office of the High Representative (OHR) as a crucial site for the constitution of gendered subjects and agents in this post-conflict zone. Drawing on post-structural theories and representations of Balkan identity, it explores the gendered articulations of P. Ashdown, first during his wartime visits to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, during his tenure as High Representative. A discoursetheoretical analysis highlights how Ashdown rationalized his involvement in wartime Bosnia-Herzegovina through a powerful self-identification with an “interventionist model of masculinity” which equates manliness with a responsibility to protect a vulnerable/backward/feminized Balkan “other” from violence and harm.

<p>The terrorist group Boko Haram, or the self-described People of the Tradition of the Prophet (SAW) for Preaching and Striving, continues to terrorize Nigeria, with horrible consequences. Clearly, study of the problem cannot be disconnected from the complex nature of Boko Haram itself, considering the group's unclear agenda and its shadowy sponsors — internal or external. A key question regarding the nature of Boko Haram is whether it has a transnational dimension or not. This paper examines the nature of Boko Haram terrorism in Nigeria. It argues that Boko Haram's terrorism does indeed have a transnational dimension, demonstrating that its agenda and targets transcend Nigeria, and that there are international links to the operations of Boko Haram.

<p>The approval of the new, controversial Egyptian constitution does not end the transition process that started with the overthrow of President H. Mubarak in February 2011. Rather, it moves the struggle for power between the country's new Islamist elite and the secularists that have ruled Egypt for decades into a new phase. New parliamentary elections will take place in the next two months. If secular parties obtain creditable results, even short of winning the majority, there is still hope that the transition will eventually lead to a democratic outcome. If secular parties suffer a resounding defeat, as they did in early 2012, the battle will probably move to the streets, with unpredictable results.

<p>The paper argues that the profound identity split strongly influences Ukraine's post-communist development, precluding effectively consolidation of any political system — either democratic or authoritarian. In most cases, the identity issue supersedes all other issues on the agendas of political parties and largely determines the character and results of electoral rivalry, and the way in which both domestic and international politics is viewed and articulated. The paper examines historical roots of competing identities in Ukraine, their essence and impact on two different visions of Ukrainian past, future, and “Ukrainianness” itself. The use and misuse of identity issues by Ukrainian authorities is a special concern of the paper that stresses the need of alternative policy aimed at a national reconciliation.

<p>This article tries to explain the reasons why the Kurdish people broke with a protest movement that, without a specific plan and consequently without guarantees for minorities for the Assad past era, asked for the fall of the regime. Although, for long the Kurds represented the most active opposition to the Assad regime. While this can be explained as a strategic consideration, it had an immediate effect on Syrian space: the Kurdish conquest and control of a region that, even if not yet well-delimited, is in the process of construction. Among the consequences of the process of creation of a Kurdish common region in the North of Syria there is the development of a progressive fragmentation of Syria according to community lines.

<p>This study analyzes [how] recruitment to the Finnish elites and coherence within the elites have changed as a result of important social changes in 1991–2011. Methodologically, the study is based on the positional approach and postal/internet surveys were conducted among the elites in 1991, 2001 and 2011. The conclusions are based on theoretical models characterizing various elite structures and their interconnections with democracy. The hypotheses are derived from important societal changes which have likely affected not only the population but also the elites since the early 1990s. The first hypothesis — that the openness of the elite structure is reduced as a result of important societal changes since the 1990s — was not verified. By contrast, the second hypothesis of decreased coherence within the Finnish elites was verified. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>63.2661 SARKISSIAN, Ani — <bold>Religious regulation and the Muslim democracy gap.</bold> <italic>Politics and Religion</italic> 5(3), Dec. 2012: 501–527.</p>
<p>This article argues that high levels of government regulation of religion help to explain the “democracy gap” in majority Muslim countries. Controlling for previously hypothesized determinants of democracy, it finds that as levels of regulation increase, levels of democracy decline. Examination of specific types of religious regulation in Muslim-majority countries uncovers a pattern of repression of religious expression that may be used to mobilize citizens politically. These regulations are targeted more often at Muslims who seek independence from state-controlled religion or who wish to challenge authoritarian governments, rather than at non-Muslim minorities or at religious worship more generally. Thus, authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes in Muslim-majority states successfully use policies toward religion to restrict political competition and inhibit democratic transition. [R]</p>

<p>This article situates the Marikana massacre, in which 34 mine workers were gunned down by police in South Africa, in the context of what the South African state has become, and questions the characterization of the post-Apartheid state as a “developmental state”. [After showing] how this misrecognition of the state is ideologically constituted, it argues for an approach to understanding the post-Apartheid state by locating it within the context of the rise of transnational neoliberalism and the process of indigenizing neoliberalism on the African continent. Third, it examines the actual economic practices of the state that constitute it as an Afro-neoliberal state. Such economic practices are historicized to show the convergence between the post-Apartheid state and the idealtype neoliberal state coming to the fore in the context of global neoliberal restructuring and crisis management.

<p>I explore the pre-negotiation process between Israel and the PLO, which ended with the signing of the Declaration of Principles (DoP) in September 1993. Scholars of conflict-resolution typically view these discussions as a positive example of how antagonists in ethno-national conflicts begin a course of constructive dialogue and conciliation. Applying pre-negotiation theory, I argue that the pre-negotiation process was [only] a means of conflict-management adjusting to contemporary circumstances. [I examine] the factors that brought the leaders of both parties to consider negotiation and accept it as the best option at their disposal. I explore pre-negotiation's functions and discuss how both parties failed to ensure that the necessary pre-negotiation functions of the process were exhausted. Thus, the failure of the Oslo process, which began with the signing of the DoP, was inherent in the process's flawed basis. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Can democracy make headway in the Middle East, [whose] societies are deeply “patrimonialized”, [where] patron-client relationships structure the interaction between state and society? This review essay discusses two recent books that cast new light on how countries can overcome such fundamental obstacles to democratization as patrimonialism. Most recently, F. Fukuyama has offered a comprehensive reinterpretation of human history with <italic>The Origins of Political Order</italic> [Vol. 1, New York, 2011], but one that is broadly in line with the basic understanding in D. C. North, J. Wallis and B. R. Weingast's <italic>Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History</italic> [New York, 2009]. However, both contributions are difficult to apply to contemporary cases of democratization. This review article sketches a starting point for such a contemporary analysis, which could also help us understand the prospects for democracy in the Middle East. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>December 2011 protests in Russia, the largest after the collapse of the Soviet Union, shattered the status quo that had taken shape over the last decade and signaled that Russia is entering turbulent waters. Russia found itself caught in a trap: the 2011–2012 elections perpetuate a personalized power system that became the source of decay. The top-down rule and its “personificator” — V. Putin — are already rejected by the most dynamic and educated urban population. However, no clear political alternative with a broad social support has yet emerged to replace the old Russian matrix. One thing is apparent: transformation will not happen in the form of reform from above and within, and if it does occur, it will be the result of the deepening crisis and society's pressure.

<p>This work focuses on Hamas's use of religion and ideology to legitimize its use of political violence within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I focus upon how Hamas has appropriated and (re)interpreted a core component of Palestinian national identity, i.e., the culturally entrenched and socially resonant norm of Palestinian heroic warfare that manifests itself as active and passive heroic resistance under conditions of occupation. This has effectively enabled the group to establish political legitimacy, garner civilian support and justify its use of political violence. This work also underscores the interplay between the active and passive faces of heroic resistance by illustrating how Palestinian active (i.e., armed) resistance is founded upon the elements of <italic>sumud</italic> (steadfastness) and <italic>sabr</italic> (patience), which are in fact the key signifiers of passive Palestinian identity and resistance.

<p>The relationship between language and ethnic identity is important. The importance is magnified in societies where language differences are a characteristic of inter-ethnic competition. Where language is connected to a political order, a change in that order can alter its fortunes. Afrikaans in the new South Africa constitutes an interesting context for the study of ethno-linguistics and the relationship between language and politics. With apartheid gone, the language no longer enjoys political patronage. Yet it remains an emotionally relevant and core feature of Afrikaner identity. This article considers the debate about the language's future in the light of research conducted with the Freedom Front Plus — which projects itself as South Africa's Afrikaner party. [R]</p>

<p>This article builds on the insights of the contact hypothesis and political socialization literatures to go beyond recent findings that racial and ethnic diversity have overwhelmingly negative effects on social capital, particularly generalized trust. Using the Canadian General Social Survey (2003), our results show that despite a negative relationship among adults, younger Canadians with racial and ethnic diversity in their social networks show higher levels of generalized trust. The results seem to confirm that youth socialization experiences with rising diversity and the normalization of diversity in a multicultural environment contribute to beneficial (instead of detrimental) effects of diverse social networks.

<p>I argue that space precedes and conditions the manifestation of borders. The argument is based on an understanding of cartography as a practice that mediates the relationship between space and borders. Drawing on B. Latour, I introduce the notion of cartopolitics to describe the process where questions pertaining to sovereign control over space are decided through cartography and law. In analyzing current border practices in the Arctic, the term cartopolitics captures how the relationship between the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and cartography is shaping the attempts by Arctic states to expand sovereign rights into the sea.

<p>When authoritarian regimes break down, why does communal violence spike and why are some locations more prone to violence than others? To understand violence during transitions, it is necessary to understand what sustains order when regimes are stable. While existing theories attribute order to formal or informal security institutions on their own, I argue that intercommunal order obtains when formal and informal security institutions are aligned. During authoritarian breakdowns, the state's coercive grip loosens, exposing mismatches between formal and informal institutions and raising the risk of communal violence. I apply an instrumental variables approach on a nationwide dataset of village-level data to show that prior exposure to military intervention, proxied by the distance to security outposts, led to Indonesia's spike in violence during its recent democratic transition.

<p>We focus on the rise of the pro-religious Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power in the 2002 elections in Turkey. Using the Turkish experience with political Islam, we evaluate the explanatory value of M. Juergensmeyer's rise of religious nationalism theory, with a special emphasis on the “failed secularism” argument. Our analysis indicates that the theoretical approach formulated by Juergensmeyer has a great deal of explanatory power; however, it does not provide a complete explanation for the success of the AKP. The rise of religion in Turkish politics is the result of a complex process over long years of encounter and confrontation between two frameworks of order, starting with the sudden imposition of secularism from above, when the republic was established.

<p>This article sketches the roots and social underpinnings of both Economic Man (EM) and Soviet Man (SM) and looks at the interaction between the two archetypes during the transformation of former socialist nations since 1990.

It also looks at the unique nature of the Soviet EM and to what extent SM has been dismantled. This paper examines how well the Western, market-oriented economic ideology was implemented and why the process occurred differently in various former socialist countries.

<p>Scholars argue that policies of multiculturalism in different countries are in retreat or in question. Britain is often used as an example of this, and leading British politicians and commentators often criticize such a policy. Yet a long-held multiculturalist goal has been to make Britishness more inclusive and this is something leading politicians were until recently uncommitted to. We use interviews with politicians who have served in this government and the last, the measures they have introduced, their media contributions, speeches and policy documents, to show that they are now committed to this goal. At a time when a British policy of multiculturalism is said to be in retreat or in question we identify a multiculturalist advance and show that this raises a range of difficult questions about government approaches to “Britishness”.

<p>Interestingly enough, the only Turkish experience that seems to be worthy of emulation is that of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), ignoring the “original” Turkish model — secular modernism — and the role it played in post-colonial Middle Eastern history. Yet it was precisely this secular-democratic system that eventually — albeit unintentionally — led to the emergence and triumph of the Islamist AKP, which built much of its legitimacy on the critique of the very system from which it emerged. By contrast, the similarly secularist Arab regimes were ruthless dictatorships that held their subjects in an iron grip until some were swept from power by the recent uprisings. An exploration of the original Turkish model, its strengths and weaknesses, might thus help inform and guide the future. [R]</p>

<p>Ukraine belongs among those young countries where the beginnings of democratization and nation-building approximately coincided. While the development of nation states in Central Europe was usually preceded by the development of nations, the biggest dilemma in the Ukraine is whether a nation-state program — parallel to the aim of state-building — [can] bring unfinished nation-building to completion. Ukraine sways between the EU and Russia with enormous amplitude. The alternating orientation between the West and the East can be ascribed to superpower ambitions reaching beyond Ukraine. Eventually, internal and external determinants are intertwined and mutually interact with one another.

<p>With decisions about to be made on major pipeline projects, Turkey could become a vital component of the so-called southern gas corridor. Turkey is aiming to become a significant gas transit state and key energy hub. However, despite separate transit deals for Nabucco and the Trans-Anatolian pipeline projects, Ankara has still to establish a proper gas transit regime. Geopolitical tensions and the possible increased risk of attacks on infrastructure could threaten Ankara's ambitions. But energy dependence on Russia will probably not thwart Turkey's plans as Turkish officials seek to facilitate the transportation of gas from northern Iraq and Turkmenistan, as well as from Azerbaijan, to the European market.

<p>When a central government deals with local demands, it may strengthen political accountability of the local governments by political decentralization or offer benefits through economic assistance. An authoritarian regime uses economic assistance policy because political decentralization may contradict regime survival. Although economic benefits can be used to buy political support, the distribution of these benefits is seldom equal. We argue that the unequal distribution is more salient in regions where ethnic minorities reside because the unusual demographic composition of those areas make it difficult for the national government to evaluate the performance of the local government who is responsible for the distribution of the economic benefits. We develop a simple formal model to illustrate our arguments and explore the cases of Xinjiang and Hong Kong for empirical analysis. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.2388]</p>

<p>The East Asian development model ascribes an interventionist role to a state which uses regulations to govern the market in the early stages of development. However, a major difference between China and other East Asian economies is the massive size of China's population. In Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, the role of the state governing labor markets and labor transfers from rural to urban areas has not been considered central to their development model. In China, the size of its rural population has led the Chinese state to take a more proactive approach to governing the labor market and the urbanization process by using the <italic>hukou</italic> system to institutionalize a temporary laboring class, to guide urbanization to low population density areas and to create competitive residency schemes in desirable urban areas.

<p>Since the Communist Party of China (CPC) launched the reform movement in 1978, China has altered Mao Zedong's revolutionary model of social development, and achieved remarkable economic success. However, the rapid growth of Chinese economy has not resulted in democratization. Is it possible for China to become an internationally recognized superpower without accepting universal values? This paper challenges the two opposite viewpoints and argues that an internationally recognized world leader must be equipped with multifaceted characteristics in economy, military, diplomacy, and politics. The legitimacy of governance must include democratic values. The absence of democracy might be an important factor for the declining legitimacy of the CPC. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>63.2692 ZUBAIDA, Sami — <bold>The “Arab Spring” in the historical perspectives of Middle East politics.</bold> <italic>Economy and Society</italic> 41(4), Nov. 2012: 568–579.</p>
<p>The events of the “Arab Spring” appeared to be animated by slogans and objectives of universalist orientations to liberty, dignity and social justice, a departure from the ethno-religious nationalisms that dominated the politics of the region. They raised questions regarding the “exceptionalism” of Arabs and Muslims, whom many observers and commentators considered to be tied to sentiments and solidarities of patrimonialism, tribe and religion. Yet, the forces that seemed to benefit from the transformations in Egypt and elsewhere were not those that made the “revolution” but precisely religious and patriarchal parties which benefited from popular constituencies in elections. A consideration of the political history of the main countries concerned can throw some light on these transformations. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 63.1345]</p>
