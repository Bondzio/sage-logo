<abstract>
<p>This article integrates three central theories of optimism–pessimism (OP). The combination of the shared components of these theories – outcome expectancies, emotions, and behavioral intention – may produce an integrative academic achievement evaluation. Little has been written regarding the differentiation between general and domain-specific OP, a factor that is essential in describing the evaluation process of academic achievement. In this paper, we will examine this differentiation and discuss how an integrative model of the three theories is strengthened by two domains: (a) heuristic versus systematic processing styles and (b) the level of confidence in the accuracy of evaluating events. The gap between required confidence in high-personal-interest domains and actual confidence in moderate general OP influences systematic processing style and planned behavior. Based on these principles, an intervention program is suggested.</p>

<title>Theoretical background</title>
<p>Studies dealing with the effects of optimism and pessimism have found that whereas optimism usually has a positive correlation with academic achievements, pessimism has a negative correlation with achievements in different domains, including academic performance (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261429411435106">Nonis and Wright, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261429411435106">Ruthig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411435106">Smith and Hoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429411435106">Yates, 2002</xref>). Various optimism–pessimism (OP) theories have tried to explain these correlations by viewing optimism and pessimism as general dispositions that encourage and prevent goal achievement, respectively (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435106">Carver and Scheier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411435106">Reivich and Gillham, 2003</xref>). However, very few OP theories refer to optimism as content dependent (domain specific) rather than general (domain general) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435106">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261429411435106">Dember et al., 1989</xref>). Furthermore, none of the theories illustrates the process necessary for an individual to be able to evaluate a specific domain or goal such as school (academic) achievement.</p>
<p>This paper briefly outlines the main theories in the field of OP, and then presents a model that both integrates the OP theories and adds to it different styles of thought processing and levels of confidence in order to understand the way students evaluate their achievements.</p>

<title>Theoretical approaches to optimism and pessimism</title>
<p>There are three central OP theories currently being discussed in psychological literature: dispositional optimism, OP explanatory style, and hope theory. Their essences are summarized below:</p>
<sec id="section3-0261429411435106">
<title>Dispositional optimism</title>
<p>The dispositional optimism theory defines optimism as a positive future expectation and pessimism as a negative future expectation (Carver and Scheier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435106">2000</xref>). The theory of dispositional optimism links an individual’s disposition and expressive behavior, and describes dispositional optimism or pessimism as a stable variable that is not significantly influenced by specific events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0261429411435106">Schou et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>According to this theory, positive outcome expectancy is a combination of the value of a goal and the individual’s confidence that he or she can achieve it. This combination creates the motivation necessary to achieve goals, whereas negative expectancy prevents this achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261429411435106">Carver and Scheier, 2000</xref>). Several studies support this theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411435106">Carver and Scheier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261429411435106">Nes and Segerstrom, 2006</xref>), showing positive correlations between school achievements and dispositional optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261429411435106">Carver and Scheier, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261429411435106">
<title>OP explanatory style theory</title>
<p>OP explanatory style theory defines an optimist as one who views positive events as having a global, permanent, and internal significance, and negative events as having a specific, temporary, and external consequence. Pessimism contradicts optimism; a pessimist perceives negative events as having a global, permanent, and internal significance, while viewing positive events as specific, temporary, and external (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261429411435106">Reivich and Gillham, 2003</xref>). Every person has his or her own unique OP explanatory style, creating different positive or negative expectations of future events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0261429411435106">Wise and Rosqvist, 2006</xref>). Correlations between school achievement and OP explanatory style point to the fact that higher school achievements usually correlate with an optimistic explanatory style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261429411435106">Boyer, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0261429411435106">
<title>Hope theory</title>
<p>The hope theory defines hope as a mental set directed towards goal attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0261429411435106">Snyder et al., 2000</xref>). Hope is composed of two inter-related components: (a) agency – the perceived capacity to use one’s pathways to reach desired goals or a mental motivation to initiate and sustain movement toward a goal; and (b) pathways thinking – the perceived ability to ‘develop routes’ in order to achieve goals. Raising future expectations involves the cognitive evaluation of both agency and pathways thinking, and the level of hope is determined by an integrated evaluation of both components.</p>
<p>Where both components are positive, an expectation of positive results accompanied by goal attainment behavior occurs, whereas one negative component (or both) leads to a negative expectation, accompanied by goal abandonment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411435106">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>). In analyzing the correlation between high hopes and high school achievement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411435106">Snyder (2002</xref>) describes eight parameters that provide advantages to people with high hopes. However, he offers no explanation of how one can move from being someone with low hopes to someone with high hopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0261429411435106">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0261429411435106">
<title>Integrating the theories into a comprehensive model</title>
<p>While general comparisons between the theories have been made (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261429411435106">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0261429411435106">Scheier and Carver, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411435106">Snyder, 2002</xref>), no research has been conducted into whether these psychological approaches can be combined into one. Our argument is that these psychological approaches can be integrated in the same way as three different cameras can photograph the same object from three different angles: cognition, emotion, and behavior. Hope theory accentuates the cognitive outcome expectancy and its causes. This entails assessing the likelihood of a future result, taking into consideration additional factors such as personal history, characteristic traits, and judgment processes. OP explanatory style describes the characteristics of the event that create the expectations and the emotions accompanying the outcome expectancy. Dispositional optimism theory focuses on behavior, that is the behavioral intention is facilitated or inhibited by the interaction between the outcome expectancy and its concomitant emotions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0261429411435106">
<title>Lack of distinction between general and specific OP</title>
<p>The theories of dispositional optimism, OP explanatory style, and hope theory provide three basic components for creating an integrated theory: cognitive outcome expectancy, emotions, and behavioral intention. In addition, they provide a general description of the interaction of the three components to demonstrate how integrating outcome expectancy with emotions facilitates (or inhibits) behavioral intentions. However, one of the fundamental problems of integrating the three theories is that it fails to distinguish between general and specific OP.</p>
<p>The distinction between general and specific OP is discussed within the three central OP theories. For instance, all three focus on general outcome expectancy or on a permanent OP characteristic. However, dispositional optimism theory claims that dispositional optimism is not always constant, and it will change in different situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261429411435106">Carver and Scheier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0261429411435106">Shepperd et al., 2006</xref>). Hope theory also describes the possibility of a specific expectation and provides measurements for both general and domain-specific hopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261429411435106">Lopez, Snyder and Teramoto-Pedrotti, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, OP explanatory style is defined as consisting of an extremely flexible general disposition, which is therefore measured jointly by a number of integrated specific events. Additional studies have documented variations between the different general and specific OP measurements. Thus, for example, research on weight loss revealed a stronger connection between specific optimism measurements and achievements as compared with the general dispositional optimism and weak correlations between the general domain and specific measurements of OP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261429411435106">Benyamini and Raz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435106">Pekrun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261429411435106">Garber, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, people can be both optimistic and pessimistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261429411435106">Burke et al., 2000</xref>). Adults, for instance, reported a higher pain threshold when dealing with their illness in situations where optimism and pessimism existed simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261429411435106">Benyamini, 2005</xref>). Being simultaneously optimistic and pessimistic can be explained by the domain-general and domain-specific dispositions. For example, people with an optimistic disposition (general domain) will expect to pass a certain test. In this case, general optimism influences specific optimism with regard to succeeding in the specific test.</p>
<p>However, other people with similar general optimistic dispositions will expect to fail the same test because of specific pessimism resulting from diverse reasons including a history of failure in that subject or unfamiliarity with the designated material. In other words, a person can be generally optimistic yet still exhibit a pessimistic outlook in a specific area, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Although the above approaches do explain the differences between the general OP disposition and events specifically evaluated as OP, they fall short of describing the process inherent in each situation (evaluation according to the general disposition in assessing a specific domain). In addition, they also do not present a way for integrating all situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0261429411435106">Szalma et al., 2006</xref>). One attempt was conducted by a few researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435106">Chen and Chaiken, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435106">Fazio, 1990</xref>), which describes the process from the general OP to the evaluation of a specific domain (such as school subjects) as OP combined with a number of processing styles presented below. Their incorporation into an integrative OP theory clarifies whether the general OP has more influence on domains such as school achievement, or whether it is itself influenced by the specific evaluation of a domain as OP.</p>
<sec id="section8-0261429411435106">
<title>Heuristic versus systematic processing styles</title>
<p>People can evaluate or make decisions by using one of two extreme poles of processing styles. One is heuristic information processing with the resultant spontaneous behavioral intention. At the other end lies systematic information processing, which encourages planned behavioral intention.</p>
<sec id="section9-0261429411435106">
<title>Heuristic information processing style</title>
<p>Heuristic information processing is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261429411435106">Kahneman (2003</xref>) as decision shortcuts and simple generalizations that a person believes are the correct decision protocol. Thus, for example, if ‘most of the public thinks something is true’, others accept that it must be so. These shortcuts develop as a result of a previous experience and are transformed into procedural information applied to evaluate situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411435106">Klaus et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In heuristic processing, an individual reaches conclusions by using simple principles to focus on easily retrieved information details. The person generally observes the issue presented and formulates an expectation based only on general knowledge and past experience, without investing any further effort. Heuristic processing usually derives from a general grasp of the situation. This process involves only a minimal absorption of new information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261429411435106">Kruglanski et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0261429411435106">
<title>Spontaneous behavioral intention</title>
<p>Heuristic information processing is likely to lead to a spontaneous, effortless processing of behavioral intention derived from general disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435106">Fazio, 1990</xref>). This process occurs after completion of the initial evaluation of a specific domain, an evaluation that determines the expected behavior. This evaluation is stored in the person’s memory, and thereafter provides ‘ready aid’; in additional encounters with similar domains, people will act directly and automatically as they will not require the control and supervision of the initial evaluation.</p>
<p>Consequently, there will be no need to invest any effort in the demanding process of behavioral clarification in any additional similar events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261429411435106">Fazio et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, a behavioral intention can be predicted as a person evaluates the event or the domain while automatically activating the initial evaluation from memory. As such, using heuristic processing to evaluate events or domains as OP facilitates a prediction of a behavioral intention based on a person’s general OP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0261429411435106">
<title>Systematic information processing style</title>
<p>This style entails systematic and comprehensive information processing, including a detailed analysis of the quality of the argumentation. Systematic processing demands both a great deal of attention and cognitive effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261429411435106">Chaiken et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261429411435106">Forehand et al., 2004</xref>). The contrasting aspects of heuristic and systematic processing have also been described as experimental processing (based on historical experience) versus rational processing, respectively, or as impulsive versus reflective processes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0261429411435106">Spence and Townsend, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>When people are looking systematically for information in the field of OP, their evaluation of events is based primarily on the content of the domain that encompasses those events. Moreover, people using the systematic style are simultaneously and meticulously searching for relevant information to be included in a calculated manner. In this case, the influence of the general OP will be weakened, whereas the content-based evaluation of the domain will be strengthened.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261429411435106">
<title>Planned behavioral intention</title>
<p>Planned behavioral intention is a premeditated and conscious behavioral process which usually derives from a systematic processing style that demands mental effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261429411435106">Fazio, 1990</xref>). During this process, details are carefully tested for additional behavioral possibilities and their implications, until a conscious decision is made about the desired behavioral intention. Theories describing planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0261429411435106">Zint, 2002</xref>) demonstrate conscious processes entailing the investment of effort in behavioral intention. As with planned behavioral intention, when behavior is retrieved from memory, here the person also undergoes a conscious process, including testing the different consequences of possible behavior. Therefore, in this process, the general disposition will not usually be a significant factor when explaining behavioral intention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0261429411435106">
<title>The gap between the required confidence and the actual confidence influences the processing style</title>
<p>The use of heuristic information processing and spontaneous behavioral intentions is a default option because of its economy of effort. It occurs whenever people who receive new information balance an investment of minimal effort to process this information with the required confidence necessary to make a decision or evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435106">Chen and Chaiken, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>When the required confidence in the accuracy of events is low, or when personal interest or involvement is low, no actual confidence is needed for a correct evaluation. In this case, there will be no gap between required confidence and actual confidence. As a result, heuristic processing and spontaneous behavioral intention based on the general OP will occur. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261429411435106">Crano (1995</xref>), personal interest or involvement is determined by the level of personal interest vested in the accuracy of evaluating a domain or an event. High-personal-interest domains reflect evaluations in which the accuracy has personal consequences. This occurs when a mistake in an evaluation might cause significant personal damage, whereas accuracy can prevent damage or provide great personal benefit.</p>
<p>A person will invest greater effort in information processing and in planned behavior when there is a large gap between the required confidence for an accurate evaluation and the actual confidence in ability to evaluate correctly the events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261429411435106">Chen and Chaiken, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411435106">Fazio and Towles-Schwen, 1999</xref>). This situation may occur in domains of high personal interest, such as school achievement, which is a domain with significant consequences for the student’s future. In this case, the required confidence for the accurate evaluation of the student’s expectancies of his or her school achievements is high, and it is important to examine whether the actual confidence is also high or not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0261429411435106">
<title>Extreme or moderate general OP in high-personal-interest domains</title>
<p>It is important to make a distinction between events in which the general OP is extreme (either very optimistic or very pessimistic) and those events in which the general OP is moderate. In the case of extreme general OP, the student might have a high level of confidence in the correct evaluation of different events. In extreme dispositions the level of confidence is high; the more extreme the general disposition, the more consistency there is between the cognitive and emotional components of the evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261429411435106">Chaiken and Yates, 1985</xref>). This, in turn, encourages behavior supporting the developed evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0261429411435106">van Doorn et al., 2007</xref>). This is because of either a tendency of extremely confident individuals to dismiss conflicting information by doubting, overshadowing, or refuting its content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0261429411435106">Wood et al., 1995</xref>) or the greater availability of information corresponding with the general disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261429411435106">Krosnick and Petty, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0261429411435106">Thompson et al., 1995</xref>). An extreme disposition is stronger and more stable over a period of time, and also opposes change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435106">Bohner and Wanke, 2002</xref>). For instance, in a study on alcohol drinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435106">Boninger et al., 1995</xref>), it was found that in contrast to participants with moderate views on alcohol consumption, those with extreme views radicalized these attitudes in response to contradictory messages. The level of extremity is related to the level of actual confidence; a sufficiently high level of confidence in correctly evaluating a specific event or domain exists in an extreme general disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261429411435106">Bohner and Wanke, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, heuristic processes and spontaneous behavioral intention will be based on this disposition.</p>
<p>Extreme OP is manifested in consistency among its main components (outcome expectancy, emotions, and resulting behavioral intentions). In addition, an extreme general OP is highly correlated with actual confidence in accurate evaluation of events in the domain (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261429411435106">Pekrun et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the level of extremity of the general OP represents the level of actual confidence in the accuracy of the evaluation of the domains.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence suggests that pessimism is negatively correlated with school achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0261429411435106">Smith and Hoy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0261429411435106">Snyder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0261429411435106">Yates, 2002</xref>). This means that students with negative general outcome expectancies will, similarly, evaluate negatively their predicted failures in school. A combination of this negative outcome expectancy and the accompanying negative emotions leads to a lack of motivation, with the result that the negative outcome expectancy is often fulfilled with low school achievements.</p>
<p>Extreme optimism holds a similar danger. Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261429411435106">Brown and Marshall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261429411435106">Chang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411435106">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>) indicate the relative success of moderate optimism as opposed to extreme optimism. Moderate optimists consistently attained similar or higher achievements in school subjects than extreme optimists did. These findings back up our contention that extreme optimists have high actual confidence in their ability to accurately evaluate their general expectancies, including how well they will succeed at school. There is no gap between their high required confidence (resulting from high personal interest) and their high actual confidence (resulting from their extreme optimism). Therefore, these individuals adapt heuristic information processing based on their general optimism and spontaneous behavioral intention, and consequently do not invest great effort as they believe that they are destined to succeed in any event.</p>

<sec id="section15-0261429411435106">
<title>Moderate OP in high-personal-interest domains</title>
<p>In contrast to the phenomenon described above, in the case of high-personal-interest domains when high confidence is required, but the general OP is moderate, actual confidence in the accurate evaluation of the domain is lower. As a result, the gap between required and actual confidence in the accurate evaluation of the expectation increases. Therefore, more systematic information processing and planned behavioral intention is to be expected.</p>
<p>Thus, systematic processing will occur when the actual level of confidence in making a correct evaluation is low (as expressed by a moderate general OP) and the personal interest is high. Such arguments actually can be supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0261429411435106">Tobin and Weary (2008</xref>), who asked participants to evaluate different events. After that the researchers presented opposing views to the opinions of the participants. It turned out that the participants performed a systematic search processing for more information and explanations of events only if both principles happened: (a) participants showed a lack of confidence in assessing the events received because they feared that they did not understand the events correctly; and (b) the events were of importance to the participants (e.g. an overwhelming chance of success in an academic course).</p>
<p>This made the information processing much more systematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261429411435106">Boninger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261429411435106">Klaus et al., 1997</xref>). Accordingly, behavioral intention will also be more planned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261429411435106">Fazio and Towles-Schwen, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of school achievements, where there is moderate general optimism, actual confidence will be lower than the required confidence. The gap between the actual confidence and the required confidence encourages systematic processing style and allows their behavioral intention to be planned according to the evaluated expectation in the specific subject. As a result, the general OP will be applied to the specific school subject. Students will try to evaluate their success in an upcoming task based on previous achievements in the specific subject. Their behavioral intention will be more planned by applying learning strategies that were most effective in achieving higher grades in the past.</p>
<p>To reiterate, both types of processing styles represent continuous polarized ends, which are not mutually exclusive. When systematic information processing takes place, the influence of heuristic processes will certainly decrease, but will not necessarily disappear altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261429411435106">Maheswaran and Chaiken, 1991</xref>). Therefore, a positive correlation between optimism and school achievements is possible in the case of heuristic processing. In moderate OP, systematic processing and planned behavioral intention will be strengthened and will be based mainly on a specific domain (contrary to the general OP). However, when the student has extreme general OP, only lowering the high level of extremity will encourage systematic style and planned behavioral intention. This is because extreme general OP leads to heuristic information processing with the resultant spontaneous behavioral intention.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261429411435106">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the basic processes used to evaluate school achievement as OP. It is clear that the first step is assessing whether the school subject has a high level of personal interest for the students. If the level of personal interest is low then a low level of required confidence is needed. If the student does raise high personal interest, then a high level of confidence is required. Both answers converge on the question of whether the general OP is extreme or moderate. If the general OP is extreme (the right side of the figure) then a high level of actual confidence is needed, resulting in a small gap between required and actual confidence. These factors will lead to a heuristic processing style and the general OP level will be applied to the evaluation of specific school subjects. Heuristic processing will lead to spontaneous behavioral intentions; the student, therefore, will not have the motivation to study because of his or her predicted evaluation failure or success in a specific subject. Therefore, no studying efforts can be predicted.</p>

</fig>
<p>The left side of the figure demonstrates what might occur when the general OP is moderate. In this case, the student may have a low level of actual confidence and there will be a large gap between required and actual confidence. This large gap leads to a systematic processing style that entails a thorough and careful evaluation of a specific school subject (in accordance with, or in contradiction to, the general OP).</p>
<p>This systematic style will also lead to planned behavioral intentions. The outcome of such behavior cannot be predicted because a student might decide either to withdraw from the task (no chance of succeeding) or to continue to invest more effort.</p>

<title>Applications to education</title>
<p>Below are various proposed principles for an intervention program to facilitate control of the desired kind of processing style. This intervention program consists of three main elements: (a) a self-evaluation of OP; (b) guided metacognitive intervention; and (c) guided accompaniment in school.</p>
<p>
<italic>Self-evaluation.</italic> A self-evaluation entails three stages: general OP self-evaluation, self-evaluation of the general OP extremity, and self-evaluation of personal interest in the domain of school achievement. Initially, students evaluate their general OP by completing general OP measurements. Participants receive the results of their self-evaluation questionnaire and are informed that optimism has a higher positive correlation with school achievements than pessimism. After self-evaluation, the level of the general OP extremity is evaluated (second stage). This might comprise about 3% of the most optimistic or pessimistic of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261429411435106">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>). The level of the extreme general OP as compared with that of the other participants will be reported to each student by the program counsellor. Over several meetings, the participants will be introduced to the concepts of OP and heuristic and systematic information processing styles, and to the nature of the behavioral intention derived from choosing either process.</p>
<p>In the third stage, students are asked to evaluate the importance they attribute to specific school subjects, that is those that are most likely to affect their present or future. The important school subjects that were selected by the students will be the focus of the subsequent elements of the program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0261429411435106">
<title>Guided metacognitive intervention</title>
<p>The second part of the program utilizes metacognitive intervention whereby students are taught to analyze the information available to them accurately and logically and to consciously plan their behavioral intention.</p>
<p>The trainers will stress the importance of maintaining general optimism, while explaining that students who have general pessimism can regulate the kind of information processing and apply systematic information processing to provide an accurate evaluation of OP expectations for a high-interest specific domain.</p>
<p>Once the students delivered this information, the trainers will assist students with an extreme general OP to consciously moderate it in important school subjects by teaching the two processing styles (heuristic and systematic). The trainer helps the students by pointing out the gap between required and actual confidence in the accurate evaluation of high-personal-interest domains, and thus enabling the students to recognize their own gaps. The counsellor then stresses the necessity to invest greater effort in systematic information processing and planned behavioral intention.</p>
<p>By directing the students to adopt systematic information processing, the counsellor encourages a realistic evaluation of specific domains through the use of available information. This encompasses the following elements: the relative level of difficulty of the school subject to the students and their peers; their past experiences of this school subject; and the different learning strategies they had previously used in order to cope. The counsellor will identify and point out to the student which strategies were more helpful than others.</p>
<p>Toward the end of this stage, the counsellor will ask the students to accurately evaluate their OP expectations of this specific school subject. This type of metacognitive intervention will help students to evaluate, more accurately and more objectively, the outcome expectancy in the specific high-interest school subjects. In addition, the metacognitive element supports the conscious planning of behavioral intention, and helps students understand the value of investing effort in order to achieve goals in domains that are of high personal interest to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0261429411435106">
<title>Guided accompaniment in school</title>
<p>The third section of the general program entails monitoring the students’ accurate evaluation of specific high-interest school subjects and following their success in light of these expectations. After they have taken one or more tests in the same subject, it is advisable to request students to revise their initial evaluation of a success or failure in that specific subject. Where meaningful gaps remain between the evaluation of the subject as OP and actual achievements, students should redo the program. Even when students do moderate their OP evaluation toward specific high-personal-interest domains, the counsellor should continue to monitor their progress and direct them to apply what they have learned to other high-personal-interest domains not necessarily connected to school subjects.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this program reflects the OP evaluations of specific high-personal-interest domains in accordance with the theoretical background of this article, i.e. the integration of the processing style of OP to the evaluation of specific domains such as school subjects. This program is not a substitute for other important programs including those of control perceptions, self-awareness, and positive emotions.</p>
<p>To summarize, information processing styles are recognized paradigms in the world of psychology. The article presents an integration of recognized information processing styles with the OP disposition. As far as we know, it is the first trial that refers to the processes that occur when evaluating specific domains such as school achievements. It is our belief that this article will allow for the examination of different situations including checking the level of validity of the general OP in evaluating specific domains as OP, differences in the evaluation of a specific domain as OP among people with extreme versus moderate general OP, and the level of consistency between expectation, emotion, and behavioral intention in evaluating a domain that contradicts the general OP.</p>
