<p>Recently on the American Psychiatric Nurses Association’s Member Bridge a lively discussion occurred around what psychiatric mental health (PMH) nurses should be “called” as they move into expanded roles within hospital settings. The discussants agreed that terms such as midlevel providers or physician extender should be avoided; but there was debate on use of the title designated by one’s state licensing department (e.g., in Illinois, Advanced Practice Nurse) versus the credential conferred by certification (e.g., PMHCNS-BC). This editorial will conclude with thoughts on this question but begins with a summary of the context for the titling discussion, that is, role changes PMH nurses might anticipate as health care reform unfolds. The context frames my central argument: Why consistency and clarity in titling is critical.</p>
<p>Health care reform has created new roles for nurses via policies that strengthened wellness/prevention, expanded primary care, and incentivized care collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313495916">Newhouse et al., 2012</xref>). Owing to concerns around the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness and expansion of state insurance structures, a new mental health care service landscape is evolving—one that favors integrated care, behavioral health care homes, and wellness outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313495916">American Psychiatric Association, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313495916">Delaney, 2011</xref>). Incentives such as value-based purchasing will bring greater emphasis on consumer involvement and patient-centered care, while the mechanisms to enforce preventable 30-day readmissions may result in a more judicious use of the remaining inpatient beds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313495916">Berenson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313495916">Burke, Donzé, &amp; Schnipper, 2013</xref>). Finally, mechanisms are moving into place to address the epidemic of substance use via grant monies directed toward wider use of screening and brief treatment interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390313495916">Substance Abuse</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078390313495916">Mental Health Services Administration, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Amid these financing and health care delivery innovations, titling becomes an important issue as professional roles develop that fit with the emerging service system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078390313495916">Newhouse et al., 2012</xref>). While the focus is often directed to PMH Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs), it is likely that PMH RNs will experience a similar shift in practice and professional roles. For instance, a Chicago-based Integrated Care program (co-located in a behavioral health center) uses a complement of APRNs and PMH RNs to address their population’s needs. PMH RNs should anticipate increased roles in wellness initiatives within behavioral health care and case coordination of individuals with medical comorbidities. Shifts in service delivery and roles for PMH APRNs are also occurring as a result of payment and insurance reforms that strengthen integrated primary care and promote parity for mental health services. Here the service sector anticipates increased use of APRNs to fill the workforce gap of an expanded primary care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313495916">Carrier, Yee, &amp; Stark, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychiatric nurses have a goodness of fit with these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313495916">Hanrahan, Delaney, &amp; Merwin, 2010</xref>). However, as with other nursing specialties, PMH APRN and RN skills may be unclear to service organizations and payors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078390313495916">Lowe, Plummer, O’Brien, &amp; Boyd, 2012</xref>). Thus, PMH nurses should focus not just on titling but clearly articulating their skill set. The upcoming revision of the PMH Scope and Standards should be on every office shelf as PMH RNs and APRNs move into new responsibilities and integrated systems of care. For RNs, PMH board certification will be an important identifier since in this mix of new roles one’s scope of practice is a critical anchor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078390313495916">1</xref></sup> “What should be treated here, and where is the point of hand-off to specialty care?” will become an everyday question that will demand exercising professional responsibility to assure safe/quality care as well as adherence to the boundaries of one’s scope of practice.</p>
<p>Titling influences role clarity because what APRNs are “called” should be a reflection of their skills, knowledge, and expertise. Terms such as midlevel providers marginalizes the expertise of APRNs, contributes to the poor characterization of their skills, and suggests a two-tier system of providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313495916">Poghosyan, Lucero, Rauch, &amp; Berkowitz, 2012</xref>). The American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) takes the position that the terms <italic>midlevel provider</italic> or <italic>physician extender</italic> should be avoided for a number of reasons but primarily because they do not correctly identify what the APRN is providing, which is nursing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313495916">AANP, 2013</xref>). AANP suggests being “called” what one is, which is a PMH NP or PMH CNS, and if the APRN is being referenced in a group of providers, they suggest terms such as <italic>independently licensed providers, primary care providers, health care professionals</italic>, and <italic>clinicians</italic>. Consistency around how nurses are referenced by other providers and insurers is important, but APRNs should not lose sight that in the clinical arena titling must be in line with licensure.</p>
<p>In this instance, titling is tied to one’s state nursing license and thus informed by how APRNs are identified within a particular state. It is the state board of nursing that delineates the exact title an APRN should use to indicate licensure when signing clinical documents. The National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) persists in its efforts to have every state adopt the APRN title, but 21 states maintain state-specific licensing titles, such as APN or ARNP (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncsbn.org/2567.htm">https://www.ncsbn.org/2567.htm</ext-link>). Beyond the recognition of licensure, NCSBN model rules also stipulate that the APRN use appropriate role identifiers (Clinical Nurse Specialist, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist, Certified Nurse-Midwife, Certified Nurse Practitioner) indicated by respective abbreviations (CNS, CRNA, CNM, or CNP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078390313495916">NCSBN, 2012</xref>). Thus, what APRNs might be “called” based on certification should not be confused with how one must identify himself or herself in clinical documentation.</p>
<p>Nor should consistency in APRN identifiers be underestimated particularly on billing records. With the emergence of sophisticated health information technology (IT) systems, billing encounter forms will become an important data source for both those who provides care and those who select outcomes of that care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078390313495916">Poghosyan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078390313495916">Resnik, 2013</xref>). Billing records also contain an APRN’s National Provider Identifier, which will also become a source of workforce data—perhaps eventually tracking APRN concentrations and access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313495916">Kaplan, Skillman, Fordyce, McMenamin, &amp; Doescher, 2012</xref>). The PMH specialty has labored under a lack of national workforce data for some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313495916">Hanrahan et al., 2003</xref>). Health IT and its capacity to mine, organize, and report data could help us demonstrate what we do, where we practice, and the outcomes of that care.</p>
<p>What PMH nurses are called is an issue that has ramifications on several levels, and attention to consistency will be critical particularly as clinical and workforce data become available in national data banks. As PMH roles diversify in new service delivery models, clarity and consistency in role delineation is equally important. I appreciate this opportunity to suggest some crosswalks between titling and the movement of our specialty into the era of health care reform.</p>
