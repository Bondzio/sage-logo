<p>This study reflects the traditional central concern of industrial relations (IR) with the role of unions in bargaining on workplace training, and the more recent ‘turn’ in social science to the study of comparative national skill formation systems through the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) literature. It nicely balances these two disciplines by incorporating core IR concepts – such as negotiation between employers and unions over training, certification, definition of occupations and pay; company versus industry levels of bargaining; unitarist versus adversarial bargaining models; and internal and external labour markets – and key concepts from the VoC literature. The latter (for those who have been hibernating for the last three decades) places IR bargaining and vocational training systems in a broader political and economic context, such as the linkage between the quality of vocational training and how this shapes, and is itself shaped by, the industrial structure, product markets and innovation systems. (The classic example is the reinforcing relationship between the German apprenticeship system and <italic>Mittelstand</italic>, the small and medium manufacturing firms.) In the book, ‘workplace training’ is a synonym for formal vocational education and training (VET; or training leading to a qualification) or informal training. University-level training is not covered, except occasionally when the issue of the ‘permeability’ or recognition of qualifications across the two education sectors is raised. This is an interesting omission, given that the ‘workplace’ plays a central role in the initial and continuing education of professionals in fields such as medicine, nursing, pharmacy, engineering and teaching and that professional unions can exercise considerable bargaining power. An omission that may best be left for a different book.</p>
<p>The book provides seven national case studies that were mostly chosen to ensure a split between nations conforming to VoC stylised models of liberal market economies (LMEs) (Canada, Australia, the US and UK) and coordinated market economies (CMEs) (Germany, Norway and France). (Although as the chapter authors, Le Deist and Winterton, note, France is an uneasy fit in the CME schema given its very low union density, weak unions at the workplace level and a system of formal vocational training that is largely state-funded and institution-based. They suggest that it is a model owing more to elite French <italic>grandes écoles</italic> (higher education institutions providing professional education, particularly to engineers and managers) rather than to the Germanic <italic>berufliche ausbildung</italic> (VET system).</p>
<p>The major themes in the book are the response of unions to the great transformation in labour markets over the last three decades or so, and the consequent constraint on both the incentive and capacity of workers and employers to invest in vocational training. Driving this transformation are the usual suspects: neo-liberal economic policies; intensified international competition; industrial restructuring (decline of manufacturing and public sector employment); rise of part-time, casual and contract labour; greater labour mobility (especially within the EU); and financialisation, with its attendant shifting of risk from firms and the state to households and individuals. In response, employers demand greater ‘flexibility’ in training content, duration and providers. The state emerges in these case studies as a principal agent in this labour market transformation, but also paradoxically as a focus for unions to influence economic and training policy.</p>
<p>A strength of the book is that it deals with both ‘initial’ and ‘continuing’ vocational training. The general argument is that the latter is becoming more important for workers precisely because of the changed labour market conditions described earlier. Continuing skill acquisition by workers is deemed essential to ensure future employability and industry and occupational mobility. The analysis in many chapters is commendably nuanced, such as that in the chapters on Norway and Germany, which describe considerable resistance by union members to their leadership pushing the shop floor to persist with wage moderation in return for increased continuing training. The membership may be prepared to trade-off wage rises for initial training but not for indefinite training, especially when it is perceived as being overly firm-specific.</p>
<p>The contrast between the CME and LME systems is most stark in the two chapters on the UK. The UK stands out as seemingly incapable of resolving the conflict between the necessity for a social partnership to ensure a sufficient quantity and quality of vocational skills and a commitment to managerial prerogative, and a ‘voluntarist’ employer training model. Bert Clough’s chapter (drawing on Ewart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185613482230a">Keep’s (2006</xref>) idea) makes it clear that the inevitable failure of provision leads, paradoxically, to a highly centralised and state-led VET system, which is both remarkably expensive and ineffective. (There is a great PhD topic in describing how and why the Australian VET system has ‘aped’ the major policy shifts in the UK VET system since the late 1970s, with roughly a 10-year lag. The current disastrous policy of contracting out publicly funded VET to private colleges is clearly derived from the identical 1990s’ UK policy.) The volume makes an excellent complement to other comparative volumes on national VET systems published in the same Routledge series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185613482230a">Bosch and Charest, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185613482230a">Clarke and Winch, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, one is left with the impression of an intensifying contradiction between the drive for private capital accumulation and the social requirement to invest in vocational skills. In none of the country case studies do unions, despite displaying considerable creativity, emerge as more than fighting a defensive and mostly losing strategic battle. Even in Germany, according to the chapter by Vera Trappmann, apprenticeship commencements have stagnated for some decades. Shifting the cost of provision to the state and individual workers and reducing quality and duration of training is not a sustainable solution.</p>
