<abstract>
<p>This study examines the relationship between equity analysts and information asymmetry, and the extent of leakages in analyst recommendations. Literature suggests that analysts reduce information asymmetry by bringing privately held information to the market, and through superior analysis of publicly available information. However, we find that investor access to analyst reports is far from even, and show evidence consistent with the leakage of analyst recommendations. We find that leakages provide annualised cumulative abnormal returns of approximately 6.30% for upgrades and 12.53% for downgrades over a four-week period, after a generous provision of 1% (round trip) for transaction costs. In our examination of broker/analyst size, we find evidence of greater leakage from the smaller brokers on stock downgrades, but not upgrades. We suggest that smaller brokers are less likely to have an established relationship with company management, are less reliant on them as a source of future information, and are therefore less hesitant to leak downgrades.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Managers are in a privileged position when it comes to judging the true value of a firm. When information asymmetry of this nature is coupled with poor governance and disclosure, shareholders lose. In the case of Enron, tens of billions of dollars were wiped in shareholder value, while the management – the keepers of their fraudulent accounting practices – gained through insider trading. The near bankruptcy of the energy giant and the downfall of Arthur Anderson, along with similar cases, reshaped financial and accounting practices. Equity analysts are widely considered to be a market power that counteracts these negative forces.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212446997">Easley and O’Hara (2004)</xref> argue that analyst coverage is complementary to accounting standards, disclosure policies, and market microstructure in minimising the cost of capital. This notion is supported by other studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0312896212446997">Botosan (1997)</xref> finds that the relationship between company disclosure and the cost of equity capital is strong, but only in stocks without a strong analyst following. In stocks that already have a strong analyst following, additional disclosure does not appear to reduce the cost of capital. This suggests that analyst coverage may be a close substitute, or at least complementary, to voluntary disclosure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0312896212446997">Lang et al. (2003)</xref> find a higher valuation for firms that choose to cross-list in the US by issuing ADRs. They attribute this largely to analyst coverage, which improves the information environment of the stock, thereby reducing the cost of capital.</p>
<p>At the fundamental level, information asymmetry refers to one party having more or superior information to others. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0312896212446997">Merton (1987)</xref> separates information asymmetry into two dimensions: information asymmetry between investors and management (depth), and information asymmetry between shareholders (breadth). While the extant literature overwhelmingly suggests that equity analysis reduces a company’s cost of capital, insufficient distinction is made between the asymmetry between investor and management and asymmetry between investor groups. With regard to equity analysis, if the distribution of analyst reports is unequal, one cannot conclude that information asymmetry has decreased. When a subset of clients receive more information, or information in a more timely manner, asymmetry between management and the shareholders as a group may reduce, but asymmetry between different shareholders may actually increase.</p>
<p><italic>Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst</italic>, an exposé by Dan Reingold on the analyst industry during the tech boom, highlights some of the issues that equity analysts face when bringing information to the market. The act of passing analyst information on to privileged clients prior to its public release, allowing these clients to trade ahead of the market, is of particular interest. Leakages in analyst reports are often exacerbated by the regular breach of Chinese walls between the equity analysis and investment banking arms of the brokerage houses.</p>
<p>The presence of leakages in analyst reports is supported by prosecutions in the area. On 28 May 2003, the NASD (now FINRA) charged Phua Young, a former analyst at Merrill, with giving advance notice of rating changes to selected institutional clients, along with other misconduct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0312896212446997">1</xref></sup> Such incidents, however, are not isolated to the US. On 20 March 2007 the UK’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) fined an analyst for market misconduct while employed at Citigroup.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0312896212446997">2</xref></sup> Similar to the US case, the misconduct charge was in relation to the analyst’s selective disclosure of a stock recommendation to four of his clients prior to its public release.</p>
<p>As rankings in Institutional Investor’s All-American Research Team are based on the subjective opinions of buy-side firms, leaking analyst reports to favoured clients provides the potential for more favourable reviews in rankings. Since analyst remuneration is closely linked with their perceived quality (as judged by rankings, for example), a strong incentive exists to establish and maintain a loyal client base through information leakage. From the brokerage firm’s perspective, leakages to favoured clients will increase the likelihood of future trading business. There is a natural tendency to encourage (or disregard the presence of) such activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0312896212446997">3</xref></sup> This may lead to an increase in information asymmetry in stocks where leakages occur regularly, and represents a breach of insider trading laws if the reports make use of material non-public information.</p>
<p>This study seeks to clarify the relationship between equity analysts and information asymmetry by examining the level of investor access to analyst reports. Specifically, this study focuses exclusively on the asymmetry between shareholders, and seeks to show that leakages exist in analyst recommendations and certain customers of broker-analyst firms trade on these leakages, which nets them abnormal profits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> demonstrate that ‘tipping’ (i.e. leakages) exists in initial analyst buy recommendations using a sample of institutional trades from Plexus Group. They find abnormally high institutional trading five days prior to the initial recommendation, which nets the purchasers abnormal profits. The dataset used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> provides no information on the identity of the brokerage houses that executed the institutional trades.</p>
<p>Using a proprietary dataset from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that includes the identity of the buying and selling broker on every transaction between January 1996 and June 2008, this study mitigates the potential disconnect between institutional clients, their trades and the tipping of recommendations. Drawing on the broker identification data, we examine whether the extent of tipping differs between large and small brokers. In addition, this study extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0312896212446997">4</xref></sup> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0312896212446997">Christophe et al. (2010)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0312896212446997">5</xref></sup> by examining leakages of both positive and negative information in analyst recommendations. This allows us to examine whether or not leakages (or tipping) are limited to positive or negative news only.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the other studies that examine the financial benefits of obtaining a research report are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0312896212446997">Goldstein et al. (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0312896212446997">Kim et al. (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212446997">Green (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0312896212446997">Juergens and Lindsey (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0312896212446997">Anderson and Martinez (2010)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0312896212446997">Goldstein et al. (2009)</xref> conclude that positive abnormal returns are possible by trading through a recommending broker, notwithstanding that the clients of these brokers pay a higher commission than those of other brokers. However, this result is based on trading on the date of the release of the analyst’s report. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0312896212446997">Anderson and Martinez (2010)</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0312896212446997">6</xref></sup> we extend the analysis by examining the financial gains in relation to pre-release trading.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0312896212446997">Kim et al. (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212446997">Green (2006)</xref> focus on the timing difference between the official release of an analyst report and when that information is picked up by the rest of the market through word of mouth, or through the mass media. The current study represents an investigation into leakages in analyst reports prior to their official public release, and therefore differs significantly from these two studies. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212446997">Green (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0312896212446997">Juergens and Lindsey (2009)</xref> examine a sample of broker-analyst recommendations of stocks listed on the NASDAQ, with corresponding intraday quote and trade data obtained from Nastraq and PostData respectively. The NASDAQ consists of more than 500 member firms who act as market makers, who may either trade for their clients or against other dealers. Therefore, any market making actions may introduce noise into the data sample and potentially weaken the relation between client trading and broker recommendations.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are neither mandated market makers nor specialists acting within the ASX trading environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0312896212446997">7</xref></sup> While individual brokers may choose to provide market making services, it is unlikely that they will perform the tasks of a traditional market maker. Thus it is unlikely that any trading behaviour can be reasonably attributed to market making. As such, the pure limit order book market structure of the ASX is expected to support a stronger link between broker-analyst recommendations and brokers’ client trading behaviour.</p>
<p>Consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref>, this study finds evidence consistent with the leakage of analyst recommendations. This provides financial benefits measured as cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of approximately 0.49% for upgrades and 0.96% for downgrades over a four-week period, with a generous provision of 1% (round trip) for transaction costs. This is annualised<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0312896212446997">8</xref></sup> to a CAR of 6.30% p.a. for upgrades and 12.53% p.a. for downgrades. The degree of leakage and CARs for the sub-sample of large brokers are consistent with full sample results, perhaps due to the high concentration of order flow generated by large brokers within the full sample. In contrast, small brokers exhibit a significantly high level of abnormal order flow (leakage) for negative recommendations compared to large brokers. We suggest that smaller brokers are less likely to have an established relationship with company management, are less reliant on them as a source of future information, and are therefore less hesitant to leak downgrades. Further, results appear robust to the confounding information effects of other broker recommendations and market sensitive company announcements, albeit with a lower level of economic significance. These results suggest that investor access to analyst research is far from equal, and illustrates the complexity of the relationship between equity analysts and information asymmetry.</p>
<p>The remainder of this study is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature pertaining to equity analyst coverage and its beneficial effects on information asymmetry. Contrasting literature is also presented that suggests an unequal level of access to analyst reports, placing certain investors at a competitive advantage. Section 3 provides a brief background on the brokerage/research market in Australia. Section 4 describes the data source and research methods employed in this study. Section 5 presents the results of the study, including robustness tests. Section 6 summarises this study’s findings, with some concluding remarks.</p>

<title>2.1. Equity research and information asymmetry</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0312896212446997">Easley and O’Hara (2004)</xref> argue that analyst coverage is complementary to accounting standards, disclosure policies, and market microstructure in minimising the cost of capital. Like disclosure, analyst research increases the total amount of information available to market participants, by either obtaining private information from the relationship they hold with the management, or through the analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of publicly available information. Consistent with the notion that analysts have access to private information, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0312896212446997">Rogers and Grant (1997)</xref> show that over half of all financial and operating data cited in analysts’ reports does not appear in company reports.</p>
<p>The literature reports a positive relationship between equity analysis and a company’s information environment. This relationship appears to exist in both directions – that is, analyst coverage appears to improve a stock’s information environment, but the information environment also appears to determine the amount of analyst coverage. While the direction of the relationship is unclear, equity analysts are generally thought to be complementary to mechanisms that improve a company’s information environment (e.g. voluntary disclosure, insider trading legislation).Using a new implied cost of capital measure, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0312896212446997">Gebhardt et al. (2001)</xref> show a positive relationship between the dispersion in analyst forecasts and a company’s cost of capital. This suggests that more accurate analyst forecasts are, on average, associated with higher firm value.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0312896212446997">Frankel and Li (2004)</xref> examine the relationship between analyst coverage and the frequency and profitability of legal insider trades. They find fewer insider trades for firms with greater analyst following, and the trades they do find are, on average, less profitable. Consistent with the notion that analyst coverage is complementary to voluntary disclosure, they also find a negative relationship between disclosure quality and the frequency of insider purchases. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0312896212446997">Botosan (1997)</xref> finds a strong relationship between company disclosure and the cost of equity capital, but only in stocks without a strong analyst following. In stocks that already have a strong analyst following, additional disclosure does not appear to reduce the cost of capital.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0312896212446997">Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1995)</xref> investigate the relationship between the number of analysts covering a stock and adverse selection costs, defined as the price impact of a marginal dollar of trade. They argue that greater analyst coverage increases the number of competing informed traders, which improves market quality. Consistent with this notion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0312896212446997">Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1995)</xref> find a negative relationship (after controlling for liquidity) between the number of analysts and adverse selection.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0312896212446997">Bowen et al. (2008)</xref> analyse the effects of analyst coverage on the level of information asymmetry in seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). To the extent that SEO underpricing reflects the presence of information asymmetry, analyst coverage appears to alleviate some of these costs. In comparison to firms without analyst coverage, firms followed by eight or more analysts have 60% lower SEO underpricing. In a study of the close relationship between equity analysts and stock liquidity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0312896212446997">Roulstone (2003)</xref> finds a positive (negative) relationship between the number of analysts following a stock (analyst forecast dispersion) and market liquidity (proxied by the bid-ask spread, depth, and the adverse selection component of the spread). Granger causality test results suggest that analyst characteristics lead market liquidity characteristics. These results are therefore consistent with the notion that analysts increase the total amount of information available to investors, reducing adverse selection, and therefore improve the liquidity of markets.</p>
<p>The literature also examines the flip side of the relationship between analysts and the information environment. These studies recognise that analysts have a greater incentive to cover stocks with more available information or with superior investor protection. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0312896212446997">Lang and Lundholm (1996)</xref> find greater analyst following in firms with more informative disclosure. Further, these stocks have lower analyst forecast errors, lower forecast dispersion and less variability in forecast revisions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0312896212446997">Bushman et al. (2005)</xref> conducted an international study on insider trading restrictions and its effects on analyst coverage. They find an increase in analyst coverage after the initial enforcement of insider trading laws. However, this increase in analyst coverage appears to be concentrated in emerging markets which do not have a strong information environment. The authors proxy the level of investor protection using a country’s legal origin, where investor protections are presumed to be stronger in countries with a common law origin relative to countries with either civil law or socialist legal origins. For markets with strong investor protection mechanisms already in place (measured by countries with a common law legal origin as opposed to a civil law or socialist origin), the level of increase in analyst coverage upon enforcement of insider trading restrictions is significantly lower relative to those countries with civil law or socialist origins.</p>
<p>While all of the studies mentioned above document the positive relationship between analyst coverage and the information environment in which companies operate, these do not necessarily show a causal relationship between equity analysts and information asymmetry, or vice versa. In a study that partially resolves this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0312896212446997">Lang et al. (2003)</xref> investigate the relationship between a company’s decision to cross-list in the US, its effects on analyst coverage and the resulting effects on firm value. As American Depository Receipts (ADRs) are often subject to stricter information dissemination requirements (in comparison to the company’s primary exchange), they improve the stock’s information environment. Consistent with the notion that analysts are attracted to stocks with a superior information environment, Lang et al. document an increase in analyst coverage and forecast accuracy following listings in ADRs. Further, of the ADRs that experience an increase in analyst coverage, firm value also increases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0312896212446997">Lang et al. (2003)</xref> therefore provide some additional insights on the complexity of the relationship between analysts and a stock’s information environment. Specifically, their results suggest that the relationship works concurrently in both directions.</p>

<sec id="section4-0312896212446997">
<title>2.2. Unequal access to analyst research</title>
<p>Institutional investors are widely considered to be more informed in comparison with retail investors. Literature shows that returns on stocks with higher institutional holding lead those with lower institutional holding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0312896212446997">Badrinath et al., 1995</xref>), that institutional traders move prices more often (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0312896212446997">Chakravarty, 2001</xref>), that their trades predict future returns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0312896212446997">Yan and Zhang, 2009</xref>), that institutional investors are more likely to purchase stocks (sold by retail investors) that eventually outperform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0312896212446997">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>) and that they appear to have the ability to predict a break from a series of earnings increases at least one quarter ahead of the break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0312896212446997">Ke and Petroni, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One advantage that institutional investors hold is their ability to use a wider range of information. This is arguably related to the amount of resources at the institution’s disposal, allowing them either to acquire and process their own information or to obtain information from a fee-based source such as those provided by equity analysts. The literature shows that certain investor groups make greater use of analyst reports. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0312896212446997">Walther (1997)</xref> examines whether institutional investors rely more on analyst forecasts than time series models in forming their view on expected earnings. Stocks with greater institutional ownership are found to place a greater weight on analyst forecasts than do simple time series models.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0312896212446997">Battalio and Mendenhall (2005)</xref> find that small and large traders behave in a manner consistent with the two groups having different information sets. While large traders make use of time series models in addition to analyst forecasts, small traders tend to ignore earnings signals contained in analyst forecasts. These results suggest that small/retail investors have less access to information disseminated by equity analysts, and consequently make poorer economic decisions. This is possibly related to the cost of obtaining analyst research, which is prohibitively high for smaller retail traders.</p>
<p>In addition to the evidence on the presence of unequal access to analyst research, the literature also documents the financial benefit of this advantage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0312896212446997">Kim et al. (1997)</xref> examine the price reaction of initial buy recommendations. Using a sample of initial recommendations released prior to market open, they find the presence of short-run profit opportunities. This provides those with analyst subscriptions a means to trade for abnormal profits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212446997">Green (2006)</xref> investigates the value of obtaining an analyst recommendation after its official release, but ahead of other investors who do not have direct access to them. Short-term profit opportunities persist for roughly two hours following the release of analyst recommendations, with two-day abnormal holding returns of 1.02% on upgrades and 1.50% on downgrades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0312896212446997">Goldstein et al. (2009)</xref> finds that institutional trades related to broker recommendations are more profitable<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0312896212446997">9</xref></sup> by market adjusted abnormal returns of 1.93% and 3.73% for recommendation upgrades and downgrades, respectively. Despite the magnitude of abnormal returns, it is also shown that clients of recommending brokers pay commission of 0.70 cents per share more than the clients of other brokers. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0312896212446997">Juergens and Lindsey (2009)</xref> show that market making sale volume increases at the recommending analyst’s firm in the two days before a downgrade.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> find evidence of ‘tipping’ in initial analyst buy recommendations made as a part of their coverage initiation. They use a sample of institutional trades from Plexus Group as a proxy to the market’s level of institutional trading and, subsequently, the trading interest of brokerage clients who receive tips (i.e. leakages). Consistent with the notion that access to analyst research is unequal (even among subscribers and customers), they find abnormally high institutional trading five days prior to the initial recommendation, and that purchasers net abnormal profits. However, the dataset used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> provides no information on the identity of the brokerage houses that executed the institutional trades.</p>
<p>The current study is an extension of the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> and examines leakages of both upgrades and downgrades (as opposed to initial buy recommendations only) between brokers of different size and reputation. Using a proprietary dataset from the ASX that includes the identity of the buying and selling broker to every trade, this study directly links recommendations to the trading activities of their clients. This allows inferences to be drawn with a greater degree of robustness than those presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>

<title>3. Institutional background</title>
<p>As of 2010, there were 43 registered brokers operating at the ASX, 10 of which offered discount internet and/or telephone broking services and 34 of which offered full-service brokerage, providing additional value-added services such as research and execution. The largest full-service brokers at the ASX (in terms of turnover) are Macquarie Bank, Goldman Sachs JBWere, UBS, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, CSFB, ABN AMRO (currently owned by RBS), Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. Two large discount brokers also have significant market share: Commonwealth Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and E-Trade, owned by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.</p>
<p>Institutional and high-wealth investors typically rely on an information service such as First Call (a subsidiary of Thompson Corporation) to receive analyst reports from their brokers. The less appealing alternative is to check the websites of various brokers at regular intervals. This is time-consuming and may cause delays in receiving valuable information, possibly forgoing the advantage of early trading. Upon receiving a report from a broker, First Call simultaneously sends it to all clients who have been granted access rights by the brokerage house. Those who do not have access rights may find out about the report at a later time and may purchase the report from First Call.</p>
<p>While analyst reports are typically issued simultaneously to all investors with subscriptions, anecdotal evidence from non-academic sources suggests this does not always happen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0312896212446997">10</xref></sup> For example, <italic>Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst</italic>, an exposé by Dan Reingold on the analyst industry during the tech boom, highlights some of the issues that equity analysts face when bringing information to the market. In particular, the act of passing analyst information to privileged clients prior to its public release allows certain clients to trade ahead of the market. This anecdotal evidence is further supported by the successful prosecution of Phua Young in 2003 by the NASD (now FINRA) and Roberto Casoni in 2007 by the UK’s FSA. Both of these cases involved the selective disclosure of stock recommendations to certain clients prior to their public release. While Reingold does mention the market for analyst research in Australia, there is no reason to suspect any differences in the incentives of Australian analysts, as the brokerage/research market is dominated by global investment banks with, presumably, a similar corporate culture.</p>
<p>With regard to the legality of tipping, or trading on leaked analyst reports, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> argue that ‘it is inappropriate for the firm to trade before its own recommendations’, on account that it would be unfair to its own clients. This is consistent with the views of the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and its interpretation of Rule 2110. However, with regard to the legality of brokerage clients trading on leakages, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> argue that the US regulatory framework is somewhat murkier, noting that the SEC does not specifically address tipping but rather deals with tipping on a case-by-case basis under insider trading laws (rule 10b-5). They cite the previously mentioned case in 2003 against Phua Young, a Merrill Lynch analyst who gave advance notice of rating changes to selected institutional clients. In their view, tipping is related to company policy, rather than being an issue that is unambiguously illegal. For companies that make a promise to treat all clients equally (the authors cite the internal guidelines of Merrill Lynch as an example), tipping may be seen as a misrepresentation and therefore leave the companies open to civil litigation by their clients.</p>
<p>Regulation of the trading of recommendations prior to their widespread release is marginally stronger in Australia. As in the US, tipping may leave companies or their employees open to prosecution under insider trading laws. According to the Corporations Act of 2001 (section 1043A), a definition of inside information must satisfy these two conditions: ‘(a) the information is not generally available; (b) if the information were generally available, a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on the price or value of particular Division 3 financial products.’</p>
<p>Australia’s greater regulatory power against tipping comes from two sources. First, Section 912A of the Corporations Act of 2001 (relating to the responsibilities of financial service licensees, including analysts) states that licensees must ‘do all things necessary to ensure that the financial services covered by the licence are provided efficiently, honestly and fairly’. To the extent that tipping is unfair to some clients, this may be seen as a breach of the Corporations Act. Tipping in Australia may therefore leave companies or analysts open to prosecution, irrespective of internal company guidelines or contractual clauses. This contrasts with the US (according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al., 2007</xref>), where tipping may be more of a misrepresentation of fairness (provided internal guidelines originally exist) than an unambiguous breach of regulation.</p>
<p>Further, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australian equivalent of the SEC, has stricter requirements on the fair release of analyst reports, where tipping may be open to direct prosecution under insider trading laws. In <italic>Regulatory Guide 79 – Managing conflicts of interest: A guide for research report providers</italic>, ASIC provides clarification on the treatment of research reports in relation to insider trading. Section 2.25 states:
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Non-public information about the timing of and recommendations contained in future research reports may amount to inside information… To the extent that the research report itself is or involves ‘inside information’, trading before or shortly after its publication is likely to amount to insider trading.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite this perceived greater legislative power over the trading of leaked analyst reports, to the best of our knowledge, there do not appear to have been any Australian cases involving tipping at the time of writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0312896212446997">11</xref></sup> In the context of common law (where past cases help to shape and define laws), these regulations should be considered untested. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent tipping is legally enforceable in Australia.</p>

<title>4. Data and research design</title>
<p>The data used in this study comes from a proprietary dataset containing all trades on the ASX between January 1996 and June 2008, with fields for stock code, date, time, price, volume and the buying and selling brokers. Analyst recommendations are sourced from I/B/E/S through Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) and contain fields for stock ticker, analyst firm, recommendation date, recommendation time and the stock recommendation issued. While each analyst firm has its own rating system, I/B/E/S standardises these into five levels, which correspond to strong buy, buy, hold, sell, and strong sell. Through the use of a historical list provided by the ASX detailing the names and broker IDs of each brokerage house across time, brokers in the I/B/E/S dataset are matched to brokers in the trade level data. This is supplemented with index data (All Ordinaries) from Yahoo Finance and Signal G ASX announcements provided by the Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific (SIRCA).</p>
<p>We classify the 10 largest full-service brokers on the ASX (in terms of turnover) as ‘large brokers’, while the remaining are classified as small brokers. Large brokers include Macquarie Bank, Goldman Sachs/JBWere, UBS, Citigroup/Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, CSFB, ABN AMRO/RBS, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan. These 10 brokers are also consistently the top-ranked institutions in research, broking and market making according to the East Coles Survey. The East Coles Survey is similar to the one conducted by <italic>Institutional Investor</italic> in the US.</p>
<p>Between January 1996 and June 2008, there were in total 48,042 analyst recommendations in 1273 stocks (identified by tickers). Recommendations are classified into upgrades or downgrades by comparing each recommendation with the previous recommendation issued by the same broker-analyst firm. While recommendations themselves might be biased, changes in recommendations might not be, especially when rational investors take note of any historical biases and systematically correct for them. Recommendations that did not change are therefore excluded from the analysis. Of the 48,042 original recommendations, 33,159 represent clear upgrades or downgrades. This approach is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0312896212446997">Barber et al. (2001)</xref>, who find changes in recommendations to be a strong predictor of returns.</p>
<p>Recommendations are further classified into those that occur during a trading session and those that occur outside of one (i.e. before market open or after market close). There is a danger in combining recommendations released during trading hours, given the large variations in the amount of time available for the market to process the information. For example, a recommendation released two minutes prior to the close may not cause a market reaction until the following day. Combining this with recommendations released immediately after open will introduce significant noise. Further, timestamps on the public release of stock recommendations may not be entirely accurate, making intraday analyses difficult. To circumvent these issues, all recommendations released during market trading hours are excluded, leaving a total of 25,867 recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0312896212446997">12</xref></sup> This approach is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0312896212446997">Green (2006)</xref>. After matching recommendations to a list of analyst firms with brokerage presence on the ASX, 16,039 recommendations remain, of which 7788 are upgrades and 8251 are downgrades.</p>
<p>To investigate the extent to which leakages occur in analysts’ reports, daily order flow imbalances around the public release of stock recommendations are examined. Specifically, the variable of interest is the order flow imbalance for the broker recommending the stock in the stock being recommended. Order flow imbalance is defined as the recommending broker’s aggregate daily buy volume divided by the broker’s total volume for the recommended stock during the trading session. Order flow imbalance (OFI) in stock <italic>i</italic>, for broker <italic>j</italic>, on trading session <italic>t</italic> is defined as:</p>

<p>If leakages in recommendations exist, then one would expect greater buying activity from the clients of the recommending broker prior to the widespread release of analyst reports. This would result in an increase in the order flow imbalance metric for stock upgrades. For downgrades, one would expect greater selling activity (and proportionally less buying activity) from clients, resulting in a reduction in order flow imbalance.</p>
<p>Abnormal order flow imbalance is used to measure order flow deviations from market expectations. It is defined as the difference between actual and benchmark order flow, and is examined for 10 trading sessions before and after the recommendation. Benchmark order flow is defined as a broker’s average daily order flow imbalance from four months to one month before the recommendation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0312896212446997">13</xref></sup> The abnormal order flow imbalance (AOFI) is defined as:</p>

<p>Following from the expectations on the OFI metric in an environment where leakages in recommendations exist, one would expect a positive AOFI for upgrades and a negative AOFI for downgrades. Note that 10 trading sessions are not the same as 10 trading days. For example, if a stock recommendation is made at 6pm, then the previous trading session is on the same calendar day, and the next trading session on the subsequent weekday.</p>
<p>This study also investigates the likely profitability of trading on leakages, by measuring the market-adjusted abnormal returns around recommendations for a period of 10 trading sessions before and after a recommendation. Returns are defined as the close-to-close returns on a stock, net of returns on an index in the corresponding period. While optimally one should use the S&amp;P/ASX 300 Index, an index that roughly equates to stocks with analyst coverage, this index did not exist until April 2000 (which is after the sample start date). This study therefore uses a broader market index, the All Ordinaries (roughly equivalent to the top 500 stocks), as a proxy of market returns. Two CARs are also calculated: one from <italic>t</italic>(–10) to <italic>t</italic>(–4), and another from <italic>t</italic>(–3) to <italic>t</italic>(+9). The first window represents the CAR prior to the leakage of recommendations, while the second represents the information content of the recommendation (which includes the value of the leakage).</p>
<p>A major criticism of the event study methodology is the lack of controls for confounding events, which makes economic inferences both dangerous and difficult. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0312896212446997">Welch (2000)</xref> finds that equity analyst recommendations suffer from the effects of herding, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0312896212446997">Clement and Tse (2005)</xref> argue that bolder recommendations (i.e. those that do not suffer from herding) are more informative to the market. Herding may cause confounding effects on the order flow of brokers, especially when recommendations from different brokers are released temporally close to one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0312896212446997">14</xref></sup> For example, if broker A releases a recommendation on day <italic>t</italic>, while broker B releases a similar recommendation on day <italic>t</italic>+1, it is difficult to disentangle the portion of each broker’s order flow that is attributable to their own recommendation. One may therefore observe abnormal order flow patterns for broker B prior to the release of their recommendation and erroneously conclude the presence of information leakages. Likewise, the dangers of confounding events exist with recommendations that are released around company announcements. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0312896212446997">Altinkilic and Hansen (2009)</xref> show that nearly 80% of all analyst recommendation revisions are closely preceded by a corporate event. Therefore, a recommendation released a few days after a price sensitive announcement (e.g. higher reported earnings) may display false signs of information leakages where none actually exist.</p>
<p>To mitigate the potential consequences of these risks, sensitivity tests are conducted on a ‘clean sample’, which is relatively free of confounding effects, in addition to tests employed on the full sample. The ‘clean sample’ excludes all recommendations released within two weeks of another recommendation (in the same stock) and all recommendations within two weeks of the release of a company announcement deemed market-sensitive by the ASX. This restrictive sample yields a total of 2139 recommendations, of which 1056 are upgrades and 1083 are downgrades.</p>

Post recommendation order flows (i.e. from trading session <italic>t</italic>=0 onwards) suggest that recommendations are perceived to be informative and result in significant trading interests for the brokerage firm in the direction of the recommendation. For example, in the trading session immediately after a change in stock recommendation (<italic>t</italic>=0), the daily mean and median abnormal order flow for upgrades (downgrades) are 4.45% (–4.65%) and 6.69% (–9.39%) respectively, which are significant at the 1% level.

<p>This table reports the mean abnormal order flow imbalance surrounding changes in equity analysts’ recommendations. Order flow is defined as the issuing broker’s total shares purchased (in the stock being recommended) on the day divided by the sum of purchases and sales. Abnormal order flow is the broker order flow minus a benchmark order flow, defined as a broker’s average daily order flow imbalance from four months to one month before the recommendation. The mean abnormal order flow of upgrades and downgrades is examined for 10 trading sessions before and after the recommendation.</p>

<p>Of greater interest to this study, however, is the order flow prior to the release of a stock recommendation, as it represents abnormal trading patterns possibly related to information leakages. For upgrades, mean buy-side daily order flow becomes significantly higher five trading sessions prior to the release of the recommendation (1.07% at the 5% level). For downgrades, mean sell-side order flow is significantly larger seven trading sessions before (–1.31% at the 1% level).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0312896212446997">15</xref></sup> This significant change in broker order flow is consistent with the posited notion that information leakages occur prior to the public release of a change in stock recommendations. The result for upgrades is remarkably similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al.’s (2007)</xref> finding of the presence of leakages five days prior to an initial buy recommendation. In addition, as an extension of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref>, we show that leakages (or tipping) occur with regard to both positive and negative changes in analyst recommendations.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0312896212446997">Figure 2</xref> report the daily mean and median abnormal returns surrounding changes in recommendations. Consistent with prior literature, results suggest that recommendations are price-sensitive and hence valuable (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0312896212446997">Bjerring et al., 1983</xref>). Daily mean and median abnormal returns on the trading session immediately after an upgrade (downgrade) at <italic>t</italic>=0 are 0.44% (–0.54%) and 0.19% (–0.25%) respectively, and are statistically significant at the 1% level. These daily abnormal returns persist for at least a week before showing signs of dissipation (0.01% and –0.03% for mean upgrade (downgrade) at <italic>t</italic>=+7).</p>

</fig>
<p>The results also suggest that returns begin to move in the direction of the recommendation prior to its public release. For example, in the trading session immediately prior to the recommendation change at <italic>t</italic>=−1, daily mean and median returns for upgrades (downgrades) are 0.29% (–0.29%) and 0.09% (–0.11%) respectively and are significant at the 1% level. In addition, there is some evidence that returns are higher two trading sessions prior at <italic>t</italic>=−2. For upgrades, daily mean abnormal returns are 0.06% (significant at the 10% level), while for downgrades daily mean and median abnormal returns are –0.20% and –0.03% and are significant at the 1% and 5% levels, respectively. These pre-recommendation returns are consistent with the abnormal order flow results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0312896212446997">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0312896212446997">Figure 1</xref>, and coincide with large changes in broker level order flow.</p>
<p>An interesting and peculiar observation is the lack of a long-lived price run-up (or run-down) normally associated with other types of information leakages (e.g. with takeover announcements). Daily abnormal returns up to and including <italic>t</italic>=−3 are more likely to be negative for upgrades and positive for downgrades. While these daily abnormal returns are mostly statistically insignificant on their own, their accumulation is potentially significant. This is inconsistent with results of prior information leakage studies, as leakages of positive information are normally associated with positive run-ups, while leakages of negative information result in price run-downs.</p>
<p>A difference in the nature of the information leakage being studied may help to explain this peculiarity. To illustrate, juxtapose a stock’s recommendations against a commonly examined information leakage involving corporate control. Prior to a merger announcement, information is often held by numerous parties associated with the deal – the management, underwriters, lawyers, and accountants, for example. This information is often known long before the official announcement. When they decide to trade on this private information, they compete with other informed traders and therefore trade aggressively, quickly moving prices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0312896212446997">16</xref></sup> In the case of a stock recommendation, the knowledge lies exclusively with the analyst and their brokerage house, and thus lacks the same level of competition from multiple informed parties. Therefore, leakages in stock recommendations are unlikely to experience the same level of price run-up observed in corporate control events.</p>
<p>This thought experiment, however, does not explain why returns before and after the announcement move in opposite directions. This peculiar price behaviour may be attributable to the stickiness of analyst price targets in the face of changing stock prices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0312896212446997">17</xref></sup> For example, say that an equity analyst has a neutral (hold) rating on a stock, with a particular price target. If the price of the stock falls significantly without sufficient justification, the analyst may be inclined to believe the stock is underpriced. The analyst may then choose to reiterate their price target, but move their recommendation from hold to buy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0312896212446997">18</xref></sup> If a large number of recommendation changes involve these price target reiterations, then average stock prices prior to upgrades would be lower, while those prior to downgrades would be higher.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0312896212446997">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212446997">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0312896212446997">Figure 3</xref> present the results of CARs around recommendation changes. Two windows are presented, one from <italic>t</italic>=−10 to <italic>t</italic>=−4 and another from <italic>t</italic>=−3 to <italic>t</italic>=+9. These two windows are split approximately around the trading sessions in which prices start to move in the direction of the recommendation change. The first window yields mean CARs of –0.51% for upgrades and 0.26% for downgrades at <italic>t</italic>=−4, which are significant at the 1% level. This result is qualitatively similar to those presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0312896212446997">Figure 2</xref>. As noted earlier, this peculiar price ‘run-up’ may be attributable to the stickiness of analyst price targets. The second window yields mean CARs of 1.49% for upgrades and –1.96% for downgrades at <italic>t</italic>=+9, which are significant at the 1% level. Medians are likewise significant, and in the expected direction. This result is consistent with those presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0312896212446997">Figure 2</xref> and show that stock recommendations are valuable to all those with access to them, but in particular to those with early access to them in the form of information leakages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0312896212446997">20</xref></sup></p>

Two important concerns remain. First, the size and economic significance of these CARs are unclear when transactions costs are taken into account. However, brokerage costs are unlikely to exceed 0.5% per side (1% round trip),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0312896212446997">21</xref></sup> which nets those trading on recommendation leakages a large 0.49% (1.49% – 1%) for upgrades and 0.96% (1.96% – 1%) for downgrades over a holding period of under four weeks (i.e. the size of the event window). Across thirteen four-week periods in a year, this is annualised arithmetically to a CAR of 6.30% per annum for upgrades and 12.53% for downgrades.</p>
<p>The second concern is the potential for observed leakages to be an artefact of confounding events. This is introduced when a recommendation occurs temporally close to another recommendation in the same stock, or around market sensitive company announcements. As noted earlier, when these confounding events are uncontrolled for, one may observe evidence of information leakages when none in fact exist. Thus in Section 5.3 we carry out robustness tests controlling for these confounding effects.</p>

<title>5.2. Sub-sample results: small versus large brokers</title>
<p>The analyses for the full sample are repeated for a sub-sample of small versus large brokers. The abnormal order flow surrounding recommendations is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0312896212446997">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0312896212446997">5</xref> for large brokers versus small brokers, respectively. The difference in the number of observations between the two sets of results reveals the high concentration of order flow generated by large brokers (7279 recommendation upgrades and 6911 downgrades) compared to small brokers (992 upgrades and 917 downgrades). Given the dominance of large brokers in the sample, the results provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0312896212446997">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0312896212446997">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0312896212446997">5</xref> are very similar to the full sample results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0312896212446997">Table 1</xref>. In comparison, small brokers reveal a high level of leakage, particularly for downgrades. For instance, a higher mean abnormal order flow is observed for small brokers (–2.15%, –4.30% and –4.61%) compared to large brokers (–1.28%, –1.78% and –3.07%) in the three trading days prior to the release of a downgrade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0312896212446997">22</xref></sup> However, in upgrades, differences in leakages are not large and are not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0312896212446997">23</xref></sup></p>

<p>The presence of greater leakages for smaller brokers in downgrades but not in upgrades is peculiar. There may be two reasons for this. First, it is possible that the downgrades of larger brokers have lower information content. Lower information content results in fewer trades by the clients of the larger brokers, even if they are leaked. It is also possible for these results to be driven by relationship concerns, which makes larger brokers less inclined to leak negative information about a company. If larger brokers have a more established relationship with a company’s management, and rely on them for future information, then leaking excessively may damage this important information source. Alternatively, the company’s management will be less concerned about positive leakages. This argument is consistent with those presented by the recommendations bias literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0312896212446997">Francis and Philbrick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0312896212446997">Hodgkinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0312896212446997">Lim, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our unreported CAR results provide no indication that downgrades of larger and smaller brokers provide different levels of economic returns. CARs for both upgrades and downgrades for clients of both large and small brokers are consistent with the full sample results shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212446997">3</xref>. Although differences in CARs may be observed between large and small brokers at certain trading periods prior to recommendation release, the size and economic significance of these differences is minimal in most trading periods. For example, the greatest difference between the mean CARs of large and small brokers is 0.63% one day prior to the release of recommendation downgrades. In contrast, the difference in CARs at other periods is no more than 0.2%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0312896212446997">24</xref></sup> Therefore, it is unlikely that differences in leakages are driven by differences in information content, and more likely that they are driven by relationship concerns. This result is consistent with the suggestion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> that tipping is concentrated in certain subsets of brokers, and we find evidence that this result is particularly strong in downgrades, possibly for relationship reasons.</p>

<sec id="section10-0312896212446997">
<title>5.3. Robustness checks: ‘clean sample’ results and adjustment to the order flow benchmark</title>
<p>The first robustness test examines the daily abnormal order flow surrounding equity analysts’ recommendations based on the exclusion of confounding events from the full sample (i.e. the ‘clean sample’). These confounding events include all recommendations released within two weeks of another recommendation (in the same stock), as well as all recommendations within two weeks of the release of a company announcement deemed market sensitive by the ASX. For brevity, the tables and figures in relation to these results have not been included but are readily available from the corresponding author upon request.</p>
<p>Post-recommendation daily abnormal order flows show significant trading interests for the brokerage firm in the direction of the recommendation, consistent with the equivalent full sample results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0312896212446997">Table 1</xref>. For instance, at <italic>t</italic>=0, the daily mean and median abnormal order flow for upgrades (downgrades) are 4.65% (–3.95%) and 7.82% (–11.29%) respectively, which are significant at the 1% level. Further, abnormal order flow display a slow decrease in trading interests from <italic>t</italic>=0 until <italic>t</italic>=+9 (represented by a trend towards zero abnormal order flow), with this pattern being most evident in daily mean abnormal order flow surrounding analysts’ recommended downgrades. Following the definition of abnormal order flows presented in the study earlier, a positive (negative) abnormal order flow for upgrades (downgrades) represents greater (less) than expected buying activity from the clients of the recommending broker.</p>
<p>More importantly, the abnormal order flow prior to recommendation release shows abnormal trading patterns possibly related to information leakages, supporting the conjecture that information leakages occur prior to the public release of a change in stock recommendations. For upgrades, daily mean buy-side order flow becomes significantly higher one trading session prior to the release of the recommendation (4.08% at the 1% level). For downgrades, daily mean sell-side order flow is significantly lower three trading sessions before (–4.49% at the 1% level). This suggests that clients of the recommending broker may possibly be taking advantage of the leakage of upgrades (downgrades) by entering into higher (lower) than expected buying activity prior to the widespread release of analyst reports.</p>
<p>‘Clean sample’ daily abnormal returns are consistent with the full sample results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Table 2</xref>. Daily mean and median abnormal returns on the trading session immediately after an upgrade (downgrade) at <italic>t</italic>=0 are 0.32% (–0.25%) and 0.15% (–0.17%) respectively, and are statistically significant at the 1% level. In contrast, daily mean abnormal returns prior to recommendation changes reveal only weak support for the full sample results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0312896212446997">Table 2</xref>. Only daily mean abnormal returns for recommendation upgrades at <italic>t</italic>=−1 in the trading session immediately prior to the recommendation change show movement of returns in the direction of the recommendation change (0.13% at the 5% significance level).</p>
<p>Similar to the full sample results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212446997">Table 3</xref>, two windows for CARs around recommendation changes for the ‘clean sample’ are presented, one from <italic>t</italic>=−10 to <italic>t</italic>=−4 and another from <italic>t</italic>=−3 to <italic>t</italic>=+9. The first window yields a mean CAR of –0.82% for upgrades and 0.78% for downgrades at <italic>t</italic>=−4, both of which are significant at the 1% level. This peculiar pattern of returns moving in the opposite direction to the information is consistent with <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212446997">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0312896212446997">Figure 3</xref>. As noted previously, this is potentially caused by brokers maintaining the same price target in the face of moving prices, and in the process upgrading their recommendation. Consistent with full sample results, the second window shows that trading on leakages is profitable. A mean CAR of 0.90% for upgrades and –0.96% for downgrades is observed at <italic>t</italic>=+9, both of which are significant at the 1% level.</p>
<p>Overall, results from the ’clean sample’ are consistent with the full sample results, albeit at a lower level of economic significance. While there is still abnormal order flow prior to recommendations, it appears that information leakages are occurring closer to the time of the recommendation. Further, the potential for abnormal returns, while large, is significantly lower when compared to the full sample. This is somewhat reassuring, as it suggests the presence of confounding effects in the full sample, and is a vindication of the choice in methodology.</p>
<p>However, this reduction in economic significance does cast doubt on the profit potential of trading on leakages when transaction costs are considered. If the same (and conservative) transaction cost of 1% round-trip is applied, CARs become –0.102% (0.90% – 1%) for upgrades and –0.04% (0.96% – 1%) for downgrades over a holding period of under four weeks. This is annualised to a CAR of –1.18% per annum for upgrades and –0.49% for downgrades. If the recipients of the leakages (who are usually the favoured clients) receive better transaction costs, for example at 0.5% round-trip, then leakages do become profitable. Without any information on the average brokerage costs faced by institutions, we refrain from making any predictions with regard to their true economic significance.</p>
<p>The order flow benchmark used in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0312896212446997">equation (2)</xref> is defined as the broker’s average daily order flow imbalance from four months to one month before a recommendation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> find that using pre- and post-broker volume is a stronger control for abnormal volume flow. Thus we carry out robustness tests based on an order flow benchmark defined as the average daily order flow imbalance from four months to one month before the recommendation and from one month to four months after the recommendation. The experiment is repeated for the cases in which recommendations released during trading hours are excluded and included. We find that the general trends shown in these robustness tests are consistent with results using a benchmark based on the average daily order flow imbalance from four months to one month before the recommendation release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0312896212446997">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0312896212446997">3</xref>).

<title>6. Conclusion</title>
<p>The literature suggests that analysts help to reduce information asymmetry by bringing privately held information in the hands of management to the market, and through their superior ability to disseminate and analyse publicly available information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0312896212446997">Merton (1987)</xref> separates information asymmetry into two dimensions: information asymmetry between investors and management (depth), and information asymmetry between shareholders (breadth). While both are presumably important dimensions of information asymmetry, the literature focuses predominantly on the relationship between analysts and the depth dimension of information asymmetry.</p>
<p>This study investigates the extent of investor access to analyst recommendations. Specifically, we examine the extent of leakages (to a subset of all brokerage clients) in analyst recommendations, and the potential for abnormal profit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> find evidence of ‘tipping’ (i.e. leakages) in initial analyst buy recommendations made as a part of their coverage initiation. This study extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> by using a proprietary dataset from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) that includes the identity of the buying and selling broker on every transaction between January 1996 and June 2008, thereby providing a direct link between analyst recommendations and institutional trades. We examine leakages of both upgrades and downgrades (as opposed to initial buy recommendations only), and between brokers of different size and reputation.</p>
<p>This study finds evidence of abnormal brokerage order flows prior to the official release of recommendations, consistent with the leakage of analyst recommendations or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> would call it, ‘tipping’. In addition, we find that leakages provide financial benefits of CARs of approximately 0.49% for upgrades and 0.96% for downgrades, which includes a generous provision of 1% (round trip) for transaction costs. This is annualised to a CAR of 6.30% p.a. for upgrades and 12.53% p.a. for downgrades. Consistent with the suggestion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref>, leakages concentrate around large brokers. Small brokers tend to exhibit greater leakage than large brokers for the three days prior to recommendation downgrades. We suggest that smaller brokers are less likely to have an established relationship with company management, are less reliant on them as a source of future information, and are therefore less hesitant to leak downgrades. Results controlling for confounding effects (i.e. recommendations by other brokers or market sensitive company announcements) reach qualitatively similar conclusions, albeit at a lower level of economic significance. The true profitability of these leakages in the ‘clean sample’, however, is difficult to gauge without any knowledge of institutional brokerage costs.</p>
<p>As a final remark, while analysts may excel at bringing privately held information to the market, this study shows that its distribution among market participants is unlikely to be equal. However, this study refrains from drawing the dangerous conclusion that these leakages are necessarily bad for the market. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0312896212446997">Gomes et al. (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0312896212446997">Irvine et al. (2007)</xref> suggest, removing leakages altogether could potentially (and seriously) affect the analysts’ incentives to acquire information, leaving total welfare outcomes unclear. However, irrespective of optimal welfare outcomes, there is likely to be a trade-off between the level of information asymmetry between shareholders and the management and the level of information asymmetry between shareholders. As an avenue for further research, the incentives to leak analyst reports should be examined under a wide range of market structures. In particular, the level of transparency is expected to influence an informed trader’s ability to hide their trading intentions. When the level of market transparency reduces, trades resulting from information leakages are less likely to be detected by the market, improving their likelihood and profit potential.</p>

<p>The annualised CAR is approximated by subtracting 1% from the observed four-week CAR to account for transaction costs and multiplying the result by 13 (there are approximately 13 four-week periods in a year).The four week trading period is equivalent to the 20-day trading period covered in the event study. For instance, the annualised mean CAR for upgrades in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0312896212446997">Table 3</xref> over the 20 days trading period is (1.4852% – 1%) × 13=6.30% p.a.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0312896212446997">Boros (2009)</xref>, on page 415, discusses the extent of enforcement of disclosure breaches by the ASX. The article states that the ASX has never taken action under sections 792B or 793C of the Australian Corporations Law for breaches of ASX disclosure rules, in particular with relation to leakage of analyst reports. ASX justifies its non-action by the potential undertaking of damages if it is unsuccessful in the proceeding of prosecutions.</p>

<p>A robustness test is also employed in which all recommendations released during market trading hours are included. This set of results may be requested from the corresponding author. After matching recommendations to a list of analyst firms with brokerage presence on the ASX, 16,052 recommendations remain, of which 7797 are upgrades and 8255 are downgrades. The general trends in abnormal order flows and CARs are found to be consistent with those based on the exclusion of recommendations released during market trading hours.</p>

<p>Regarding abnormal order flow imbalances for downgrades, clarification is required. As the order flow imbalance metric is defined as buy volume divided by total volume, one would expect a decline in buys (in comparison to sells) around a stock downgrade. This results in a negative abnormal order flow imbalance metric. Therefore, the negative metric should not be interpreted as a reduction in the amount of selling activity, but rather as a reduction in the amount of buying activity proportionally (resulting from an increase in selling activity).</p>

<p>For example, RBS Morgans (previously ABN AMRO) states that a recommendation ‘is based on implied upside/downside for the stock from the target price… The target price is the level the stock should currently trade at if the market accepted the analyst’s view of the stock, provided the necessary catalysts are in place to effect the change in perception’. This suggests that a recommendation can occur when prices deviate from a stock’s target price.

<p>To investigate the prevalence of recommendation changes with no price target changes, we use a subset of recommendation changes data with prevailing analyst price targets forecast by each broker.
