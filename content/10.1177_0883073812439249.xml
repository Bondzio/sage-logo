<abstract>
<p>To describe the current practice and views of neurologists on transitioning patients from pediatric to adult care, a cross-sectional study of all pediatric and adult neurologists in the province of Quebec, Canada, was conducted. The response rate was 73% for pediatric and 49% for adult neurologists. Most pediatric neurologists do not have a patient transition program or policy in place. Although a transfer summary is commonly provided, critical information is often lacking. Nearly half of neurologists believed that patients experience a gap in care during the transition process, and most agreed that the transition process is often poorly coordinated, highlighting patient, family, and health care factors. Current practice does not follow existing consensus statements for transition of care with respect to timing, communication, and preparation, and many pediatric neurologists experience difficulty in finding an appropriate adult health care provider for their patients. Neurologists reported many challenges in the current transition of care process.</p>

<p>Transition of care from a pediatric to an adult provider is not limited to the physical transfer of a patient and his or her medical record but is carefully planned and managed as a process. Transition programs aim to improve the young adult’s skills in negotiating the adult health care system independently, minimize secondary illnesses, plan for long-term needs, and promote autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812439249">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812439249">2</xref></sup> The American Academy of Pediatrics published a consensus statement in 2002 on health care transition for young adults with special health care needs, outlining 6 critical steps. The first is identifying a health care professional who assumes responsibility for care coordination and planning in partnership with other health care professionals, the youth, and the family. The second step is to “identify the core knowledge and skills required to provide developmentally appropriate health care transition services to young people with special health care needs and make them part of training and certification requirements for primary care residents and physicians in practice.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812439249">1</xref> (p1305)</sup> The third is preparing and maintaining an up-to-date medical summary that will be accessible to collaborating health care professionals. The fourth is to create a transition plan together with the youth and the family by age 14 years and update this annually. The fifth step is to follow primary and preventive guidelines recognizing that youth with special health care needs may require additional resources to optimize his or her health. The last proposed step is to ensure affordable continuous health insurance coverage during this transition period, a step less applicable in Canada, where a public health care system is in place. The Canadian Pediatric Society issued 2 position statements in 2006: the first on the care of adolescents with chronic illness, with some specific recommendations for transition, and the second on the transition to adult care for youth with special health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812439249">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812439249">4</xref></sup> The Canadian Pediatric Society states that pediatricians should be flexible and take into consideration the developmental age of youth when deciding on the time to transfer them to adult care. The transition to adult care should be continuous, comprehensive, and coordinated, with discussions regarding transition beginning between the ages of 10 and 12 years. There are no current consensus guidelines specific to the field of neurology.</p>
<p>Adolescents graduating from pediatric neurology services often have complex medical conditions with physical disabilities or limitations in cognitive and communication skills, all of which increase their difficulties navigating the adult health care system. In a study comparing health care service use between adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy in Ontario, the authors reported a decline in the annual rate of visits to specialists and an increase in the annual rate of emergency department visits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812439249">5</xref></sup> One of the reasons for the increase in emergency department visits was postulated to be the result of limited access to specialist follow-up care. Surveys of neurologists on transition are limited to child neurologists and certain conditions. The authors of a recent survey of child neurologists and nurses on transition of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome reported that most do not have a transition program and are dissatisfied with the transition process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812439249">6</xref></sup> During the analysis, the authors identified a number of challenges including attachment to the pediatric team, lack of adult neurologists willing to care for this patient population, and concern that adult neurologists may lack knowledge on these childhood-onset conditions. Analysis of an unpublished survey of 12 child neurologists described in the same publication also showed that most have problems transitioning patients, many reporting complaints from families about their experience in the adult health care system. The results of both surveys highlighted the importance of further studies on neurology transition. The goal of our study is to describe current practices and views of both pediatric and adult neurologists on transferring and transitioning young adult patients with childhood-onset neurologic conditions to adult care.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073812439249">
<title>Research Design</title>
<p>We conducted a cross-sectional study using 2 self-administered postal questionnaires, 1 for pediatric neurologists and 1 for adult neurologists. The questionnaires were developed based on available questionnaires in the literature in other specialties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812439249">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812439249"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812439249">9</xref></sup> Draft versions of the questionnaires were reviewed independently by an expert panel, and their input on the domains and the range of included items was used to establish face validity of the questionnaires and to finalize content and clarity. Responses to the questionnaires were anonymous, but unique numerical identifiers allowed targeted second mailings to nonresponders only. Completion and return of the questionnaire were considered to be implied consent. Ethics approval was obtained from the McGill University Institutional Review Board before initiating study.</p>
<p>Eligible participants were neurologists licensed and actively practicing in the province of Quebec as of July 1, 2009. Demographic information on all surveyed neurologists was gathered from the Collège des Médecins du Québec including sex, language of correspondence, year of medical graduation, year of neurology certification, and city of current practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0883073812439249">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>PASW statistics software version 18.0 (PASW, Chicago, Illinois) was used for data entry and statistical analysis. Transition processes were described as percentages and absolute numbers for categorical variables, means and SD for continuous variables, and percentages for binary variables. We selected 95% confidence intervals (CI) for selected parameters directly related to the study objective. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to assess differences between groups for categorical variables, the Wilcoxon rank sum test for ordinal variables, and 2-sample <italic>t</italic> tests for continuous variables. The Bonferroni correction was used for multiple testing. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided with α = .05.</p>

<title>Response Rate and Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 231 eligible neurologists were identified: 209 adult neurologists and 22 pediatric neurologists practicing in Quebec as of July 1, 2009. Among all 231 eligible neurologists, women had fewer years in practice (mean, 15.1 years; SD, 10.1 years) than men (mean, 24.0 years; SD, 11.9 years), and there was a higher percentage of women in pediatric neurology than in adult neurology (45.5% vs 31.4%%). After 2 mailings, 119 neurologists (16 pediatric neurologists and 103 adult neurologists) returned a completed questionnaire (response rate of 73% for pediatric and 49% for adult neurologists). Variation in the sample sizes listed in the tables is the result of missing responses for particular questions.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the participants and nonparticipants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812439249">Table 1</xref>. Women, Anglophones (English language-speaking), and pediatric neurologists were more likely to participate, as were neurologists with fewer years in practice and those in general neurology practice.</p>

<title>Current Transfer and Transition Practices</title>
<p>In our survey, pediatric neurologists indicated that they transfer 12.2 patients to adult care every year. Most (75%) did not have a written transition policy or a transition program in place (62.5%), but many plan to develop one in the next 2 years (50.0%). Sixty percent of pediatric neurologists reported finding it “very difficult” to find an adult provider for transferring young adults. Participating pediatric neurologists reported that they are usually responsible for the administration and coordination of the transfer and transition process (87.5%). The median suggested age for adolescents to be transferred to adult care was 18 years. Seventy-five percent of pediatric neurologists believe the transition process should begin 1 year prior to transfer of care.</p>
<p>Although 43.8% (95% CI, 19.5%-68.1%) of pediatric neurologists reported communicating directly sometimes or almost always with the adult neurologist when transferring a young adult to their care, only 15.2% (95% CI, 8.3%-22.1%) of adult neurologists reported that they communicate directly with the pediatric neurologist sometimes or almost always during the transfer process. All pediatric neurologists reported sending a transfer summary, and 71.4% (95% CI, 62.8%-80.0%) of adult neurologists reported receiving one. However, the adult neurologists reported that they often lack critical information from the past medical chart and/or previous investigations.</p>
<p>Pediatric neurologists were asked whether they usually transfer patients to an adult neurologist or to a primary care physician for each of 10 selected neurologic conditions. Patients with neuromuscular disorders, epilepsy, movement disorders, spina bifida, chromosomal and metabolic disorders, and cerebrovascular disorders were more often transferred to an adult neurologist than to a primary care physician. Patients with headache, autism, and cognitive–behavioral disorders were more often transferred to a primary care physician. Adolescents with cerebral palsy were almost equally referred to adult neurologists and family physicians.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0883073812439249">
<title>Challenges in Transition</title>
<p>Neurologists were asked, “In your opinion, do young adults entering/leaving your practice experience a gap between pediatric and adult care?” Responses were mixed: 44.3% thought that young adults experience a gap, 36.5% did not, and 19.1% stated that they did not know. There was no statistically significant difference in opinion between pediatric and adult neurologists.</p>
<p>Neurologists were also asked to provide their opinion on a list of 8 statements on possible barriers to transition (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073812439249">Table 2</xref>). For all but 1 of the listed statements, at least half of the participants were in agreement. The one statement that stood out was “issues of sexuality are often not discussed with adolescent patients in the pediatric setting.” For this statement, all adult neurologists responded “I don’t know,” so we removed this statement from our analysis. Most neurologists agreed that the transition process is often poorly coordinated. Half agreed that their colleagues may be unwilling to care for young adults with chronic neurological disorders. In relation to patient-specific factors, most neurologists agreed that young patients are not always ready to assume medical decision-making responsibilities, often do not know how to navigate the adult health care system, and often do not know their medical history. Most agreed that parents and caregivers can remain excessively protective and may not understand the privacy issues of the young adult patient, whereas adult neurology practices are described as less paternalistic than pediatric practices (eg, patients may not be contacted when they miss an appointment). There was no statistically significant difference in opinions between pediatric and adult neurologists on the 7 opinion statements (excluding the statement on sexuality).</p>

<p>Neurologists were also asked to rank the importance of patient factors in relation to successful transition to an adult neurology practice (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073812439249">Table 3</xref>). The majority of neurologists agreed that the patient’s knowledge of his or her medical condition; knowledge of his or her medication name, dose, and side effects; and compliance with medication were all important or very important factors. The young patient’s capacity for active participation during office visits and co-existence of communication impairment were also ranked as important factors; however, the patient’s ability to attend office visits alone was not. The latter was the only factor found to differ between adult and pediatric neurologists (<italic>P</italic> = .003). The majority of pediatric neurologists (87.5%) believed that attending office visits alone was an important factor compared with 60.2% of adult neurologists. Respondents ranked co-existing behavioral difficulties as an important factor, along with the need for multidisciplinary care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this study was to describe the current practice and views of neurologists in transferring and transitioning youth with chronic neurologic disorders from pediatric to adult care. Most participating pediatric neurologists did not have a transition program or policy in place. In previously published surveys of health care professionals, only about a third reported having a transition program or clinic in place, although most believed there was a need for one.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812439249">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812439249">14</xref></sup> The lack of protocol has been reported as “leaving patients unprepared for an abrupt transfer,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812439249">15</xref></sup> contributing to the loss of follow-up in the adult center,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812439249">13</xref></sup> and limiting the coordination of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812439249">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073812439249">16</xref></sup> The median age of 18 years suggested by our participants for transfer to an adult center is similar to previous surveys of health care professionals and is the standard age in most pediatric institutions in Quebec for transfer of care to an adult setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812439249">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812439249">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073812439249">18</xref></sup> However, 75% of pediatric neurologists in our study suggested starting the transition process a year prior to transfer, which does not follow current recommendations set by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the Canadian Pediatric Society to start this process much earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812439249">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812439249"/>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812439249">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812439249">4</xref></sup> Interestingly, our finding is consistent with surveys of other health care professionals, where the suggested time to start the transition process was often later than recommended, usually only 1 to 2 years prior to transfer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812439249">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073812439249">17</xref></sup> Missing information from the past medical chart or past investigations can remain a barrier even when a medical summary is provided. Direct communication between physicians can facilitate this by highlighting what additional information is beneficial to include in the transfer file. Poor communication between providers has been suggested as a barrier to transition by other health care professionals. The importance of maintaining an up-to-date medical summary that is readily available has been emphasized in consensus statements on the topic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812439249">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812439249">3</xref></sup> Despite a high response rate from pediatric neurologists, the absolute numbers were low and very few practitioners had a transition program in place, so we were not able to compare the characteristics of neurologists with and without a transition program. Asking about transfer practices for particular disorders does not take into account patients with multiple comorbidities, such as patients with cerebral palsy who also have epilepsy and cognitive difficulties. Whether they are preferably transferred to a specialist or a primary care physician was not measured in this study. Patients with multiple comorbidities would benefit from continued multidisciplinary care in the adult milieu; however, this is often unavailable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073812439249">19</xref></sup> The patient factors in successful transitioning agreed upon by most neurologists are similar to those reported in the literature by other health care professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812439249">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073812439249">20</xref></sup> Since the statement addressing sexuality issues was not clear to many responders, future questionnaires should improve on the clarity of this statement as this is a relevant issue to this age group.</p>
<p>This study has several important strengths. We were able to identify and send the survey to all Quebec neurologists making up the target population and had basic demographic information on all members. Our questionnaire had a fair response from physicians (51.5%). Response rates of 54% to 61% have been reported in recent systematic reviews of mailed physician questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073812439249">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073812439249">22</xref></sup> The 2 most common reasons reported in the literature for physician nonresponse are lack of time and perceived value of the study. However, as with all questionnaire-based research, our study has limitations. Participants and nonparticipants were different in a number of aspects, which could introduce a response bias as participants are more likely to be interested and involved in the topic of transition and may systematically have different views than nonparticipants. Another limitation is our text analysis of the open-ended question on barriers to the transition process, which were manually coded by one investigator (MO); the categories of responses created may lose some of the richness of the textual comments provided by the participants. Finally, this survey of neurologists in a single Canadian province may not be generalizable to other countries without a universal health care system, where issues of insurance coverage have greater importance.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title>
<p>This study provides a basis for understanding the current practice and challenges in health care transition within the field of neurology, which is a first step toward moving from consensus guidelines to a transition practice that is feasible and beneficial. Currently, Quebec pediatric neurologists <italic>transfer</italic> adolescents to adult care rather than transition them, and there is a perceived gap in care during this period. Neurologists identified challenges in transferring adolescents with traditionally pediatric-onset chronic neurologic disorders into the adult health care milieu on multiple levels, including the patient, the family, the health care provider, and organization of services. Late adolescence is a time of uncertainty for the patient, who may experience adverse health and psychosocial consequences if developmentally appropriate and timely guidance is not provided. The benefits of implementing a neurology transition program are numerous. Better continuity of care between pediatric and adult neurologists can improve patient care, information and data sharing, and communication among health care professionals, ultimately leading to reduced long-term health care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812439249">5</xref></sup> A transition program could also help educate patients on their disorder, medications, and self-management skills at an appropriate developmental and cognitive level.</p>
<p>Whether patients truly experience a gap in care during the transition process can only be determined in a prospective study of a cohort of graduating pediatric neurology patients. It will be a challenge to identify good outcome measures of a successful transition. This will need to be defined with additional input from families and especially the young adults who have graduated to adult care, and a qualitative approach may be helpful. Extrinsic modifiable factors are increasingly recognized as important determinants of health and quality of life of individuals living with chronic disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073812439249">23</xref></sup> The contextual factors targeted in transition planning would ultimately improve the health and well-being of young adults with chronic neurologic disorders. </p>
