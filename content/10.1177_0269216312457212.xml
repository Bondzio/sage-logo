<title>Background:</title>
<p>In the ageing population, older people are living longer with chronic diseases. Especially in the last year of life, this can result in an increased need for (complex) end-of-life care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216312457212">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To study potential changes in received end-of-life care and transfers by older people during the last 3 months of life between 2000 and 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216312457212">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>A repeated survey in 2000 and 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216312457212">
<title>Participants:</title>
<p>Data were collected from a sample of proxies of deceased sample members of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam in 2000 (<italic>n</italic> = 270; response = 79%) and 2010 (<italic>n</italic> = 168; response = 59%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216312457212">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Compared to 2000, in 2010, older people had a significantly lower functional ability 3 months before death. Over the 10-year period, people were significantly less likely to receive no care (12% vs 39%) and more likely to receive formal home care (45% vs 15%). Older people aged over 80 years, females, and those in the 2010 sample were more likely to receive formal home and institutional care (formal home care – age &gt; 80 years, odds ratio: 3.7, male odds ratio: 0.74, 2010 – odds ratio: 6.9; institutional care – age &gt; 80 years, odds ratio: 11.6, male odds ratio: 0.34, 2010 – odds ratio: 2.5) than informal or no care. Regardless of the study year, older people receiving informal home care were more likely to die in hospital (odds ratio: 2.3).</p>

<sec id="section6-0269216312457212">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Two scenarios of care in the last 3 months of life seem to arise: staying at home as long as possible with a higher chance of hospital death or living in a residential or nursing home, reducing the chance of hospital death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a result of the population ageing, people are living longer with chronic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312457212">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312457212">6</xref></sup> Additionally, older people are frequently affected with multiple medical problems, many of which arise predominantly in the last year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212">7</xref></sup> Consequently, there is an increased need for care over a longer period of time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312457212">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312457212">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312457212">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312457212">8</xref></sup> and particularly for more complex care closer to death. This care can be given by family or friends (informal care) or by professionals (formal care) and can be provided in an institution or at older people’s homes. The likelihood of older people receiving institutional care is influenced by age and functional ability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312457212">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312457212">10</xref></sup> About 10 years ago, more than one-third of older Dutch people received institutional care and another 16% received formal home care in the last months of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref></sup> A further increase in institutionalization has been predicted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312457212">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216312457212">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is of interest to study the place of care in the last phase of life considering that most people prefer to be cared for and die at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216312457212">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216312457212">16</xref></sup> Several studies have shown that supporting more home care opportunities by avoiding institutionalization may reduce health-care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216312457212">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216312457212">25</xref></sup> However, research has also shown that many people are transferred to a hospital and die there instead of their preferred own home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312457212">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216312457212">26</xref></sup> A study on care arrangements of older Dutch people revealed that in the 1990s, half of the older Dutch population experienced one or more transfers between care settings in the last 3 months of life and 32% died in a hospital. Furthermore, 17% died in a nursing home and 15% died in a residential home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Changes in care may origin from demographic changes of the population as well as changes in health-care services. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312457212">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216312457212">27</xref></sup> We replicated the study done 10 years ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref></sup> in order to study potential changes in received care by older people during the last 3 months of life between 2000 and 2010. Specific objectives are to study place of residence, transfers between care settings and place of death. Furthermore, we examined factors associated with type of care received and with dying in hospital.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216312457212">
<title>Study design and sample</title>
<p>The data were derived from deceased sample members of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). The LASA cohort is based on a national representative sample of older adults aged 55–85 years, stratified by age and gender and drawn from three regions in the Netherlands. These regions reflect the national distribution of urbanization and population density. The representativeness of the LASA cohort was examined by comparing mortality in the LASA sample to that in the Dutch population: the mortality difference observed between LASA and the Dutch population was less than 1% for all groups except women aged 80–85 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216312457212">28</xref></sup> In 1992–1993, the LASA sample was recruited (T1), and a total of 3107 participants were enrolled. Data collection takes place every 3 years. An additional cohort was recruited from the sampling frame in exactly 10 years after the first cycle of the cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 1002 enrolled in 2002–2003). The sampling, data collection and response rates of the LASA have been described more extensively elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216312457212">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216312457212">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>For our study, we sampled all deceased LASA sample members who had died between 1995 and 1999 (T2 and T3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref></sup> and 2005 and 2009 (T5 and T6, including the new cohort) and who had given permission to contact a named proxy. This proxy was contacted for participation. After confirmation of participation, data were obtained through a structured interview based on a standardized questionnaire in 2000 and through a written questionnaire in 2010. In this article, the description ‘the 2000 sample’ refers to members who died between 1995 and 1999 and ‘the 2010 sample’ refers to members who died between 2005 and 2009. The samples enclosed all deaths, including sudden deaths, since it is not very well possible to let proxies distinguish between sudden and non-sudden deaths in a uniform way. Their proxies filled in the questionnaire in 1999–2000 and 2009–2010. The study design was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the VU University Medical Centre.</p>
<p>The 2000 sample consisted of 342 deceased LASA sample members. We approached 325 proxies since 17 proxies (5%) could not be found. A total of 270 proxies (79%) completed and returned the questionnaire, 25 proxies (8%) did not respond and 30 proxies (9%) refused participation. The 2010 sample included 311 deceased LASA members. A total of 284 proxies were approached since 27 proxies (10%) could not be found. A total of 168 proxies (59%) completed and returned the questionnaire, 69 proxies (25%) did not respond and 47 proxies (17%) refused participation.</p>
<p>In the 2000 sample, 47% of the respondents were children of the deceased and 32% the deceased’s partner. In the 2010 sample, 78% of the respondents were a child of the deceased and 7% the deceased’s partner. For both time periods, no significant differences were found in the type of proxy between respondents and non-respondents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216312457212">
<title>Questionnaire</title>
<p>The questionnaire consisted of structured questions about socio-demographic characteristics, symptoms, functional ability, types of care, transfers and place of death. Symptoms included somatic complaints (e.g. pain and other physical symptoms) and psychosocial complaints (e.g. mood) during the last week before death. Severity of symptoms was rated on a 3-point scale in 2010: ‘no symptoms, not very severe and very severe symptoms’. Severity of symptoms was rated on a 4-point scale in 2000 (‘no symptoms, symptoms not severe, symptoms, relatively severe, very severe symptoms’). A mean score of severity was used. To ensure comparability of mean scores, the 2000 scale was recoded into the 3-point scale (the options ‘not severe’ and ‘relatively severe’ were combined in ‘not very severe symptoms’).</p>
<p>Functional ability was measured with questions about five activities 3 months and 3 days before death, and the answering options ranged from 1 to 5 (‘not possible’ (1) to ‘yes, without difficulty’ (5)). A sum score was calculated, with scores ranging from ‘respondent was unable to perform any of the activities of daily living (5)’ to ‘respondent was able to perform all activities without difficulty (25)’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216312457212">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Type of care 3 months and 3 days before death was distinguished in informal home care, formal home care or institutional care. Care refers to help with personal care (e.g. washing, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring) and not to help with household (e.g. cooking, shopping). Informal home care was defined as care provided by one or more unpaid family members, friends or acquaintances. Formal home care was defined as care provided by one or more paid and professionally trained caregivers (e.g. registered nurses). Institutional care was defined as living in facilities such as residential/nursing homes, hospitals and hospices.</p>
<p>Transfers to different types of care arrangements are rated from lower to higher intensity of care. The hierarchy was defined as home, residential home, nursing home and hospice or hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216312457212">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>The 2000 and 2010 data were pooled. The oldest member of the 2000 sample was 91 years old compared to 100 years old for the 2010 sample. To ensure that age did not influence the comparison between the 2000 and 2010 samples, the sampling age was restricted to a range of 55–91 years for both samples. To make the two samples comparable and the estimates interpretable, the data of both samples were weighted by age and gender. As reference, we looked at age and gender distribution of deaths in the Netherlands in 2008, a central year of death for people in the 2010 sample. These numbers were derived from mortality of Statistics Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312457212">1</xref></sup> Differences between both samples in patient characteristics, symptoms and care characteristics were tested with chi-square tests and t-tests.</p>
<p>A multinomial analysis was conducted for type of administered care with independent variables age, gender, education, marital status, functional ability and year of measurement. Age, gender and year of measurement were forced in the analyses, as these variables are essential to the overall aim of this study. Others were stepwise removed if <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05. Potential interaction between age and year of measurement and gender and year of measurement was checked and found to be not significant.</p>
<p>Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with dying in a hospital. First, univariate logistic regression was conducted, and all significant variables were included in stepwise backwards multivariate logistic regression. Age, gender and year of measurement were forced in the analyses. Others were removed if <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05. Independent variables were education, marital status, functional ability, care arrangement and cancer. Potential interactions between care arrangement, on the one hand, and year of measurement, functional ability and cancer, on the other hand, were checked and found to be not significant.</p>

<title>General characteristics</title>
<p>About half of the sample was people aged over 80 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216312457212">Table 1</xref>). More than half of the 2010 sample (56%) and a majority of the 2000 sample (71%) had a low education level. Deceased LASA sample members in the 2010 sample were most frequently married (52%), as were members in the 2000 sample (48%). The most commonly reported cause of death was cancer (2010: 30%, 2000: 25%), followed by heart disease (2010: 18%, 2000: 17%) and old age (2010: 11%, 2000: 16%). Furthermore, in the 2010 sample, dementia was a significantly more frequent cause of death (7%) compared to the 2000 sample (1%). The 2010 sample reported significantly more symptoms of pain (83% vs 57%) and feelings of anxiety and depression (63% vs 41%) than the 2000 sample. Moreover, all four of these symptoms were more severe in the 2010 sample (mean = 2.3–2.8 vs 2.0–2.4). A significantly higher percentage of people in the 2010 sample had problems with incontinence for both urine and faeces, compared to the 2000 sample (28% vs 12%). The 2010 sample was significantly more functionally impaired 3 months before death (mean at 3 months = 13.7) compared to the 2000 sample (mean at 3 months = 15.9). At 3 days before death, the mean difference in functional impairment between 2010 and 2000 (8.5 vs 9.6) was not significant.</p>

<title>Association with type of care and dying in hospital</title>
<p>The bivariate analyses showed that compared to people in the 2000 sample, the people in the 2010 sample were more likely to receive formal home care (odds ratio (OR): 6.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7–12) and institutional care (OR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3–3.9) than no or informal care. The multivariate analyses examined whether these associations would remain when patient characteristics were controlled for (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216312457212">Table 3</xref>). The year of measurement remained significantly associated with type of care (formal home care – OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.3–14.4 and institutional care – OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2–5.3). In addition, other variables proved significant in the multivariate analyses. Females and people over 80 years were more likely to receive formal home care (men OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.36–1.5 and age &gt; 80 years OR: 3.7; 95% CI: 1.4–9.7) and especially institutional care (men OR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.17–0.68 and age &gt; 80 years OR: 11.6; 95% CI: 3.4–39.7), compared to no or informal home care. Furthermore, people with higher functional abilities were less likely to receive formal home care (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79–0.84) or institutional care (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.71–0.81), compared to no or informal care.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compares the care received by older people during the last 3 months of their life in the year 2000 and 2010 by a replication study. The data were derived from the LASA cohort, which is based on a nationally representative sample of older adults aged 55–85 years, stratified by age and gender and reflecting national distribution of urbanization and population density. The study revealed that people who died between 2005 and 2009 had a significant increase in functional disabilities, compared to people who died between 1995 and 1999. Also, in 10 years time, the care received in the last 3 months of life seems to have changed to constitute significantly more formal home care or a combination of formal and informal home care in the 2010 sample. Furthermore, compared to people who received no or only informal home care, people were more likely to receive formal home or institutional care if they were in the 2010 sample, female, over 80 years or had a lower functional ability. Half the older people moved one or multiple times to another care setting in the last 3 months of life in both sample years. People living in an institution had a reduced chance of hospitalization until death regardless of the sample year. Place of death did not change in 10 years.</p>
<p>The strength of this study is that the data are derived from a representative sample of the older Dutch population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216312457212">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216312457212">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, a strength is the replication of the similar sampling method and questions over 10 years to monitor changes in care. The study is limited, however, by the difference in the method of examining of the questions, with an interview in 2000 and a self-administered questionnaire in 2010. Another limitation of this study is a potential bias in the data due to retrospective reporting: the LASA sample members deceased 0.5 year to a maximum of 3.5 years before the proxies entered the study and there might be recall bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216312457212">32</xref></sup> However, it is likely that proxies remember circumstances around the death of a relative. Literature confirms that proxies give accurate information, especially when it concerns more factual information such as chronic diseases and service provision of a deceased relative. Reporting of less factual information can be less accurate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216312457212">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216312457212">33</xref></sup> Previous research on the agreement in reporting personal care abilities between older female patients in the United Kingdom and the United States and their proxies not only underlined that proxies were reliable in reporting abilities by proxies but also reported that proxies were likely to report more disabilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216312457212">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216312457212">35</xref></sup> Furthermore, a tendency to produce better agreement was suggested for proxies with a more distant relationship and contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216312457212">35</xref></sup> It is not known whether this also holds for recalling personal care abilities a shorter and longer period after a person’s death.</p>
<p>The reduced functional ability of older people in the 2010 sample is in line with the predicted ageing of the population and the assumption that people live longer with chronic diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216312457212">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216312457212">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216312457212">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312457212">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216312457212">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216312457212">38</xref></sup> The findings in this study confirmed the increase in formal home care and the remaining high use of institutional care, and its relationship to age and functional ability, that has been reported before.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312457212">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312457212">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216312457212">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216312457212">41</xref></sup>A novel finding is the influence of time on care received, independent of age, gender, functional status, marital status and educational level. Several factors can contribute to this influence. First, people in the 2010 sample may have received more formal home care and institutional care compared to people in the 2000 sample because the availability of informal caregivers has decreased. Family structures are changing over time, and this may have influenced the time informal caregivers can spend on taking care of their loved ones. This may be due to work obligations, children living far away and a higher number of women working.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216312457212">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269216312457212">43</xref></sup> Second, it is also possible that older people now prefer formal home care over informal home care, as they may prefer to maintain their autonomy and not be dependent on family.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216312457212">42</xref></sup> Since older people in the 2010 sample had more severe symptoms and disabilities, one-third possibility is that they may have needed more care than informal caregivers are able to give. Finally, the increased availability of especially formal home care services for palliative care in the Netherlands in the last decade might have been influential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216312457212">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216312457212">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269216312457212">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite increases in formal home care, the percentage of elders transferred to a care setting in the last 3 months of life did not change in 10 years: half the people in both the 2010 and 2000 samples experienced one or more transfers to different care settings. Transfers in the last phase of life are argued to reduce the continuity of care and perceived quality of life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216312457212">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216312457212">45</xref></sup> and are therefore preferably prevented. However, some transfers are inevitable from a medical perspective and due to conditions of progressive frailty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269216312457212">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216312457212">46</xref></sup> In addition, some older people prefer to be transferred to a care service in order to receive professional care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216312457212">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the increased emphasis in policy to support home care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216312457212">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216312457212"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216312457212"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216312457212">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216312457212">27</xref></sup> and our finding that formal home care has increased, the percentage of home deaths did not increase in 10 years (i.e. one of three in both samples). Besides that, a small but significant decrease in hospital deaths was found (35%–29%). Keeping in mind the decreased functional ability of older people in the last phase of life in the last decade, it is possible that the increased availability of palliative home care did prevent a decrease in home deaths.</p>
<p>The present study indicates that people receiving informal home care are more likely to be hospitalized until death. For this group, a sudden decline in the condition of these people might have led to hospital admission for professional treatment and symptom control. Alternatively, treatment in hospital may have been assessed as potential life prolonging or lifesaving, but despite this assessment, they died in the hospital. Another possibility is that health-care professionals may not have recognized that these people were already in their palliative phase.</p>
<p>People who receive home care are more likely to die in hospital, compared to people receiving institutional care. Probably the latter group already receives care within their nursing or residential home, and they therefore do not have to change from their (already medical) environment for symptom control or life-prolonging treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269216312457212">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269216312457212">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, two scenarios of care in the last 3 months of life seem to arise from the data: staying at home as long as possible with a higher chance of dying in hospital or reducing the chance of dying in hospital by living in a residential or nursing home. The health-care professionals could take this into account when discussing with patients in light of advance care planning: older people might prefer staying at home, accepting the higher chance of dying in hospital, or they might prefer timely transfer to a residential or nursing home, which may avoid hospital death. Since in the last decade there was a decrease in functional ability of older people, no decrease in the number of home deaths and an increase in the availability of palliative home care, making optimal use of palliative home care seems crucial when people do want to stay at home.</p>
