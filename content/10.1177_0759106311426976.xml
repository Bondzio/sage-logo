<p>This issue of the <italic>BMS</italic> has four research articles -- three in English and one in French -- and one research note in English. The first article is “Nonresponse versus Measurement Error – Are Reluctant Respondents Worth Pursuing?”, by Joop J. Hox, Edith D. de Leeuw and Hsuan-Tzu Chang who ask whether or not “reluctant” survey respondents provide answers of lower quality than “eager” respondents and, with an example, show that the measurement structure does not differ between eager and reluctant respondents, and that there is no systematic difference in the reliability and validity estimates for both groups.</p>
<p>The second research article, “Transfer of Variables between Different Data Sets, or Taking ‘Previous Research’ Seriously”, by Bojan Todosijević, shows that the transfer of data across data sets could be achieved by applying the procedures for Bayesian multiple imputation of missing values and by creating a simulated data set to serve as the “third data set”.</p>
<p>The third research article, in French, is “The Choice of Language for the Alceste Software - Example of the Analysis of a Bibliographic Data Base”, by Monique Dalud-Vincent and Romuald Normand, who show for a largely bilingual (English and French) bibliography with 5,000 references, what variations in the software result from changes in the settings.</p>
<p>The fourth research article, “Supplemental Application of Configural Frequency Analysis for Free Sorting Data”, by Joachim Harloff, shows that the average number of different configurations encountered depends on the number of sortings collected, the number of items included in the domain and the qualities of the domain. A simple exact significance test is also proposed for hypothesis testing of configural frequencies in free fuzzy sorting data.</p>
<p>The ongoing research note, “Understanding Sequencing in Social Network Communications”, by Guang Ying Mo and Barry Wellman, examines the conceptualization of sequencing to understand how and why information senders prioritize some network members when they communicate with others. This conceptualization is applied to the data collected from the Canadian GRAND scholarly network</p>
