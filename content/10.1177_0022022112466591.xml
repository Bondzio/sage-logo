<abstract>
<p>An emerging literature has documented differences in values and behavioral practices (including conformity) between frontiers (areas that were more recently settled) and areas with a longer history of settlement. However, so far there have been few tests of which mechanisms might contribute to the maintenance of such regional differences. The present study provides the first test of the hypothesis that differences in pathogen prevalence might underlie this regional variation. Specifically, the relationship between frontier settlement, pathogen prevalence, and nonconformist voting was explored. Date of statehood, a proxy for recency of settlement, was positively correlated with votes for third-party candidates, and this relationship was partially mediated by pathogen prevalence. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.</p>

<p>Both frontier settlement and pathogen prevalence have been linked to regional variation in conformity. Effect sizes in experiments using classic conformity paradigms are smaller in more recently settled areas of the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022022112466591">Varnum, in press</xref>) and popular names are less prevalent in these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112466591">Varnum &amp; Kitayama, 2011</xref>). The voluntary settlement hypothesis holds that areas that were more recently settled historically attracted (and continue to attract) individuals who were more independent and nonconformist and that these regions historically fostered and contemporarily encourage these tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022112466591">Kitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, &amp; Plaut, 2010</xref>). The proposition of leaving behind the comforts of one’s society in order to create a new life on the frontier is one that is more appealing to nonconformists. In addition, such environments encouraged practices like self-reliance, and in the present day, regional cultures continue to reflect the frontier ethos. However, despite recent speculation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022022112466591">Kitayama, Varnum, &amp; Sevincer, in press</xref>), there is little evidence as to which contemporary mechanisms might maintain such regional variation in conformity in the present day.</p>
<p>One reason why conformity may be lower on frontiers is that they may tend to have lower levels of pathogen prevalence. In cultures that arose in areas of high pathogen prevalence there is stronger conformity to social norms and less tolerance for nonconformity. Conformity has been proposed as a mechanism for limiting the transmission of pathogens, by reinforcing norms that may limit the spread of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466591">Murray, Trudeau, &amp; Schaller, 2011</xref>). Indeed, historical pathogen prevalence has been linked to cross-national variation in effect sizes in conformity experiments, the value people place on obedience, dispositional variability, and left-handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022022112466591">Murray et al., 2011</xref>). Openness to experience is also lower in societies where disease is more common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022022112466591">Schaller &amp; Murray, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, contemporary differences in pathogen prevalence have been linked with regional variation in practices reflecting collectivism and in the strength of family ties in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466591">Fincher &amp; Thornhill, 2012</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022022112466591">Murray and Schaller (2011)</xref> have demonstrated a causal link between the salience of disease and conformity. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466591">Fincher and Thornhill (2012)</xref> speculate that frontier values such as innovation and individualism might be driven by the relatively low prevalence of pathogens in frontier regions compared to regions with a longer history of settlement. Thus, low pathogen prevalence may be one of the factors underlying nonconformist behavior in regions that were recently frontiers.</p>
<p>Although both frontiers and pathogen prevalence have been linked to variation in conformity, it is unclear whether these relationships extend to preferences for political leaders. In addition, although it seems plausible that differences in disease prevalence may contribute to the maintenance of differences in conformity between frontier and nonfrontier regions, this hypothesis has yet to be tested.</p>
<p>In the United States, third parties tend to receive little popular support, thus voting for third-party candidates likely reflects nonconformity. With the exceptions of 1968 and 1992, from 1968 to 2008, third-party candidates never received more than 10% of the national vote. Nor since the two-party system emerged has a third-party candidate ever won the presidency. And with the exceptions of 1968 and 1992, even in states that were relatively high in the percentage of third-party votes, third parties never received more than 20% of the vote. Thus, even in such states, a vote for a third-party candidate is likely an act of nonconformity. Furthermore, major party candidates launch massive persuasive campaigns aimed at convincing voters to support them. Voting for a third-party candidate in spite of descriptive norms and ubiquitous appeals from major party candidates (not to mention remonstrations from their fellow citizens not to “throw away their votes”) demonstrates resistance to social influence. The idea that third-party voting indicates a preference for uniqueness is also supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112466591">Vandello and Cohen’s (1999)</xref> inclusion of the percentage of Libertarian votes cast as a negative indicator of collectivism in their state-level index.</p>
<p>The present study sought to address whether contemporary pathogen prevalence and frontier settlement are linked to nonconformist voting behavior. As a proxy for frontier settlement, we used the year in which a state was admitted to the Union (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022022112466591">Varnum &amp; Kitayama, 2011</xref>); states that were admitted to the Union at a later date tend to have been settled earlier and to have reached higher population density and advanced infrastructure development earlier than those states that were admitted later. There were four main predictions: (1) date of statehood positively correlates with votes for third-party U.S. presidential candidates, (2) date of statehood negatively correlates with pathogen prevalence, (3) pathogen prevalence negatively correlates with votes for third-party candidates, and (4) pathogen prevalence mediates the effect of date of statehood on votes for third-party candidates. To test these predictions, data were gathered on the percent of votes in each state given to third-party candidates for president in elections from 1968 to 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022022112466591">Leip, 2011</xref>). Parasite Stress USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022022112466591">Fincher &amp; Thornhill, 2012</xref>) was used as an index of pathogen prevalence. As previous research has linked cross-national variation in GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022022112466591">Van Leeuwen, Park, Koenig, &amp; Graham, in press</xref>) and population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022022112466591">Gelfand, Nishi, &amp; Raver, 2006</xref>) to constructs related to conformity, state-level data on median family income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022022112466591">U.S. Census Bureau, 2011</xref>) and population density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022022112466591">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>) in 2008 were also gathered.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In nearly every election between 1968 and 2008, date of statehood and pathogen prevalence predicted votes received by third parties. Date of statehood was positively correlated with votes for third-party candidates, in 10 out of 11 elections (.24 &lt; βs &lt; .58, <italic>p</italic>s between .08 and .001). Pathogen prevalence was negatively correlated with third-party votes in 7 out of 11 elections (−.24 &gt; βs &gt; −.72, <italic>p</italic>s between .09 and .001) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022022112466591">Table 1</xref>). The only significant reversal of these patterns occurred in 1968, when date of statehood was negatively correlated with votes for third-party candidates (β = −.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .06), and pathogen prevalence was positively correlated with votes for third-party candidates (β = .76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In the 1968 election, George Wallace ran on a segregationist platform and garnered electoral majorities or pluralities in several Southern states. In this context, votes for Wallace most likely did not represent nonconformist behavior. Excluding votes for Wallace, neither date of statehood or pathogen prevalence were significant predictors of third-party votes in 1968.</p>

<p>In order to test the robustness of these effects, median household income and population density in 2008 were added as control variables in separate regression analyses for date of statehood and pathogen prevalence. Controlling for median income and population density, date of statehood remained a significant predictor of third-party votes in the 2008 election (β = .37, <italic>p</italic> = .03). Pathogen prevalence also remained a significant predictor when controlling for median income and population density (β = −.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, in separate regression analyses, controlling for median income and population density, date of statehood remained a significant predictor of average third-party votes (excluding votes for Wallace in 1968) (β = .43, <italic>p =</italic> .003), as did pathogen prevalence (β = −.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Importantly, state-level average third-party voting (excluding Wallace) was negatively correlated with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022022112466591">Vandello and Cohen’s (1999)</xref> index of collectivist behaviors (<italic>r</italic> = −.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that these voting practices are a valid indicator of broader nonconformist tendencies.</p>
<p>Next, mediation was tested for the most recent election (2008) and for average third-party votes from 1968 to 2008 (excluding votes for Wallace in 1968). All tests of mediation were conducted using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022112466591">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> SPSS Macro for Multiple Mediation. As predicted, pathogen prevalence partially mediated the relationship between date of statehood and votes for the third-party candidates in 2008 and average votes for third-party candidates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022022112466591">Figure 1</xref>). Nonparametric bootstrapping analyses, the preferred method of testing mediation in small samples, were used to test for significant mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022022112466591">Preacher &amp; Hayes, 2008</xref>). Mediation is considered significant in these analyses if the bias corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effect do not include zero. Based on 5,000 bootstrapped samples, pathogen prevalence significantly mediated the effect of date of statehood for both 2008 third-party votes (95% CI: .0002, .0048) and for average third-party votes (95% CI: .0003, .0108).</p>

<p>Mediation models with pathogen prevalence as the independent variable and date of statehood as the dependent variable were also tested, for both 2008 and overall average third-party votes (excluding Wallace). For 2008, this analysis failed to show mediation; based on 5,000 bootstrapped samples, the bias corrected and accelerated 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effects included zero (95% CI: −.1658, .0069). This model was significant for average third-party votes based on 5,000 bootstrapped samples (95% CI: −.5567, −.03). However, the reduction of the direct effect in this mediation model (pathogen prevalence → average third-party voting; β = −.62 to β = −.52) is smaller than the reduction of the direct effect in the hypothesized model (date of statehood → average third-party voting; β = .50 to β = .34). Furthermore, Sobel tests (although conservative in small samples) suggested that mediation in the original model (independent variable = date of statehood; Mediator (M) = pathogen prevalence; dependent variable = average third-party voting) was significant (<italic>z</italic> = 1.97, <italic>SE</italic> = .001, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) but that the alternative model (independent variable = pathogen prevalence; M = date of statehood; dependent variable = average third-party voting) was only marginally so (<italic>z</italic> = 1.81, <italic>SE</italic> = .09, <italic>p</italic> = .07). It should also be noted that this alternative model seems less logically plausible than the originally hypothesized mediation model as it would hold that a contemporary state of affairs (the current prevalence of infectious diseases) influences events in the distant past (the date a state joined the Union).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study provides support for both the voluntary settlement hypothesis and the parasite stress hypothesis. These results suggest that state-level nonconformist voting behavior differs as a function of recency of settlement. Furthermore, these differences appear to be driven in part by variation in the prevalence of pathogens. Thus, pathogen prevalence may not only explain regional variation in psychological tendencies and traits but may also be a mechanism that leads to cultural differences in highly consequential decisions such as voting.</p>
<p>These results suggest that disease prevalence may be a key contemporary factor that underlies differences in conformity between frontiers and more recently settled regions. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022022112466591">Kitayama et al.’s (in press)</xref> recent proposal that pathogen prevalence might be one of the mechanisms that underlie a number of differences in values, implicit psychological tendencies, and related behavioral practices between frontiers and areas that have a longer history of settlement. Future research should explore whether other psychological and behavioral differences tied to frontier settlement might also be explained by variation in the prevalence of pathogens. It should be noted that the present study is correlational in nature; hence, experimental paradigms (manipulating say the salience of illness or evoking frontier imagery) might provide for stronger inferences about the relationship between pathogen prevalence, frontiers, and nonconformist behavior.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some evidence of mediation was found for an alternative model, where date of statehood mediated the effect of contemporary pathogen prevalence on average third-party voting. Although this model seems less plausible (as it posits a contemporary variable predicting a temporally distal variable), it may be that current pathogen prevalence reflects historical levels of disease prevalence and that low disease prevalence may have been one enticement to settle frontiers. If systematic estimates of disease prevalence at earlier points in American history can be compiled, this might enable a better test of this alternative account. It may also be interesting to explore the relative contribution of historical and contemporary disease prevalence to regional variation in conformity.</p>
<p>Finally, this research may have some practical applications for politicians. Two rather unintuitive implications of these findings are that candidates for office who are outside the political mainstream might do better to focus their efforts on more recently settled areas and on areas where infectious disease is less common.</p>
