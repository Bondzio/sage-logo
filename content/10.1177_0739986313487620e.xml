<p>In <italic>Immigration and Integration in Urban Communities</italic>, Hanley, Ruble, and Garland bring together 10 chapters on immigration from scholars around the world. Their purpose in doing this is to give what they refer to as “snapshots” to show that the current academic study on immigration does not fully “capture the reality of the migration experience on the ground” (p. 2). In this humble mission, they are essentially successful. In place of the current academic study, which tends to lean toward either assimilation or multiculturalism theories, they offer the term “renegotiation.” This new term emphasizes the give and take that immigrants have with their new homes as well as their old. In this undertaking, the editors split the articles under two general categories: the renegotiation of urban space and the renegotiation of urban citizenship. Under the framework of renegotiation, the 10 articles struggle to find one coherent narrative, but as snapshots they do offer a broad view of the current gaps in literature on the migrant experience.</p>
<p>Within the renegotiation of urban space, the chapters focus on the intersection of spatial and social/political belonging. The five chapters in this section go about disproving the idea that space decides the immigrant experience, showing instead that immigrants have agency (though it can be limited by outside factors) in negotiating with space to create their experience. One way this is shown is through the more recent process of suburban versus urban immigration. This gives a lens for looking at how immigrant communities are centered less on actual spatial belonging and more on the formal and informal organizations that create belonging. In Jones-Correa’s chapter on immigrants in suburbia, he says, “The urban literature assumes that ethnic organization and mobilization go hand-in-hand with place stratification, and that as racial/ethnic groups assimilate spatially, their mobilization efforts become less distinguishable from those of the population as a whole” (p. 26). He goes on to show that in the suburbs, regardless of spatial separation, immigrants find their communities around churches and cultural schools, despite a lack of ethnic enclaves. This idea of churches as a place of ethnic belonging in communities, despite spatial stratification, comes up in many of the chapters that follow.</p>
<p>Another way of getting at the same idea can be seen in Houston and Wright’s interviews with interracial couples in Seattle. These authors want to demonstrate that the navigation of the immigrant life in urban spaces, even at a small unit like the household, is not just about segregation and stratification, but primarily about relationship. Another unique feature on this topic of spatial belonging can be seen in the idea of the “placelessness” of Filipina domestic workers in Rome and Los Angeles. In this chapter we see how racial and socioeconomic stratification, often more than spatial, impact the experience of immigrants. In Rome the Filipina migrants renegotiate a (albeit limited) public space for their community despite intense personal discrimination. In Los Angeles, in many ways the Filipina domestic workers fail to negotiate a space for themselves due to socioeconomic discrimination by middle-class Filipina immigrants.</p>
<p>The story of the Filipina domestic workers really begins to get at the idea of “renegotiation” and the interaction and power of the immigrant within the larger urban space. While the immigrant does not always successfully negotiate a safe space for belonging, the immigrant impacts the world around her. She is not a passive entity. The second half of the chapters continue with the theme, digging into the idea of immigrant agency in the process of urban citizenship. Brettell begins this argument, exploring the idea of place making in immigrant communities, again looking to the suburbs as a place for examining the departure of social, economic, historical, and cultural understanding of ethnic identity from one that is purely spatial. She argues, like Jones-Correa, that churches as well as retail centers and even online forums create a place for immigrant communities. She also comments on changes in laws in the communities she is studying, not just as a defensive response against immigrants but also as immigrants showing agency to impact their environment. She acknowledges that this varies a great deal by ethnic group, with some groups being absorbed by others (the Salvadorans by the Mexicans in the Dallas area) and is somewhat tied to the human capital the ethnic group as a whole possesses for economic and political power.</p>
<p>This idea of immigrant agency is also shown in a public health scenario. Pribilsky discusses immigrants’ struggles with tuberculosis in a smaller city in New York. Local health officials try to implement “culturally sensitive” care but are frustrated by what they view as noncompliance on the part of immigrants in seeking out medical attention. Pribilsky points to the immigrant’s negotiation and retention of community with the sending country as a part of the perceived failure of local public health entities to respond to the problem. The immigrant’s transnational citizenship changes his interaction with his local community. Ley brings much of this together in his chapter entitled “Postmulticulturalism?” In this chapter he uses Canada as a case study for whether we are, along with all of the other “posts” we now employ, moving past the idea of multiculturalism. He explores the arguments for and against multiculturalism and settles on a particular example in a wealthy Canadian neighborhood. In this instance, the immigrants actually end up exercising political power and “renegotiating” with the native elites in the area to come up with a new set of housing laws that exemplify a happy compromise. His argument is that multiculturalism indicates a more passive role for immigrants, but he believes that immigrants exercise agency through the political power of their citizenship. It is a strong example of renegotiation, but it occurs in a group of wealthy immigrants from Hong Kong that holds substantial economic capital and is intentionally seeking property investments.</p>
<p>Overall, the editors make a strong case for the need to add academic study of “renegotiation” to the current assimilation and multiculturalism perspectives. This compilation of 10 chapters takes on a huge feat, examining an impressive variety of immigrant experiences from Johannesburg to Los Angeles to Stuttgart. In spite of this, the authors’ open acknowledgement of the scope of the project allowed them to stay on course despite a lack of one cohesive narrative across the anthology.</p>
