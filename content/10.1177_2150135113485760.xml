<title>Background:</title>
<p>Development of a subaortic membrane is not fully understood. Recurrence after surgical removal continues to be high. We sought to assess the differences in aorto-septal angles (AoSA) to possibly explain alterations within the left ventricular outflow tract, hence in subaortic membrane formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 113 patients who underwent subaortic membrane resection were matched by age and sex with 113 controls. The subaortic membrane resection group included isolated subaortic membranes (n = 34, group I), associated with ventricular septal defect (n = 29, group II), or patent ductus arteriosus (n = 50, group III).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Mean (± standard deviation) AoSA (in degrees) were not different between subaortic membrane groups I, II, and III but were steeper than their control groups (126.2 ± 9.2 vs 138.6 ± 7.0, 129.2 ± 9.9 vs 137.7 ± 10.0, and 126.2 ± 8.1 vs 135 ± 8.5, respectively; all <italic>P</italic>s &lt; .05). Additionally, group II had lower preoperative gradients (28.8 ± 20.7 mm Hg) compared to groups I and III (67.0 ± 32.9 and 66.2 ± 33.1 mm Hg, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Follow-up ranged from 3 to 132 months. In 22 (32%) patients, a subaortic membrane recurred. Early postoperative residual gradients and development of aortic regurgutation were associated with the need for reoperation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>These findings suggest a contributing role of the AoSA in the development of subaortic membrane. Further rheological experiments are warranted. Whether the steeper the angle the higher the risk of recurrence may be revealed by longer follow-up periods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A subaortic membrane is defined as a discrete fibrous membrane that causes subvalvular left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO), frequently involving also the aortic valve, leading to aortic valve regurgitation (AR).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135113485760">1</xref>
</sup> The natural history of patients with subaortic membrane is one of the progressive LVOTO, increasing degrees of AR, endocarditis, and recurrent obstruction after surgical resection. Since a subaortic membrane was identified as a cause of LVOTO and secondary damage to the aortic valve, surgical resection was initially advised in all the cases. Over the years, some authors have changed their approach based on the timing for removal of the membrane, gradients greater than 30 to 50 mm Hg, presence and the degree of AR, age of presentation, or a combination of these factors. Nevertheless, surgery as prophylaxis against development of aortic valve damage and eventual left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction continues to guide the timing of the surgical intervention.</p>
<p>Although subaortic membrane is mostly considered an acquired defect, hereditariness has been suggested.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135113485760">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135113485760"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135113485760">4</xref>
</sup> Presently, the genesis of a subaortic membrane has been assumed to be mostly caused by an initial physical stress triggered by an abnormal flow pattern across a geometrically altered left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), followed by biochemical responses that would partially explain the relatively high subaortic membrane recurrence rate of 7% to 27%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135113485760">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135113485760">6</xref>
</sup> despite a seemingly complete resection of the membrane. A steeper aorto-septal angle (AoSA), the angle formed by the midline long axis of the ascending aorta and the ventricular septum, has been found to increase the septal shear stress within this area of the LVOT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113485760">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To better understand the subaortic membrane formation and its consequences, it is important to investigate the morphological and hemodynamic characteristics of hearts of patients with subaortic membrane. For this purpose, we designed a case–control study to compare the AoSA of patients with subaortic membrane to those without. We further analyzed preoperative echocardiographic characteristics of the heart of patients with isolated subaortic membrane or associated with ventricular septal defect (VSD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and outcome after subaortic membrane resection.</p>

<title>Patient Selection</title>
<p>Permission to proceed with a retrospective review of anonymous patient data was approved by our hospital ethics committee. Patient-/parent-written consent was waived. Subaortic membrane was defined as a discrete fibrous membrane in the LVOT as observed echocardiographically. Between 1997 and 2010, 144 patients underwent subaortic membrane resection in our institution. Of these, 25 had associated anomalies other than VSD or PDA and were excluded from the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135113485760">Table 1</xref>). Five of them had subaortic membrane associated with diffuse subaortic stenosis (subaortic tunnel) and required a Konno operation, and one patient had severe aortic valve stenosis and therefore required aortic valve replacement. Six other patients who were operated before 2003 were also excluded, because their preoperative echocardiograms were not available for review.</p>

<p>We reviewed the preoperative echocardiograms of the remaining 113 patients who underwent primary surgical resection of subaortic membrane, including patients with additional VSDs or PDA. These patients were divided into three groups according to the presence or absence of an associated lesion: group I (34 patients), isolated subaortic membrane; group II (29 patients), subaortic membrane and VSD; group III (50 patients), subaortic membrane and PDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135113485760">Figure 1</xref>). We decided to analyze groups II and III separately because of the overload volume of the left ventricle generated by these lesions, and group II separately because of the increased septal shear stress generated in the LVOT by the presence of a hemodynamically significant VSD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113485760">7</xref>
</sup> Ten patients underwent a previous procedure (PDA ligation, VSD closure, aortic valve dilation). They were considered to belong to group I unless they had a residual lesion or the subaortic membrane was already present when the first procedure was performed. To investigate the presence of a steeper AoSA, patients with isolated subaortic membrane (group I) were compared to a group of age- and sex-matched control patients in whom an echocardiogram excluded congenital heart defects. Patients with subaortic membrane and VSD (group II) or PDA (group III) were compared to a group of age-, sex-, and lesion-matched control patients who had a VSD or a PDA.</p>

<title>Surgical Details</title>
<p>The operations were performed or supervised by one of the four pediatric cardiac surgeons then in our institution. The surgical technique underwent changes. Before 2003, sharp dissection and excision of the subaortic membrane was performed in 21 patients (18.6% of the total number of patients in the study), while after 2003 a blunt dissection technique advocated by McKay et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135113485760">8</xref>
</sup> was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135113485760">Figure 2</xref>). Septal myectomy was performed only when a hypertrophic anterior septum was identified intraoperatively (through the aortic annulus) as a clear contributor for the LVOTO.</p>

<title>Echocardiographic Studies</title>
<p>Echocardiograms were performed with four types of cardiac scanners (Acuson XP128, Siemens, Erlagen, Germany; Hewlett-Packard Sonos 1000, 4500, Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Philips iE, Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and with transducer frequencies appropriate for patient size. Studies were recorded on 0.5-in (1.27-cm) videocassette tape. The AoSA was measured in the long-axis parasternal echocardiographic view during end-diastole according to the method described previously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135113485760">9</xref>
</sup> A still frame was scanned, and the angle between these lines was measured in Microsoft PowerPoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2150135113485760">Figure 3</xref>). The AoSA was compared between subaortic membrane groups (I, II and III) and their respective control groups.</p>

<p>The peak LVOT gradient, aortic annulus <italic>z</italic>-score, and AR were assessed on pre- and postoperative echocardiograms of all subaortic membrane group patients. The peak LVOT instantaneous gradient was measured from continuous wave Doppler velocities using a 2- or 5-chamber view and the simplified Bernoulli equation (gradient = 4V<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135113485760">2</xref>
</sup>). A peak systolic gradient greater than 30 mm Hg was considered significant. The aortic valve annulus diameter was measured in the parasternal long-axis view in mid-systole between the hinge points of the right coronary and noncoronary aortic leaflets (expressed as <italic>z</italic>-score to adjust for the body surface area). The AR was graded as trivial, mild, moderate, or severe using color Doppler jet diameter according to the criteria described previously.<sup>

<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>Follow-up data were obtained through a review of the medical records between 2010 and 2011. The last echocardiogram was recorded. Follow-up was available in 80 (71%) patients. The median follow-up was 3.4 years (range, 3 months to 11 years). The primary outcome was recurrence of subaortic membrane after a successful complete removal. The secondary outcomes were development or worsening of AR and reoperation. For that, we decided to divide the 80 patients into three groups based on the immediate postoperative result: patients with no residual subaortic membrane and no residual peak LVOT gradient (45 patients); patients with no residual subaortic membrane and some residual LVOT gradient (23 patients); and patients with residual subaortic membrane (12 patients).</p>

Another patient with mild AR had undergone two previous percutaneous aortic valve dilations and had prolapse of the right coronary leaflet. The other three patients with no preoperative AR had repair of a surgical perforation that occurred while detaching the invasive subaortic membrane from the leaflets.</p>
<p>Septal myectomy was performed in 10 patients. Two of them had a residual subaortic membrane and high LVOT gradient and needed reoperation.</p>
<p>Sharp dissection versus blunt dissection of subaortic membrane had no significant impact on the overall outcomes.</p>

<title>Immediate Postoperative Outcomes</title>
<p>Follow-up data were available in 80 (71%) patients. Twelve (15%) patients had a residual subaortic membrane. Four of them underwent septal myectomy. The postoperative LVOT gradient was 17.8 ± 16.3 mm Hg (range from 0 to 60 mm Hg). Two of them had significant residual LVOT gradient (35 and 60 mm Hg), but they were not reoperated in the same admission. In all, 68 (85%) patients had no residual membrane, but only 45 patients (56%) had no residual LVOT gradient. The remaining 23 (29%) patients had an LVOT gradient of 15 ± 9.9 mm Hg (range from 4 to 40 mm Hg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2150135113485760">Figure 5</xref>).

<title>No Residual Subaortic Membrane or LVOT Gradient</title>
<p>Of 45 patients, 10 (22%) with the initial finding of no residual subaortic membrane or LVOT gradient developed an LVOT gradient over time. Seven of them had a recurrent subaortic membrane, while three patients developed a mild LVOT gradient in the follow-up despite absence of a recurrent subaortic membrane. The mean LVOT gradient in the last echocardiogram for this subgroup of patients was 3.4 mm Hg, ranging from 0 to 40 mm Hg. The recurrence rate was 27% (12 of 45 patients). The median time to develop recurrent subaortic membrane was 2 years (4 months to 7 years).</p>
<p>Preoperative characteristics, such as age, gender, aortic valve morphology, LVOT gradient, and degree of the AoSA, were not associated with subaortic membrane recurrence. Late postoperative AR was associated with a higher preoperative LVOT gradient (73.83 ± 45.27 mm Hg vs 41.46 ± 28.24 mm Hg; <italic>P</italic> = .02), the presence of preoperative moderate to severe AR (67% vs 10%; <italic>P</italic> = .001), and the need for aortic valve repair (50% vs 5%; <italic>P</italic> = .013). Also, patients in whom the subaortic membrane recurred had more severe degrees of late postoperative AR: four (33%) patients had moderate to severe AR, while two (6%) patients with no recurrent subaortic membrane had moderate AR (<italic>P</italic> = .01). Reoperation was associated with the presence of pre- and postoperative moderate to severe AR (100% vs 2.33%; <italic>P</italic> = .003, and 100% vs 9.3%; <italic>P</italic> = .005 respectively) but not with postoperative LVOT gradient nor recurrence of subaortic membrane (<italic>P</italic> value of .528 and .467, respectively). Thus, in our series, recurrent subaortic membrane was associated with significant AR rather than significant LVOTO, and reoperation was associated with new onset or worsening of AR.</p>

<title>No Residual Subaortic Membrane With Residual LVOT Gradient</title>
<p>The LVOT gradient decreased over time in 13 (56%) of 23 patients, most of them to zero (10 patients). The gradient remained the same in three (13%) and increased in seven (30%) patients. Subaortic membrane recurred in 44% (10 of 23) of these patients, and there was no tendency identified in the LVOT gradient behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2150135113485760">Figure 6</xref>). The absence of recurrent subaortic membrane was associated with significant reduction in the LVOT gradient (<italic>P</italic> = .02). In fact, the only patient in whom the subaortic membrane did not recur, and developed a significant gradient in the late postoperative period, was due to aortic valve stenosis rather than subaortic stenosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-2150135113485760">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Residual Subaortic Membrane</title>
<p>In 10 (83%) of the 12 patients , the residual gradient was less than 30 mm Hg in the immediate postoperative period. The other two patients needed reoperation, two years and seven years after their initial intervention. Both had residual subaortic membrane with progressive hemodynamically significant gradient; at the same time, AR developed as the gradient increased. They underwent resection of the subaortic membrane with aortic valve repair (resuspension). One of them needed a second reoperation for persistent LVOT gradient and AR. She died due to low cardiac output syndrome after undergoing Konno enlargement of the LVOT with implantation of a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis.</p>
<p>The LVOT gradient tended to increase over time, although this was not statistically significant (17.8 ± 17.1 vs 27.7 ± 30.3 mm Hg; <italic>P</italic> = .06). Immediate (47.5 ± 17.7 vs 11.9 ± 9.3 mm Hg) and late (82 ± 29.7 vs 16.9 ± 15.5 mm Hg) postoperative gradients were associated with moderate to severe AR and the need for reoperation (<italic>P</italic> = .001 and &lt; .001, respectively).</p>

<sec id="section16-2150135113485760">
<title>Residual LVOT Gradient (With or Without Residual Subaortic Membrane)</title>
<p>We analyzed all patients who had peak LVOT gradient different from zero in the analysis (total of 32 patients), regardless of the presence of residual subaortic membrane or not. We found that septal myectomy (66.7% vs 11.5%; <italic>P</italic> = .012) and aortic valve repair (50% vs 7.7%; <italic>P</italic> = .034) proved predictors of moderate to severe AR in the end of the follow-up, and the latter, to reoperation (60% vs 11.1%; <italic>P</italic> = .027). Immediate (31.2 ± 19.8 vs 16.5 ± 8.7 mm Hg) and late (61.6 ± 29.3 vs 11.5 ± 13.1 mm Hg) postoperative gradients in the LVOT was associated with the need for reoperation as well (<italic>P</italic> = .009 and &lt; 0.001, respectively).</p>

Twelve (15%) patients developed moderate to severe AR in the postoperative follow-up period. Half of them underwent aortic valve repair in addition to subaortic membrane resection at the time of the first operation. The preoperative AR grading of these patients was none or trivial in three (25%) patients, mild in four (33%) patients, moderate in one (9%) patient, and severe in four (33%) patients. In the early postoperative follow-up, five (42%) patients had none or trivial AR after the subaortic membrane resection, but the AR progressed as the subaortic membrane recurred in four of them. The other patient had a residual subaortic membrane. Three (25%) patients had mild AR, which worsened over time. The remaining four patients had moderate AR early postoperatively. Five of these patients were reoperated.</p>

<title>Reoperation</title>
<p>Seven patients underwent reoperation for different reasons. Three of them had neither residual nor recurrent subaortic membrane but exclusively aortic valve-related problems: moderate AR, severe AR, and aortic valve stenosis. One patient had progressive residual subaortic membrane and severe AR. The remaining three patients had recurrent subaortic membrane; two of them had severe AR as well. The mean time interval to the first reoperation was 3.9 years. A second intervention was needed in three patients; the first patient was described previously. The second patient had been clinically treated for aortic valve endocarditis previous to the subaortic membrane resection. She underwent balloon aortic valve dilation (65-mm Hg transvalvar gradient) three years after the first operation and remained with residual subaortic gradient of 11 mm Hg. One year later, she underwent resection of tunnel-like subaortic fibrosis. The most recent subsequent echocardiogram showed a recurrent subaortic membrane (35-mm Hg gradient) and moderate AR. The third patient was reoperated within 3 hours after the first operation due to residual septal hypertrophy with a significant LVOT gradient. Two years later, she was diagnosed with severe AR and a perforation within the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. She underwent a Konno operation and a mitral valve repair.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In all three groups of patients, the AoSA was steeper when compared to their respective control groups, suggesting a contributing role of the AoSA in the development of subaortic membrane. Arguments in favor of this hypothesis are that hemodynamic stress produces changes in the cellular and extracellular components of vessel walls as seen in the aorta of patients with nonstenotic, nonregurgitant bicuspid aortic valve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135113485760">11</xref>
</sup> Moreover, experiments have confirmed that the AoSA indeed plays a role in the flow dynamics across the LVOT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135113485760">7</xref>
</sup> The steeper the AoSA, the greater the wall shear stress, which may induce changes in the biochemical components of the subendothelial layer, inducing smooth muscle cell migration, and proliferation within the adjacent fibrous body of the subaortic membrane. At this point, additional gradients may be generated, increasing blood flow velocity and wall shear stress, thus creating a positive feedback for further growth of the membrane. The secondary AR may be explained by both the invasion of the aortic leaflets by membrane tissue and the mechanical stress caused by turbulent blood flow across the valve (jet effect).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135113485760">12</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the LVOT obstruction eventually leads to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling over time, which could conceivably also contribute to the development of AR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135113485760">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135113485760">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Barkhordarian et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135113485760">15</xref>
</sup> reported that in patients under 10 years of age with an isolated subaortic membrane, the AoSA did change after surgical removal of the membrane, suggesting that the LVOT geometry may be remodeled in younger patients. This might explain why steeper AoSA were not associated with subaortic membrane recurrence in an eight-year follow-up study by Geva et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135113485760">16</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, an interaction between hemodynamic and genetic stimuli may determine the fate of patients with abnormal AoSA.</p>
<p>We have also observed occasional patients who after repair of other congenital heart defects developed subaortic membrane later in life, which was also reported by Kalfa et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135113485760">17</xref>
</sup> They recorded that an AoSA less than 130° was present in 14% of such patients. However, this finding was not analyzed further.</p>
<p>The AR was an important finding for outcome prediction. Preoperative severe AR was associated with the need for reoperation in the subgroup of patients who had neither residual subaortic membrane nor residual LVOT gradients. Postoperative AR, either made worse after the operation or acquired postoperatively, represented the most serious complication. It was associated with reoperation in all three subgroups of patients. In fact, the only patient who died within this series was reoperated for severe AR. Although subaortic membrane recurrence and residual postoperative gradients were not associated with reoperation in all subgroups, they were associated with postoperative AR.</p>
<p>There was a tendency to higher rates of reoperation in patients who underwent sharp dissection of the subaortic membrane, but it could be explained by the longer follow-up period of these patients. To protect the aortic and mitral valves, and the conduction system, we tended to limit the removal of the subaortic membrane, allowing some residual gradient in the LVOT. Although we found that the recurrence rate of subaortic membrane is higher in the group of patients who had a residual LVOT gradient in the immediate postoperative period (43%) than in the group of patients who had none (27%), we could not conclude that the residual gradient is associated with subaortic membrane recurrence. This could be explained by the decrease in the LVOT gradient to zero in most of the cases in which subaortic membrane did not recur. We could hypothesize that the residual LVOT gradient secondary to the LV hypertrophy may disappear after the LV remodeling.</p>
<p>The association of residual gradients in the LVOT and postoperative AR has been previously reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135113485760">18</xref>
</sup> Perhaps, the relatively high rates of reoperation for postoperative AR in our patients may be related to insufficient resection, leaving some of the pathological subaortic membrane tissue adhered to the aortic valve or muscular obstruction in the LVOT. Besides, an increased shear stress in the LVOT could ultimately induce further damage to the aortic valve even without recurrence of a subaortic membrane. Apparently, a more extensive resection, including myectomy along the entire length of the interventricular septum, sparing only the area adjacent to the membranous septum, and circumferentially around the LVOT onto the free wall, reduces significant recurrences. However, this more aggressive approach does increase the risk of causing complete atrioventricular block and creation of an iatrogenic VSD.<sup>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. All data were collected retrospectively and only one echocardiographer carried out all the necessary measurements. Due to the late referral of our patients,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135113485760">19</xref>
</sup> analysis of optimal timing of surgical intervention could not be determined. Since UNICAR is a public institution and majority of our patients are in the majority native (Mayan) or Ladinos (mixed Mayans and Europeans), it is difficult to identify an ethnic predisposition. In addition, 29% of the patients were not available for follow-up, mostly due to the low socioeconomic conditions and communication difficulties with our significantly poor rural population.</p>

<sec id="section21-2150135113485760">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A steeper aorto-septal angle was associated with the presence of a subaortic membrane in patients with otherwise normal hearts or with an additional VSD or PDA. However, on the basis of our data, we were unable to determine whether a steeper AoSA represents a risk factor for hemodynamically significant postoperative recurrence of a subaortic membrane.</p>
<p>The present study does suggest that residual immediate postoperative gradients in the LVOT are predictors of the need for reoperation either because of the additional removal of a residual or recurrent subaortic membrane or because of the onset or progression of AR. In some cases, more extensive subaortic membrane resection, considering also an additional septal myectomy, seems justified.</p>
<p>A long-term prospective study following a cohort of infants with subaortic membrane would be needed to confirm its association with steeper AoSA. More basic studies concerning the formation of subaortic membrane and its rheological consequences are necessary to improve long-term surgical results.</p>
