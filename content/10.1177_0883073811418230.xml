<abstract>
<p>To identify parent-reported symptoms that predict parenting stress in preschoolers with global developmental delay, 201 parents/guardians of 142 boys and 59 girls with global delay, mean age 39.1 months (range, 18 to 63 months) were studied retrospectively. Parents completed the following: (a) a semistructured interview; (b) the Child Development Inventory, (c) Child Behavior Checklist 1½-5, and the (d) Parenting Stress Index-Short Form. Forty-two percent of parents described clinically significant parenting stress (≥ 85th percentile). The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form subscales Difficult Child and Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interactions were elevated. Parental stress increased with higher gross motor development and decreased as social and fine-motor ratios increased. Furthermore, stress increased when parents reported higher levels on the Emotionally Reactive and Withdrawn scale scores and when parents reported Pervasive Developmental and Oppositional Defiant Problems. In mobile children with global delay, behavior problems predict parenting stress.</p>

<p>Parents of children with a physical or intellectual disability experience more stress than parents of able children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811418230">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811418230"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811418230">3</xref></sup> At an early stage, this stress can be considerable especially when a child does not respond to ordinary requests and behavior advice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811418230">4</xref></sup> To support parents it is necessary to identify predictors of their stress that increase the negative experience of parenting a child with delayed development. Predicting stressors could help child neurologists recommend more targeted interventions that lead to a better quality of life for the children and their families.</p>
<p>Parents of school-age children with a preschool diagnosis of developmental delay report clinically significant levels of parenting stress, and there can be many reasons that predict this stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811418230">5</xref></sup> Parental concerns about their child’s development and behavior predicts parenting stress at developmental screening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811418230">6</xref></sup> A child’s social skills are stronger predictors of parenting stress than motor, communicative, adaptive behavior, or cognitive abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811418230">7</xref></sup> Caring for a child with a developmental disability entails high physical, financial and emotional demands and these family functioning variables are strong predictors of overall parenting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811418230">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Parenting stress is common in many neurodevelopmental diagnoses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811418230">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811418230">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811418230"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811418230"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811418230">12</xref></sup> In young children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders, deficits in a child’s social relatedness is associated with parenting stress, parent–child relationship problems, and distress. Parents report these children are more stressful than children with other developmental disabilities, such as Down syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and fragile X.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811418230">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811418230">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811418230">14</xref></sup> Having a child with delays who has sleep problems is especially stressful for parents. In families with preschool children with cerebral palsy, the factors most strongly related to parental stress levels were high family needs, low family adaptability, and cognitive impairment in the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811418230">15</xref></sup> Mothers of high-risk very low birth weight children experience significant stress; lower child cognitive abilities and, in addition, the socioeconomic status in these families is associated with stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811418230">9</xref></sup> Caregivers of in utero drug-exposed children who report high parental stress levels are more likely to report significant behavior problems in their child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811418230">10</xref></sup> Stress in mothers of boys with Duchene muscular dystrophy is elevated because of increased problem behaviors, especially social interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811418230">11</xref></sup> Parents of children with biochemical disorders experience more stress around a child’s adaptive functioning, lack of satisfaction with support, and difficulties meeting their child’s health care needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811418230">12</xref></sup> Identifying these stressors is important, as parenting is a potentially modifiable factor that can promote the development of children in the face of significant neurodevelopmental risks.</p>
<p>While developmental and behavior problems have been documented as predictors of parental well-being in middle childhood, there are only a few studies that evaluate them as predictors of parenting stress in young children at risk for developmental delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811418230">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811418230">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811418230"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811418230"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811418230">16</xref></sup> Since supporting parents is a clinical imperative, there is good reason to recognize adaptive and maladaptive child behaviors not only for diagnosis but to reduce parenting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811418230">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811418230">17</xref></sup> The purpose of this research is to identify the developmental and behavior attributes of young children with developmental delay that predict parenting stress.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0883073811418230">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of parent/caregiver reports about their child. The respondents were parents/guardians of children with global developmental delay presenting at consecutive assessments at a neurodevelopmental clinic between April 1, 2005 and March 3, 2009.</p>
<p>Of the 201 respondents, most of the data was collected from mothers (78.6%). Most were married (84.0%), white (83.3%), high school graduates (97.9%), and employed (72.6%). All children were young (18 to 63 months). They were classified as having global developmental delay if they had significant delay in 2 or more developmental domains (gross motor, fine motor, expressive language/language comprehension, social, and self-help). Significance was defined as 2 or more standard deviations below the mean on a norm referenced test (ie, the Child Development Inventory). Data were collected as part of their initial assessment.</p>

<title>Child Development Inventory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811418230">18</xref></sup></title>
<p>The Child Development Inventory is used for the developmental assessment of children 15 months to 6 years of age. It creates a profile of a child’s current development. Parents/caregivers complete the booklet that consists of 270 “yes” or “no” items. Parents read and respond to each of the items, which are organized into 9 scales of child development: Social, Self Help, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Expressive Language, Language Comprehension, Letters, Numbers and General Development. The General Development Scale is an index of overall development and is unique from the other scales as the most age-discriminating items are included here. The overall results provide a comprehensive assessment of the child’s development, problems, and strengths. The overall reliability is adequate, with Cronbach alphas exceeding 0.70; subscale reliabilities range from 0.80 to above 0.90 for the Expressive Language, Language Comprehension, and General Development Scales. The developmental scales correlate closely with age (r = 0.84). Finally, there is some evidence of validity as the scales correlated with kindergarten reading achievement as follows: general development 0.69, letters 0.56, language comprehension 0.42, expressive language 0.36, and self-help 0.35.</p>

<p>The Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1½–5 is a rating form that results in profiles for children age 18 months through 5 years. Parents rate 99 problem items, plus descriptions of problems, disabilities, priority concerns, and the strengths of the child. A factor analysis resulted in 7 syndrome profiles: Emotionally Reactive, Anxious/Depressed, Somatic Complaints, Withdrawn, Sleep Problems, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811418230">19</xref></sup> Across the various syndrome scales test–retest correlations are in the range of 0.80 to 0.90. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Oriented Scales are as follows: affective problems, anxiety problems, pervasive developmental problems, attention deficit/hyperactivity problems, and oppositional defiant problems. The profiles are analogous to the profiles of empirically based syndromes. There are acceptable levels of content, construct, and criterion-related validity and strong levels of internal consistency and test–retest reliability (.63–.86) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Oriented Scales. A confirmatory factor analysis provided validity evidence toward using this measure to identify emotional and behavior disorders in preschool children with autism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811418230">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>Parenting Stress Index-Short Form.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811418230">21</xref></sup></title>
<p>The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form is used to assess parental stress due to parent characteristics, child characteristics, and their interactions. The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form is a 36-item parental self-report measure used to assess parenting stress in 3 domains: Parental Distress, Parent–Child Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child. Items are measured along a scale from 1 (<italic>Strongly Disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>Strongly</italic>
<italic>Agree</italic>) so higher scores indicate greater levels of parenting stress. A score at or above the 85th percentile indicates clinically significant stress, while scores 15 to 85 indicate normal levels of stress. In this study, only the total stress score was used.</p>

<sec id="section7-0883073811418230">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All scores on the Child Development Inventory are reported as age equivalents in months. Scores on the Child Development Inventory scales were converted to ratio quotients by dividing the developmental age by the chronological age.</p>
<p>The Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17.0 was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated to describe the groups within the study sample. A 1-way Analysis of Variance compared the mean level of parenting stress scale scores by primary diagnosis. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the developmental ratios and behaviors that best predicted parenting stress. A cutoff of <italic>P</italic> = .10 was used for including particular variables into the model. Significantly associated variables were included in the model until the best-fitting model was determined. 95% confidence intervals of the results were calculated. Two-tailed <italic>P</italic> values of ≤ 0.05 were considered significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample of children with consecutive visits to a neurodevelopmental clinic consisted of 142 (70.6%) boys and 59 (29.4%) girls, with a mean age of 39.1 months (SD = 11; range, 18 to 63 months). All children had 2 or more developmental domains delayed (mean = 4.57; SD = 1.42; range, 2–6). The frequencies of primary diagnosis were: 51% developmental delay (not otherwise specified), 20.5% autism spectrum disorder, 13.0% genetic or metabolic, 8.5% motor impairment, and 7.0% other. A 1-way analysis of variance compared the level of parenting stress by primary diagnosis and there was no significant difference among primary diagnoses (F(4,195) = 1.039; <italic>P</italic> = .388).</p>
<p>Forty-two percent of parents reported stress at or above the cutoff for clinical significance (≥ 85th percentile). Subscale analysis showed that parenting stress was due primarily to elevations on the child behavior and parent–child interactions subscales (parent stress = 18.9%, difficult child = 45.3%, and parent–child dysfunctional interaction = 49.8%).</p>
<p>A logistic regression model was conducted to assess whether the 6 predictor variables from the Child Development Inventory—the social ratio, self help ratio, gross motor ratio, fine motor ratio, expressive language ratio and language comprehension ratio—significantly predicted whether or not a parent reported clinically relevant stress. When all 7 predictor variables were considered together they predicted parenting stress (Omnibus χ<sup>2</sup> = 21.06; df = 6; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .002). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811418230">Table 1</xref> presents the odds ratios. The results indicate that the odds of parenting stress increase as a child’s gross motor development decreases. Furthermore, parenting stress decreases in likelihood as a child’s social and fine motor ratios increase.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Parenting stress is common in families where a neurodevelopmental assessment indicates a child’s developmental is delayed. Forty-two percent of parents in this study reported clinically significant stress. These levels of stress are very similar to those reported in other studies of children with developmental disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811418230">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811418230">22</xref></sup> Results from this study indicate parenting stress was related more strongly to child behavior problems, chiefly difficult behaviors and parent–child interaction. Child behavior problems accounted for most of the variance for the parent’s level of stress.</p>
<p>An important observation is that the severity of a young child’s disability, especially social and fine motor skills deficits, predicted parenting stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811418230">Table 1</xref>). A toddler with delays in social and fine motor skills will not help, offer help, apologize, or easily fit in with a group. School-age children with a preschool diagnosis of developmental delay that includes personal-social skills best predict parenting stress, suggesting that the experience of stress persists when these functional deficits are present.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811418230">5</xref></sup> Other studies note that social skills are a stronger predictor of parenting stress than motor, communicative adaptive behavior or cognitive abilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811418230">7</xref></sup> Deficits in social reciprocity contribute to parenting stress which is not surprising since pro-social behavior minimizes maternal stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811418230">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811418230">24</xref></sup> Pro-social behaviors include behaviors that concern for the well-being of others, including empathy, helping behavior, and altruism. A lack of adaptive behavior skills is not a key determinant of parenting stress and is consistent with previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811418230">24</xref></sup> Maternal stress is increased when the symptoms, poor expression of feeling and emotion and little social interest are more severe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811418230">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Consistent with prior studies, these results indicated a motor impairment predicted less parenting stress, perhaps because children with motor delays are less mobile and therefore get into less mischief and are easier to control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811418230">22</xref></sup> It is also possible that since motor delay is common to many varied clinical presentations and is not an isolated delay that it is not as stressful. Parental stress does not appear to relate, the severity of a child’s health condition in cerebral palsy, spina bifida, or limb deficiencies, but is more closely associated with a child’s behavior and psychosocial development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811418230">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811418230">26</xref></sup> Yet context is important, since in children with cerebral palsy parenting stress correlates with the severity of the presentation and caregiver satisfaction with varying elements of the disclosure process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811418230">27</xref></sup> Long-term parental stress is associated with the child’s behavior problems and, less strongly, with dysfunctionality in daily life in children with hemiparesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811418230">28</xref></sup> Parenting stress is higher when children with cerebral palsy are more demanding and less adaptable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811418230">25</xref></sup> At a young age, children with motor delays are less likely to have stressful disruptive behavior.</p>
<p>Results from prior studies have established links between behavior problems and parenting stress in children with disabilities, but few have explicitly described the specific behaviors that predict parenting stress. In this study, parental experience of child-related stress was predicted by behavior problems, especially emotional reactivity, and withdrawn behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811418230">Table 2</xref>). Similar observations have been noted among economically disadvantaged preschoolers where children who rated high on emotionality had poorer receptive vocabulary skills. In this instance, parenting stress was related to children’s receptive and expressive vocabulary skills. Other studies have noted that children with delays most often differ from their nondelayed/normally developing peers in Social Withdrawal and Attention Problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811418230">29</xref></sup> The extent of a child’s behavior problems is a much stronger contributor to parenting stress than a child’s cognitive delay. The presence of child behavior problems when completing care-giving tasks is 1 of the most significant contributors to the level of parenting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811418230">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811418230">30</xref></sup> Children with problem behaviors, much more than the reality or degree of delay, account for the parents’ stress level, and caregivers are more likely to report maladaptive child behavior, especially aggression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811418230">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811418230">31</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>On the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-Oriented Scales Pervasive Developmental Problems and Oppositional Defiant Problems predicted parenting stress, underscoring the importance of pro-social behaviors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073811418230">Tables 3</xref> and 4). The Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1½–5, particularly the Withdrawn and Pervasive Developmental Problems scales, are useful to predict parenting stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073811418230">32</xref></sup> In young children with autism, parenting stress relates to autism severity, and as a child gets older, stress appears to relate more to behavior problems. Since behavior problems can escalate with time, especially with increasing cognitive and social demands, it is reasonable to anticipate that parenting stress will increase. In addition, in many situations parental risk factors predict a child’s disruptive behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0883073811418230">33</xref></sup> Some or all of these risk factors can be plausible causal factors and, if identified, can be treated or prevented.</p>
<p>Limitations pertaining to the data mitigate the results. First, this is a referred sample and no typically achieving control group is included for comparison. The use of questionnaires, although adequate for this explorative purpose, has some important methodological bias. Checklists are indirect measures of behavior and are subject to the potentially inaccurate perceptions of the rater/informant. Parental reports of stress is a subjective perception and future studies could use more objective measures of stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811418230">14</xref></sup> In addition, the small sample size limits the power of this study in exploring causal pathways. Therefore, future studies are needed to validate these findings and test the causal relationship between predictor variables and parenting stress, so effective health promotion initiatives can be developed. Furthermore, longitudinal studies could ascertain the impact of intervention on optimizing a child’s development, reducing problem behaviors and alleviating parenting stress. It follows that the cross-sectional design where observations are made at 1 point in time is a further limitation.</p>
<p>Parenting stress is a common observation during an initial neurodevelopmental assessment and needs to be taken into account by clinicians. Developmental delays and problem behaviors in young children predict this stress. The defiant uncooperative young child with sudden disruptive outbursts is especially stressful. Since parenting stress foreshadows future behavior problems, the information gathered about the parenting stress and its causes should guide further dialogue between the clinician and the parent. The Parenting Stress Index-Short Form allows a clinician to follow a parent’s lead in exploring the extent of the parental concern and the level of distress. However, instruments such as the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form are useful only if the information is used. Interventions for children with a neurodevelopmental disability will not be optimally effective if clinicians neglect parenting stress; there is need to work with families on strategies for coping with stress immediately.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811418230">16</xref></sup> Decreasing problem behaviors in children with global delay may lessen parenting stress and minimize the risk of future mental disorders for the child.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811418230">29</xref></sup>
