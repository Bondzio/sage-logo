<abstract>
<p>The impact of the cell surface roughness on titanium alloys used for biomedical implants has been extensively studied, whereas the dependency of human osteoblast viability on hydroxyapatite (HA) submicron and micron surface roughness has hitherto not yet been investigated in detail. Therefore, we investigate in this study the effect of HA substrates with different well-adjusted surface roughness on human osteoblast proliferation using the standard colorimetric reagent WST-1. By grinding, we obtained HA surfaces with six levels of well-defined surface roughness ranging from Sa = 3.36 µm down to 0.13 µm, resulting in hydrophilic contact angles from 11° to 27°. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray fluorescence measurements confirmed that neither grinding paper residues nor changes of the crystal structure were introduced to the HA substrates by the grinding process. By applying this simple surface treatment, we were able to isolate other effects from surface chemistry, crystal structure, and relative density. The changes of the osteoblast proliferation (WST-1 assay) on these different roughened HA surfaces after 7 days were found to be insignificant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), evaluated by one-way analysis of variance and Tuckey’s Multiple Comparison Method. The results of this study show that all roughened HA surfaces, regardless of the microtopography, are biocompatible and allow osteoblast attachment, proliferation, and collagen type I production. The comparison with surface roughness used for standard Ti-based implants yielded that for HA no finishing process is necessary to ensure a sound human osteoblast cell proliferation in vitro.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211426354" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Micropatterned and roughened ceramic surfaces are of great interest in biological and medical research fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211426354">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211426354">2</xref></sup> Compared to metals or polymers, the advantages of oxidic ceramics are their chemical resistance and inertness, high hardness, and temperature resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211426354">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211426354">4</xref></sup> The use of calcium phosphate ceramics in medical applications is very common due to the chemical similarities to biological apatite in bone or teeth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211426354">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211426354">6</xref></sup> One of these important apatites is hydroxyapatite (HA), which is used, for example, as a coating on titanium (Ti) implants or as bone replacing material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211426354">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211426354">8</xref></sup> The interface between cells and the implant surface exhibits a strong influence on the tissue response and the success of the incorporation of an implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211426354">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211426354">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211426354">11</xref></sup> Thereby, the interaction strongly depends on a variety of surface properties such as chemistry, free energy, and topography. The effect of the surface topography or in particular surface roughness, is thoroughly investigated for Ti. In most studies, osteoblasts and osteoblast-like cells prefer rougher Ti surfaces as compared to smoother ones by comparing roughnesses ranging from Ra = 0.60 µm to 5.70 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211426354">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211426354">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Osteoblast viability is indirectly assessable via various indications such as measured cell proliferation, cell attachment, cell spreading, and collagen type I or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production. A few studies correlated osteoblast or osteoblast-like cell viability to different HA surface roughness. Deligianni et al. investigated the influence of three different HA roughnesses (Ra = 0.73 µm; Ra = 2.86 µm; and Ra = 4.68 µm) on bone marrow stromal cells. The roughness of HA had no impact on the cell morphology or ALP activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211426354">17</xref></sup> Ball et al. found no significant differences in the ALP activity of osteoblasts on HA-coated implant materials by comparing roughnesses of Ra = 0.49 µm and Ra = 1.75 µm, but the cell shapes were different after 48 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211426354">18</xref></sup> From in vivo experiments with implant surfaces in bone tissue, Hayashi et al. reported no differences in interface shear strength of two different HA surfaces with roughnesses of Ra = 0.88 µm and Ra = 3.38 µm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211426354">19</xref></sup> In addition to the above-mentioned studies, we have used more levels of well-defined surface roughness and included cell proliferation quantification in order to assess impacts on cell behavior. Apart from the measured osteoblast proliferation via WST-1 assay, the expression of collagen I type was semiquantified. In this study, we focused on the hypothesis that HA roughness has an influence on osteoblast viability.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211426354"><title>Sample fabrication</title>
<p>Cylindrical plane samples were made of 1.1 g of commercially available calcium phosphate HA powder (HA, (Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>), Prod.-No. 04238, Lot: 8345A, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany). The powder had a primary particle size of 151 ± 0.235 nm (unimodal distribution) and a density of 3.03 ± 0.04 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The powder was uniaxially die-pressed using metal plungers and a hydraulic press (Weber Maschinen- und Apparatebau GmbH, Remshalden, Germany) applying a compressive force of 15 kN. The sample diameter was23 ± 0.1 mm with a thickness of 2.8 ± 0.2 mm. The die-pressed samples were sintered in a furnace (LHT08/17, Nabertherm GmbH, Lilienthal, Germany) at ambient conditions at 1200 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 50 K/h and a cooling rate of 100 K/h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211426354"><title>Fabrication of defined surface roughness</title>
<p>The sintered platelets were treated by silicon carbide (SiC) grinding papers (WS Flex, Hermes Abrasives Ltd., Virginia Beach, United States) to generate a controlled surface roughness. For the grinding process, the ceramic platelets were pressed manually on the rotating grinding paper for 45 s, with a rotation speed of 150 rpm (Phoenix Alpha, Buehler GmbH, Duesseldorf, Germany). During the treatment process, the position of the samples was varied to achieve a randomized surface texture. The treatment processes were truncated after selected stages to process samples with final grits of p80, p120, p180, p320, p600, and p4000. Water was used as a lubricant to remove the excessive material and to avoid a heating of the samples during the grinding process. After polishing, each platelet was washed three times for 5 min withdouble deionized water (Synergy®, Millipore, resistivity 18 MΩcm, Schwalbach, Germany) in an ultrasoniccleaner (1510 Bransonic®, Branson Ultraschall, Dietzenbach, Germany). After cleaning with double deionized water, all samples were dried atambient conditions and then sterilized at 180°C for2 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211426354"><title>Imaging of surface texture, measurement of surface roughness and surface area</title>
<p>Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images were taken at 20 kV (Camscan Series 2, Obducat CamScan Ltd., Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom). Prior to imaging, the samples were sputtered with gold (K550, Emitech, Judges Scientific plc, West Sussex, United Kingdom).</p>
<p>Imaging of surface texture, measurement of surface roughness and surface area was performed with an optical profilometer (Plµ2300, Sensofar, Terassa, Spain) with 420-folds magnification. Measurements in triplicate have been conducted on 15 ceramic samples for each treatment. The size of each single measurement area was 477 × 636 µm<sup>2</sup> and contained 442,368 measurement data points from which the average surface roughness Sa, the maximum heights of the surfaces Sz (from highest peak to lowest valley), and the surface area were calculated according to ISO25178. The arithmetical mean height of the surface (Sa) is defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0885328211426354">Equation (1)</xref> according to ISO25178-2, where <italic>A</italic> is the domain of definition and <italic>z</italic>(<italic>x,y</italic>) is the height of the surface at position <italic>x, y</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211426354">20</xref></sup>

</p>
<p>Apart from the height parameters Sa and Sz, a spacial parameter Str and hybrid parameters Sdq and Sdr have been evaluated. All 3D data analysis was performed using SensoMap Plus software (Sensofar) version 5.0.3.4995. A commercially available HA -coated dental implant (Tapered HA, Nobel BiocareTM, Yorba Linda, United States) and a commercially available standard Ti dental implant (Dentsply Friadent, Ankylos®) were measured as reference materials for the surface characterization. Here, the average surface roughness between two screw threads was measured on three different positions according to ISO25178. The surface curvature was compromised by the SensoMap Plus software. In addition, plastic coverslips (Thermanox®, Nalge NUNC, Rochester, New York, United States) generally used as cell culture substrate material were measured as a reference material.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0885328211426354"><title>Crystal structure analysis</title>
<p>X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD, C3000, Seifert, Ahrensburg, Germany) of sintered (1200°C) HA samples were made for all roughnesses to determine the crystal structure and monitoring possible changes in the crystal structure due to the grinding processes. Scans with 2 Theta ranging from 15° to 70° were taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211426354"><title>Detection of grinding wear residues</title>
<p>Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS, Camscan Series 2, Obducat CamScan Ltd., Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom) with a detection limit of about 0.1% of the elements mass was used to possible wear residues originating from the grinding papers. The measurements were taken on treated and sintered HA (p4000, 1200°C) for two different spots with an area of 27 × 17 µm<sup>2</sup> each.</p>
<p>X-ray Fluorescence analysis (XRF) was performed to detect residues, for example, Si from the grinding papers(detection limit of approximately 10 ppm). XRF measurement was carried out using a low pass filter andamain filter (0–40 keV, XL3t900 AnalytiCON Instruments GmbH, Rosbach, v.d. Hoehe, Germany). XRF was conducted on two different circular spots with an area of 7.1 mm<sup>2</sup> each. Prior to the EDS and XRF analysis, the samples were washed three times for 5 min in deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328211426354"><title>Density measurements</title>
<p>The density of non-sintered HA particles was measured by a helium pycnometry system (Accu Pyc 1330, Micromeritics, Aachen, Germany). Ten measurements were made and the relative density of the samples aftersintering was calculated by the geometrical approach, comparing theoretical and experimental (mass/geometrical volume) densities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328211426354"><title>Contact angle measurements</title>
<p>The contact angles (Θ) between sessile drops (20 µL) of double deionized water and the ceramic surfaces were measured on three samples for each roughness. As a reference material, Thermanox® was used. Side view images of the droplets were taken via an aligned (45°) mirror with a microscope (Axio Imager M.1, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena Germany). The contact angles were analyzed via Software ImageJ (version 1.39 u, National Institutes of Health, United States).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328211426354"><title>Cell culturing</title>
<p>Prior to the cell testing, all samples were rinsed with double deionized water containing 1% antibiotics/antimycotics and dried in air in ultraviolet light for 1 h. Human osteoblast cells (HOB, cryovial, Cat.-No.: 121 0311, Provitro GmbH, Berlin, Germany) with a doubling time of 120 h cultivated in their fourth culture generation for the in vitro testing. One sample was put into one polystyrene culturing dish (12-well multidish, Nalge NUNC, Rochester, New York, United States). Then the samples were fully immersed in 2 mL of complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) media with high glucose (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium) and stored at 37°C, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 94.5% relative humidity in an incubator (C200, Labotect Labor-Technik-Göttingen GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) for 30 min. The media contained 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotics/antimycotics. Afterward the media was removed with a sterile pipette and discarded. Approximately 8 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells, homogenously dispersed in 2 mL DMEM media, were added to each well containing the wet samples. The cells were incubated on the various substrates in the same incubator for a period of 7 days under static conditions. Sampling points were taken after 24 h (day 1), 72 h (day 3), and after 168 h (day 7).</p>
<p>As cell culture reference materials, plastic coverslips (Thermanox®) with a diameter of 15 mm were used. The cell-relevant chemicals were purchased from Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0885328211426354"><title>Cell proliferation measurements via WST-1 assay</title>
<p>The proliferation of the HOB cells was analyzed via a plate reader (Cameleon, HIDEX, Turku, Finland) using a colorimetric WST-1 assay (WST-1, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) for the nonradioactive quantification of the cell proliferation via the measurement of the formazan product in living cells. Supernatants were quantified spectrometrically (OD) at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 650 nm. Proliferation measurements of three samples of each roughness per sampling day were applied. The same volume of culture medium and cell proliferation reagent WST-1 was used in the experiment as a background control (absorbance of culture medium plus WST-1 in the absence of cells) for the plate reader.</p>
<p>Due to different sample sizes the measured proliferation values of Thermanox® were normalized to the sample area of the ceramic samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0885328211426354"><title>Cell imaging</title>
<p>Fluorescence staining of cell components was accomplished with different fluorescent dyes. Alexa Fluor® 488 Phalloidin was used for the cytoskeletons. 4′6′-Diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) was taken for the cell nuclei and mouse anti-human-collagen as primary antibody and conjugated anti-mouse-IgG (Alexa Fluor® 546) as secondary antibody was used for the specific collagen type I staining. Cells were observed and visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager M.1, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Imaging of three samples of each roughness was applied. The chemicals for cell staining were purchased from Invitrogen GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0885328211426354"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The statistical analysis was performed using the statistic software MiniTab 16. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Tukey’s Multiple Comparison test was performed. A <italic>p</italic> value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant for the comparison of the absorbance values from the proliferation measurement. Data are shown asmean values including standard deviation. In addition, the differences in average roughness (Sa) were evaluated by one-way ANOVA using Tukey’s Multiple Comparison test.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0885328211426354"><title>Surface texture</title>
<p>The grinding processes of HA with SiC grinding papers resulted in a range of micro andsubmicron roughnesses between Sa = 3.36 µm and Sa = 0.13 µm. Grinding with a grit of p80 resulted in a surface roughness of Sa = 3.36 ± 0.54 µm. The surface was matt finished with an apparent randomly grooved and craggy topography. A variety of depths having either rounded U-shaped or V-shaped profiles or cavities in the sample surface could be distinguished. Comparable results in surface texture were achieved with grits of p120, p180, and p320, but with less intense characteristics. Thereby, the treatment with p120 resulted in a surface roughness Sa = 1.41 ± 0.18 µm. With p180, a surface roughness of Sa = 0.92 ± 0.24 µm was achieved and grinding with p320 caused a surface roughness of Sa = 0.50 ± 0.10 µm. The grinding procedure with a grit of p600 resulted in a half-matt surface with a craggy topography and with U- and V- shaped profiles in the submicron range. Grooves were partially present on the surface but were smaller and less intensewhen compared to p320. A surface roughness Sa = 0.24 ± 0.05 µm was fabricated using a grid of p600. The polishing with p4000 resulted in a surface roughness Sa = 0.13 ± 0.03 µm. The surface was glossy with a very smooth topography. A few tiny grooves in the submicron range were visible. A small amount of defects was detectable on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211426354">Figure 1</xref>). The mean roughness values of our treated HA samples aresignificantly different from each other; with just one exception for p600 versus p4000 (Supporting data). The reference HA -coated Ti implant had an average roughness of Sa = 4.23 ± 0.28 µm. The reference standard Ti implant had a roughness of Sa = 2.06 ± 0.11 µm. Both implant surfaces were matt and rough. The reference material Thermanox® had a roughness level of Sa = 0.03 ± 0.00 µm and was shiny and transparent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211426354">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Diverse surface treatments or machining processes can result in similar roughness values, but exhibit different topographies and textures, which can affect cells during in vitro experiments. We focused on the hypothesis that HA submicron and micron roughness has an influence on osteoblast viability. For this study, we produced six different surface roughnesses on HA samples with a traditional grinding technique. In our tests, the surface roughness was evaluated using a 3D-area on the basis of the suggested guidelines for the topographic evaluation of implant surfaces advised by Wennerberg and Albrektsson.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211426354">21</xref></sup> The maximum height of the surface (Sz) was measured to account for the spread of the cells. The results clearly demonstrated that a reproducible and very homogenous fabrication of roughnesses between Sa = 3.36 ± 0.54 µm and Sa = 0.13 ± 0.03 µm was possible for HA. The same reproducible results were found for the maximum height of the surfaces ranging from Sz = 39.94 µm down to 5.05 µm. The fabricated average roughnesses (Sa) and as well the maximum heights (Sz) for the HA samples were comparable to the roughness of two analyzed commercially available dental implants. The reference HA-coated Tiimplant from Nobel BiocareTM (Sa = 4.23 µm/Sz = 36.41 µm) showed slightly higher surface roughness but similar maximum surface heights compared to the fabricated HA samples. The reference standard Ti implant from Dentsply Friadent (Sa = 2.06 µm/Sz = 24.46 µm) was in the range of the fabricated HA surface roughnesses and maximum surface heights, which emphasizes the relevance of the examined HA surface roughness levels. Comparing the surface area ratio (Sdr) of the two tested implant surfaces with the treated HA surfaces yields that the implants have a much higher surface area ratio of 56.5% and 43.6% compared to only 13.1% for HA treated with p80 grinding paper. This might be due to the fabrication or treatment process. Presumably, the commercially implants have been grit-blasted and/or acid-etched, which caused a larger surface area due to pores and cavities, and so on. The surface chemistry and the mechanical properties of the commercially available dental implants might also be different compared to the fabricated HA surfaces, but these properties were not of interest for this study.</p>
<p>As expected, an increase of the total surface area on HA was clearly measurable due to an increased surface roughness. An increased surface area means a larger contact area for the binding of important and relevant proteins, growth factors, or interaction with cells. The importance of proteins and growth factors for the adhesion of osteoblasts has been reviewed in detail by Anselme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211426354">22</xref></sup> Although the total surface area of the HA samples increased due to an increase of the surface roughness, no significant differences of the osteoblast cell proliferation (WST-1) or shape were detectable. Significant differences in the proliferation due to an increase of the real surface area comparing the smoothest surfaces (p4000) and the roughest surfaces (p80) are not expected. The differences in the real surface area are comparatively low regarding the cell size and the used size of the samples.</p>
<p>Contact angles were measured as an indication for surface wettability in our study. Contact angles of less than 30° were measured on all HA samples independently from the roughness. In tendency, the contact angles decreased in correlation to an increase of the surface roughness, indicating an increase of surface wettability and free surface energy. Schakenraad et al. reported wettability as one important factor for cell adhesion and proliferation of human fibroblasts on polymer materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211426354">23</xref></sup> The results of our study showed that all tested surfaces were clearly hydrophilic (Θ &lt; 90°). Significantly higher contact angles were measured on Thermanox®. Although the measured contact angles are slightly different from each other no significant influence on the cell behavior (e.g., cell proliferation or collagen type I production) is supposed due to very similar wettability. Prior each cell experiment, all samples were fully immersed in DMEM medium for 30 min directly before osteoblast cells were seeded onto the wet samples.</p>
<p>It has been reported that changes in the surface porosity and relative density of HA have influence on the metabolic activities, for example, ALP activity of rat bone marrow cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211426354">24</xref></sup> and that different crystal structures of calcium phosphate such as tricalcium phosphate (TCP) versus HA can alter the osteoblast-like cells response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211426354">25</xref></sup> Neither the crystal structure, however, nor the relative density was changing in our experiments. Thus, the influence of the relative density and crystal structure on the osteoblast cells should be identical for all HA samples.</p>
<p>After cleaning the treated HA samples in double deionized water, no particles or residues of the SiC papers were detected by XRF and EDS. This points out that no residues could influence the cell proliferation or morphology during the in vitro cell testing.</p>
<p>In our study, the osteoblasts showed flat and well-spread morphologies with lamellipodiae and filopodiae at their periphery on all treated samples at day 1. This indicates a good adhesion between the HA surfaces and the cells, but no influence of the different roughnesses onthe osteoblasts was detectable. Additionally, they showed clearly visible actin fibers (stress fibers) in the cytoskeleton, which is often associated with strong cell adhesion, but as the occurring processes are very complex, the role of these stress fibers in relation to adhesion is still not fully understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211426354">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211426354">34</xref></sup> The attachment and proliferation of the HOB was good on all treated HA surfaces. Collagen type I was produced after day 1. This indicates that the cells adapted to their environment and showed normal metabolic activity. No abnormal cell phenotypes like blebbed plasma membranes were detected, which would give an advice for low cell adhesion or even apoptotic mechanisms in the cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211426354">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211426354">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>A minor role of the surface roughness on the cell behavior and metabolic activity was demonstrated in the studies of Hayashi et al. and Ball et al. Hayashi et al. reported no differences in interface shear strength of a dense sintered HA surface with Ra = 0.88 µm and a rougher HA-coated Ti surface with Ra = 3.38 µm from in vivo experiment in bone tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211426354">19</xref></sup> Other results were found by Deligianni et al. They investigated the influence of three different roughnesses of HA (Ra = 0.73 µm; Ra = 2.86 µm; and Ra = 4.68 µm) fabricated via grinding papers of p180, p600, and p1200. The roughness of HA had no impact on the bone marrow stromal cells morphology or ALP activity. However, the proliferation after 14 days was higher on rougher HA as compared to smoother ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211426354">17</xref></sup> The higher proliferation is similar to our results with HOB after seven days in-vitro. A period of 7 days may be too short to detect significant differences in the proliferation of HOB on HA. This assumption is confirmed by the slightly higher (but statistically insignificant) proliferation values of both roughest HA surfaces (p80 and p120) at day 7. The measurement of the proliferation via WST-1 assay might also be not sensitive or specific enough to detect differences in osteoblast metabolism between the evaluated HA roughness levels. Ball et al. reported no significant differences in the ALP activity of osteoblasts after 48 h on HA-coated implant materials by comparing roughnesses of Ra = 1.75 µm (grit blasted) vs. Ra = 0.49 µm (treated p240). The cell shapes were different, but collagen type I appeared present and was similar on all samples after 7 days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211426354">18</xref></sup>, which is in agreement with our results. Engel et al. reported significant differences in osteoblast-like MG63 cell proliferation and differentiation on calcium-deficient HA (CDHA) with roughness of Ra = 3.4 µm and Ra = 1.7 µm. The cell number was significantly lower on the smoother CDHA surfaces compared to the rougher ones after 3, 7 and 14 days of proliferation in vitro. Interestingly the ALP activity and the osteocalcin production were significantly higher on the smoother CDHA surfaces compared to the rougher ones [38]. The differences in the cell proliferation comparing the two tested roughness values are contrary to our results, but might be caused by the slightly different composition of the CDHA samples to sintered HA samples. Furthermore the type of cells used by Engel et al. are tumorous osteoblast-like cells (MG63) which are expected showing different behavior compared to human osteoblast (HOB).</p>
<p>In contrast, our findings for osteoblasts grown on HA surfaces with various roughnesses are different to results made with osteoblasts or osteoblast-like cells grown on Ti surfaces. On Ti it is reported that osteoblasts prefer rougher surfaces to smoother ones. For example, Kunzler et al. reported a significant increase in the number of osteoblasts (RCO) by increasing surface roughness of Ti. Thereby, the cells were seeded on Ti with roughness gradients ranging from Ra = 1.12 µm to Ra = 5.70 µm. The osteoblasts morphology changed continuously following the gradient of roughness from smooth to rough. Boyan et al. reported a decrease of cell (FRC) number by increasing Ti surface roughness, but the ALP activity of the osteoblast-like cells was increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211426354">13</xref></sup> Schneider et al. and Bowers et al. found a higher mineralization ratio of osteoblasts (RCO) on sandblasted Ti compared to ground Ti.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211426354">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211426354">16</xref></sup> Mangano et al. reported a faster osteointegration by the differentiation of human dental pulp stem cells on laser sintered Ti(SLS) compared to acid-etched Ti surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211426354">8</xref></sup> Comparing these results for Ti surfaces from literature to our findings suggest that in contrast to Ti, the treatment of HA surfaces does not improve the cell proliferation (WST-1 assay) and collagen type I production of osteoblasts within the first 7 days.</p>

<sec id="sec26-0885328211426354" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this contribution, we studied the influence of various surface roughnesses on HOB proliferation (WST-1) for HA. Applying only a simple surface treatment technique allowed the effects of the surface roughness to be isolated from differences in surface chemistry, crystal structure, and relative density. The changes of the osteoblast proliferation (WST-1 assay) on these different roughened HA surfaces after 7 days were insignificant (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), evaluated by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Method. In contrast to findings for Ti, the changes in surface roughness of HA cannot be used to further enhance HOB proliferation (WST-1) and collagen type I production.</p>
