<p>This engaging and timely volume places the gender dynamics of the 2008 US elections on a solid foundation of history and cumulative research on American elections, women and gender in politics. The ascendance of Nancy Pelosi to Speaker of the House, Hillary Clinton’s historic bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination and Sarah Palin’s run as Vice-Presidential candidate have underscored the need for a second edition of this seminal volume to advance our understanding of gender and women in contemporary electoral politics. The volume goes beyond the role of women as political actors to explore the increasingly important role of gender in American elections. Taken together, the chapters demonstrate that gender shapes election outcomes, strategies, processes and the choices the electorate is presented with on Election Day.</p>
<p>This edited volume will be widely utilized in undergraduate and graduate courses on American Elections and Electoral Politics, Women and Politics and Gender Politics and Current Issues. The chapters are consistently well written and accessible and incorporate election facts and stories with pop culture references that will draw in readers. Intermittent text boxes highlight important themes that will generate class discussion. These contemporary references are rooted in careful histories of the role of women in American politics. The book is also a useful resource for scholars seeking a concise overview and key studies in specialized areas of women, gender and electoral politics studies.</p>
<p>Each chapter presents the state of our knowledge on a different aspect of women, gender and electoral politics in the US. Georgia Duerst-Lahti’s chapter builds theoretical foundations for subsequent chapters (and future research) by breaking down the subtle role of gender in presidential elections, insightfully depicting the masculine aspects of ‘presidential timber’ and the ways in which masculinity shapes political norms and traditions. The 2008 candidacies of Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton pervade Susan Carroll and Kelly Dittmar’s chapter. Gender stereotypes influence candidate strategies, and this chapter details the ways in which Clinton’s choices in overcoming stereotypes may have doomed her campaign in a year of change-oriented politics. Susan Macmanus covers the role of parties and women’s groups in mobilizing women to register, vote and participate in electoral politics. Moving from participation toward vote choice, Susan Carroll’s chapter traces the gender gap up to the 2008 election, presenting competing explanations and concluding that the gender gap has heightened women’s influence as voters.</p>
<p>However, this volume is careful to avoid treating women as a monolithic bloc, as evidenced in both Carroll’s chapter and in the chapters by Christine Marie Sierra and Wendy Smooth. Sierra draws attention to the important role of Latinas in American elections, as voters, activists and candidates for office. Smooth traces the historical role of African-American women in politics, and emphasizes the relatively high numbers of African-American women in office. Richard Fox’s chapter is similarly steeped in history, and emphasizes Congressional elections. Although past research reveals little gender bias among voters and donations, Fox turns our attention to important explanations for women’s under-representation among candidates and elected officials.</p>
<p>Examining the instrumental role of parties and women’s organizations in electoral politics, Barbara Burrell, importantly, draws out connections between parties and interest groups in promoting women for office. Dianne Bystrom concludes that although women and men present themselves in similar fashion in television commercials and websites, gender differences in media coverage of candidates persist in subtle ways. While most chapters cover national level elections, Kira Sanbonmatsu’s chapter delves into the gender dynamics of state-level elections. She details women’s successes in the 2008 elections across the American states, and points out the conditions under which women made the greatest strides – in the Democratic Party and in liberal states with professionalized legislatures and a greater share of women among the eligible pool of candidates.</p>
<p>The promise of an impressive line-up of scholars, each a leading figure in his or her sub-field, is backed up by solid chapters that dovetail on key aspects of the importance of context, history and the ever-dynamic nature of gender in American elections. As undergraduates around the world read this volume, there is no doubt that it will inspire some to pursue new research on these topics, and, for countless other students, previously invisible gender dynamics will stand out in future campaigns and elections, enriching our collective understanding of the democratic process.</p>
