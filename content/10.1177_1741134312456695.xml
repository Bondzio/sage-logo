<abstract>
<p>The importance of the pharmaceutical sector for Europe has been growing as it is essential for the health and well-being of its citizens to access innovative, safe and affordable medicines, particularly as its population ages. The 2009 sector inquiry of the European Commission into the pharmaceutical sector found that on average citizens waited more than 7 months after patent expiry for cheaper generic medicines, costing them and their health care systems 20% in extra spending. This article discusses to what extent the conduct of pharmaceutical companies and the agreements between originator and generic companies contribute to the delay of generic entry. The recent monitoring exercises by the Commission have revealed that although the total number of patent settlements has steadily increased in Europe in recent years, the potentially anticompetitive patent settlements (settlements leading to delay of generic entry with the presence of reverse payments and/or out-of-scope settlement terms) have generally decreased in Europe following the Commission's sector inquiry. Competition authorities should, however, remain vigilant and concerned about potentially anticompetitive practices leading to delay in generic entry. Moreover, further guidance will need to be developed by competition authorities and ultimately by the courts whether and under what circumstances patent settlement agreements that delay generic entry in return for a payment or other value transfer from the originator company constitute anticompetitive conducts.</p>

<body>
<p>The importance of the pharmaceutical sector for Europe has been growing as it is essential for the health and well-being of its citizens to access innovative, safe and affordable medicines, particularly as its population ages. Between 2007 and 2009 the average expenditure on medicines increased by approximately 6% notwithstanding that economic downturn and the austerity measures that followed in many EU member states. Overall, in 2010, the market for prescription and non-prescription medicines for human use in the EU was worth over €150 billion ex-factory and €220 billion at retail prices, which amounts to approximately 1.8% of the European Union’s annual GDP at that time.</p>
<p>In 2009 the European Commission had completed its sector inquiry (the ‘Inquiry’) and issued its final report on competition in the pharmaceutical sector (the ‘Report’). The Commission’s Inquiry has contributed significantly to the debate on European policy for pharmaceuticals, and in particular for generic medicines. On the basis of a sample of medicines that faced loss of exclusivity in the period 2000 to 2007 in 17 Member States, the Inquiry found that on average citizens waited more than 7 months after patent expiry for cheaper generic medicines, costing them 20% in extra spending.</p>
<p>The entry of cheaper generic medicines matters significantly as generic products are on average 40% cheaper 2 years after market entry in Europe compared to the originator drugs. Competition by generic products thus results in substantially lower prices for consumers and in turn the social security systems of the member states. The Inquiry has revealed that originator companies use a variety of practices to extend the commercial life of their products without generic entry for as long as possible. In the view of many, including the professional staff of the European Commission’s competition authority, DG Competition, some of these practices may well run afoul of antitrust rules, in particular, Articles 101 and 102 of the TFEU.</p>
<p>Besides pointing out to potential antitrust problems in the sector, the Commission’s Report has also highlighted the need to improve the regulatory framework. The Inquiry has found that there was an urgent need for the establishment of a Community patent and a unified specialised patent litigation system in Europe to reduce administrative burdens and uncertainty for companies. About 30% of patent court cases are conducted in parallel in several EU Member States, and in 11% of cases national courts reach conflicting judgements.</p>
<p>The Report has called for improvements on the pricing and reimbursement procedures of medicines. As a result, a review of the Transparency Directive was initiated presenting an opportunity, among other things, to clarify the scope of the Directive and to update its text in order to better reflect the relevant case law of the European Court of Justice, and to ensure the effectiveness of better time-limits. On March 1, 2012, the European Commission proposed a new Directive for public consultation to streamline and reduce the duration of national decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines. In the future, such decisions should be taken within 120 days for innovative medicines, as a rule, and for generic medicinal products within only 30, instead of 180 days today. The Commission also proposed strong enforcement measures in case the decisions do not comply with the time limits, as these are often exceeded by Member States. Overall, this new Directive represents an important simplification measure and shall repeal its predecessor enacted in 1989 as it no longer reflected the increased complexity of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in the Member States.</p>
<p>Equally noteworthy are the efforts made since the Inquiry in the area of a unitary patent, which the Commission supported whole-heartedly in the Report, aimed at improving innovation in all sectors. Efforts to establish a ‘Union patent’ and a unified European patent judiciary system had been going on for many years without much success, but recently significant progress has been made. Although presently not at EU Treaty level but within the framework of enhanced cooperation among 25 Member States, the proposed ‘EU patent package’ could soon come into force. It will consist of the unitary patent, a language regime and a unified patent court. Let us hope that the European Parliament and the European Council will soon endorse this package allowing the new regulation to enter into force.</p>
<p>The Commission’s Inquiry has also prompted or supported various initiatives of the European Patent Office to ensure a high quality standard of patents granted and to accelerate procedures (so called ‘raising the bar exercise’). These included, for example, measures taken in 2009 to limit the possibilities and time periods during which voluntary divisional patent applications can be filed.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has urged the EU Member States to significantly accelerate approval procedures for generic medicines, for example, the Commission believes that generic products should automatically and immediately receive pricing and reimbursement status where the originator drug already benefits from such status, which would allow for a faster product launch in certain cases. In the Commission’s view, the Member States should also take meaningful action if misleading information campaigns questioning the quality of generic medicines are detected in their territory, and they should streamline trials that test the added value of novel medicines.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the main focus of the Commission’s Inquiry was the behavior of companies, their relationships and dealings with each other. In particular, the Commission was very much, and still is, interested in further understanding to what extent the market players’ conduct and their agreements contribute to delays of generic entry. The originator companies use a variety of practices to extend the commercial life of their medicines at the detriment of competition from other originators and generic companies. The originator companies’ conduct and sometimes their agreements with generic companies can contribute to substantial delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>Strategy documents obtained by the DG Competition have confirmed that some originator companies seek to develop specific strategies to extend the breadth and duration of their patent protection. Filing numerous patent applications for the same medicine (forming so called ‘patent clusters’ or ‘patent thickets’) is a common practice. In one case, up to 90 patent families were found around the product, which on a European level translated into 1300 individual patents. Another tool used by originator companies that was identified is filing voluntary ‘divisional patent’ applications. Although these applications cannot extend the content of the original application or its protection period, they could in some circumstances significantly increase the legal uncertainties surrounding a possible entry.</p>
<p>In addition to the purchase of key IP rights, and sometimes the acquisition of the company itself owning the key IP rights, filing of ‘sham’ patents can be found in the tool box of some originator companies. While generally the issue whether or not the filing of a particular patent should be deemed ‘sham’ is best left for the patent offices and courts, competition authorities should not ignore evidence, which suggests that the sole purpose of acquiring patents was to limit the freedom of operation of competitors or where the company’s own experts considered the patents in question clearly invalid.</p>
<p>Patent litigation is often initiated against generic companies and in Europe on a national level it takes on average 2 years to resolve such litigation. If the litigation is coupled with injunctions against the generic product, generic market entry is delayed pending the case. It is interesting to note that in the large sample of the litigation cases examined in the Commission’s Inquiry, the generic companies have ultimately won in more than 60% of the litigation cases.</p>
<p>An important and frequently used practice that causes generic delay is a certain type of settlement agreements between the originator and generic companies which for the originator companies remove the risk presented by the potential entry of a generic competitor. Settlement agreements are commercial agreements between originator and generic companies to resolve patent-related disputes and their litigation. In some cases the originator companies may try to avert an invalidation of their patent by the court by agreeing with the generic company to have the latter withdraw its litigation claims and not enter the market in consideration for a value transfer by the originator to the generic company. In other cases the originator companies as plaintiffs commence the litigation and then resolve the dispute by providing a ‘reverse payment’ to the generic; i.e. some value transfer to the generic company in exchange for the generic company’s giving up or transferring its IP rights in question, or otherwise not pursuing its plans to enter as the originator’s generic competitor.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of such settlement agreements may contain terms that are deemed out-of-scope of the subject matter of the IP rights in dispute leading to further restriction of competition.</p>
<p>It must be emphasized that patent settlements are generally an efficient way of resolving patent disputes. As in any other area of commercial disagreement, the parties concerned have a legitimate interest in finding a mutually acceptable compromise for their disagreement. In particular, the parties may prefer to discontinue the dispute or litigation because it proves to be too costly, time-consuming and/or risky as regards its outcome. Such settlements do save considerable litigation costs for the parties and, equally importantly, provide legal certainty concerning the underlying issue often much sooner than the anticipated completion of the litigation with appeals. However, a clear downside of such agreements is that these settlements resolve disputes only between the litigating parties instead of <italic>erga omnes</italic>, which would be case for example upon the completion of a patent invalidity action. As a consequence, weak underlying patents held by originators are not removed, or their non-infringement by the generics is not established.</p>
<p>Taking into account the specific circumstances under which such settlement agreements are made, as a result of the settlement agreement the originator company will often be able to extend the period during which its branded product will not face generic entry. A part of the continued higher income derived from the absence of generic entry then can be shared by the originator company which in turn serves as an incentive to enter into the settlement agreement by the generic company. Conceptually, such value sharing may take many forms, from cash payments to advantageous licensing or distribution agreements with terms and conditions which otherwise would not have been attainable by the generic company but for its agreement to refrain from or delay its generic entry.</p>
<p>In such scenarios, while the terms of the settlement may well be a ‘win-win’ situation for both the originator and generic companies, the public purse of the national health care system and consumers continue to pay high prices for the single originator product.</p>
<p>Besides the foregoing patent tools and related litigation activities, after introducing a second generation product, originator companies often engage in intensive marketing and promotion strategies and use other practices in order to switch patients to the second generation product before the generic entry concerning the first generation product can take off. Where such a switch is successful, the generic product has little chance to capture a significant share of the market.</p>
<p>In order to market a generic product in the EU Member States, the product needs to obtain marketing authorisation, a reimbursement status and in some Member States a fixed price also. In order to determine all of these, some national authorities have limited ‘slots’ available for evaluation of each product. By occupying as many of such slots as possible through various subsidiaries with envisaged new products and their variations, originator companies may manage to block such slots for generics and thereby delay their regulatory procedure and thus also their market entry. It is also not excluded that the companies are willing to ‘trade’ such slots between themselves.</p>
<p>At different stages, the originator company may intervene in the regulatory procedures that are necessary for the generics to market their product with the effect of delaying generic market entry. For example, the originator company may claim safety issues, lacking bioequivalence or alleged patent infringements with the marketing, pricing, and/or reimbursement authority, which is not the main arbitrator/ governmental body entrusted with the adjudication of the specific issue raised.</p>
<p>Extensive patent filings, aggressive litigation tactics, settlement agreements causing delays of generic entry, lobbying, life-cycle strategies for follow-on products, and many other steps in the tool box which aim at protecting the significant income stream of the originator company’s blockbuster drug should not of course necessarily violate antitrust laws. However, since any delay in generic entry costs dearly to cash-strapped national health care systems, policy makers, legislators, antitrust authorities and the judiciary all should carefully consider whether or not to intervene when a specific conduct of private firms causes, or significantly contributes to, the delay of generic entry.</p>
<p>Two such specific conducts have been objected to by the European Commission in the <italic><underline>AstraZeneca</underline></italic> case,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741134312456695">1</xref></sup> which is currently on its second appeal before the European Court of Justice after the main points of the Commission's decision were confirmed by the General Court in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312456695">2</xref></sup> One of the conducts to which the Commission objected was AstraZeneca’s submission of misleading information, such as the wrong date of a product's first EU market launch, to the patent office in order to obtain a prolonged exclusivity (SPC/supplementary protection certificate). If successful, such practice by an originator company necessarily delays generic entry.</p>
<p>The second abuse found by the Commission and confirmed by the General Court concerned the deregistration and withdrawal of capsules of the first generation product from the market (being then replaced by tablets); these capsules were the required reference product for generic market authorisation and thus a <italic>sine qua non</italic> for generic entry. The General Court found that this conduct was designed to delay the marketing of generic products and to exclude generic competitors. The Court held that such conduct did not constitute ‘competition on the merits’ and it amounted to an unlawful abuse of dominant position.</p>
<p>Currently, the Commission is investigating with priority status several cases involving agreements between originator and generic companies, which will provide the Commission with the opportunity to develop and explain its analysis concretely as well as to provide further guidance to the public.</p>
<p>In its Report the Commission considered important to continue monitoring the patent settlements between originator and generic companies, and since its Inquiry the Commission has conducted three annual patent monitoring exercises and will likely continue them in the future.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the monitoring exercises are to further understand the use of this type of agreements in the EU and to identify those settlements that delay generic market entry to the detriment of the European consumers possibly in violation of European competition law.</p>
<p>These patent monitoring exercises so far have revealed that the total number of patent settlements has been steadily increasing in Europe due to primarily the increased number of settlement agreements under which generic entry was not delayed. The monitoring exercises have also revealed that the potentially anticompetitive patent settlements between originator and generic companies (i.e. settlements leading to delay of generic entry with the presence of reverse payments and/or out-of-scope settlement terms) have generally decreased in Europe following the Commission's Inquiry and the issuance of its Report.</p>
<p>Competition authorities should remain vigilant and concerned about potentially anticompetitive practices leading to delay in generic entry. Further guidance will need to be developed by competition authorities and ultimately by the courts whether and under what circumstances patent settlement agreements, which delay generic entry in return for a payment or other value transfer from the originator company constitute anticompetitive conducts, and whether these agreements have the object or the effect of restricting of competition.</p>
<p>Similarly to the <italic>AstraZeneca</italic> case where the Commission found that the originator company held a dominant position in the relevant product market, further guidance will also need to be developed as to which practices, and under what circumstances, on the part of an originator company may constitute an abuse of dominant position under Article 102 of the TFEU.</p>
