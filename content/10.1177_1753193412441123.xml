<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 76-year-old retired fisherman presented with three discrete ulcerating masses on the dorsum of the nondominant left hand of 6 month’s duration. He was immunosuppressed, having been using a steroid inhaler for over 1 year for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had also received chemotherapy 6 months earlier after right upper and middle lobectomies for adenocarcinoma of the lung. Surgical debridement was done and histopathology showed inflamed fibro-granulation tissue with epitheloid macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412441123">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> was identified and successfully treated with oral rifampicin 450 mg daily and ethambutol 800 mg daily for 6 months.</p>

<p>After about 18 months of uneventful follow-up, he presented again with a 2 week history of a nontender nodule 1 cm in diameter over the middle metacarpophalangeal joint of the left hand. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 28 mm/h, but C-reactive protein (CRP) titres were consistently &lt; 0.35 mg/dl and lymphocyte count was 1.90 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l. Serum total protein and albumin were 65 g/l and 39 g/l, respectively. The lesion was debrided and specimens sent for pathology and cultures. Although a smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was negative, histopathology revealed chronic inflammation that warranted the recommencement of rifampicin and ethambutol empirically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412441123">Figure 2</xref>). The AFB culture was positive for mycobacterium with susceptibility to clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, and linezolid, leading to a change in his treatment to clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily. <italic>Mycobacterium terrae</italic> complex was identified 6 weeks later. Due to frequent complaints of dizziness and bitterness of taste, clarithromycin was discontinued after 3 months and replaced with levofloxacin 300 mg daily for the subsequent 3 months. In the fourth month of treatment, ESR was 9 mm/h and CRP was &lt; 0.35 mg/dl. There has been no recurrence of swelling at 11 month’s follow-up.</p>

<p>Although recurrence of atypical mycobacterial infections has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412441123">Castell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412441123">Smith et al., 2000</xref>), it should not be assumed that another lesion at the site of a previous <italic>M. marinum</italic> infection is a recurrence until a microbiological diagnosis has been made. <italic>M. marinum</italic> is a slow-growing atypical mycobacterium that causes chronic skin infection due to exposure to contaminated water, manifesting clinically as papules, plaques, and nodules that may or may not ulcerate. Infections of deeper structures, such as the synovium and tendon sheath, can also commonly occur among those handling fish and after trauma, especially in immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412441123">Osorio et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>M. terrae</italic> complex is a group of three atypical slow-growing, nonchromogenic mycobacteria, <italic>M. triviale, M. nonchromogenicum</italic>, and <italic>M. terrae</italic>, which have now been linked to clinical infections involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, lymph nodes, skin, joints, and even disseminated infections. However, chronic tenosynovitis of the hand appears to be the most common presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412441123">Carbonara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412441123">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). Treatment includes a combination of surgical debridement and a wide range of systemic agents, such as macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, among others. Because there is presently no standardized regimen for choice of drug and treatment duration, clinicians and microbiologists are guided by the results of susceptibility testing and clinical response to treatment in choosing drugs for monotherapy or combination regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412441123">Osorio et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
