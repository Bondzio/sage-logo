<abstract>
<p>Malnutrition has lifelong and irreversible effects, especially when it occurs in the early stages of infancy. This study examined infants and young children feeding practices (IYCFPs) using the Child Feeding Index (CFI) in a sample of 232 children aged 0 to 24 months and their caregivers living in a rural Ugandan district. A cross-sectional design was used to collect data about the children’s weight and height and the feeding practices of their caregivers. Results show that caregivers’ IYCFPs were suboptimal. The majority of caregivers were biological mothers of the children (97%), but their practice of exclusive breastfeeding was low (34%). Most mothers initiated breastfeeding early (61%) but also introduced other feeds before the recommended time. Complementary feeding was characterized by early introduction of age-inappropriate feeds and inadequate feeding. The CFI showed that only 39% of children in the age group of 9 to 12 months and 9% of children in the age group of 12 to 24 months received the recommended number of meals in a day. Analysis of children’s nutritional status showed that 33% were stunted and 13% were underweight, and there were significant differences in nutrition outcome of the children according to their caregivers’ IYCFPs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Undernutrition is responsible for approximately 35% of deaths in children younger than 5 years worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412454166">1</xref></sup> and is one of the common factors that prevent children who survive from reaching their full developmental potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412454166">2</xref></sup> Government estimates show that malnutrition affects 40% of Ugandan children younger than 5 years of age and has led to stunting or underweight especially among those living in rural areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412454166">3</xref></sup> The causes of malnutrition in children are many and diverse, but it has been recognized that poor feeding practices by caregivers are a major contributing factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412454166">4</xref></sup> The feeding practices used by the child’s caregiver during the period from birth to 2 years of age are important because at this critical stage, essential physical and cognitive growth and development takes place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412454166">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Realization of the importance of feeding practices to the nutrition and health outcomes of children 0 to 2 years of age has led to a worldwide focus on strategies to promote appropriate feeding practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412454166">6</xref></sup> Currently, the World Health Organization and other international health agencies recommend that breastfeeding should be initiated within the first hour after delivery and that a mother should continue to exclusively breastfeed the child for the first 6 months after birth. After 6 months, it is recommended that the child should be fed on complementary feeds in addition to breastfeeding, and this practice should continue until the age of 24 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412454166">1</xref></sup> These recommendations have been adopted by government health authorities in many developing countries. However, national survey reports from countries such as Uganda continue to show that a large number of mothers do not initiate breastfeeding within the first hour of delivery and give their babies prelacteal feeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412454166">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Uganda, national statistics show that a large number of mothers with children 0 to 6 months old do not exclusively breastfeed (40%), 20% of children of age 6 to 9 months do not get timely complementary feeding, and 72% of children aged 6 to 23 months receive inadequate complementary feeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412454166">3</xref></sup> Similar trends of poor child feeding practices have been reported in Ethiopia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412454166">7</xref></sup> and in Limpopo province of South Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412454166">8</xref></sup> The International Baby Food Action Network report on infant and young child feeding practices in 33 countries located in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean also shows closely similar rates of noncompliance with infant and young child feeding recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412454166">6</xref></sup> One of the explanations for the low rates of compliance with the internationally recognized and recommended infants and young children feeding practices (IYCFPs) is lack of support for women in the health care facilities and communities where they live to help them carry out optimal child feeding practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412454166">6</xref></sup> The other factors include maternal death during or immediately after childbirth and the subsequent outcomes, such as children being taken care of by extended family members such as grandmothers who are not in a position to breastfeed the child and are more likely to use more traditional feeding practices.</p>
<p>Although the problem of lack of compliance with recommended IYCFPs has been reported about in developing countries, this has been mostly based on data collected from large hospitals in urban areas of these countries. The phenomenon has been understudied among children and children’s caregivers living in rural areas of developing countries. This knowledge gap needs to be bridged because studies of IYCFPs increase our understanding of critical behaviors related to outcomes of children’s nutrition, general well-being, and health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412454166">9</xref></sup> The critical behaviors and practices of child caregivers related to breastfeeding, dietary diversity, food frequency, and meal frequency affect health and developmental outcomes in young children. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine IYCFPs and associated nutrition outcomes in children aged 0 to 24 months living in a rural Ugandan district.</p>

<title>Methods and Procedures</title>
<p>A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from participants found in 232 households. The study was approved by the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology and was conducted in Luweero, a rural district located in Central Uganda. The sample for this study was acquired by obtaining a list of administrative divisions of the district from the District Authorities. The list was used to randomly select the counties and subcounties from which participants for the study were recruited. Two subcounties were randomly selected from each of the initially selected counties. In each subcounty, 2 parishes and subsequently villages were selected as the locales from which participants were recruited. In each village, a list of households was used to determine the sampling interval and households to be approached to participate in the study. Prior to approaching the household from where participants were enrolled, village leaders were requested to provide a list of households with children aged 0 to 24 months. The list, maintained by village leaders as part of the local government administration public records, was matched with the randomly selected households. In cases where the household that was randomly selected had no participants meeting the inclusion criteria, the next household was considered.</p>
<p>From the list provided, households with children of appropriate age (0-24 months) were identified and notified about the study. Households with children born with congenital abnormalities were excluded from the study. In each selected household, 1 child who met the inclusion criteria was included in the study. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: household with at least 1 child of age 0 to 24 months, biological mother or regular caregiver is available and consents to participate in the study, and caregiver consents to allow child’s measurements to be taken. On entry into each household, the mother or caregiver was provided an explanation about the purpose and procedures related to the study and signed the informed consent form before the child was screened for eligibility using the birth date listed on the child’s health card or a date provided verbally by the caregiver. A total of 232 caregiver-child pairs formed the sample for this study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1941406412454166">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Caregivers were interviewed using a questionnaire comprising a section on sociodemographic characteristics and Child Feeding Index (CFI). Data on intake of complementary foods was collected using a 24-hour recall and a 7 days’ food frequency questionnaire. In all households, the questionnaire on characteristics and practices was administered first, followed by the food frequency questionnaire and 24-hour recall questionnaire. After these procedures, the family felt comfortable enough for the child’s measurements to be taken. The child’s measurements taken were weight and length. The weight of children was measured using a UNICEF digital weighing scale (manufactured by SECA Company) and length using a UNICEF model height/length board (0.1 cm sensitivity).</p>

<sec id="section4-1941406412454166">
<title>Scoring of the CFI</title>
<p>The CFI is a composite index used for global assessment of IYCFPs and was developed in 2002 for use in developing countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412454166">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412454166"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412454166">11</xref></sup> The domains of the CFI are based on the current infant and young child feeding recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412454166">12</xref></sup> A score is generated for each of the 4 CFI domains (breastfeeding, dietary diversity, food frequency, and meal frequency). The CFI defines optimal feeding practices for 3 different age groups as follows: 6 to 9 months (breastfeeding plus gradual introduction of complementary foods); 9 to 12 months (similar to that for 6-9 months but increasing the amount and frequency of complementary feeding); and 12 to 24 months (continued breastfeeding for as long as possible, gradual transition to the family diet, and focus on dietary quality). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412454166">Table 1</xref>, each item of the CFI is scored by assigning a value of 0 for a potentially harmful practice and a score of 2 for a positive practice. The practices that are between potentially harmful and positive are scored as 1. The scores on each item were added to obtain scores for each domain. Within each age group, the CFI scores were grouped into terciles to form 3 categories of child feeding practices: low, average, and high.</p>

<title>Breastfeeding Practices and Types of Prelacteal Feeds Used by Caregivers</title>
<p>At the time of the interview, all caregivers reported that the child included in the study was delivered in a health care facility, and 65% of the mothers were still breastfeeding their children. The other results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1941406412454166">Table 3</xref> (pooled analysis) show that only 61% of the mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 hour after childbirth, whereas the others initiated breastfeeding after 1 hour (35%). The initiation period varied significantly with maternal age (χ<sup>2</sup> = 67.76; <italic>P</italic> = .00). The main reasons leading to failure to initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery were the following: insufficient milk production, maternal exhaustion from the childbirth process, and child-related factors such as sickness and inability to suck the breast. Although most caregivers (61%) initiated breastfeeding within 1 hour after delivery, a large number (32%) also gave their child other feeds such as home made sugar water, glucose water bought from drug stores, other fluid mixtures consisting of water with ghee, dry tea, or plain water. Only 34% of the children younger than 6 months of age were exclusively breastfed according to recommendations.</p>

<title>Complementary Feeding Practices</title>
<p>At the time of the study, the majority of the caregivers (94.4%) had started feeding their child with other feeds, and 57% started the complementary feeding before the recommended 6 months of age. The mean age at which complementary feeds were introduced to the child was 2.9 ± 0.8 months. The caregivers reported that they gave their children solid foods and fluids or semisolids such as plain milk, milk tea, dry tea, and porridge. Most caregivers did not take into consideration the age appropriateness of the feeds, and there was no proper transition time from liquids to semisolids and to solid feeds as recommended. The majority of the caregivers introduced solid foods at the age of 6 months, and the most commonly used complementary foods were maize porridge, millet porridge, and cassava flour porridge. Only 27% of the participants reported using millet porridge during the weaning period.</p>

<p>Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1941406412454166">Table 4</xref> show that children aged 6 to 9 months received more meals in a day compared with 12- to 24-month-old children. The proportion of children fed with animal protein–rich foods reduced with increasing age of the child. A larger number of caregivers (49%) reported that children aged 6 to 24 months were served food on their own plates, and only 26% received assistance with feeding from adults. The results show that the majority of the children in the age group of 9 to 12 months (94.4%) and 6 to 9 months (87%) had medium scores on the CFI. The majority of children in the age group of 12 to 24 months (68%) had low CFI scores, indicating poor IYCFP practices. The mean CFI score across all age groups was 3.63 ± 1.47, which also shows generally poor IYCFPs by caregivers included in the sample.</p>

<title>Feeding Practices Associated With Poor Nutrition Outcomes</title>
<p>The CFI scores of caregivers were analyzed to examine differences in nutrition outcomes of the children. Statistically significant differences in numbers of stunted children were found depending on aspects of feeding practices, such as duration of each episode of breastfeeding (χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.4; <italic>P</italic> = .04) and introduction of or failure to introduce complementary feeds after 6 months of age (χ<sup>2</sup> = 9.55; <italic>P</italic> = .008). Male children (35.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.8-45.0) were more affected by stunting than female children 30.6% (95% CI = 20.8 -40.4), and the mean LAZ was −1.36 ± 1.11. Despite the suboptimal IYCFPs, acute malnutrition (WLZ, &lt;−2 × <italic>z</italic> score and/or edema) rate was 2.2% (95% CI = 0.1-4.4). The mean WLZ score was −0.09 ± 0.96, and boys were more affected 3.2% (95% CI = −0.4 to 6.7) than girls 1.2% (95% CI = −1.1 to 3.6). The prevalence of underweight was 16.6% (95% CI = 7.2-17.5), whereas 9.8% (95% CI = 5.4-13.9) were moderately underweight and 3.8% (95% CI = 0.1-4.2) severely underweight. The mean WAZ was −0.78 ± 1.03 (standard deviation), and again male children were more likely to be underweight when compared with female children.</p>
<p>A significant difference was found in CFI scores for caregivers of children of different ages (χ<sup>2</sup> = 15.01; <italic>P</italic> = .005) and between LAZ of children cared for by caregivers using different modes of serving food (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.4; <italic>P</italic> = .029). The acronyms LAZ, WLZ, WAZ represent Length for Age z-score, Weight for Length z-score, Weight for Age z-score, respectively.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study used the CFI in a rural population of children and their caregivers. The results show that stunting was prevalent and common in children cared for by caregivers with inappropriate infant feeding practices. Other studies have also pointed out that feeding practices in rural areas have a significant impact on childhood nutrition status and growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412454166">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412454166">11</xref></sup> The growth faltering seen in this study was associated with poor breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices. The CFI scores of caregivers varied significantly according to the age of the child. The younger children (6-9 months) were more likely to be fed better than the older ones (12-24 months), and this may be because they are perceived to be very vulnerable or weak and therefore in need of more attention compared to older children who may be regarded as strong enough to feed on the adult diet and according to adult meal frequency. The results seem to suggest that in rural communities, there is still need for targeted interventions to promote appropriate IYCFP, discourage community dynamics that encourage poor infant feeding practices, and provide community-based support systems for caregivers responsible for feeding children in households.</p>
<p>In this study, the duration of each breastfeeding session was significantly linked to the nutritional status of the children. If a mother reported spending more than 30 minutes breastfeeding at each feed, the child was more likely to have good nutritional outcomes compared with a child who was breastfed for less time during each breastfeeding encounter. A good percentage of mothers (64%) were still breastfeeding at the time of the interview, but this number is still lower than ideal. Studies elsewhere indicate that greater proportions of mothers do breastfeed their children before the age of 24 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412454166">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412454166">14</xref></sup> The main reason for early cessation of breastfeeding was inadequate breast milk production. Teaching mothers strategies for maintaining adequate breast milk production is another opportunity that needs to be taken advantage of among mothers living in rural areas.</p>
<p>The breastfeeding initiation period varied significantly with maternal age, with older mothers aged 20 to 30 years more likely to initiate breastfeeding within the first hour. Reasons given for failure to breastfeed within 1 hour of child birth were again related to insufficient milk production and maternal or baby exhaustion. Similar trends were observed in another study conducted in western Uganda.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412454166">15</xref></sup> Mothers who delay breastfeeding initiation are more often those who are young, have given birth at times other than the evening hours (6-12 <sc>pm</sc>), and have not attended antenatal care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412454166">16</xref></sup> The literature also shows that infants of mothers who delay initiating breastfeeding from 1 hour to 7 days are at increased risk of neonatal mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412454166">17</xref></sup> and miss out on the other benefits of timely initiation of breastfeeding such as mother-newborn bonding. And for the mother, initiation of breastfeeding immediately after childbirth facilitates uterine contraction because of the stimulation from the baby sucking on the breast.</p>
<p>In this study, many mothers, after initiating breastfeeding within the first hour of delivery, went ahead to introduce other feeds within the first day. Such feeds are harmful to the baby,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412454166">18</xref></sup> and this finding portrays a significant lack of knowledge among mothers about the dangers of prelacteal feeds and the importance of initiating breastfeeding.</p>
<p>A study conducted in another African country also showed that mothers give fluids to their newborn babies to allow enough time for the breast milk to start flowing and because giving a liquid is perceived as having a cleansing effect for the baby’s intestines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412454166">7</xref></sup> Other studies conducted in Uganda found that 43% of the mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 hour of childbirth, and 1.3% did not try at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412454166">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412454166">15</xref></sup> The findings of this study and that of others entrench the need for more support for mothers to enable them to initiate and continue breastfeeding beyond the first hour or month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412454166">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412454166">19</xref></sup> This is especially important because most mothers and child caregivers have misconceptions about most aspects of infant and child feeding. For instance, breastfeeding on demand is a good practice that encourages the mother to breastfed whenever necessary. However, the practice of breastfeeding on demand is still a challenge to most caregivers in rural areas because of the heavy workload in agricultural fields and misconceptions. Some studies have found that a significant proportion of women understand on-demand feeding to mean feeding the child when he or she cries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412454166">20</xref></sup> This may lead to inadequate feeding of more passive children.</p>
<p>In this study, only 34% of the caregivers exclusively breastfed their children, and this number is below the national level of 60%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412454166">3</xref></sup> and that of more economically prosperous African countries (70% in South Africa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412454166">15</xref></sup> However, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in this study is higher than that in other African countries such as Ghana.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412454166">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The caregivers also started supplementary feeding at a much earlier age than recommended (mean age of introduction of complementary feeds = 2.9 months), and most of them gave their child solid foods before the age of 4 months. The reasons for early introduction of solid feeds found in this study are similar to those found in other studies and mainly point to the mother’s own perceptions that their child is not getting satisfied with breast milk alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412454166">8</xref></sup> The age of 4 months is considered to be very early because at this stage of life the gastrointestinal system cannot easily digest foods other than breast milk. Therefore, in rural areas, suboptimal IYCFPs are often worsened by early introduction of solid foods, which interferes with breastfeeding and the mother’s motivation to breastfeed her child. Introducing foods for a child younger than 6 months of age under unhygienic conditions also increases the risk of diarrheal diseases, and these have been noted to lead to pediatric morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412454166">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most of the children receiving semisolid feeds in this study were being given maize, millet, and cassava porridge almost daily or at least more than 3 days in a week. Therefore, traditional cereals and grains played an important role in the diet of many of the households sampled and were a major source of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Unfortunately, these foods have major deficits in micronutrients such as calcium, iron, and vitamin A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412454166">22</xref></sup> Nutritionally adequate complementary foods that can safely be introduced after a child attains 6 months of age such as eggs, soya flower, meat, and fish are very expensive to obtain in rural settings because caregivers mostly live in resource-poor households. This could be responsible for the findings that showed that irrespective of age group, children were fed on solid or semisolid foods for fewer than the recommended minimum number of times. Indeed, most children consumed only 0 to 2 food groups in a day. In other developing countries such as Madagascar, a drop in age was found to be associated with higher feeding frequency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412454166">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The meal frequency in a day observed in this study was below the recommended levels and could explain the levels of malnutrition. In general, the complementary feeds given were inadequate because of low quality and quantity. A component of active feeding (ie, who feeds the child) was also assessed, and it was found to be poor, with only a quarter of children receiving assistance from adults to feed. Households in rural communities tend to live as extended families, and this family structure can be used to support child feeding by involving available extended family members in active and responsive feeding of the child. Children who are fed responsively and actively are likely to be well nourished, and supervised feeding or helping a child to feed leads to better growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412454166">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412454166">24</xref></sup> In rural areas of Uganda, it is still possible to educate caregivers to enable them to take up the practice of responsive and active feeding for their children. The uptake of this practice and other optimal IYCFPs is likely to succeed because most child caregivers in rural settings work in informal sectors near the home and tend to have their meals at regular times of the day as a family.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The findings of this study show significant differences in IYCFPs among caregivers of children with good nutritional status and those affected by malnutrition. The majority of the caregivers in this study were not following the recommended IYCFPs, and as a result, malnutrition was common among their children. There is a need for regular nutritional surveillance for children 0 to 24 months of age, and interventions such as community health education, social support for caregivers, and the distribution of low-cost, ready-to-use foods for complementary feeding will enhance IYCFPs. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of each feeding practice on the nutritional status of the child, because considering all of them together could lead to loss of information that could be unique to each practice.</p>
