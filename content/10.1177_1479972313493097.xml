<abstract>
<p>Chronotropic incompetence (CI; failure to reach the targeted heart rate (HR) on exercise) and a delayed HR recovery (HRR; ≤12 beats decline within the first minute after cessation) reflect autonomic dysfunction (AD) and predict adverse cardiac prognosis. As chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known to be associated with AD, we hypothesized that these patients may manifest these responses on exercise. The prevalence and predictors of these responses in COPD and their association with its severity have not been evaluated. Normoxemic, stable male patients with COPD (<italic>n</italic> = 39) and 11 healthy controls underwent lung function testing and incremental leg ergometry. HR responses were monitored during exercise and recovery to compute the HRR and CI. Of all the patients, 33 (84.6%) had at least one of the two exercise responses as abnormal, with the majority (23, 58.9%) having both an abnormal HRR and CI. The frequency of abnormal responses increased with increasing Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stage and body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity index. After adjusting for smoking history and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second, only a reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide predicted abnormal HRR, though weakly. We concluded that abnormal HRR and CI are common in patients with COPD. These responses are observed with increasing frequency as the severity of disease increases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479972313493097">1</xref>
</sup> A probable cause of mortality is autonomic dysfunction (AD) that may predispose to arrhythmias.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972313493097">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479972313493097">3</xref>
</sup> Though there is a lack of direct evidence, AD predicts fatal cardiac events in diabetes mellitus, post-myocardial infarction state and heart failure<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479972313493097">4</xref>
</sup> and may play a similar role in COPD.</p>
<p>The rate of recovery of heart rate (HR) within the first minute after cessation of exercise, termed ‘heart rate recovery’ (HRR), reflects parasympathetic reactivation and an abnormally delayed (≤12 beats) decline implies its dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479972313493097">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493097">6</xref>
</sup> It has been shown to predict all-cause and cardiac mortality in population studies and in patients with cardiac disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493097">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479972313493097"/>

</sup> Though it has not been systematically investigated, a delayed HRR has been observed in studies on cardiac responses to exercise in COPD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479972313493097">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479972313493097">12</xref>
</sup> In a retrospective analysis, Lacasse et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479972313493097">13</xref>
</sup> found abnormal HRR to be associated with all-cause mortality in COPD. Chronotropic incompetence (CI), an attenuated HR response to exercise, is believed to represent an impaired sympathetic response and is another independent predictor of cardiac mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479972313493097">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493097"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479972313493097">16</xref>
</sup> It is also associated with atherosclerosis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479972313493097">17</xref>
</sup> and diastolic heart failure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479972313493097">18</xref>
</sup> In a recent retrospective study, it was observed that CI improved after lung volume reduction surgery in patients with COPD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479972313493097">19</xref>
</sup> A prospective study to document and characterize CI has not been carried out in COPD.</p>
<p>Stewart et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972313493097">2</xref>
</sup> demonstrated AD in patients with hypoxemic COPD, and later, we reported it even in normoxemic patients and in those with mild COPD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479972313493097">3</xref>
</sup> As both an abnormal HRR and CI reflect AD, we hypothesized that an abnormal HRR and CI may occur in COPD. Being established as independent predictors of cardiac mortality, these markers of AD may find application as risk stratification tools in COPD and therefore need to be characterized. The prevalence and predictors of these markers in COPD and their association with severity of the disease have not been evaluated. With these objectives, the present study was carried out.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted in an outpatient setting at the Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (New Delhi, India). It was approved by the Ethics Committee of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute (MD Pulmonary Medicine project 3/2008). A total of 39 stable patients with a clinical diagnosis of COPD based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479972313493097">20</xref>
</sup> were included after a written informed consent.</p>
<sec id="section3-1479972313493097">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>We intended to include patients with COPD due to their smoking habit. COPD in women in India is more often due to biomass fuel exposures than due to smoking and considering our hospital attendance patterns, it was felt that sufficient numbers of female smokers with COPD may not be found within the study period. Therefore, we selected only male patients with a history of smoking of ≥10 pack-years. Consecutive stable patients were screened for inclusion in the study. Patients with chronic respiratory failure (pulse oximetry saturation &lt; 90% and partial pressure of oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) &lt; 80 mm Hg with or without partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pa<sc>co</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) &gt; 45 mm Hg), recent acute exacerbation (in the previous 4 weeks), diabetes mellitus, evidence of any systemic disease including hypertension or coronary artery disease and any neurological disorder or musculoskeletal limitation that could prevent successful performance of leg ergometry were excluded. All the patients had been attending the outpatient clinic and were on treatment with inhaled long-acting beta agonists (LABAs, salmeterol/formoterol), tiotropium and corticosteroids according to severity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479972313493097">20</xref>
</sup> Eleven non-smoker healthy males in the matched age range and not known to have any chronic disease or any medication were included as controls from among the hospital staff and attendants of the patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1479972313493097">
<title>Initial assessment</title>
<p>After blood counts, routine biochemistry panel, plain chest radiograph (posteroanterior view) and a 12-lead standard electrocardiogram, the patients underwent lung function tests including spirometry and measurement of single-breath diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub>) and a 6-min walk test. Dyspnoea was graded according to the Modified Medical Research Council scale. The severity of COPD was staged according to the GOLD criteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479972313493097">20</xref>
</sup> Body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnoea and exercise capacity (BODE) index was calculated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479972313493097">21</xref>
</sup> The BODE index scores each of these components in an ordinal manner and a total composite score is calculated. As it is not scored on a ratio/interval scale, we did not use it as a continuous variable but divided the patients into two categories, above and below the 50th percentile; these were labelled as ‘low’ and ‘high’ BODE index groups, respectively.</p>
<p>Inhaled bronchodilators were withdrawn 24 hours before investigations but corticosteroids were allowed. Spirometry was performed on a dry rolling seal spirometer (Benchmark lung function equipment, P.K. Morgan, Kent, UK) according to current recommendations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479972313493097">22</xref>
</sup> DL<sub>CO</sub> was corrected for alveolar volume to obtain the Krogh’s constant (K<sub>CO</sub>). The 6-minute walk test was performed in accordance with the American Thoracic Society guidelines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479972313493097">23</xref>
</sup> The 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) was used to calculate the volume of oxygen consumed and the exercise workload to be applied. The maximum HR (MHR) on ergometry was calculated (MHR = 220 − age). The target HR (THR) was set at 80% of MHR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1479972313493097">
<title>Leg ergometry</title>
<p>After 4 hours post-prandial and a 30-minute rest, a 3-minute stepwise test of increasing intensity of exercise was performed by leg ergometry on a manually braked cycle (Rehab Trainer 881E, Monark Exercise AB, Sweden). It was supervised by the same operator Vishal Bansal. The patients were instructed to pedal at frequencies of 50–55 cycles/min. In this range, the cycle delivered a constant workload. This frequency was maintained throughout the exercise and in the cooling phase. The predicted maximal oxygen consumption (V<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) was calculated from the 6MWD and the workload to be applied was obtained from equivalent charts (Monark) available for cycle ergometer workload estimation. After a 3-minute warm-up period of unloaded pedalling (0 watts), the workload was increased to the calculated level and maintained for 3 minutes. If the THR was not achieved, the load was further increased in steps of 10 watts every 3 minutes until it was achieved or patient reported fatigue, chest pain or dyspnoea. At this point, the subject continued to pedal for 20 seconds to ensure maintenance of a constant HR (17: ± 5 beats per minute) in a steady state. This was followed by the recovery phase, where the load was removed and the patient continued unloaded pedalling to cool down for another 3 minutes. HR was recorded at baseline, throughout the exercise and during the cooling-down period on a Nellcor pulse oximeter (Model N 560, Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Pleasanton, California, USA). The HR recorded represented an average of last six beats. The HR was read off from the display at specific time points as required.</p>
<p>HRR was calculated as the difference between the HR at peak exercise and at first minute into the cooling period. A cut-off point of ≤12 beats was taken as an abnormal HRR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479972313493097">6</xref>
</sup> The utilization of HR reserve at peak exercise was expressed as the chronotropic response index (CRI)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479972313493097">15</xref>
</sup> and was calculated as follows: <inline-formula id="inline-formula1-1479972313493097">

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and Graph Pad Prism 4.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, California, USA) softwares. The data were examined for normality of distribution by Shapiro–Wilk’s test and for homogeneity of variance by Levene’s test. Data on continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD. Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic> test/Mann–Whitney’s <italic>U</italic> test was used for independent group comparisons. Comparison of data on continuous variables among multiple groups of patients was carried out by Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance. Chi-square test was used to compare the association between abnormal HRR and CI. Correlation analysis was carried out to determine Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Multiple logistic regression was carried out to identify significant predictors of HRR/CI after adjusting for other variables. Abnormal/normal HRR and presence/absence of CI were the dependent binary variables and age, pack-years of smoking, post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) percentage predicted, percentage predicted DL<sub>CO</sub> and percentage predicted K<sub>CO</sub> were the predictor variables. A two-tailed <italic>p</italic> value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We found that nearly 85% of normoxemic patients of COPD have either abnormal HRR or CI or both on exercise. These tended to occur together and were observed at all levels of severity, becoming more frequent with higher GOLD stages and significantly increasing with higher BODE index. Patients with abnormal HRR had greater airways obstruction and a lower diffusion capacity compared to those with a normal HRR. After adjusting for age, smoking history and airways obstruction, only a reduced diffusion capacity predicted an abnormal HRR, though weakly. No clinical or lung function parameter predictor of abnormal CI was identified.</p>
<p>The first minute rapid decline in HR following exercise-induced tachycardia is largely due to parasympathetic restoration and a slower decrease was first shown to mark an increased risk of mortality by Schwartz et al.<sup>

</sup> Though not specifically investigated in COPD, an abnormal HRR has been noted in studies on cardiac responses to exercise in such patients. Chick et al. observed prolonged tachycardia and delayed recovery after exercise that was independent of FEV<sub>1</sub>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479972313493097">11</xref>
</sup> In a retrospective analysis of data in a heterogeneous group of patients, including COPD, Seshadri et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479972313493097">12</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479972313493097">26</xref>
</sup> followed the HR decay after maximal cycling exercise to study metabolic factors affecting the recovery in patients with COPD and identified greater lactic acid production and/or hypoxaemia as being associated with slower recovery. These factors determine the recovery later on after exercise. They did not study autonomic mechanisms of recovery that operate almost exclusively in the first minute. There are no previous reports of CI in COPD. Multiple definitions and lack of standardized criteria likely account for the wide range in reported prevalence of CI in different disease states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479972313493097">27</xref>
</sup> The most often used criteria to diagnose CI is a failure to reach an arbitrary percentage (usually 80%) of the age-predicted maximal HR or a failure to attain 80% of the HR reserve from rest to peak exercise (CRI).<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479972313493097">2</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479972313493097">28</xref>
</sup> observed a mixed sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of HR in COPD. From our laboratory studies, we reported that both parasympathetic and sympathetic limbs of the cardiac autonomic control were affected even in patients without hypoxaemia and in mild COPD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479972313493097">3</xref>
</sup> In the present study, the observation of an abnormal HRR suggests parasympathetic dysfunction, while the findings of CI raise the possibility of an impaired sympathetic response. The present study also confirms our earlier observations that AD develops early in COPD and becomes more frequent as the disease advances. This is likely to be a significant complication as cardiac events may be responsible for mortality even in mild COPD.<sup>

<title>Possible mechanisms for observed cardiac responses</title>
<p>The underlying mechanisms of impaired cardiac autonomic control during exercise are not known. Sustained tachypnoea on exercise in patients with COPD<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479972313493097">11</xref>
</sup> may impair parasympathetic recovery, a response known to be enhanced by slower breathing. Reduced baroreflex sensitivity in COPD is associated with an impaired sympathetic response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1479972313493097">31</xref>
</sup> On the other hand, increased sympathetic activity has been shown at rest in COPD<sup>

</sup> that may counter parasympathetic restoration. However, we did not find any difference in the resting HR in patients and controls, and also between patients who had and did not have abnormal HRR and CI arguing against increased sympathetic activity at rest. Furthermore, Imai et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1479972313493097">34</xref>
</sup> have also shown that excessive sympathetic nervous system activity does not play a dominant role in immediate HRR. An incomplete washout of anti-cholinergic drugs is unlikely to explain the delayed parasympathetic restoration after exercise as these drugs were stopped 24 hour earlier. Whether there is any subsensitivity of cardiac muscarinic receptors in COPD that may explain the abnormal HRR is not known. Furthermore, as anticholinergic drugs will delay HRR by their pharmacological action, the cardiac safety of these drugs may be questioned. Indeed, this has been a subject of several investigations though the results have been inconclusive.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1479972313493097">35</xref> </sup>Recently, Kawasaki et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479972313493097">24</xref>
</sup> suggested that a post-synaptic downregulation of β-adrenergic receptors in the sino-atrial node following sympathetic activation may be responsible for CI in cardiac patients. We speculate that similar to COPD, regular use of LABAs may produce a downregulation of β-receptors resulting in CI.</p>

<sec id="section11-1479972313493097">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>Abnormal HRR and CI are well-known predictors of adverse cardiac prognosis. Although in recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of a significant cardiovascular risk in patients with COPD, the prevalence and predictors of these markers and their association with severity have not been evaluated in these patients. This is the first study to investigate these aspects of COPD. The study has identified markers that may be useful in risk stratification in COPD. Similar to their application in patients with coronary artery disease, abnormal HRR and CI may identify patients with COPD with increased risk of cardiac mortality. In view of lack of standard definitions and methods of computing CI,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479972313493097">27</xref>
</sup> we used a stricter definition as pointed out above to lend greater assurance to our observations.</p>
<p>The study is limited by being gender-specific; the reasons for non-inclusion of female subjects were explained above. Smoking itself may be a factor in causing AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1479972313493097">36</xref>
</sup> Comparison of responses in patients with non-smoking COPD is therefore required to determine the contribution of COPD itself. This was not part of our study design. It may, however, be pointed out that all the patients in the present study were ex-smokers. The only way autonomic balance can be directly evaluated is by measuring the HR variability. If we had also measured HR variability during and after exercise, it would provide direct evidence of autonomic imbalance on exercise. Finally, the clinical implications are only hypothetical. The present study was cross-sectional in design and, therefore, outcome measures such as mortality or arrhythmias could not be built into the protocol. These need confirmation in a longitudinal study.</p>
<p>Factors such as exercise levels, medication, cardiovascular fitness, neuromuscular limitations and exercise modality may also modulate the chronotropic response and thus the observed CI may not necessarily represent sympathetic dysfunction. It is important to take into account the patient’s level of effort and reasons for terminating the exercise test before concluding that a patient has CI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479972313493097">27</xref>
</sup> The respiratory exchange ratio is a more definitive and objective measure of physiological level of effort and may have provided a more definite confirmation of maximal exercise. Symptom-limited exercise also, however, ensures reasonably that maximal levels are reached. Thus, it is likely that inadequate metabolic activity was the cause of a reduced chronotropic response. Another important factor is the method of exercise. A treadmill exercise may allow achievement of higher HRs than a bicycle ergometry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1479972313493097">37</xref>
</sup> Several drugs such as beta agonists and theophyllines can confound the HR responses to exercise. However, inhaled beta agonists were withdrawn 24 hours before the test and none of the patients were on theophyllines or any other cardioactive drugs. Previous exercise habits and neuromuscular limitations may modulate the HR response to exercise. These were not objectively recorded. Ventilatory limitation may cause a premature stoppage of exercise and thus prevent the target HR from being achieved. It is now well established that dyspnoea on exercise in patients with COPD is related to dynamic hyperinflation and is the main reason for termination of exercise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1479972313493097">38</xref>
</sup> In most of our patients, dyspnoea was not the reason for stopping exercise. Thus, it can be inferred that exercise was not stopped due to ventilator limitations and lung mechanics alterations during exercise. In view of the above limitations, our observations on CI may be considered as preliminary and require confirmation.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>To conclude, abnormal HRR and CI are observed during exercise in a majority of patients with COPD and tend to occur together. These occur even in early stages of the disease and increase in frequency with increasing GOLD-defined severity and the BODE index. Clinical and lung function parameters are poor predictors of these phenomena, with only a reduced diffusion capacity weakly predicting an abnormal HRR and no factor predicting CI. Therefore, their occurrence cannot be inferred and these need to be experimentally documented. As these indices of AD are established markers of poor cardiac prognosis, these measurements may find application as tools for risk stratification in COPD. The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these abnormalities are not known and can only be speculated. The long-term significance of these abnormal responses needs to be evaluated in longitudinal studies.</p>
