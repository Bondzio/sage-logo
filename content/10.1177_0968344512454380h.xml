<p>Attempting any answer to the question why the Red Army fought the way it did in the Second World War one must keep in mind the scale of such a question. The Soviet state was a multi-ethnic country of 15 constituent republics, some only recently incorporated into the union by means of brutal occupation and violent repression. Indeed Stalin’s tyranny and oppression were the basis of Soviet power, leading to some of the most murderous policies of the twentieth century. Accordingly one might well have concluded in June 1941, as Goebbels did, that the Soviet Union ‘would collapse like a house of cards’. Yet fight, sacrifice and die the Soviet people did and in their millions. Understanding why so many did – and why others did not – has seldom found better resonance than in Roger Reese’s astute new study.</p>
<p>As one may expect, the subject matter takes on a great deal and, while I cannot claim to have agreed with every contention and conclusion, Reese’s success is due in many ways to his ability to maintain credibility while painting with such a broad brush. The book puts to rest many of the wartime myths which first circulated in the German army and were later given far longer life in the first (and sometimes second) generation of eastern front histories. As Reese demonstrates, many of Stalin’s soldiers fought with varying degrees of conviction and were not simply motivated by the pistols of their commissars. Indeed exploring the military effectiveness of the Red Army is a central theme of the book, which Reese investigates thematically and at the Red Army’s nadir in the Winter War and in 1941. Such conceptual choices appear thoroughly appropriate, and Reese has strengthened his case with good statistical data and – aiding to the book’s readability – countless personal testimonies.</p>
<p>The early months of the war in 1941 are explored in two of the earliest chapters and focus on the great encirclements of 1941, when the Red Army was suffering many of its heaviest losses. These early battles form a critical platform for establishing the behaviour of Red Army soldiers. The surrender of hundreds of thousands of Soviet POWs Reese explains as something beyond superior German generalship or anti-Stalinist sentiments. Rather, Reese highlights the collapsing ‘<italic>efficiency</italic> in the Soviet military, which then led to localized situational failures in effectiveness’ (p. 309). In other words Soviet soldiers were responding to circumstances beyond their immediate control and were often not surrendering out of any lack of conviction. Nor were the adverse circumstances created solely by the Germans: many were inherent in the Red Army’s poor organization and inadequately trained officer corps. Indeed, as Reese illustrates, it was in many instances the determination of the average Red Army soldier that held the system together while changes and improvements were instituted.</p>
<p>Mobilizing Soviet society forms the third part of the book and highlights the wide spectrum of responses to the outbreak of war. Although less groundbreaking, here Reese effectively explodes the Soviet myth of a people united in opposition to Nazi Germany. Indeed where Reese shines is the many shades of grey he illuminates to draw a complex picture of motives which reflect the urban–rural divide as well as the many ethnic and national differences. Ideology, propaganda, discipline, hatred of the enemy, and what Reese calls the ‘fear factor’ form the key areas of investigation in chapters on motivation and morale. Again the picture is a complex one, which needs to be unravelled from numerous Soviet and German post-war depictions, but a number of conclusions can clearly be discerned. Punitive efforts to intimidate soldiers, including the widespread threat of the death penalty, did not effectively counter ill-discipline, and in fact contributed to low morale. Yet the evils of desertion, shirking, and self-inflicted wounds were often prefaced by overwhelming odds, inadequate training, poor leadership, and insufficient equipment. Clearly the Red Army’s military effectiveness was decisively influenced by the efficiency of the system that created and maintained the armed forces.</p>
<p>Russia’s female soldiers form the subject of the final two chapters, which provide an enlightening discussion that both adheres to and departs from the wider narrative of the male-dominated Red Army. Certainly, however, these women’s experience in the Second World War did not support the notion of a widespread reordering of gender roles according to the post-war socialist-feminist agenda. As Reese demonstrates, female soldiers often had to endure the hardship of war on top of official bias, discrimination, and sexual exploitation.</p>
<p><italic>Why Stalin’s Soldiers Fought</italic> provides the clearest and most accessible insight into the composite inner workings and motivations of the Red Army. It is a masterful work of deduction and analysis, which should stand as one of the most authoritative texts on the Red Army in the Second World War.</p>
