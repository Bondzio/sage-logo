<p>In May 2012, the unthinkable happened. Nearly 33 years after 6-year-old Etan Patz disappeared while walking to the school bus stop in his lower Manhattan neighborhood, a 51-year-old man stepped forward and claimed responsibility for murdering Etan. After three decades of dead ends and false leads, the New York Police Department believed it had its killer. This turning point, according to multiple news sources, should give a sense of “closure” to Etan’s parents, whose unanswered questions should be finally resolved. But Nancy Berns would caution against such proclamations. Berns, author of the thought-provoking and engaging book, <italic>Closure: The Rush to End Grief and What It Costs Us</italic>, argues that “closure” is a highly problematic concept, one that teases the bereaved with the false promise that their pain will someday end, and life will go back to “normal.” As Berns astutely observes, the bereaved “do not need to ‘close’ pain in order to live life again.”</p>
<p>Berns’ thesis is that “closure” is neither possible nor desirable. Although bereaved persons may hope that their pain will eventually subside, they do not want their memories of the decedent to subside as well. Berns knows of what she writes. As she frankly acknowledges in the preface, her son was stillborn in 2001. As she grappled with the devastating loss, she found herself further saddened when a well-meaning friend told her “someday this will just be a memory” and encouraged her to “move on” (p. ix). These insensitive words triggered, in part, Berns’ writing of this book. Yet <italic>Closure</italic> is not a personal narrative; it is a well-researched, theoretically-guided cultural analysis and critique of a new and socially-constructed emotion. Drawing from social constructionist perspectives on emotion, and Arlie Hochschild’s writings on “feeling rules,” Berns explores “how and why the idea of closure jumped from a relatively unknown research term to a new emotional state that people are seeking or telling others to find” (p. 3). She draws on a range of fascinating resources, including empirical studies, court documents, popular media, and quirky websites including those selling huggable “Teddy Bear Cremation Urns” and “wedding ring coffins.”</p>
<p>Berns traces the history of the concept back to 1920s Gestalt pioneer Max Wertheimer, who used the term to explain the cognitive processes where our brains “fill in the gaps” when presented with incomplete information. Social psychologists in the 1990s wrote about the “need for closure,” which refers to one’s preference for order and predictability rather than ambiguity and uncertainty. By the early twenty-first century, psychologists used the term to describe the coping tactics used after the September 11, 2001 attacks, where “closure” referred to the process of adapting psychologically to trauma, moving forward, and reaching equanimity.</p>
<p>These three dissimilar uses of the term “closure” underscore a key point of Berns’ thesis: if closure does exist, it is a multi-faceted construct. Berns describes six types of “closure talk,” each of which seeks to “close” a different source of discomfort. “Closing a chapter” refers to finishing a task or ritual to help one get through a loss, such as viewing the decedent’s body. “Remembering” is the point at which one no longer fears forgetting the lost love. “Forgetting” involves erasing the reminders that cause pain, such as burning love letters from one’s ex-spouse. “Getting even” is a strategy for ending the injustice or anger that resulted from the loss, such as executing the person who killed one’s loved one. “Knowing” resolves unresolved questions, such as reading a suicide note. “Confessing” or “forgiving” is a strategy that resolves guilt or shame, such as apologizing to the aggrieved.</p>
<p>Each of these strategies is distinct, yet all are based on the assumptions that closure is desirable and necessary—grief is bad, and the pain of grief must end. After introducing the concept of closure and its subcomponents in the book’s first two chapters, Berns delves into six contexts in which closure is a dominant narrative of successful adaptation. Chapter Three focuses on grief and bereavement, and Berns questions whether there is a timetable for adjusting to loss. Chapter Four examines the death care industry and how it uses the concept of closure to encourage the bereaved to engage in pricy (if not outlandish) practices, like aerial burials, to commemorate the deceased. Chapter Five examines the ways that attorneys, private investigators, forensic experts, and even fortune tellers use the idea of closure to sell their services to the bereaved. Chapter Six is an amusing review of the businesses that help the dumped and divorced to achieve imaginary vengeance (e.g., ex-spouse voodoo dolls) or to celebrate the symbolic “death” of their failed relationship. Chapter Seven is a fascinating analysis of how the concept of closure has been a powerful force in death penalty debates. Chapter Eight investigates the politics and culture of mourning, with particular attention to public memorials such as the one at Ground Zero, roadside accident memorials, and memorials for “the unborn” that add fuel to the abortion debate fire. In the concluding chapter, Berns recaps her critiques of the concept of closure, and suggests alternative narratives for thinking about, framing, and treating grief.</p>
<p>Berns’ arguments are compelling and backed up with sociological theory, data, and amusing anecdotes. Given the lively writing style, clear organization, lack of sociological jargon, and snappy synopses of current events and practices to achieve closure, this book will have great appeal to general audiences as well as undergraduates with limited backgrounds in sociology. <italic>Closure</italic> is perhaps best suited for graduate-level sociology courses on emotion, culture, or death and dying. Although some readers may quibble with the relatively light coverage of recent empirical work and theoretical developments regarding grief and coping, the book provides readers with sufficient background to understand Berns’ central thesis. The book’s real strength is showing how the socially-constructed emotion of closure has been commodified, and used to sell products and services to the bereaved—who may yearn desperately for anything that will dull their pain or resolve their unanswered questions. But as Berns concludes, there is no magic pill to make the pain of loss fade: “healing…may take a long time to find, and…no one particular ritual, product, service, or politician’s promise can guarantee closure” (p. 182).</p>
