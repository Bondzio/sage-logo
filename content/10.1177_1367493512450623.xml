            <p>This research aims to investigate the rate and nature of anxiety symptoms in a group of children and adolescents living with chronic illnesses in Jordan, and their relation to social desirability in a cultural sample not previously researched. Using the Revised Children’s Manifest Anxiety Scale (R-CMAS), anxiety and social desirability data were obtained from 114 children diagnosed with chronic illnesses and 162 healthy control participants. Based on children’s self-report, participants were categorized according to their adaptive style paradigm as either high anxious, low anxious, or repressor. It was proposed that children who score high on social desirability and low on anxiety are repressors. The prevalence of these categories was compared across the two groups. Anxiety was reported in 9.64 percent of the chronic illnesses and 12.34 percent of the healthy peers. Using the data obtained in the present study, the rate and nature of anxiety in children with chronic illnesses were lower for children in Jordan when compared to previous studies. However, social desirability values were similar to those established in Western societies suggesting a significantly higher percentage of children identified as repressors in children with long-term illnesses. These results supported the hypothesis regarding the relationship between social desirability and expressed anxiety symptoms.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Living with a long-term illness has long been considered a highly stressful and burdensome experience for children and their families. Such children have a three to four times higher risk of developing mental health disorders than those who are healthy (Benton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450623">2007</xref>). They are usually confronted with a variety of issues, some of which are separation from parents, restriction in activities, dependency, pain and deformity, threat of death, and absence from school (Pradhan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493512450623">2003</xref>). Earlier works on the impact of illness on children have reported a high prevalence of anxiety in approximately 33 percent of children with epilepsy (Caplan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512450623">2005</xref>), 20 percent in children with diabetes (Jacobson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493512450623">2002</xref>; Kovacs et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493512450623">1997</xref>) and 24.7 percent in children with asthma (Goodwin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493512450623">2005</xref>). However, this percentage varies depending on the categorical approach used in defining anxiety and study aim. Benton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450623">2007</xref>) reported that roughly 40 percent of the children living with sickle cell disease report manifestations of anxiety and depression symptoms, with the prevalence increasing in those with pain to 64 percent. Factors contributing to the variability in the prevalence of anxiety are many, and include the age and gender of the child, hospitalization status, and diagnosis (Wagner et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493512450623">2004</xref>). These issues also contribute to the difficulty in assessing anxiety in children. Other issues that are important when assessing for anxiety in this population include the measures (i.e. diagnostic interviews versus self-report measures) and inclusion criteria (clinical versus subclinical) employed.</p>
         <p>Whereas the evidence suggests that children with chronic illnesses have a higher incidence of psychosocial adaptation problems than children in the general population (Benton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450623">2007</xref>), other studies suggest that these children are coping well with their illnesses (Phipps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450623">2007</xref>; Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Therefore, while integrating previous anxiety studies in describing how children are impacted by a long-term illnesses, we should bear in mind the shortcomings of these studies and the cultural barriers which make generalization of these findings inappropriate at some points. For example, one of the greatest limitations to the use of self-report of psychological functioning, particularly in children and adolescents, is the influence of social desirability on the child’s willingness to endorse symptoms of psychological distress (Logan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450623">2008</xref>; Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Moreover, due to lower cognitive maturity levels, children and adolescents are typically more susceptible to social desirability influences than adults (Brown and Kodadek, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450623">1987</xref>; Logan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450623">2008</xref>). It is suggested that children who are strongly influenced by social desirability may deny negative thoughts and feelings in an effort to normalize their social world and/or to repress negative thoughts and feelings from their own awareness (Logan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450623">2008</xref>). However, it should be noted that studies suggesting that the utility of social desirability in the identification of repressors is limited are mostly based on anxiety self-report (Furnham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512450623">2002</xref>).</p>
         <p>New studies have suggested that repressive coping among children with long-term illnesses could be a pathway towards resilience, which comprises hardiness, self-enhancement, and the transient experience of positive emotion (Newman and Blackburn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512450623">2002</xref>; Phipps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450623">2007</xref>). It is suggested also that repressors downplay children’s state of anxiety so that they may appear more socially desirable (Furnham et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Such children are hypothesized to become strengthened by the challenge of illnesses simply by being positive and by making an effort to normalize their social world (Phipps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450623">2007</xref>; Rechner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493512450623">1990</xref>). This has been referred to in some literature as a multidimensional concept of resilience (Haase, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493512450623">2004</xref>; Haase et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493512450623">1999</xref>; Newman and Blackburn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512450623">2002</xref>), where the child maintains competent functioning despite an interfering emotionality (Newman and Blackburn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Therefore, resilient children are hypothesized to be better equipped to resist stress and to recover faster and more completely from traumatic events.</p>
         <p>The notion of repressive coping in children with low anxiety scores was helpful in explaining earlier reports that showed lower levels of anxiety and depression among children with long-term illnesses (e.g. Noll et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493512450623">1999</xref>; Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). These findings are interpreted to suggest that defensiveness behavior (e.g. social desirability) in children often limited the degree to which children can discuss their true feelings, and eventually lead children to adapt a repressive adaptation style. They further speculated that social desirability bias may be particularly potent when children complete self-report forms, as is typically the case in most psychological research. In evaluating the role of social desirability in adapting to a long-term illness, it is useful to examine the contrasts between the repressor and the non-defensive/low anxious groups since they differ only on social desirability. It is therefore possible that social desirability has a more important role to play in measuring anxiety in children. Also, the choice of measurement used in the previous studies for assessing the self reported level of anxiety can have an impact on what aspect of the emotional adjustment and coping style becomes prominent in the analyses. Therefore, further work is needed to be able to fully understand important issues in assessing anxiety in children with a long-term illness, and to provide interventions to those who are most likely to benefit. There are evident gaps and limitations in the literature regarding the experience of anxiety among children with chronic illness beside the limited knowledge and dearth of studies on anxiety among children with chronic illness in Jordan. We aim to investigate the rate and nature of anxiety symptoms in a group of children living with chronic illnesses in Jordan. We sought to test a primary hypothesis that children with chronic illnesses will show more anxiety than their healthy peers. A secondary, exploratory aim was to examine the relationships between anxiety symptoms and social desirability. We hypothesized that children whose response patterns are characterized by higher social desirability would self-report lower levels of anxiety. Finally, we sought to compare and contrast anxiety and social desirability in the two groups.</p>

            <title>Participants</title>
            <p>Two groups of children and adolescents aged between 7 and 16 years were invited to participate. The study included 114 children with chronic health conditions (e.g. diabetes, renal failure, cystic fibrosis, cancer and thalassemia), and 168 healthy peers. The response rate for the chronic illnesses group was 90 percent, while none of the healthy peers showed reluctance to participate.</p>

         <sec id="section4-1367493512450623">
            <title>Procedure</title>
            <p>Participants were recruited from four hospitals and eight schools. All procedures described in this report were approved by the IRB committee of the KHCC, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education. All participants were screened for eligibility based on the following criteria. The children were between 7 and 16 years of age, which is the age subgroup for the R-CMAS at which children can reliably and validly self-report their answers when given the opportunity to do so. The children in the chronic illnesses group were at least six months post diagnosis, and the parents of children in the healthy group confirmed that their child was in good health and not in treatment for any significant ongoing illness. Disease duration in the chronically ill children was six months minimum, as a chronic health condition can be described as one that lasts longer than 3–6 months (Knaus et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493512450623">1985</xref>). Exclusion criteria were children with cognitive impairment or a history of mental illnesses.</p>
            <p>The first researcher explained the study and obtained informed consent from the parents and children according to institutional guidelines. The information sheet was used to explain the study, and, if the parents agreed to participate, the parent was asked to sign a consent form. Parents and children with chronic illnesses consented to completing the questionnaires during the clinic visit, whereas children in the healthy group completed the questionnaires in their classroom after written informed consent had been obtained from both the parents and the children. Administration of the protocol was completed in one session lasting approximately 15 minutes.</p>

         <sec id="section5-1367493512450623">
            <title>Measure: the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (R-CMAS)</title>
            <p>The R-CMAS is a self-report inventory used to measure anxiety in children aged from 6 to 19 years for clinical purposes (diagnosis and treatment evaluation), as well as in educational settings and for research purposes (Reynolds and Richmond, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493512450623">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493512450623">1985</xref>). The scale includes 37 items of which 28 assess anxiety symptoms that are represented through three scales; psychological anxiety (10 items); worry/oversensitivity (11 items); and social concern/concentration (7 items). A fourth subscale is the lie scale (social desirability), composed of 9 items that measures two factors – the approval of desirable behaviours, and the denial of undesirable behaviours. The scale is an easily administered self report with a true/false format. The total score of anxiety scales ranges from 0 to 28, and an overall cut-off point of 19 can be used to identify children experiencing clinically significant levels of anxiety. For this study the three empirically derived anxiety subscales scores can be used to develop a hypothesis about the level and nature of anxiety that the child is experiencing. Utility of the Arabic-R-CMAS in terms of predicting a child’s anxiety level was supported by several studies. Several types of reliability and construct validity have been demonstrated with the Arabic translated version of R-CMAS for children in Jordan, where it was rigorously translated into Arabic and tested for validity and reliability. Cronbach’s alpha for the forward-backward version of the tool ranged from 0.79 for the pre-test to 0.81 for the post-test (Al Jabery and Arabiat, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493512450623">2011</xref>). However, a less acceptable value was obtained for Cronbach’s alpha for the chronically ill group (0.74) and their healthy peers (0.7) in the current study.</p>

         <title>Results</title>
         <p>The sample consisted of two groups of children and adolescents aged between 7 and 16 years were invited to participate. The first group of controls included 168 healthy children and adolescents. The second group included 114 children with chronic health conditions (e.g. renal failure (12.2%), cancer (51%), thalassemia (21%), diabetes and cystic fibrosis (15.8%). The mean length of time elapsed since diagnosis was 12.5 months (SD = 6 months) for children diagnosed with cancer, while for children with chronic renal failure and thalassemia it was 2.89 years (SD = 2.44) and 10.5 years (SD = 4.1) respectively.

            <italic>The first hypothesis:</italic> 
            <italic>children with chronic illnesses will show more anxiety than their healthy peers. </italic>To explore this, we used a score of 19 as the cut-off point on the raw anxiety subscale of the R-CMAS and it gave a prevalence of 9.64 percent (n = 11) for the chronically ill group. However, the prevalence rates for the healthy group was 12.34% (n = 20). The anxiety subscale scores ranged from 2 to 25 (mean = 13; SD = 30) for the chronically ill children, and from 1 to 24 for their healthy peers (mean = 13; SD = 26). There was no significant difference between the boys’ and girls’ scores (independent samples t-test, t = -1.098; 2-tailed <italic>p</italic> = 0.274). There was no correlation between age and R-CMAS scores (Pearson rank correlation coefficient = -0.018; <italic>p</italic> = 0.826). When analysed separately for each gender, R-CMAS scores did not differ significantly by group, either for the boys or for the girls. However, there were significant differences between the children with chronic illnesses and their healthy peers on the three subscales; the physiological factor (t = 8.636, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), worry/oversensitivity factor (t = 29.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and concentration factor (t = 159.772, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). The main significant post hoc comparison indicated that the healthy group reported significantly higher levels of anxiety on the worry/oversensitivity factor (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), while higher anxiety in both concentration (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and physiological factor (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) were found for the chronically ill children.</p>
         <p>
            <italic>The second hypothesis: children with chronic illness will score higher on social desirability than healthy children</italic>. The analysis of the 9 items of the lie scale (social desirability) showed that there was a significant difference (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003) between the two groups regarding social desirability, with the control group showing a lower mean score than the chronically ill children. The scores of the lie scale ranged from 0 to 9 for the chronic illness group (mean = 6.28; SD = 2.06), and for the healthy group from 4 to 9 (mean = 5.09; SD = 2.27). The median score was 7 for the chronic illness group compared to 5 for the healthy group. The scores were statistically significantly different between the two groups (t = 6.02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results suggested that healthy children score less on defensiveness measures. There was no significant difference between the scores of boys and that of girls for the total sample (independent samples t-test, mean = -0.58; 2-tailed <italic>p</italic> = 0.56). In addition, there was no significant difference on the R-CMAS scores for social desirability regarding gender among the control and chronically ill groups separately. However, there was a weak but significant inverse correlation between age and social desirability in children (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.213; <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). This suggests that the younger the age of the child, the higher the level of social desirability. When analyzing the two groups (control and the chronically ill) separately, only the healthy group yielded this significant correlation (r = 0.284, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). Importantly, the correlation coefficient, although statistically significant, is quite weak. All group means are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493512450623">Table 2</xref>. The groups differed significantly in social desirability (t = 6.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003). As predicted, post hoc tests revealed that chronically ill children (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014) obtained significantly higher social desirability scores than their healthy peers. Moreover, there were statistically significant differences between the chronic illness and healthy groups on the anxiety measure (t = 3.51,<italic> p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>

            <italic>The third hypothesis: children whose response patterns are characterized by higher social desirability would report lower levels of psychological distress on a self-report measure of anxiety</italic>. To examine this hypothesis, the correlations between the child-reported anxiety, and social desirability were examined using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. There was a significant inverse correlation between R-CMAS-total anxiety scores and the lie scale of the R-CMAS for the whole sample (correlation coefficient = 0.312, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between the RCMAS-total anxiety scores and social desirability for the chronic illnesses group (correlation coefficient = -0.328, <italic>p</italic> = 0.021) and the healthy control group (correlation coefficient = - 0.306, <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). When analyzed by gender, there was a significant inverse correlation between R-CMAS-total anxiety scores and the lie scale of the R-CMAS scores (correlation coefficient = -0.450, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) for girls. For boys, no significant correlation between R-CMAS-total anxiety scores and scores on the lie scale of the R-CMAS was established.</p>

      <sec id="section7-1367493512450623">
         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>The primary hypothesis of this study was not supported by the findings. Results show that children with chronic illness have lower levels of anxiety than healthy children. The mean scores for anxiety on the R-CMAS were lower than those in the control group, indicating less anxiety symptoms for the chronically ill children when compared with their healthy peers. The prevalence of anxiety among children with chronic illness was 9.64 percent and 12.34 percent among the healthy group. These finding are also not consistent with the findings in the literature. In a study made in Gaza strip (in an adjacent country to Jordan) results showed a higher incidence of anxiety symptoms (21.5%, n = 51 children) among 237 Palestinian children using the same measure and cut-off point (Thabet and Vostanis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493512450623">1998</xref>). Also, a higher anxiety prevalence (21%) reported in a community survey carried out in the USA using the same measure and cut-off point (Kashani and Orvaschel,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493512450623">1990</xref>).</p>
         <p>The differences in the findings of this study and the majority of published studies from Western and some Arab societies are more likely related to differences in the inclusion criteria, as this study used a heterogeneous groups of chronically ill children, while other studies used homogenous samples, for example sickle cell disease (Benton et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493512450623">2007</xref>), diabetes, or epilepsy (Caplan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493512450623">2005</xref>). Also there are differences in the measures of anxiety used; while this study used the R-CMAS, other studies used state and trait anxiety scales and other measures of social desirability.</p>
         <p>When looking at the conceptual meaning of the various subscales of the R-CMAS, results show the healthy group reported higher levels of anxiety on the worry/oversensitivity factor (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). This would suggest that children in the healthy group internalize their experiences of anxiety, and eventually may feel overwhelmed. While higher anxiety in both concentration (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and physiological factor (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) among the chronically ill children indicate physiological signs of anxiety (e.g. sweaty hands, stomach aches). The findings also show that the social desirability values measured by the lie scale of the R-CMAS were inversely related to the self-reported anxiety of the chronically ill children and their healthy peers. This supports our hypothesis and suggests that children with chronic illnesses are prone to repress their anxieties. In almost every analysis, repressors were significantly different from the non-defensive/high anxious group (Logan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493512450623">2008</xref>). These results can suggest also that the chronically ill children are more likely to be alert to physical signs of anxiety which make them feel that they are unable to meet the expectations of other important people, and so feel inadequate and unable to concentrate on tasks. The response of these children is to become more self reliant by repressing their feelings and behaving in a more socially desirable manner. It is possible that the low self-reports for anxiety for the chronic illness group may be a valid reflection of children’s resilience and coping. (Phipps, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493512450623">2007</xref>).</p>
         <p>However, the results regarding low-reported anxiety in the chronically ill children are somewhat more difficult to interpret. First, it is difficult to compare the results against the many studies cited in the literature review, which used different measures for anxiety prevalence and different inclusion criteria. Second, when interpreting self-reports it is important to take into account the tendency of children to give highly desirable answers. Therefore, a question is raised here of whether the comparison of the scores of the R-CMAS for children with chronic illnesses against the results of their healthy peers is a valid reflection of the children’s anxiety. It can be argued that despite the possible sources of bias, it is possible that the low self-reports for anxiety for the chronic illness group may be a valid reflection of children’s resilience and coping. The lower levels of anxiety in children with chronic illnesses when compared to healthy peers found in some studies have been explained as a reflection of the low-end specificity problem of the assessment tools (e.g. Canning et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512450623">1992</xref>; Phipps and Srivastava, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450623">1997</xref>; Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>; Worchel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493512450623">1988</xref>). Thus, it can be assumed that anxiety self-reports are biased in some way toward the minimization of distress (Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Briefly describing the argument on this point, Canning et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493512450623">1992</xref>), Phipps and Srivastava (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493512450623">1997</xref>) and Phipps and Steele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>) assumed that defensiveness and selective reporting may explain low scores for anxiety when children with a long-term illness hiding their true feelings and pretending normality. These results suggest that a shift toward increased defensiveness, and repressive adaptation may be a general characteristic of children with chronic illnesses. It can be assumed that some children with long-term illnesses may have actively excluded pre-morbid symptomatology from their responses. Thus, selective reporting may result in some symptomatology being excluded from the responses of children with chronic illnesses, whereas the controls report more completely.</p>
         <p>Selective reporting and response-shift may also affect the degree to which scores for children with chronic illnesses are comparable to the children in the healthy group. If selective reporting affects the results as suggested, anxiety may be underestimated for children with chronic illnesses. This makes simple comparisons between groups conceptually invalid. The scores of children with chronic illnesses will appear artificially low because of repressive adaptation. Based on these considerations, the validity of the common anxiety tools during long-term illnesses may be debatable. Therefore, the appropriateness of using the lie scales, which are commonly used for health research with children, needs to be defended. It is a point of controversy here whether the social desirability subscale of the R-CMAS is measuring defensiveness as a personality trait, or if these findings are an indicator of the lack of validity of the anxiety scale itself. Brown and Kodadek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493512450623">1987</xref>) reported that both age and cognitive development account for 53 percent of the variance in the lie scale score obtained by the R-CMAS, suggesting it is measuring something that is strongly influenced by development. The authors interpret these findings to support their hypothesis that children at a less mature stage of cognitive development would score more highly on a lie scale than would children at a more mature stage. Consistent with these findings, our results suggests that the younger the age of the child, the higher the level of social desirability. This is not to suggest that the social desirability subscale should not be used for children, only to urge consideration of their limitations. Efforts to insure reliable and valid self-report measures may help to yield more valid reports of psychological functioning from these children and adolescents.</p>

      <sec id="section8-1367493512450623">
         <title>Limitations</title>
         <p>A major limitation of the present study is mainly due to sampling difficulties, in particular the heterogeneous character of the sample and the fact that the sample was relatively small. In interpreting results and comparing with other studies, the sample characteristic in the current study is comparable to prior studies that used similar designs (e.g. Meijer and Sinnema, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493512450623">2000</xref>; Phipps and Steele, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493512450623">2002</xref>). Subgroup differences across the entire population of the chronic sample show no statistically significant differences, nor trends toward differences between children with cancer, children with chronic renal failure, children with thalassemia, and children with other chronic illness on measures of social desirability and anxiety. Consequently, these data were combined into a single chronically ill group for all subsequent analyses.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section9-1367493512450623">
         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>In conclusion, it would appear that the present study is limited by several methodological issues that should be noted and have been discussed earlier. However, the results from the present study would suggest the importance of monitoring affective symptoms in children and adolescents with chronic illnesses. Provision of information and referral to support groups involving other children and adolescents with chronic illnesses may be beneficial, and should be formally studied. Further investigation of these issues with a homogenous sample of children awaits later study. Finally, because the present study mainly examined social desirability scores in relation to the children’s anxiety levels, it would be of interest for future research to examine R-CMAS lie scale scores in relation to other criteria, such as proxy-reports of the children’s psychosocial functioning, for instance with parents reporting on their child’s psychosocial functioning.</p>
