<abstract>
<p>Although perceptions of ‘acceleration’ are common in everyday life, empirical studies are rare. We investigated Rosa’s theoretical framework of social acceleration in working life. Based on the framework and the concept of job demands in work and organizational psychology we developed a questionnaire that distinguishes between demands for technological acceleration, demands for the acceleration of social change, and demands for the acceleration of the pace of life. The results of two studies (in the fields of office work and aviation service work) confirmed the tripartite structure of the framework and delivered evidence that employees indeed perceive acceleration-related demands in working life.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961463X12471006"><title>Study background</title>
<p>Acceleration is a headline for a wide range of time-related phenomena, such as changes in using time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961463X12471006">Garhammer, 2002</xref>), accelerated production processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961463X12471006">Backhaus and Gruner, 1997</xref>), feelings of time pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961463X12471006">Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0961463X12471006">Szollos, 2009</xref>), and pleadings for more deceleration in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961463X12471006">Geißler, 1996</xref>). The sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0961463X12471006">Hartmut Rosa (1999, 2005, 2010</xref>) defines acceleration as the main characteristic of late capitalism. He combined different aspects of acceleration into one coherent framework and developed a structure with three distinct but related dimensions: (1) technological acceleration (i.e. the increase in new technologies); (2) acceleration of social change (i.e. a permanent change of social rules); and (3) acceleration of the pace of life (i.e. an increase in pace).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> argues that acceleration also appears in working life, expressed for instance through increasing levels of work intensity and feelings of time pressure. Such perceptions are also reflected in the last European Working Conditions Surveys (EWCS) where workers report working at high speed, to tight deadlines, under high pressure, and overtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0961463X12471006">Paoli and Merllié, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0961463X12471006">Parent-Thirion et al., 2007</xref>). Analyzing the EWCS and other survey data from the 1990s, Francis Green (e.g. 2001, 2004a) also observed an intensification of labor effort. He argued that technological and organizational changes are the main source for the intensification of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X12471006">Green, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although perceptions of acceleration seem to be quite common in working life, empirical evidence is largely missing. In this study, we investigate acceleration for the first time from the perspective of work and organizational psychology. We show that the phenomena of acceleration in working life are related to different <italic>demands</italic> placed on employees. We have developed a questionnaire based on the sociological framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>), combined with the concept of (job) demands in work and organizational psychology. The questionnaire will be used to test the theoretically proposed structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> and to deliver evidence for the perception of acceleration-related demands in working life.</p>
<sec id="sec2-0961463X12471006"><title>Changes of time structures</title>
<p>A number of current theoretical diagnoses of the development of society postulate rapid changes in the time structures of modern western societies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961463X12471006">Aggers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961463X12471006">Aubert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12471006">Beck, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X12471006">Giddens, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). A dynamization of societal processes is observable which leads to a break of the development of modernity. Conceptually this development is captured with subject headings like Second Modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961463X12471006">Giddens, 1990</xref>), Reflexive Modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12471006">Beck, 1992</xref>), or Late Modernity. The new aspect in these developments is not only the societal change, but the speed of these changes. The ever-shortening occurence of crises of the global economic system, expressed in the well-known headings dotcom-crisis (2000), housing crisis (2007), global financial crisis (2008), Euro crisis (2009), is only one of many examples indicating accelerated changes of societal and economic structures and processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> describes ‘social acceleration’ as the central characteristic of modern time structures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0961463X12471006">Tomlinson (2007)</xref> even describes acceleration as the guiding theme of modernity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961463X12471006"><title>The phenomenon of social acceleration</title>
<p>Since the main aim of our study is an empirical ‘test’ of the framework of social acceleration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0961463X12471006">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0961463X12471006">2010</xref>) in working life, we start with a short description of the theoretical concept. Rosa argues that the different phenomena of acceleration may be characterized by a three-dimensional structure. The first dimension, <italic>technological acceleration</italic> results from the targeted deployment of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). A direct consequence is an <italic>increase in the amount</italic> of technologies (more technologies are being developed), which forces employees to learn the new technologies. An indirect consequence is the <italic>increasing amount</italic> of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0961463X12471006">Moser et al., 2002</xref>) employees have to produce (e.g. for documentation) and receive (e.g. circulars, emails). Furthermore, the pace of information transmission has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961463X12471006">Heylighen, 2010</xref>), requiring employees to answer and forward information faster. Another consequence is a rapid change of hard- and software (increasing change rates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961463X12471006">Cascio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961463X12471006">Freyermuth, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The second dimension, <italic>acceleration of social change</italic>, describes the increasing speed at which formerly valid structures are changing, accompanied by a contraction of predictable time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). In the sense of a ‘shrinking present’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961463X12471006">Lübbe, 1998</xref>), the length of time periods in which one can expect relatively constant living conditions decreases. As a result, past experiences no longer form a reliable basis for decision-making. In working life, changes appear in the labor market which force people to actively shape their own individual biographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12471006">Beck, 1992</xref>). For example, people have to increase the amount of their knowledge, skills (lifelong learning) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961463X12471006">Lane, 1998</xref>), and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961463X12471006">Kalleberg et al., 1998</xref>). Within organizations, rules and guidelines also change with increasing pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0961463X12471006">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2007</xref>) due to an increasing rate of organizational change processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0961463X12471006">Mathews, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The third dimension, <italic>acceleration of the pace of life</italic>, refers to an increase in the number of actions and experiences per time unit due to increased speed or compression of actions and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). Breaks and downtime between work activities are reduced, and different actions now overlap within units of time (multitasking) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961463X12471006">Kenyon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0961463X12471006">Stoneman, 2007</xref>). Forced to increase their output, employees perform more tasks during one working day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961463X12471006">Green, 2004a</xref>), for example they carry out more administrative actions or serve more customers (increase in the amount). Moreover they have to work at a higher speed (increase in pace), whereas the time for breaks is decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0961463X12471006">Roberts, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Each phenomenon, as described above, is not only related to one of the three dimensions, the phenomena are also related to one of the three aspects that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> described: (1) an increase in the amount (output); (2) an increase in pace, which could also be described as a decrease in average times; and (3) an increase in change rates (changes happen more often).</p>
<p>The framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> offers the following propositions to investigate acceleration in working life: (1) acceleration is related to various demands in working life; (2) each of these acceleration-related demands relates to one of the three dimensions; and (3) each acceleration-related demand could be described either as an increase in amount or pace, or a change rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961463X12471006"><title>The concept of job demands in work and organizational psychology</title>
<p>Traditional job demands include aspects of the job such as time pressure and high workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961463X12471006">De Jonge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0961463X12471006">Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004</xref>). Some of the acceleration-related demands (e.g. increasing the number of tasks during one working day, increasing time pressure) could be described as increases in workload and/or time pressure. These acceleration-related demands could be defined as job demands in a narrower sense (e.g. see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref>). The acceleration-related demands – in contrast to traditional job demands – are constantly increasing; for example, time pressure increases and becomes chronic time pressure (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0961463X12471006">Szollos, 2009</xref>).

</table-wrap></p>
<p>The second type of demands occurs mainly because of changing labor market conditions such as the shift from industry to service, the rising number of highly qualified jobs, combined with the insecurity of staying in the current job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961463X12471006">Hellgren et al., 2008</xref>). Such circumstances lead to the necessity to develop individual skills, knowledge, and competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961463X12471006">Ducki, 1998</xref>). The necessity for individual development could also be described as a set of demands; demands which are not directly related to the job but to career development (dealing with new skills, more knowledge, and flexibility). We differentiated these demands from the concept of job demands and labelled them as <italic>career demands</italic>.</p>
<p>To sum up, we hypothesize that: (1) acceleration-related demands can be identified (based on the three-dimensional structure); (2) these demands are related to the aspects of increasing amount, pace, or change rates (i.e. through a dynamization of these demands); and (3) the demands manifest themselves in increasing (traditional) job and career demands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961463X12471006"><title>The empirical study</title>
<p>The key objective of the study is to confirm the three-dimensional structure of acceleration-related demands and to raise evidence on whether employees indeed perceive an acceleration in these demands. We first of all identified different acceleration-related demands and their relation to each dimension and aspect of the framework (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref>). Next, based on this outline, we developed items for a questionnaire.</p>
<p>We conducted two separate studies in two fields where we expected acceleration. The first (pilot) study (study 1) was conducted in the field of office work, where acceleration has an impact particularly due to an increasing amount of new information technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0961463X12471006">Parent-Thirion et al., 2007</xref>). The second study (study 2) was conducted in the field of service work, more precisely with flight attendants. Aviation service work in general serves as a typical example of modern service work with high job demands (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961463X12471006">Ballard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961463X12471006">Heuven and Bakker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0961463X12471006">MacDonald et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0961463X12471006">Whitelegg, 2007</xref>). As a 24/7 operation, today’s aviation industry exposes cabin crew members to a variety of job demands, such as ‘extended duty periods, highly variable schedules, frequent time zone changes, and increased passenger loads’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961463X12471006">Avers et al., 2009</xref>: i). In addition to increased workload, the dynamics of air traffic have led to several changes, such as the increasing number of flights on existing routes and the rise in service quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961463X12471006">Goll et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, several operational and institutional changes have been implemented as a response to 9/11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961463X12471006">Brown and Rantz, 2010</xref>), leaving flight attendants with the constant requirement to adjust to new rules and regulations. And the aviation industry in general is affected by numerous changes triggered by economic pressure, globalization and other acceleration-related transformations.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0961463X12471006"><title>Item pool development</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref> shows the implications on structure and content based on the framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> for the development of the item pool. To ensure that the theoretical considerations cover actual demands of working life, we organized two focus groups to discuss possible acceleration-related demands (e.g. dealing with technology, increases in time pressure, changes in career development).</p>
<p>In this first attempt to investigate acceleration in working life, we were interested in obtaining a wide range of individual perspectives. Therefore, the participants covered a wide range of working areas (not only white-collar office work, but also service work including nursing and IT).</p>
<p>Based on the recommendations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961463X12471006">Krueger (1998)</xref>, we organized two focus groups with six participants each. Personal experiences and perceptions of acceleration at work were discussed. The discussion was recorded (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0961463X12471006">Morgan, 1998</xref>). Each discussion statement which could be translated into a meaningful item was added into the framework structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref>). The results indicated that some acceleration-related demands are the same across different working fields, for example an increase in technological innovations. On the other hand, the participants reported demands specifically related to their own working area. For instance, a software developer told us that customers increasingly expect instant responses to their requests, whereas a nurse explained that she has less and less time to care for her patients. Thus, items dealing with general demands that are relevant to a number of different working areas were labeled <italic>core items</italic>. Items dealing with demands related to special fields were developed separately for each field and labeled <italic>specific items.</italic></p>

<sec id="sec8-0961463X12471006" sec-type="materials"><title>Material</title>
<p>The questionnaire contained all (N = 14) core items and those specific items (N = 11) developed for office work, in particular (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X12471006">Table 2</xref>). All items were further discussed with experienced white-collar office workers to ensure that the demands indeed occur in office work.

<p>To measure whether the employees perceive a change in their acceleration-related demands, we followed the approach by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0961463X12471006">Nolan et al. (1998)</xref> who asked their participants to indicate direction and degree of changes on a five-point Likert-Scale (<italic>has increased strongly</italic>, <italic>has increased</italic>, <italic>stayed about the same</italic>, <italic>has decreased</italic>, <italic>has decreased strongly</italic>). As a reference point for the evaluation of the changes, we chose a two-year span: <italic>Please compare your job conditions today with the conditions of two years ago.</italic> The two-year span was chosen because some developments, such as big changes in organizations (e.g. due to a joint venture), need time to fully develop. Otherwise, some developments take less time, such as a computer program update. Two years may be a good compromise for the perception of long-term, ongoing, and short-term, rather completed changes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961463X12471006" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>As all office workers had easy access to the Internet at their work places, the study was conducted as an online survey. An additional advantage of this approach was the possibility of increasing the convenience sample because the participants were invited to forward the link.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961463X12471006" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Three hundred and seventy employees participated in the survey. We excluded all persons who had worked at their current company for less than two years (N = 57 persons) (due to the two-year span we refer to in the questions). With regard to missing values, we decided to exclude all persons who answered less than 90 per cent of the questions (N = 123). This procedure is stricter than the suggestions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961463X12471006">Acock (2005)</xref> who recommend excluding all cases with less than 70 per cent of answers. The remaining 10 per cent of missing values were imputed using NORM 2.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0961463X12471006">Schafer, 2009</xref>). In total, this resulted in 190 completed questionnaires. Forty-one per cent of respondents were female and 59 per cent male, and their age ranged from 22 to 61 years (M = 43.77, SD = 8.92).</p>

<sec id="sec12-0961463X12471006"><title>Model test and item analyses</title>
<p>The first step should indicate the best fitting items, and the second should confirm the three-dimensional structure. We executed a series of confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using Mplus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0961463X12471006">Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0961463X12471006">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first CFA (model 1) included all items (N = 25) (for descriptive statistics see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X12471006">Table 2</xref>). The items were grouped according to the proposed 3-factor structure. The fit indices for the first CFA were unsatisfactory: χ<sup>2</sup> = 542.61, df = 274, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; χ<sup>2</sup>/df = 1.98, CFI = .75, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .07.</p>
<p>Accordingly, those items (N = 4) with the poorest loadings and the lowest item total correlation were excluded from further analyses (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X12471006">Table 2</xref>). A second CFA (model 2) with the remaining items showed an increase in the fit indices: χ<sup>2</sup> = 304.90, df = 167, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; χ<sup>2</sup>/df = 1.83, CFI = .85, RMSEA = .07, SRMR = .07. A model comparison showed, that model 1 and 2 differ significantly Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 237.71, Δdf = 107, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. The third CFA (model 3) allows correlations between the error terms of items which address related concepts. This modification improved the fit to the data χ<sup>2</sup> = 293.35, df = 166, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; χ<sup>2</sup>/df = 1.77, CFI = .86, RMSEA = .06, SRMR = .07 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961463X12471006">Figure 1</xref>). Also model 2 and model 3 differ significantly Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 11.55, Δdf = 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.
<fig id="fig1-0961463X12471006" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>CFA results for study 1 (white-collar office work).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961463X12471006-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>A one-factor solution (model 4) showed poorer fit indices in comparison to the third model χ<sup>2</sup> = 355.31, df = 170, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01; χ<sup>2</sup>/df = 2.09, CFI = .80, RMSEA = .08, SRMR = .07. Both models (model 3 and model 4) differ significantly Δχ<sup>2</sup> = 61.96, Δdf = 4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. The reliabilities for each scale showed acceptable Cronbach’s alphas: technological acceleration .67, acceleration of social change .75, and acceleration of the pace of life .77 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961463X12471006">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The model test and item analysis show that the data support a three-factor solution. The items are reliable indicators for acceleration-related demands belonging to one of the three dimensions.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961463X12471006"><title>Excluded items</title>
<p>The decision to exclude items was based on the results of the CFA (insignificant factor loadings) and the reliability analysis (values close to zero for the inter-item correlation) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X12471006">Moosbrugger and Kelava, 2008</xref>). Overall, the results of the analyses suggest the exclusion of five items. (1) ‘The number of training courses’: this item was found to be irrelevant, since standardized training courses seem to play an insignificant role for individual development, perhaps because people learn mainly on the job or use informal strategies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0961463X12471006">McCauley et al., 1994</xref>). (2) ‘Time to instruct new colleagues’: it appears that instructing new colleagues is less necessary than we expected. This is supported by the fact that (3) ‘staff changes’ was also a mediocre indicator for an acceleration-related demand. (4) The ‘time for job-related communication’ correlates less with the other items of the acceleration of the pace of life. It is possible that the participants cover such a wide range of office work that the role of communication varies between the fields. (5) The ‘<italic>number of phone calls per day</italic>’ was found to be field-specific; thus this item was also excluded in the main study.</p>

<p>(1) ‘<italic>The exchange of information</italic>’ was developed as a new core item dealing with consequences of technological development. (2) ‘<italic>The amount of technical knowledge required</italic>’ was included to better differentiate between soft skills (which was already an item in study 1) and technical knowledge. (3) ‘<italic>The time to make decisions</italic>’ was included to make the distinction between the two items ‘decisions without planning reliability’ and ‘time for decisions’ (study 1) clearer. The items (4) <italic>‘the feeling that I do not have enough time to finalize everything</italic>’ and (5) ‘<italic>the perception of time stress</italic>’ were developed to take the subjective feelings of time pressure into account.</p>
<p>The reformulation of the two items (‘<italic>the time period for which guidelines and rules are valid</italic>’ vs. ‘the frequency at which rules and guidelines are changed’ and ‘<italic>the average time employees are employed with the company</italic>’ vs. ‘the frequency at which staff members are changed’) was carried out to direct the focus more towards a time span than to a frequency of changes because we hoped that this would make it easier to answer the items.</p>
<p>Additionally, 12 new specific items were included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961463X12471006">Table 3</xref>). The entire questionnaire for study 2 consists of 16 core and 12 specific items (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961463X12471006">Table 3</xref>). All items were discussed and developed with two senior flight attendants currently working for an airline to ensure that the demands occur in their work and to adapt the items to field-specific circumstances. A similar response scale was used as in study 1 (<italic>has decreased strongly</italic>, <italic>has decreased</italic>, <italic>stayed about the same</italic>, <italic>has increased</italic>, <italic>has increased strongly</italic>).</p>
<p>In their feedback, participants from study 1 indicated that they perceive the two-year evaluation time span as inappropriate (e.g. some stated that their position had completely changed in the last two years). Therefore, we decided not to use a specific time span any longer and leave it up to the participants: ‘<italic>Please compare your demands today with the demands of some time ago</italic>’.</p>

<p>The second study was also conducted as an online survey. In addition, we provided a paper and pencil version since some flight attendants do not handle organizational processes from home via the Intranet. To provide the opportunity to fill in the questionnaire at work, a hardcopy version of the questionnaire was put in the personal post boxes of the flight attendants at the airport. To return the hardcopy questionnaires, the participants could use either a collection box at the airport or a Business Reply Mail envelope.</p>

One hundred and fifty-four flight attendants filled in the questionnaire online; 146 filled in the paper and pencil version (overall return rate: 19.5%). As in study 1, we excluded all persons who answered less than 90 per cent of the questions (N = 100) and imputed the missing values via NORM 2.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0961463X12471006">Schafer, 2009</xref>). Two hundred and seventy completed questionnaires could be used, with 84 per cent of respondents being female and 16 per cent male. Five per cent were aged between 18 and 25 years, 43 per cent between 26 and 35 years, 44 per cent between 36 and 45 years, and 8 per cent were older than 46 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0961463X12471006">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>As in study 1, the decision to exclude items was based on the results of the CFA (poor and insignificant factor loadings) and the reliability analysis (values close to zero for the inter-item correlation) (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0961463X12471006">Moosbrugger and Kelava, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>All four excluded items belonged to the ‘acceleration of social change’ scale (<italic>the number of standby services at home and at the airport; the average time employees are employed with the company;</italic> and <italic>the time between activation from stand-by service to the beginning of my service</italic>). These three specific items showed only very little variance. The fourth item (<italic>staff member changes</italic>) was a reformulated version of study 1, but the reformulation does not seem to improve the item. As discussed above (study 1), the item ‘changes among colleagues or supervisors’ did not vary across the sample.</p>

<sec id="sec21-0961463X12471006"><title>General discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to investigate the phenomenon of social acceleration from the perspective of work and organizational psychology. We aimed to confirm the tripartite structure of social acceleration as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> and to obtain empirical evidence for perceptions of acceleration-related demands in working life. We therefore formulated items that capture demands for technological acceleration, demands for the acceleration of social change, and demands for the acceleration of the pace of life. In designing the items we not only relied on Rosa’s theoretical framework but also conducted focus groups with employees from a wide range of working areas. The interpretation of the focus groups led to the formulation of core items dealing with general acceleration-related demands that are relevant to workers from different work settings and specific items dealing with demands related to special work settings. The newly developed questionnaire was tested in two separate fields of work: (1) office work and (2) aviation service work. The results of these studies supported the three-dimensional structure of social acceleration proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005</xref>) and showed that employees indeed experience social acceleration at work.</p>
<sec id="sec22-0961463X12471006"><title>Confirmation of the three-dimensional structure</title>
<p>The framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">2005</xref>) was confirmed in both study parts; the items are good predictors of the three dimensions due to significant factor loadings. The core items were significant predictors of the proposed dimensions in both working fields. Core items for technological acceleration contained indirect consequences of technologies, especially in the information and communication area. With regard to the acceleration of social change, the core items predominantly contained issues for individual development (e.g. amount of technical knowledge and soft skills) as well as dealing with changes in everyday life (e.g. the necessity to make decisions without planning reliability). A significant predictor of the acceleration of the pace of life is the core item ‘<italic>increasing pace of work</italic>’ in both studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0961463X12471006"><title>Perception of acceleration in working life</title>
<p>In both studies, the employees perceived an acceleration of their job and career demands. The office workers perceived the technological acceleration as the strongest out of all three dimensions. This could be explained with the strong influence of communication technologies on their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0961463X12471006">Perrons et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961463X12471006">Kaufman-Scarborough, 2006</xref>). For the flight attendants, the communication technologies (e.g. Intranet used to organize work schedules and pay slips) also have a great impact on their perception of technological acceleration, more than the technologies they use on board (e.g. technologies for on-board sales or the entertainment system). Technological changes are also discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961463X12471006">Green (2004b)</xref> as a main driver for work intensification. One may expect that these changes in the meantime affect practically all work sectors.</p>
<p>In both samples, the acceleration of social change was perceived as mediocre, whereby the office workers indicate higher perceptions of acceleration than the flight attendants. Both samples showed that the demands indicating the necessity for the people to develop their own career (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961463X12471006">Beck, 1992</xref>) were perceived as particularly accelerated.</p>
<p>The flight attendants perceived the change rates within the organization more strongly than changes on the labor market. One reason could be the recently implemented major reorganization within the airline, which focused on internal processes within the organization. Another reason may be the limited labor market in this working field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0961463X12471006">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The flight attendants also perceived the acceleration of the pace of life more strongly than the office workers. They state that the pace of work has accelerated and that they have less and less time to care for each passenger. Admittedly, they did not perceive that they were doing much overtime because their working hours are precisely scheduled. The office workers stated that their pace of work has accelerated and they perceive strong time pressure. Just like the flight attendants, they did not perceive a strong increase in overtime work, perhaps because the office workers in our sample still work regular working hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0961463X12471006"><title>Development of the questionnaire</title>
<sec id="sec25-0961463X12471006"><title>Identifying items</title>
<p>The item development was based on two core elements of Rosa’s framework: the three dimensions (technological acceleration, acceleration of social change, acceleration of the pace of life) and the three aspects (increase in amount, pace, and change rates). This attempt worked well for technological acceleration and acceleration of social change, but for the acceleration of the pace of life we found only demands related to two of three aspects (increase in amount and pace) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>One explanation could be the inherent high degree of formalization of our approach. Rosa did not systematically combine the two elements. The transfer to working life demonstrates the limitations of our theoretically assumed structure. Thus, we suggest using <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961463X12471006">Table 1</xref> mainly as a tool for item development and not as an inflexible grid which has to be completely filled with items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-0961463X12471006"><title>Core and specific items</title>
<p>The concept of specific items offers the advantage of considering area-specific demands. It was possible to investigate acceleration from a field-specific perspective. Other questionnaires were also developed for specific areas such as the German language surveys to investigate regulation requirements at work (RIHA) for office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0961463X12471006">Leitner et al., 1993</xref>) and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0961463X12471006">Oesterreich et al., 1993</xref>). An obvious disadvantage is the necessity to develop new items for other working fields, which is time-consuming (e.g. item development based on focus groups and/or interviews with experienced employees).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the concept of core items offers the opportunity to compare perceptions of acceleration across different working fields.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-0961463X12471006"><title>Study limitations</title>
<p>Both studies were cross-sectional self-report studies. As acceleration is an ongoing undulate process, it should be investigated using a longitudinal approach. Data should be collected over a longer time period, since one may expect that specific areas of social acceleration are unfolding over months or even years. The self-report may also be critical because acceleration is a contemporary discourse in public media. Complaining about time stress is common in everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). Therefore, from an objectivistic perspective it is hard to say if people indeed perceive acceleration, or if they succumbed to the widespread feeling of being subject to acceleration. To investigate acceleration from a more objective perspective, longitudinal studies which combine self-report and time-use studies (cf. International Association of Time Use Research, n.d.) may be an appropriate approach. For instance, ‘objective’ (i.e. observable and countable) indicators of social acceleration, like the increasing number of emails at workplaces could be related to subjective perceptions of acceleration over time. Measures of time use over time, like the daily amount of working hours (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0961463X12471006">Robinson and Martin, 2009</xref>) could also be related to the perceptions of acceleration.</p>
<p>Moreover, we tested the core items of acceleration-related job demands in two specific fields of service work. Although the sample distribution with regard to gender and age was quite typical for flight attendants, the return rate in the main study was relatively small. Thus there are limits in the generalizability of our results. As a next step, the factorial structure of acceleration-related demands should also be confirmed for other working areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec28-0961463X12471006"><title>Implications for theory and practice</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961463X12471006">De Grazia (1964)</xref> stated that there exist many machines which help us to save time (e.g. microwave oven), but nevertheless we have less and less time. This paradox could also be described as a paradox between Rosa’s first (technological) and third (pace of life) dimension: the technological acceleration (of new technologies) should lead to a gain of time, for example for production but also free time, which should, on the other hand, slow down the acceleration of the pace of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0961463X12471006">Wajcman, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref>, the paradox could be explained by an inadequacy between an acceleration rate and a growth rate. Due to new technologies we need less time to produce the same output than before (acceleration rate), but we are also forced to produce more output (growth rate). If the growth rate is higher than the acceleration rate, the outcome is time pressure and more time saving techniques are requested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). However, even though technologies save time they also lead to several changes. For example tasks change their character and new materials and practices emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0961463X12471006">Wajcman, 2008</xref>). This may lead to a greater effort to achieve tasks, which in turn costs more time than before.</p>
<p>It could be argued that technologies do not necessarily save time even though more and more technologies are requested: a vicious circle. From a sociological point of view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref> discussed the future prognosis for such an ongoing vicious circle. An unbraked acceleration will end in a final catastrophe with a collapse of ecological, political, and economic systems; only the power of political, legitimate, and governmental authorities could help to elude this vicious circle.</p>
<p>For now, people are forced to live with acceleration. While an opt out of industrialized society is possible, it is accompanied by limited possibilities to return. In a working life where people work a ‘hard day’s night’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X12471006">Green, 2001</xref>), the possible individual consequences of acceleration have to be discussed. Data clearly show that work intensification is related to increases in work strain, which, at least in the long run, leads to reduced health. Thus, while we are forced to live with acceleration, it is important to know what may help to reduce the consequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961463X12471006">Green (2001)</xref>, for instance, found the highest increases of work intensification in areas with reduced union activities. Thus, stronger worker unions clearly help to reduce negative consequences of acceleration.</p>
<p>From the perspective of work and organizational psychology, it has to be initially assumed that acceleration leads to demands which are more than classical job demands: one set of demands could be described as dynamization (i.e. a permanent increase) of classical job demands, whereas a second set of demands is related to changes on the labor market (such demands are not part of the classical job demands).</p>
<p>Job demands per se are not necessarily associated with a negative outcome. Many studies show that the (individual) evaluation of these demands is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961463X12471006">Cavanaugh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961463X12471006">Podsakoff et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, in line with transactional stress theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961463X12471006">Lazarus and Folkman, 1984)</xref>, stressors could be categorized as either challenge stressors (e.g. role demands), which activate personal achievement, or hindrance stressors (e.g. situational constraints), which constrain personal achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961463X12471006">Podsakoff et al., 2007</xref>). The original conception of the challenge/hindrance stressor approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0961463X12471006">Podsakoff et al., 2007</xref>) relies on general evaluations of challenge and hindrance stressors, assuming that most individuals have similar perceptions of specific stressors. Newer studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0961463X12471006">Webster et al., 2011</xref>) suggest that the appraisal if a similar stressor is evaluated as challenge or hindrance is an individual process, that is, persons differ in their perceptions of challenge or hindrance stressor. Again this leads to the realm of ‘objective’ versus ‘subjective’ perceptions of acceleration-related phenomena.</p>
<p>Also from a practical perspective, the distinction between challenge and hindrance stressors could be interesting for the acceleration-related demands. Particularly because technological developments could be perceived as a benefit, as they help to save time and offer an information advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961463X12471006">Hörning et al., 1999</xref>), which could in turn lead to high engagement. The various social changes could also be perceived as a challenge accompanied with new opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa, 2005</xref>). Otherwise, an unmanageable amount of opportunities could lead to insecurity and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0961463X12471006">Offe, 1986</xref>), and in the long run to exhaustion and burnout.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec29-0961463X12471006" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We conclude that acceleration leads to new job demands which affect employees in an unknown way. The demands could be classified using the framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0961463X12471006">Rosa (2005)</xref>, particularly because the three-dimensional structure was confirmed in two working areas. The next steps, – focusing on evaluation and appraisal of these new demands, coping strategies in dealing with the new demands, and specific organizational resources –, could help to integrate the acceleration-related demands in the common concept of job demands in work and organizational psychology.</p>
