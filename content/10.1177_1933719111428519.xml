<abstract>
<p>Metabolic flexibility is the body’s ability to adapt to changing energy demand and nutrient supply. Maternal undernutrition causes growth restriction at birth and subsequent obesity development. Intriguingly, metabolic flexibility is maintained due to adaptations of muscle tissue. The aim of the present study was to investigate developmental pathways of these adaptive changes. Wistar rats received standard chow at either ad libitum (AD) or 30% of ad libitum intake (UN) throughout pregnancy. At all ages, metabolic status indicated similar insulin sensitivity in AD and UN offspring despite the development of adiposity in UN offspring at weaning. Type IIA fiber size was reduced in soleus muscle of UN offspring at weaning and they had a higher percentage of type I fibers in adulthood with a concomitantly higher oxidative capacity. Plasticity of muscle was present during the postnatal period and proposes novel pathways for the dynamic development of metabolic flexibility throughout postnatal life.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Postnatal obesity is a well-described consequence of prenatal undernutrition in both humans and animals.<sup>

</sup> However, recent research has shown that the impact of prenatal undernutrition on metabolic status varies according to the experimental model investigated. Using a rat model of prenatal undernutrition throughout pregnancy provided important insight into long-term consequences for the later metabolic status of offspring. The offspring of undernourished mothers developed obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, but they remained insulin sensitive throughout adult life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428519">7</xref>
</sup> In contrast to other experimental models of obesity, fat deposition was restricted to physiological fat depots and both muscle and liver glycogen levels were increased, indicating a physiological propensity to store energy.<sup>

<p>The capacity of skeletal muscle to adapt its cellular regulation of fuel utilization to nutrient supply and demand is critical for the maintenance of metabolic health. The essential underlying metabolic features of skeletal muscle are influenced by multiple factors including structure, fiber-type composition, fiber size, mitochondrial density, innervation, and capillary density. Metabolism of type I fibers is mostly oxidative, while that of white type IIB fibers is almost glycolytic. Type IIA fibers are intermediary regarding oxidative and glycolytic capacity but have the highest capability to change their metabolic features due to external challenges such as exercise. The morphological and functional properties of muscle are determined during embryonic development and during the fetal and the early postnatal periods. It has been shown previously in both intrauterine growth restricted piglets and rodents that dietary influences, including calorie or protein restriction during the prenatal period, can change muscle development in terms of fiber number and fiber-type composition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719111428519">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719111428519">10</xref>
</sup> In rats, skeletal muscle develops at distinct time points during both the prenatal and the early postnatal periods. While the majority of different muscle tissues in rats are developed during the early postnatal period (between birth and weaning), the number of fibers in some muscles, particularly the soleus (SOL), are fixed at the time of birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719111428519">11</xref>
</sup> In effect, skeletal muscle metabolism changes dynamically during this developmental period due to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as nutrition and exercise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719111428519">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719111428519">13</xref>
</sup> Poor fetal nutrition may reduce or delay skeletal muscle growth in order to favor neuronal development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719111428519">14</xref>
</sup> In addition, dietary influences during pregnancy and lactation are known to have a strong impact on skeletal muscle differentiation and development as quantified by fiber number, fiber size, and fiber type.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719111428519">15</xref>
</sup> In a recent publication, we reported the impact of prenatal undernutrition on adult rat skeletal muscle morphology. The result manifested in adults as altered fiber-type composition which may reflect a state of enhanced metabolic flexibility during adult life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428519">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Metabolic flexibility is the body’s ability to adapt to changing energy demand and nutrient supply. More specifically, it describes the capacity to effectively coordinate the regulation of fatty acids and glucose metabolic flux and is linked with insulin sensitivity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719111428519">16</xref>
</sup> In contrast, a metabolically inflexible state is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired skeletal muscle fat oxidation. To date, the pathways to a metabolically flexible state, or the converse inflexible condition, are not well understood. However, there is increasing evidence that the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle plays an important role in maintaining metabolic flexibility.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719111428519">17</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the impact of prenatal undernutrition is long lasting, the underlying developmental path for the observed adult metabolic status remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the postnatal development of muscle structure and function that are linked to metabolic fuel utilization. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle development adapts to reduced prenatal nutrition through structural and functional changes that favor pathways of flexible fuel usage and storage. We explored this hypothesis in prenatally undernourished rats by examining muscle morphology, fiber composition, and metabolic parameters at 3 developmentally important time points: birth, weaning, and adulthood. Structural and functional changes, especially an increased proportion of type I muscle fibers, together with an increased oxidative capacity of muscle tissue, may represent critical long-term changes that could explain increased metabolic flexibility during postnatal life.</p>

</sup> Briefly, virgin Wistar rats were time mated and assigned to receive chow either ad libitum (AD, n = 9) or at 30% of ad libitum intake (UN, n = 9) throughout pregnancy. From the day of birth until weaning food was available to all dams. UN offspring were cross-fostered to AD fed mothers at day of birth to limit the nutritional influence to the prenatal period only. Distinct groups of AD and UN offspring were investigated at 3 developmental periods:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Neonatal (N): culled on the first postnatal day (n = 6 per group, 12 in total),</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Weaning (W): culled on postnatal day 21 (n = 8 per group, 16 in total),</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Adult (A): culled on postnatal day 240 (n = 8 per group, 16 in total).</p>
</list-item>
</list>
Offspring of each group were from separate mothers to avoid litter effects. The first 2 groups, N and W, included female offspring. Mixed-sex groups were studied as previous research identified no sex differences at 1 and 3 weeks of age in the parameters included in this project following maternal undernutrition.<sup>

</sup> In short, blood was collected from overnight-fasted rats into heparinized tubes and stored on ice until centrifugation. Plasma was stored at −20°C until analysis. Liver samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C prior to analysis. Whole SOL and superficial gastrocnemius (GSUP) muscle from the right leg of offspring at weaning were also snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. The respective muscles from the left leg were prepared by fixing onto cork plates. Fixed muscles were frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>-cooled isopentane and stored at −80°C to ensure tissue integrity for immunohistochemical studies. Due to size of SOL and GSUP samples in the N group the entire right hind whole leg muscle was snap-frozen.

At the adult age, mean levels of insulin and C-peptide were increased in UN offspring; however, this was not significant (A insulin [ng/mL]: AD 0.63 ± 0.08, UN 1.22 ± 0.35; A C-peptide [nmol/L]: AD 0.99 ± 0.09, UN 1.38 ± 0.20).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results of this study demonstrate that prenatal undernutrition sets in train structural and functional changes in muscle tissue, while their biological effects on metabolic fuel utilization manifest during the later postnatal period. Changes were induced before birth, becoming physiologically apparent at weaning. Higher TG concentrations in plasma may indicate that development of adiposity in UN offspring was initiated, while plasma variables of metabolic status suggest the presence of similar insulin sensitivity in AD and UN offspring at this developmental stage.</p>
<sec id="section21-1933719111428519">
<title>Glucose Metabolism</title>
<p>Lower glycogen stores in neonatal muscle of prenatally undernourished offspring may reflect the scarce energy supply during the prenatal period. Interestingly, this did not appear to influence other markers of glucose metabolism at birth such as plasma glucose, plasma C-peptide, liver glycogen, and liver PKC ζ levels, suggesting a successful adaptive outcome of energy metabolism during fetal development. By weaning, muscle glycogen stores in UN offspring increased to levels observed in AD offspring, indicating the onset of an increased capacity to store energy. Effective storage of energy at physiological sites is a key feature of metabolic flexibility. However, it is unclear if this increased energy storage is derived from a higher energy intake or a decreased energy expenditure of UN offspring during the suckling period. Further research is required to interrogate this question. In adult UN offspring, a small but consistent elevation in plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations and significantly higher expression of hepatic PKC ζ and glycogen stores in muscle indicate a metabolic status of increased capacity to store energy as glycogen.</p>

<title>Lipid Metabolism</title>
<p>The birth weight difference between AD and UN offspring disappeared at weaning, indicating neonatal catch up growth in UN offspring. Elevated TG levels in UN offspring at weaning may herald the beginning of increased fat deposition which manifests as obesity later during adult life. In concurrence with this observation, plasma leptin levels, which were significantly lower in prenatally undernourished neonates, did not differ at weaning. As leptin is positively correlated with body weight at birth in rats and humans<sup>

<title>Developmental Changes of Muscle Morphology and Oxidative Capacity</title>
<p>In this study, muscle morphology and function, as assessed by immunohistochemical, biochemical, and enzymatic analyses, was predominately unchanged until weaning. Changes in fiber size and fiber-type composition began to emerge at weaning and were fully developed by adulthood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428519">9</xref>
</sup> The specific reduction in the size of type IIA fibers in UN SOL at weaning demonstrates that prenatally induced pathways may initiate characteristic muscle morphological features at this age, although these early changes appeared to have no apparent functional consequences for oxidative and glycolytic capacity of muscle metabolism at weaning. By adulthood in UN, SOL morphology was characterized by a shift to more type I fibers at the expense of type II fibers that were reduced in number and size.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719111428519">9</xref>
</sup> Potentially, this increase reflects a shift to a more oxidative metabolic profile in prenatally undernourished offspring as indicated in the present study by increased oxidative CS and decreased glycolytic LDH enzyme activity. Type IIA fiber size was significantly reduced in SOL of adult UN offspring, as trend that was also observed in GSUP. While investigation of neonatal muscle morphology was not possible, this difference in fiber size was already apparent in SOL but not in GSUP at weaning and suggests that the growth and development of secondary fibers and progenitors of type II fibers in SOL muscle may already be reduced during early fetal development in UN offspring. The mechanism underlying the altered development of this muscle fiber morphology requires further investigation. Functionally, the decreased type IIA fiber size observed in UN offspring of the present study may facilitate the exchange of metabolic fuels more effectively. Given that these fibers have strong oxidative properties, the smaller type IIA fibers in UN offspring provides a greater surface area for gas exchange with the surrounding capillaries.<sup>

</sup> Furthermore, the data presented here, coupled with the work of others, suggest that adaptation of skeletal muscle among other processes leading to the increased metabolic flexibility of prenatally undernourished offspring may be initiated by changes in plasma leptin levels during critical periods of development.<sup>

</sup> The role of leptin in the regulation of skeletal muscle development has been illustrated by studies in pig primary cell cultures, where leptin promoted proliferation and inhibited differentiation of myoblasts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719111428519">31</xref>
</sup> In the present study, plasma leptin concentrations were already altered by prenatal undernutrition on the first day after birth showing decreased leptin concentrations in UN offspring. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that these altered patterns of circulating leptin may be linked with the observed changes in muscle fiber size and composition in UN offspring.</p>

<title>Summary and Conclusion</title>
<p>This study describes the apparent plasticity of skeletal muscle in rat offspring challenged by prenatal undernutrition and proposes novel pathways for the dynamic development of metabolic flexibility during postnatal life. In former studies, we have observed that increased metabolic flexibility is expressed even when prenatally undernourished offspring become obese as a result of exposure to a postnatal sedentary environment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719111428519">7</xref>

</sup> We have identified that in UN rat offspring higher metabolic flexibility is based on the early development of an enhanced capacity to store energy in times of excess as glycogen and fat in physiological depots. While the metabolic profile showed changes commencing on the first day of postnatal life, specific features of muscle structure that facilitate effective utilization of metabolic fuels were slowly developed during postnatal development. The percentage of type I fiber expression and CS activity was increased in SOL muscle of adult UN offspring supporting a higher oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle. It is tempting to consider leptin as a key endocrine driver for differential muscle fiber development. Further investigations into the pathways responsible for stimulating type I fiber expression and potential selective atrophy of type IIA fibers are warranted. Higher oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle in UN offspring from the present study indicates that stored energy can be used effectively through activation of catabolic pathways in times of energy need. Stimulating these muscles by exercise postnatally was an efficient intervention to prevent obesity development in UN offspring.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719111428519">8</xref>
</sup> In principal, the high level in skeletal muscle plasticity in response to environmental stimuli is the reason why exercise intervention might be able to correct metabolic disturbances induced by prenatal nutrition.<sup>
