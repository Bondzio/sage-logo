<abstract>
<p>Rapid intravenous administration of <sc>d</sc>-ribose may result in a significant reduction in cellular damage in patients with sudden ischemic insults. The development of an effective and clinically safe therapeutic regimen using the intravenous route in critically ill patients especially with cardiac diseases requires a comprehensive assessment of potential toxic effects of the drug in laboratory animals and in human beings. The potential clinical, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, gross pathological and histological toxic effects associated with the intravenous administration of <sc>d</sc>-ribose in rabbits for 28 days were evaluated in this study. Except for an increase in neutrophil percentage in male rabbits in the <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated groups, there were no statistically significant toxic effects induced by daily intravenous administration of the drug in male and female rabbits. Results of this study suggest that <sc>d</sc>-ribose administered intravenously for 28 days in the rabbit exhibited no toxicity at 420 mg/kg.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>α-<sc>d</sc>-Ribofuranose (<sc>d</sc>-ribose) is a naturally occurring monosaccharide aldopentose. <sc>d</sc>-Ribose is an important structural subunit found in riboflavin (vitamin B2), RNA, adenosine triphosphate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and coenzyme-A.<sup>

<p>The development of an effective and clinically safe therapeutic regimen using the intravenous route in critically ill patients especially with cardiac diseases requires a comprehensive assessment of potential toxic effects of the drug in laboratory animals and in human beings. The study reported here was designed to evaluate the potential clinical, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, gross pathological and histological toxic effects associated with intravenous administration of <sc>d</sc>-ribose in rabbits for 28 days.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0960327111432505">
<title>Test substance</title>
<p>Natural <sc>d</sc>-ribose (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; molecular weight: 150.13, &gt;98% purity, CAS number: 50-69-1) was obtained from Heartland Biosciences (Minneapolis, MN, USA) as a spherical white powder. The product was verified to contain &lt;5 ppm heavy metals, &lt;100 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) aerobic plate count, &lt;10 CFU/g coliforms, &lt;100 CFU/g yeast and mold, negative for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. A certificate of composition, sterility and purity along with specific recommendations for appropriate handling, storage and preparation was provided by the sponsor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0960327111432505">
<title>Preparation of test substance for intravenous injection</title>
<p>Preparation of the test substance for the injection was carried out in sterile conditions. The test substance was dissolved in sterile water for injection (USP; 4.2%, pH 6.9, 270 mOsm/L), approximately 30 min prior to injection. The solution was then filtered using syringe-driven membrane filters (0.22 μm pore size; polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF); Jet Biofil, Shanghai, China) to ensure sterility. Samples from dosage formulations were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to verify the concentration; all samples were within 10% of the targeted concentrations. The ready-for-use solution was tested to confirm its sterility, stability, homogeneity and absence of endotoxins (limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL), Clongen Laboratories, CA, USA). Freshly prepared solution was used for injection each time.</p>
<p>Sterile 0.9% saline was also prepared and used for injection in control groups. The volume of the test substance administered to each animal was calculated based on the individual body weight (10 mL/kg). The test substance was administered intravenously, once daily, 7 days a week for 28 days, at approximately the same time each day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0960327111432505">
<title>Animals and study design</title>
<p>All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) of Jordan University of Science and Technology. Healthy, adult rabbits (Valencia V-line), weighing 2.0–2.5 kg were obtained from Alexandria University, Egypt.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111432505">18</xref>
</sup> Immediately after arrival, the rabbits were assigned individual IDs by permanent ear tattoos and placed individually in cages for observation during an acclimatization period of 1 week. Rabbits were housed in rooms with controlled temperature (21–23°C) and humidity (35%–70%). Lighting was set at 12-h light and 12-h dark cycles. Animals were fed with commercially available rabbit ration (local supplier, Jordan) and were offered fresh water as described in the following sections.</p>
<p>A total of 18 rabbits were selected for the study. Rabbits were distributed into three groups using a random distribution method based on body weight. Six animals (three females and three males) were used in each group. Rabbits in group 1 (<sc>d</sc>-ribose) received 4.2% <sc>d</sc>-ribose solution at 420 mg/kg (10 mL/kg), intravenously, once daily for 28 days. Rabbits in group 2 (saline) received 0.9% saline solution, intravenously, once daily for 28 days and served as control. Rabbits in group 3 (satellite) received 4.2% <sc>d</sc>-ribose solution at 420 mg/kg (10 mL/kg), intravenously, once daily for 28 days but were euthanatized on day 15 after the last <sc>d</sc>-ribose injection to allow for extended observation period for any late-occurring effects.</p>
<p>Rabbits were fasted for approximately 12 h prior to injection. Drinking water was freely provided during this period. Slow intravenous injection (5–10 min) was achieved via the marginal ear vein using 25–27 gauge sterile butterfly needles (Sunphoria Co., Ltd, New Taipei, Taiwan). To reduce damage to the sensitive ear veins due to repeated daily injections, the smallest needle possible was used, and the right and left ear veins were used alternatively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111432505">19</xref>
</sup> Rabbits were restrained in a wooden rabbit restrainer (locally produced, Jordan) for injection. Lamp heat was used to help dilate the vein before injection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0960327111432505">
<title>Clinical and behavioral observation</title>
<p>Cage-side observation was performed every 30 min in the 4-h post administration period and twice daily after that for 28 days. Animals in the satellite group were observed for further 14 days after the last injection. Rabbits were monitored for any abnormal clinical signs or changes in behavior. The body weight, food and water intake were recorded twice per week.</p>
<p>The body weight was measured using a digital scale with an accuracy of up to 0.1 kg. Food was offered once daily, that is, 3 h after the completion of administration. To measure feed consumption, feed left-over was collected and its weight was obtained before a fresh amount was offered. Water was offered in clean bottles and was changed every 12 h and the amount consumed was calculated. Both feed and water consumed was reported as amount consumed per gram of body weight per day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0960327111432505">
<title>Laboratory evaluation</title>
<p>Hematology and plasma biochemistry evaluations were performed on the day of killing. Approximately 2 mL of whole blood was collected from the central ear artery/vein from all rabbits. Blood was placed in tubes containing 3.8% sodium citrate for hematology, plasma biochemistry and prothrombin time (PT) measurements. To prevent dilution effects, the amount of anticoagulants in the tubes was reduced according to the amount of blood obtained. Blood samples were transported immediately after collection to the laboratory on ice for analysis. The following hematology parameters were determined using an electronic cell counter (ABC Vet hematology analyzer, ABX Diagnostics, France): total white blood cell (WBC) and differential cell counts including percentages of segmented neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and platelets count.</p>
<p>Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of blood samples at 500 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The following plasma chemistry parameters were determined using a Sp-2100 spectrophotometer (Hinotek Technology Co., Ltd, Ningbo, China): glucose, cholesterol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). BUN/creatinine ratio was calculated manually. Plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium and chlorides were determined using Easyvet (Medica Co., MA, USA). PT was determined using thrombotest reagent (Axis-Shield, Shanghai, China).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0960327111432505">
<title>Pathological examination</title>
<p>Before euthanasia, the terminal body weight was recorded. Animals in groups 1 and 2 were humanely euthanized on day 29 of the experiment and those in group 3 on day 43. Animals were euthanized by exsanguination under general anesthesia using 2.5% thiopental sodium (Abbott Laboratories, North Point, Hong Kong) at 20 mg/kg intravenously. A sharp surgical blade (No. 20) was used to transect both carotid arteries.</p>
<p>A complete necropsy examination was performed on all animals by a certified pathologist under the supervision of the primary investigator. After careful gross pathological examination of body organs, all periorgan fat and adventitia were trimmed and organ weights were determined. The following organs were collected and weighed immediately: adrenals, brain, heart, spleen, kidneys, liver, lungs, thyroids, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymis, ovaries and uterus.</p>
<p>Tissue samples from the following organs were harvested and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and prepared for histopathology examination: adrenals, brain, heart, spleen, kidneys, liver, thymus, lungs, thyroids, pancreas, prostate, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymis, ovaries, uterus, aorta, sternum, cecum, colon, eyes, optic nerves, femur, injection site, lymph nodes, rectum, salivary glands, sciatic nerves, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spinal cord, stomach, tongue, trachea, urinary bladder and vagina. Tissue samples were further processed for histopathological (light microscopy) analysis after sectioning at 5 μm thickness and staining with hematoxylin and eosin stain. At least three stained slides from each organ from each animal were thoroughly examined by the pathologist.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0960327111432505">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>It is important to note here that in this study, the smallest number of animals per group (three males and three females) recommended by our institutional ACUC was used to avoid excessive use of animals. This may explain minor variations that were noted in the results concerning some of the parameters included in the analysis.</p>
<p>Analysis was performed between all the groups using the parameters obtained within the first 4 weeks of the study only. Parameters entered in the analysis included initial body weight, weight gain, organ weights, food and water consumption and various parameters in the hematology and biochemistry analyses.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test (two samples assuming unequal variances), from the Analysis Tool Pak of Microsoft-Excel 2003, using Windows XP Professional. Two-tail <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. Data were expressed in means ± SEM.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All rabbits survived until the scheduled sacrifice day without any major clinical signs or behavioral alterations. In this study, male and female rabbits tolerated the intravenous administration of 4.2% solution of <sc>d</sc>-ribose at a dose rate of 420 mg/kg and a maximum volume of 10 mL/kg without obvious adverse clinical or behavioral side effects.</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in body or organ weights between <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated and control groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0960327111432505">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0960327111432505">2</xref>). However, there was a trend of slight, but not significant weight gain, more evident in female rabbits during the first week after the last <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration. There were no significant differences in feed or water consumption between <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated and control groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0960327111432505">Table 1</xref>). A slight increase in the means of water consumption in both male and female satellite groups was observed during the 2 weeks after the last dose of <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration compared with their water consumption during the period of <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration.</p>

<p>Results of plasma biochemical analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0960327111432505">Table 5</xref>. There were no major alterations in tested parameters after <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration. Although glucose levels in treated animals were within the normal ranges of glucose in rabbits, there was a decrease in glucose levels in the male group receiving <sc>d</sc>-ribose when compared with controls. A slight increase in glucose level was observed in female satellite group. All these variations were not significant. Cholesterol levels in all the groups were within normal values published for normal rabbits. However, a nonsignificant increase in cholesterol level was observed in <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated groups compared with their controls. In satellite groups, these levels were near base values for controls. There was no significant difference in total protein and albumin levels between groups. Values of total protein and albumin measured in our laboratory were slightly lower than the normal values of rabbits found in literature. By comparing BUN values in <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated groups with their controls, we found a slight but not significant increase in these values in treated groups. This increase in BUN levels was accompanied by a decrease in creatinine levels, resulting in an increased BUN/creatinine ratio. This was more evident in the female groups. In the satellite group, the BUN/creatinine ratio was near base levels for controls. Liver enzymes, ALT and AST, and plasma electrolytes sodium, potassium and chloride concentrations were within normal ranges of previously published values in rabbits and no significant differences were found between <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated groups and controls.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The potential therapeutic effects of <sc>d</sc>-ribose in patients with congestive heart failure, coronary arterial disease, renal ischemic diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have been demonstrated after oral supplementation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327111432505">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111432505"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111432505">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111432505">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111432505">17</xref>
</sup> Faster restoration of energy reserves is required to reduce or minimize irreparable degenerative changes in hypoxic cells. Rapid intravenous administration of <sc>d</sc>-ribose may prove advantageous over oral supplementation in those conditions. The implementation of an intravenous regimen of <sc>d</sc>-ribose, however, requires comprehensive safety and efficacy studies. The present study was conducted to assess the potential toxicity of isotonic <sc>d</sc>-ribose solution (4.2%) after repeated intravenous administration in rabbits.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate possible toxic effects resulted from fluid overload, the volume of 10 mL/kg administered intravenously was not exceeded.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111432505">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327111432505">20</xref>
</sup> In this study, 420 mg/kg of <sc>d</sc>-ribose was used to meet the recommendations for intravenous injection of isotonic solutions (around 300 mOsm/L) in laboratory animals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111432505">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327111432505">20</xref>
</sup> Injection of hypertonic solutions including <sc>d</sc>-ribose may induce undesirable effects such as hemolysis and perivascular irritation especially when repeated dosing is used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0960327111432505">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0960327111432505">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Previous clinical and preclinical toxicity studies have focused mainly on oral administration of <sc>d</sc>-ribose. Studies conducted on Wistar rats to evaluate the potential toxicity of high doses of orally administered <sc>d</sc>-ribose (15 g/kg/d) in nonpregnant rats for 13 weeks and the embryotoxicity of <sc>d</sc>-ribose at 9.9 g/kg/d in pregnant rats for 3 weeks have shown no significant changes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327111432505">22</xref>
</sup> In humans, minor side effects including diarrhea, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea and headache have been reported after oral administration to patients with stable coronary disease and no significant changes in hematological or biochemical parameters have been observed after prolonged oral intake of <sc>d</sc>-ribose by healthy volunteers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111432505">10</xref>
</sup> In one study, intravenous infusion of <sc>d</sc>-ribose to healthy volunteers was well tolerated at a dosage rate of 222 mg/kg/h.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327111432505">23</xref>
</sup> In our study, no changes in stool consistency or other signs related to gastrointestinal dysfunction have been detected in rabbits receiving an isotonic solution (4.2%, 420 mg/kg) of <sc>d</sc>-ribose intravenously once daily for 28 days. Gastrointestinal symptoms reported in previous studies, which developed after high-dose oral <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration were more likely attributed to local physiological changes in the gastrointestinal tract rather than systemic side effects due to <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration.</p>
<p>Griffiths and his colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>
</sup> have reported a significant reduction in weight gain and no significant change in feed consumption in rats receiving 10% and 20% dietary supplement of <sc>d</sc>-ribose. In our study, there were no significant differences in weight gain, organ weight or feed consumption between control and <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated groups. Similarly, Griffiths and his colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>
</sup> have also reported insignificant differences in weight gain in rats receiving 5% <sc>d</sc>-ribose compared with controls by the end of the study (13 weeks).</p>
<p>In the Griffiths study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>
</sup> there was higher water consumption in rats receiving 10% and 20% <sc>d</sc>-ribose during the 6th and 12th weeks of the study but not in the first 4 weeks. Similarly, and as expected, in our study there were no significant differences in water consumption between control and treated groups during the 4-week study period.</p>
<p>Hematology results indicate a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils in male rabbits compared with controls. No changes were observed in female group. Similar to our results, an increased percentage of neutrophils with a reduction in lymphocyte percentages was observed in rats whose diet was supplemented with <sc>d</sc>-ribose for 13 weeks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0960327111432505">22</xref>
</sup> In rat studies, most of these changes were noticed in groups receiving either 10% or 20% <sc>d</sc>-ribose for 13 weeks.</p>
<p>In rats receiving 5% <sc>d</sc>-ribose, a slight decrease in total protein was observed in male but not in female groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>
</sup> These changes were attributed to carbohydrate overload associated with prolonged supplementation of <sc>d</sc>-ribose in the animal’s diet and were deemed as nontoxic and clinically insignificant.</p>
<p>BUN were increased in <sc>d</sc>-ribose-administered groups. The BUN/creatinine ratio was also increased in <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated rabbits especially in the female groups. Clinically, increased BUN/creatinine ratio may indicate hemoconcentration or decreased renal blood flow. However, in <sc>d</sc>-ribose-treated rabbits, no signs of dehydration could be detected at any time during the study. It is possible that changes in BUN concentration and BUN/creatinine ratio are attributed to alterations in metabolic processes as a result of <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration.</p>
<p>Liver function parameters assessed in healthy human volunteers have shown slight but not significant changes after 7 and 14 days of oral <sc>d</sc>-ribose administration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0960327111432505">23</xref>
</sup> In our study, there were no significant differences in AST or ALT enzymes between control and treated groups.</p>
<p>Griffiths and his colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0960327111432505">21</xref>
</sup> found no evidence of gross or histopathological changes in any organ after extended <sc>d</sc>-ribose supplementation in rats. Similarly, in our study there were no gross or histopathological changes in any of the body organs evaluated.</p>
<p>In conclusion, isotonic solution (4.2%) of <sc>d</sc>-ribose administered intravenously to rabbits at a dose of 420 mg/kg (10 mL/kg) once daily for 28 days did not induce any clinical, behavioral, hematological, biochemical, gross pathological, or histological adverse effects.</p>
