<abstract>
<p>Periodontal tissue homeostasis depends on a complex cellular network that conveys cell-cell communication. Gap junctions (GJs), one of the intercellular communication systems, are found between adjacent human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells; however, the functional GJ coupling between hPDL cells has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated functional gap-junction-mediated intercellular communication in isolated primary hPDL cells. SEM images indicated that the cells were in contact with each other <italic>via</italic> dendritic processes, and also showed high anti-connexin43 (Cx43) immunoreactivity on these processes. Gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) among hPDL cells was assessed by fluorescence recovery after a photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, which exhibited dye coupling between hPDL cells, and was remarkably down-regulated when the cells were treated with a GJ blocker. Additionally, we examined GJs under hypoxic stress. The fluorescence recovery and expression levels of Cx43 decreased time-dependently under the hypoxic condition. Exposure to GJ inhibitor or hypoxia increased <italic>RANKL</italic> expression, and decreased <italic>OPG</italic> expression. This study shows that GJIC is responsible for hPDL cells and that its activity is reduced under hypoxia. This is consistent with the possible role of hPDL cells in regulating the biochemical reactions in response to changes in the hypoxic environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The periodontal ligament (PDL) is a soft connective tissue that is situated between the cementum and alveolar bone to sustain teeth and preserve tissue homeostasis. It is thought to play a role in sensing mechanical stress on the teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513489992">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513489992">Seo <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and appears to influence site-specific remodeling of the alveolar bone <italic>via</italic> the biochemical responses to stress such as masticatory and orthodontic forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513489992">Takano-Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of intercellular communication between PDL cells has not been well-characterized, although it is widely accepted that such communication among osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes is deeply involved in the regulation of bone modeling and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513489992">Civitelli, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Gap junctions (GJs), composed of connexin (Cx) subunit proteins, are known to comprise one of the intercellular communication systems which allow for electrical and metabolic coupling between adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513489992">Flagg-Newton <italic>et al</italic>., 1979</xref>). In spite of the fact that Cx proteins have already been identified in PDL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513489992">Beertsen and Everts, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513489992">Yamaoka <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), their distribution and detailed relationship to the cell morphology are not fully understood. Moreover, there is currently no direct evidence that Cx proteins form functional GJs among PDL cells.</p>
<p>The mechanical force exerted by orthodontic tooth movement causes distortion of the cells in the PDL. Since the PDL is a highly vascularized soft connective tissue that occupies from 4% to 47% of the tissue volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513489992">Blaushild <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034513489992">Sims <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), these alterations affect both the blood supply and oxygen transport in the local environment of the PDL cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513489992">Gaengler and Merte, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513489992">Packman <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). It has been unclear whether such changes affect GJ coupling. In this report, we describe the occurrence of functional gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between isolated human PDL cells, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis. In addition, we examined the effects of hypoxic stress on the GJIC in PDL cells to understand how the GJIC among PDL cells responds to the low-oxygen conditions that develop on the compression side during orthodontic tooth movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513489992">Khouw and Goldhaber, 1970</xref>).</p>

<title>Isolation and Culture of hPDL Cells</title>
<p>With approval of the ethics committee, intact permanent teeth were collected from healthy patients undergoing orthodontic treatment at Okayama University Hospital. Ten premolars from 10 healthy donors (three male and seven female donors), aged 15 to 40 yrs, were used in the present study, and hPDL cells were isolated from the teeth as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513489992">Kawanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The isolated hPDL cells were maintained in alpha-modified Minimum Essential Medium (Î±-MEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL and 100 Âµg/mL, respectively; Invitrogen). The cells were fed twice a week by replacement of half of the media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034513489992">
<title>Cx43 Staining and CLS Images</title>
<p>The hPDL cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, then permeabilized by 0.5% saponin in PBS for 10 min. After 3 washes with PBS, the cells were incubated overnight at 4Â°C with a 1:200 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-Cx43 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) in PBS containing 1% BSA. Subsequently, the cells were stained for 24 hrs at 4Â°C with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) for mouse IgG in PBS containing 1% BSA. After being rinsed with PBS, cells were stained overnight at 4Â°C with a 1:100 dilution of Texas red-X-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in PBS containing 1% BSA. The samples were washed twice in PBS, mounted on glass slides with fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), and observed with a 60 X fluorescence objective mounted on an inverted microscope. Fluorescence images of cells were acquired with a FLUOVIEW FV500 confocal laser scanning microscopy system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034513489992">
<title>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)</title>
<p>We used SEM (DS-720; Topcon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) to study the hPDL cell structures. Isolated hPDL cells were fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, post-fixed in McDonaldâs osmium-potassium ferricyanide mixture [0.5% OsO<sub>4</sub> plus 0.8% K<sub>3</sub>Fe (CN)] for 15 min, washed in buffer, and immersed in 0.15% tannic acid for 1 to 2 min. After being rinsed in water, the specimens were dehydrated in ethanol, subjected to critical-point-drying, and then gold-coated by means of an ion sputter (JFC- 1100E; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section6-0022034513489992">
<title>FRAP Analysis</title>
<p>GJIC was monitored by a quantitative FRAP analysis, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513489992">Ishihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). After loading of Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) onto the hPDL cells, images were acquired pre-bleaching, immediately afterward, and at 30-second intervals after bleaching in each experiment. The FRAP data were normalized and calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513489992">Ishihara <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Induction of Hypoxia</title>
<p>Hypoxia experiments were performed for the indicated time periods in a humidified triple gas model BL-40M incubator (BIO-LABO, Tokyo, Japan) calibrated to deliver 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 2% O<sub>2</sub>, and 93% N<sub>2</sub> at 37Â°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513489992">Kondo <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-0022034513489992">
<title>Western Blot Analysis</title>
<p>SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western transfer of proteins were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513489992">Kubota <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Briefly, a 20-Âµg quantity of extracted proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE (in a 10% acrylamide gel) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA). The membranes were then blocked with 1% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline, labeled with antibodies against hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1Î±; R&amp;D), Cx43 (BD), and actin (Sigma). The blots were visualized by means of an enhanced chemiluminescence analysis system (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).</p>

<sec id="section9-0022034513489992">
<title>Real-time Reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain-reaction (RT-PCR)</title>
<p>RNA purification and the RT-PCR analysis were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513489992">Kawanabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). The gene-specific primers used in the present study were as follows:</p>

<sec id="section10-0022034513489992">
<title>Measurement of the Gap Junction Area</title>
<p>The GJ area was analyzed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513489992">Sugawara <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). The outline of the cell area was determined by phalloidin staining, and the GJ area was determined by anti-Cx43 staining. The average ratio of the total GJ area to the total cell area was calculated with the Win ROOF software program (MITANI Corporation, Fukui, Japan). Fluorescent images were converted to binary images for the measurement of the area. To generate the binary models of the total GJ area, we determined the threshold for the binary models to be more than 30 gray levels.</p>

<title>Reagents</title>
<p>The GJ inhibitor, 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (18Î±-GA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513489992">Davidson and Baumgarten, 1988</xref>), and hypoxia mimetic compound, desferoxamine (DFO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513489992">Wang and Semenza, 1993</xref>), were purchased from Sigma. The effects of 18Î±-GA on gap junction coupling are thought to act indirectly on the GJs through a series of phosphorylation changes in Cx43 proteins, resulting in the inhibition of GJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513489992">Ciovacco <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).

<title>Effects of Hypoxia on the Cx43 Expression of hPDL Cells</title>
<p>The effect of hypoxia on hPDL Cx43 protein distribution and quantity was determined by immunofluorescent staining and a Western blot analysis. Using fluorescence microscopy and the Win ROOF software program, we found that the Cx43 area in hPDLs was decreased in a time-dependent manner after treatment with DFO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513489992">Fig. 3F</xref>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>n</italic> = 15). This suggested that there was a decrease in Cx43 protein expression under hypoxic conditions. Densitometric measurements of the results of the Western blot analyses were performed to confirm whether the reduction in the immunolabeling was due to altered expression levels of Cx43. Hypoxic exposure or DFO treatment time-dependently decreased the Cx43 protein levels in hPDL cells (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513489992">Figs. 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513489992">3H</xref>). These findings suggest that the reduction in Cx43 immunoreactivity is most likely due to altered expression levels of this protein under hypoxic conditions, and not to conformational changes in the surface structures of Cx43.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated the presence of GJIC between hPDL cells and showed that there was a decrease in GJIC and Cx43 expression by primary hPDL cells when they were cultured under hypoxic stress. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that GJs are responsible for intercellular communication between adjacent hPDL cells and that their activity is influenced by hypoxia.</p>
<p>Cx43 is the most abundant GJ protein forming GJ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513489992">Musil <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>). Our morphological results with the anti-Cx43 antibody showed that Cx43 was predominantly distributed throughout the dendritic structure in a serial dot-like or linear fashion. We speculate that this expression pattern represents attachment of hPDL cell processes on the sides, as shown in our previous study in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513489992">Kamioka <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The FRAP analysis results of decreased fluorescence recovery in the presence of the GJ inhibitor suggest that GJs are functional in isolated hPDL cells. Furthermore, previous reports have shown that GJIC in the bone cell network contributes to bone formation and remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513489992">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513489992">Donahue, 2000</xref>). The fact that the positions of PDL cells are well-suited to allow the cells to sense biophysical stress and communicate with other bone cells makes it conceivable that the signals sent <italic>via</italic> the GJs of PDL cells to the surrounding bone cell network play a role in bone remodeling.</p>
<p>The application of orthodontic tooth movement leads to compression of the PDL, resulting in localized hypoxia due to vascular constriction within the PDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513489992">Gaengler and Merte, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513489992">Kuitert <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513489992">Packman <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the analysis of the hypoxia-induced regulation of the GJIC provides a better understanding of the biochemical processes associated with orthodontic tooth movement. We observed a decrease in Cx43 expression, leading to a reduced level of GJIC in hPDL cells cultured in a low-oxygen environment. Other investigators have shown an increase and/or decrease in Cx43 expression in response to hypoxic stress; however, the mechanism underlying this regulation remains unknown. Su <italic>et al</italic>. reported the role of Cx43 expressed on osteocytes in orthodontic tooth movement. It was demonstrated that Cx43 is significantly increased in osteocytes in the tension zones compared with the compression zones after exposure to force during experimental tooth movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513489992">Su <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>). In a recent study, Matsumoto and colleagues provided the first evidence showing that osteocytes are involved in osteoclastic bone resorption during orthodontic tooth movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513489992">Matsumoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Our present study demonstrated that the blockade of GJs or hypoxic stress increased RANKL mRNA expression and decreased OPG expression in hPDL cells, indicating either a positive influence of GJs on bone formation or a negative influence of GJs on bone resorption. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the precise role of GJIC in PDL cells, it can be speculated that hypoxia-induced regulation of GJ-mediated cell-cell communication plays a role in bone metabolism in the compression area of PDL during orthodontic tooth movement.</p>
<p>In conclusion, hPDL cells showed direct cell-cell contact <italic>via</italic> cell processes and functional communication with each other through GJ. Additionally, hypoxic stress decreased the GJIC, which was attributable to a decrease in Cx43, suggesting a possible role for these cells in the regulation of biochemical reactions in response to hypoxia.</p>
