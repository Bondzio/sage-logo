<abstract>
<p>The authors report 2 cases of cutaneous pseudolymphoma that occurred in 2 young adult patients who referred for relentlessly growing nodules that appeared within 4 to 5 months after the application of a mercury-based tattoo. Systemic symptoms were not present and there was no evidence of lymph node enlargement. Clinically, both lesions were limited to the red, mercury-based areas of the tattoo. Microscopic examination featured a dense cellular infiltrate composed of polytypic T cells in the upper to mid-dermis, coupled with focal interface tissue reaction. Scattered macrophages contained finely granular particles in their cytoplasm. In addition, extracellular pigment particles were also recognized. Collections of epithelioid macrophages were present in both cases and were reminiscent of epithelioid granulomas. This study confirms evidence that, among skin diseases featuring a dense lymphoid infiltrate, cutaneous pseudolymphoma secondary to tattooing is a rare but not exceptional source of diagnostic challenges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although the application of a tattoo is often an uneventful procedure, clinically significant complications may arise in a small but sizable percentage of cases, especially local inflammatory diseases or systemic infections as well as some cutaneous neoplasms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911425487">1</xref></sup> In contrast to diseases due to transmissible agents, often seen in the past, the more prevalent complications today are secondary to a local abnormal immunologic reaction to the dyes. Such complications often include granulomatous, lichenoid, or sarcoid-like reactions or a combination of them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911425487">2</xref></sup> Rarely but not exceptionally the inflammatory dermal infiltrate may acquire a pseudolymphomatous appearance simulating a lymphoproliferative disorder clinically and/or histologically. Although cutaneous pseudolymphoma (CPL) is mentioned in the medical literature as a potential complication of tattooing, only a small number of cases have included a detailed microscopic and immunohistochemical evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911425487">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911425487"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911425487"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911425487"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911425487"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911425487">8</xref></sup> In this article, we report 2 new cases of CPL appearing after the application of a tattoo, both featuring a dermal nodular infiltrate composed predominantly of polytypic T lymphocytes.</p>

<title>Case Reports</title>

<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 39-year-old lady was evaluated because of 2 raised, pruritic plaques of the calf that appeared 5 months after the introduction of a tattoo. The tattoo depicted the queen of hearts (as on a playing card); both lesions were restricted to the “heart,” where a red ink had been applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911425487">Figure 1</xref>). The other parts of the tattoo were unremarkable. The patient reported that the lesions had grown fairly rapidly without any associated systemic symptoms. There was no clinical evidence of lymph node enlargement. Details as to the chemical composition of the ink were not available; however, the tattoo parlor did report that the suspension used to produce the red color included mercury. Both lesions were removed yielding 2 ellipses of skin that showed 2 unevenly raised, fairly well demarcated pink to red nodules.</p>

<sec id="section4-1066896911425487">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 46-year-old male patient presented with an indurated and elevated polypoid lesion measuring about 1 cm in largest dimensions, which developed in the background of a tattoo. The process affected only the red parts of a tattoo and left the black part of the tattoo completely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911425487">Figure 2</xref>). The lesion had started to develop 4 months after tattooing, was becoming increasingly harder and pruritic. Regional lymph nodes were not enlarged, and systemic symptoms and signs were absent. A 5-mm punch biopsy was initially performed but was subsequently followed by excision of the entire lesion. The patient was lost to follow-up.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The submitted tissues were fixed in formalin and routinely processed. Paraffin tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, 4-µm-thick sections were cut and simultaneously deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated for epitope retrieval in the Dako PT Link with a 3-in-1 procedure. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on a Dako Autostainer Link 48 using commercially purchased antibodies directed against CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD10, CD20, and CD68.</p>

<title>Case 1</title>
<p>Sections of the cutaneous specimen showed focal parakeratotic or hyperkeratotic changes of the epidermis. Some keratinocytes were necrotic. The mid and upper dermis was diffusely infiltrated by small lymphoid cells featuring small nuclei and scant cytoplasm. A grenz zone was fairly well recognized despite the presence of a focal interface pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911425487">Figure 3</xref>). Particles of bright red granular material were present, either extracellularly or intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896911425487">Figure 4</xref>): these did not extend beyond the boundaries of the dermal area involved by the lymphoid cells. Collections of epithelioid histiocytes containing red pigment were noted as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896911425487">Figure 5</xref>). No lymphoid follicle was recognized. The lymphoid cells expressed T-cell markers—including CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8—and were mostly negative for CD7, CD10, and CD30. CD20 positive cells were scattered within the population of T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1066896911425487">Figure 6</xref>). Histiocytes were positive for CD68.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>Low-power examination of the punch biopsy from the red area of the tattoo revealed mild hyperkeratosis and achantosis. Prominent interface reaction pattern was seen along the entire length of the punch biopsy and was characterized by lymphocyte exocytosis into the basal layer of the epidermis coupled by focal vacuolar degeneration and isolated necrosis of basal keratinocytes. A dense perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate composed predominantly of lymphocytes was present in the upper and middle parts of the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1066896911425487">Figure 7</xref>). Scattered within the inflammatory cell infiltrate were macrophages, either as isolated cells or forming small groups, reminiscent of epithelioid granulomas. Numerous fine red granules were seen within the cytoplasm of macrophages. Much rarely, fine red granules were also present extracellularly within the dermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1066896911425487">Figure 8</xref>). Immunohistochemical profile of the lymphoid cells was basically comparable to that of case 1, that is, CD3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1066896911425487">Figure 8</xref>, inset) and CD4-positive T lymphocytes predominated and contained scattered CD20-positive B lymphocytes. Mild loss of CD2 and CD7 was noted. Interestingly, prominent lymphoid infiltration was limited to the area of red pigment deposition. A sharp delineation of inflammation was seen toward the area of black pigment deposition, which was completely devoid of any inflammation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tattoo dye is a well-known cause of CPL, the clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to pruritic plaques or nodules. Microscopically, these lesions exhibit a variable pattern: they are often sustained by B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911425487">1</xref></sup> or T cells accompanied by an interface/lichenoid or granulomatous infiltrate composed of polytypic T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911425487">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911425487">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911425487">8</xref></sup> Lesion flare-up secondary to sunlight exposure has also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911425487">4</xref></sup> The exact pathogenesis of tattoo-related CPL remains obscure. A delayed allergic reaction to metal compounds and the azo dyes used to prepare the ink solutions is currently viewed as the most important cause since these substances are known to produce abnormal immune response in the skin. In fact, tattoo inks are composed of pigments that are suspended in a carrier solution. Today’s pigments are primarily metal salts, include carbon (black), cobalt aluminate (deep blue), iron hydroxide (brown), cadmium sulfate (yellow), and mercury sulfide (red).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911425487">1</xref></sup> While the pigment obviously gives the tattoo its color, the purpose of the carrier is to disinfect the pigment suspension, keep it evenly mixed, and facilitate its application. In most cases, the abnormal lymphoid infiltrates manifest clinically as raised, firm, pink nodules or plaque-like dermal indurations that are often pruritic. Systemic symptoms are generally not present. Polymorphic reactions, such as a lichenoid reaction and CPL, may coexist in the same patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911425487">6</xref></sup> Phenotypically, T (diffuse) and B (follicular) cytoarchitectural patterns have been documented, with B-cell lesions apparently being more prevalent. CPLs occur most frequently in the red areas of the tattoo where cinnabar, or pigment-containing mercury sulfide, has been applied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911425487">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911425487">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911425487">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911425487">9</xref></sup> Less often, CPL may also be seen in the absence of mercury, as with chrome or cobalt salts used for green or blue green.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911425487">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911425487">7</xref></sup> Timing for the appearance of the lesions is variable and may range from a few months to several years.</p>
<p>In our 2 cases we documented fleshy, raised nodules arising in the background of tattoos where a red pigment had been applied several months earlier. No lesion could be identified in other tattoo areas where blue or black ink had been injected. This is in keeping with the prevailing opinion that tattoo-related CPL is most often secondary to the application of red pigment. Information regarding the precise chemical composition of the dyes used in our patients’ tattoos was not obtainable; however, one of the tattoo-parlor managers did state that mercury was among the components of the ink solutions.</p>
<p>Basically, the histologic diagnosis of tattoo CPL may be correctly rendered if appropriate clinical information is available and some diagnostic clues are recognized including a top-heavy infiltrate that is well delineated laterally, associated with a grenz zone, scattered pigment particles, and sometimes epithelioid macrophages. The latter may contain engulfed pigment granules, although extracellular pigment particles are more commonly seen. In both of our cases scattered collections of macrophages containing ink particles were also seen. Application of a standard immunohistochemical panel for lymphoid antigen confirmed that the lymphoid cells expressed a polytypic T-cell profile with only a few small scattered B cells. No germinal centers were recognized. In addition, the histiocytes were positive for CD68.</p>
<p>Microscopic interpretation of tattoo-related CPL may be problematic when patient data are missing or are incomplete. In addition, small tissue specimens such as punch or shave biopsies may be only partly representative of the lesions, thus causing diagnostic difficulties. Likewise, when the dermal density of the ink particles is scant, they may be overlooked.</p>
<p>The differential diagnosis of the dense T-cell lymphoid infiltrate seen in our cases includes a number of conditions. Lymphoid infiltrates of the skin pose some of the most challenging diagnostic problems in pathology. Although the popularity and accessibility of special techniques such as immunohistochemistry and molecular pathology have partly facilitated the diagnostic task, careful clinicopathologic correlation remains the most critical step, since only the combined assessment of presenting symptoms, conventional histology, and medical follow-up can ultimately differentiate between reactive and neoplastic lesions. In tattoo-related CPL featuring T cells, the most important disease to be ruled out microscopically is obviously malignant lymphoma. Both CPL and lymphoma share a number of histologic features such as hypercellularity and the presence of a grenz zone. A monotonous cell component, as often seen in small biopsy fragments, may further support the presence of malignant lymphoma. However, a bottom-heavy rather than a top-heavy infiltrate is generally recognized in cutaneous lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas feature small cells with indented or slightly lobulated nuclei. The atypical lymphoid cells may infiltrate the subcutaneous fat and skin adnexa including the pilar muscles. Cells may be packed and also show smudging of chromatin. Immunohistochemistry may be used to complement traditional morphologic evaluation; however, staining for T-cell markers may not be fully conclusive for lymphoma if the case is not supported by clinical evidence. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia eventuating in B-cell cutaneous lymphoma has been reported only in 1 case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911425487">10</xref></sup> Among low-grade disorders, primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium-sized pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma deserves mention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911425487">11</xref></sup> This is usually a solitary and indolent lesion characteristically arising in the head and neck and manifesting as erythematous, raised cutaneous nodules. Although sustained by phenotypically equivocal lymphoid infiltrates, its true neoplastic nature is often revealed by a combination of morphologic features, including nuclear pleomorphism, cytologic atypia, invasion of adnexa and pilar smooth muscle, and molecular genetic studies demonstrating T cell reception rearrangement in about 70% of cases.</p>
<p>Extramedullary granulocytic sarcoma is a rare neoplastic disease that has a predilection for the skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911425487">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911425487">13</xref></sup> Solitary granulocytic sarcoma may be difficult to recognize especially if there is no clinical or laboratory evidence of myelogenous leukemia. Microscopically, tumor cells grow in diffuse sheaths within the dermis and feature immature cells that may, at a glance, recall lymphoid cells. Diagnostic clues include kidney- or horse-shoe-shaped nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm granules, and immunopositivity for myeloperoxidase. In CPLs associated with a tattoo the pigment granules are either extracellular or, as in one of our cases, within histiocytes.</p>
<p>In summary, we have reported 2 new cases of CPL that developed following the application of tattoo. In both cases the lesions occurred within the cutaneous areas of the red color, which is where ink containing the red pigment was injected. Microscopically, a diffuse dermal infiltrate of polytypic T cells was seen, raising the suspicion of malignant lymphoma. A careful, integrated clinicopathologic approach is essential to make sure that the patients receive the appropriate treatment.</p>
