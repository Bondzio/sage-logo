<abstract>
<p>Body image concern has long been linked with unhealthy restrained eating patterns among women, yet scant research has examined factors to disrupt this process. At the same time, feminine stereotypes prescribe that women should be small, restrict their movements, speak softly, and limit their food intake (e.g., through dieting). Here, we examined whether women’s postural constriction or expansion moderated the relation between body shape concern and restrained eating, predicting that expansive postures would interrupt this robust relation. As a secondary aim, we investigated whether women spontaneously adopted constrictive postures and to what extent postures contributed to restrained eating under baseline conditions. Specifically, women’s postural position (constricted, expanded, or baseline posture) was manipulated and restrained eating was measured. Results showed that at high levels of body shape concern, women sitting in expansive postures restrained their eating less compared to women in constrictive postures. Further, spontaneously expansive (vs. spontaneously constrictive) postures were associated with less restrained eating among women. Thus, postural expansion attenuated the link between body shape concern and restrained eating whereas postural constriction exacerbated the link. Implications for gender performativity and possible interventions for restrained eating are discussed.</p>

<p>Feminine prescriptions suggest that women should act small, restrict their movements, speak softly, and take up as little space as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>), including through limiting their food intake (e.g., dieting). For example, women eating small meals are regarded as possessing more stereotypically feminine traits relative to women eating larger meals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313476477">Chaiken &amp; Pliner, 1987</xref>), and this motivated behavior among women is connected to attempts to appear socially desirable and feminine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313476477">Mori, Chaiken, &amp; Pliner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313476477">Pliner &amp; Chaiken, 1990</xref>). At the same time, feminist scholars have long noted that understanding the role of the body is critical to fully understanding gendered experiences (Fredrickson, Hendler, Nilsen, O’Barr, &amp; Roberts, 2011; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313476477">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684313476477">Johnston-Robledo &amp; Fred, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684313476477">Smith, Hawkinson, &amp; Paull, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>). Indeed, one of the primary ways women are restricted in society is through their bodies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young (1990</xref>, p. 153) suggested that “women in sexist societies are physically handicapped” and, due to this sexist environment, women “learn to live out our existence in accordance with the definition of patriarchal culture assigned to us, as we are physically inhibited, confined, positioned, and objectified.”</p>
<p>Two important areas of research have developed that examine exactly <italic>how</italic> women take up less space. Body image and objectification researchers have considered why and how women attempt to create and maintain bodies that are less capable of occupying space. For example, although on average women have smaller bodies than men, women often strive, through dieting and excessive exercise, for bodies that are even smaller and thinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684313476477">Smolak &amp; Levine, 2001</xref>). Moreover, women more than men perceive themselves as being overweight even when they are at a healthy weight for their height and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313476477">Cash &amp; Hicks, 1990</xref>). Such “body shape concern” represents the extent to which women experience apprehension over their body shape being evaluated, including cognitive distortions, negative emotional responses, and avoidance-based behaviors stemming from the “phenomenological experience of feeling fat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper, Taylor, Cooper, &amp; Fairburn, 1987</xref>, p. 490). We suggest that body shape concern may be one indicator of the degree to which women’s perceptions of their bodies deviate from feminine prescriptions for appearance. Because it is impossible for most women to achieve the cultural ideal of thinness prescribed by feminine stereotypes, body shape concern is a likely consequence of the discrepancy between what women believe they should look like and what they actually look like (also see related concepts of body shame: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313476477">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>; body dissatisfaction: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684313476477">Smolak &amp; Levine, 2001</xref>; and appearance anxiety: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684313476477">Dion, Dion, &amp; Keelan, 1990</xref>). Body shape concern and its correlates have been identified as important contributors to restrained and disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684313476477">Calogero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll, Quinn, &amp; Twenge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313476477">Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313476477">Peat &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313476477">Tiggemann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684313476477">Tiggemann &amp; Kuring, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313476477">Wilson, Tripp, &amp; Boland, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, feminist, embodiment, and non-verbal behavior scholars suggest that women may take up less physical space by occupying more or less expansive postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>). Women’s constrictive body postures can be in response to other people’s actions (e.g., a woman’s submissive posture following a man’s dominant posture)—resulting in gender-power dynamics due to non-verbal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684313476477">Hecht &amp; LaFrance, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313476477">Dovidio, Brown, Heltman, Ellyson, &amp; Keating, 1988</xref>)—or may be internalized, with women policing their own non-verbal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>). Importantly, as a result of other people’s actions and internalized prescriptions, girls and women take up less actual physical space (e.g., spontaneously sit in more constrictive postures: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>), and occupy less symbolic space (e.g., speak less in interactions: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684313476477">Saguy, Quinn, Dovidio, &amp; Pratto, 2010</xref>) than men.</p>
<p>Despite the important implications for disordered and restrained eating, research and theory in body shape concern and posture have developed largely independently of one another. In the present work, we provide a novel integration of these literatures and consider whether inconsistencies between body posture and self-perceptions of one’s body may cause women to adjust their eating behavior to reduce these discrepancies. Although research showing that body shape concern (and related body shame, body dissatisfaction, and appearance anxiety) is associated with restrained eating is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684313476477">Calogero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313476477">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313476477">Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313476477">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>), we extended this seminal research by testing whether restrained eating tendencies can be offset when women sit in non-feminine postures (expansively) or enhanced when women sit in feminine postures (constrictively). Toward that end, we review theory and research that (a) provides support for the linkage between body shape concern and restrained eating and (b) identifies situational factors that may facilitate or disrupt this link to introduce the novel hypothesis that postural constriction and expansion may importantly moderate this link.</p>
<sec id="section1-0361684313476477">
<title>Body Shape Concern and Restrained Eating</title>
<p>Generally speaking, body shape concern is related to long-term eating disorder symptomology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313476477">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). In addition to disordered eating patterns over time, we suggest that women’s concern over their body shape may put them at risk of restrained eating in situations where one must decide how much food to eat in a single sitting (i.e., discrete eating experiences). Although no published research to our knowledge has demonstrated that body shape concern contributes to restrained eating for discrete eating experiences, its correlates (e.g., body shame) have been linked with discrete instances of disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684313476477">Calogero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313476477">Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684313476477">Peat &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313476477">Tiggemann, 2011</xref>). We extended this research to examine whether the relation between body shape concern and restrained eating emerges in discrete eating situations, as well as considered which factors facilitate or disrupt this relation.</p>
<p>Although some women are more prone to restrained and disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684313476477">Stice, 2002</xref>), particularly women high in body shape concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>), previous research suggests that some contexts may exacerbate this link. Appearance-focused situations (such as wearing tight-fitting, revealing clothing and looking in a mirror) moderate the relation between self-objectification—an important precursor to body shape concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313476477">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684313476477">Oehlhof, Musher-Eizenman, Neufeld, &amp; Hauser, 2009</xref>)—and restrained eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684313476477">Moradi &amp; Huang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684313476477">Szymanski, Moffitt, &amp; Carr, 2011</xref>). Although experiencing state self-objectification may exacerbate the link between body shape concern and restrained eating, it is also critical to consider what factors might attenuate the body shape concern → restrained eating link.</p>
<p>Because of the robust association between body shape concern and disordered eating, researchers have mostly offered intensive clinical interventions to disrupt this link (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684313476477">Tylka &amp; Augustus-Horvath, 2011</xref>, for a review). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684313476477">Alberts, Thewissen, and Raes (2012)</xref> introduced an 8-week mindfulness program to women exhibiting disordered eating symptoms (vs. a wait-listed control group). The mindfulness program met once weekly, and participants were encouraged to practice its components daily. The program included five components: mindful eating, introceptive awareness (i.e., recognizing internal body states such as hunger), monitoring eating-relevant cognitions/emotions, acceptance of one’s body, and daily action plans related to changing maladaptive eating behaviors. The program’s effectiveness was measured by assessing disordered eating and body shape concern pre- and post-intervention. Participants in the mindfulness intervention (vs. control) group showed reduced disordered eating, including lower external eating (e.g., stress-induced), lower emotional eating, and lower body shape concern at post-test. Mindfulness-based training, then, could be one useful (albeit time intensive) strategy to reduce restrained eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684313476477">Tylka &amp; Augustus-Horvath, 2011</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684313476477">Daubenmier, 2005</xref>). In sum, most considerations aimed to disrupt the body image concern → restrained eating link have investigated long-term interventions (e.g., ranging from several days to several months, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313476477">Tiggemann, 2011</xref>), rather than situational manipulations designed to change immediate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684313476477">Fitzsimmons-Craft, 2011</xref>). Thus, the question remains: What can women high in body shape concern do on a moment-to-moment basis to become less susceptible to restrained eating? Extending these considerations, we next turn to body posture as a potential momentary intervention that may disrupt the body shape concern → disordered eating link.</p>

<title>Women’s Body Postures</title>
<p>The constriction of the gendered female body is pervasive in women’s lives. Women constrict their bodies in response to other people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684313476477">Dovidio et al., 1988</xref>) and internalize outsiders’ views of their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313476477">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684313476477">McKinley &amp; Hyde, 1996</xref>). Thus, women often police their own and others’ bodies to conform to stereotypically feminine prescriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684313476477">Fredrickson &amp; Roberts, 1997</xref>), occupy small physical spaces with their bodies (e.g., sit in constrictive postures: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>), and occupy small symbolic space (e.g., speaking less in interactions: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684313476477">Saguy et al., 2010</xref>), even without explicit pressure from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684313476477">LaFrance, Henley, Hall, &amp; Halberstadt, 1997</xref>). Similar to women’s reliance on “eating lightly” to communicate femininity and social desirability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313476477">Mori et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313476477">Pliner &amp; Chaiken, 1990</xref>), women are also socialized to engage in postural constriction as an indicator of gender performance. Despite the fact that women may engage in postural constriction to signal their femininity and obtain intrapersonal and interpersonal rewards from adhering to gendered expectations, there are a number of psychological costs associated with such constriction.</p>
<sec id="section3-0361684313476477">
<title>Constrictive postures</title>
<p>Constrictive postures prescribed by feminine stereotypes are associated with powerlessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313476477">Carney, Cuddy, &amp; Zap, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684313476477">Schubert, 2004</xref>). Most relevant to the present work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313476477">Carney and colleagues (2010)</xref> had women hold expansive, open postures or constrictive, closed postures for 2 minutes total. Following the postures, participants completed a risk-taking behavioral task, recorded self-perceptions of power, and contributed a saliva sample to be analyzed for testosterone and cortisol levels. Results showed that women in the constrictive postures felt less powerful, engaged in less risk-taking behavior, and showed hormonal changes correlated with low power (decreased testosterone and increased cortisol) relative to women in expansive postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313476477">Carney et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the costs, postural constriction also bestows some benefits; girls and women experience intrapersonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>) and interpersonal (e.g., social approval: Martin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684313476477">Tylka &amp; Augustus-Horvath, 2011</xref>) rewards when their physical bodies conform to the constrictive feminine ideal. As an example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts and Arefi-Afshar (2007)</xref> examined women’s experiences in slumped (a specific manifestation of postural constriction) or upright (a specific manifestation of postural expansion) postures. In the study, women completed a cognitive task to serve as the basis for the manipulated feedback. Then, participants experienced a covert manipulation designed to place them in a slumped or upright posture as part of a study on “physiological effects of body posture.” Specifically, while in the assigned posture, participants received positive feedback regarding the cognitive task. Participants subsequently completed a math test and satisfaction of math task measure. Results showed that women in slumped seated postures, compared to other women in upright postures, were more accurate and more satisfied with their performance on a math test and experienced some psychological benefits. Thus, women may adopt constrictive postures because constrictive postures confer some benefits over costs and expansive postures confer some costs over benefits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0361684313476477">
<title>Expansive postures</title>
<p>Expansive postures are dominant, non-verbal behaviors that may be viewed as gender-role inappropriate when performed by women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley (1977)</xref> theorized mostly negative reactions to women exerting dominant behaviors during interactions with men, including being ignored, having their behaviors attributed to sexual interest, and being derogated or punished for violating gender roles. Henley noted that although women’s dominant non-verbal behaviors may be explicitly accepted, they are often implicitly countered with dominance behaviors from men to restore the balance of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684313476477">Rudman, 1998</xref>). Postural expansion, for women, carries some risks due to the threat of backlash when used in interpersonal contexts with men.</p>
<p>Yet, inducing women to sit in expansive postures, which are inconsistent with the cultural ideal of thinness (smallness) may cause the importance of thinness to be less salient or be regarded as a less approach-worthy goal, at least in that situation. Although not directly tested in previous research, two studies can be reinterpreted as consistent with this suggestion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684313476477">Engel et al. (2006)</xref> trained undergraduate women to either approach or avoid locations where weight/shape words inconsistent with the cultural ideal of thinness (e.g., blubber) were present. Paired words were presented and a letter recognition task followed each trial presenting either “q” or “p” as the critical letter. In the approach condition, the critical letter was located primarily where the weight/shape word was presented; in the avoidance condition, the critical letter was located primarily where the neutral word (e.g., bumper) was presented. Women’s eating attitudes were then assessed. Engel et al. found that approaching words like blubber, fatty, or overweight resulted in less disordered eating attitudes compared to avoiding such words. Applied to the present work, inducing women to adopt expansive postures may be akin to inducing women to approach body words that are inconsistent with feminine prescriptive stereotypes of thinness—and thus may promote less restrained eating in women.</p>
<p>Additionally, considering the classic swimsuit-sweater study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson, Roberts, Noll, Quinn, and Twenge (1998)</xref> manipulated state self-objectification and measured restrained eating. In the objectifying condition, women wore the revealing swimsuit, which was also constrictive; in the control condition, women wore the non-revealing sweater, which was also expansive. Results showed that the state self-objectification produced by wearing a swimsuit (vs. a sweater) in front of a mirror predicted body shame, which then predicted women’s restrained eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313476477">Tiggemann, 2011</xref>), but only for women high in trait self-objectification. Reinterpreted through the current posture framework, it is possible that wearing a less constrictive and more concealing piece of clothing such as a sweater prompts women to be less aware of the degree to which their body shape may not fit the cultural ideal of thinness compared to wearing a more constrictive and revealing piece of clothing such as a swimsuit. In the current work, we extend this seminal research by manipulating body posture without confounding it with the revealing nature of clothing to determine the influence of posture specifically.</p>

<title>Weighing costs versus benefits</title>
<p>Despite their benefits (e.g., more positive experiences of success feedback: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>), constrictive postures appear to contribute to women’s subjugation. Constricting one’s body causes women to feel powerless, take fewer risks, and show hormonal changes associated with less dominance and more stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313476477">Carney et al., 2010</xref>). Indirect evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684313476477">Engel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>) also suggests that factors associated with postural constriction (e.g., activated concepts, tight clothing) contribute to disordered eating attitudes and behaviors. Thus, although women may subjectively feel somewhat positively when occupying small spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>), postural constriction may still prompt them to act in line with the feminine stereotype that women should be small by engaging in more restrained eating. Specifically, focusing on additional costs of adopting constrictive postures as well as potential benefits of adopting expansive postures, we suggest that sitting small and adopting constrictive postures may exacerbate the relation between body shape concern and restrained eating, whereas sitting big and adopting expansive postures may attenuate this relation.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we suggest that discrepancies between self-perceptions and space occupied signal a gender violation, causing women to engage in gendered behavior to reduce discrepancies. Because they have internalized the feminine stereotype that women should be small, women high in body shape concern are chronically worried that their bodies and body parts are too fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>). These women may restrain their eating when their self-perception is inconsistent with the amount of space their body actually occupies; the discrepancy from feeling fat, but occupying a small, constrictive space signals a gender violation, causing women to perform gender by restraining their eating to reduce the discrepancy between the self-perception and space occupied. However, when women feel fat, but occupy a more expansive space, such discrepancies should not emerge, freeing women from restraining their eating. Moreover, women low in body shape concern are less concerned that their bodies and body parts are too fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>). These women may also adjust their eating when their self-perception is inconsistent with the amount of space their body occupies; the discrepancy from feeling thin, but occupying an expansive space signals a gender violation, causing women to again restrain their eating to reduce the discrepancy. However, when women feel thin, but occupy a smaller space, such discrepancies between their self-views and space occupied should not emerge, releasing women from the gender performance of restricted eating. In sum, the effect of women’s self-perceptions of the shape of their bodies (thin vs. fat) may depend on posture, which frees or constrains eating in line with feminine prescriptions.</p>

<title>Hypotheses and Overview</title>
<p>Based on the foregoing rationale, we investigated if posture moderated the relationship between body shape concern and restrained eating for women. We hypothesized an interaction between body shape concern and posture on restrained eating. Specifically, we tested whether the simple slopes differed (relation between body shape concern for each posture condition) and whether posture condition differences emerged at low and high levels of body shape concern. First, for the simple slopes hypothesis, we expected that body shape concern would be positively associated with restrained eating among women in constrictive postures, whereas body shape concern would be negatively associated with restrained eating in expansive postures. We included a baseline condition in which we asked women to sit spontaneously to tease out the direction of the effects; however, it was possible that when undirected, women might situate themselves into constricted postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>), which we also examined. Second, for the condition differences hypothesis, we expected expansive postures to cause less restrained eating and constrictive postures to cause more restrained eating at high levels of body shape concern. At low levels of body shape concern, we expected the opposite pattern—with expansive postures causing more restrained eating and constrictive postures causing less restrained eating.</p>
<p>As well, despite extensive feminist scholarship theorizing that women habitually adopt constrictive postures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>), there is little direct empirical evidence consistent with this proposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>). Thus, a secondary, more exploratory purpose of our research was to examine the baseline condition to consider women’s spontaneous postures in the absence of any situational cues to determine (a) whether women spontaneously adopt constrictive postures and (b) if the relation between baseline posture and restrained eating differed depending on body shape concern.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Following informed consent, 97 women (86.6% Caucasian, 4.1% Hispanic/Latina, 4.1% Asian, 3.1% African American, 2.1% unreported) with a mean age of 19.61 years (<italic>SD </italic>= 1.92, range = 18–29) participated. Participants’ body mass index (BMI) levels were in the average range (<italic>M</italic> = 22.44, <italic>SD </italic>= 3.10, range = 17.75–33.28). Twelve additional participants (11%) were removed due to suspicion because they did not believe that the medical monitor was actually recording their physiological responses (which was a critical aspect of our cover story as outlined below).</p>

<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<sec id="section10-0361684313476477">
<title>Body posture</title>
<p>Women participants were told that they would be engaging in a study examining the psychology of marketing and physiology. To manipulate posture, participants placed a “medical monitor” on their wrist and ankle in the “physiology” portion of the study. To ostensibly provide an accurate measurement for the monitor (providing the cover story for the manipulation: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684313476477">Tiedens &amp; Fragale, 2003</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>), participants were asked to place their hands and feet on two pieces of tape that were either 4.5 inches apart (constrictive) or 31.5 inches apart (expansive). Participants in the baseline condition were expressly asked to sit naturally: “In order for the computer to record your data, we’ll need to you to place your feet on the floor and your hands on the table. It’s very important that you remain in a natural position at all times so the computer can record your physiological accurately.” Then, all participants were instructed to keep their backs pressed firmly against the back of the chair, so that we did not inadvertently confound our constrictive versus expansive posture manipulation with upright (vs. slumped) posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>). Participants sat in the posture for approximately 30 minutes (until the completion of the product tests); the “medical monitor” was then removed and a spontaneous posture was occupied during collection of the individual difference measures.</p>
<p>As a manipulation check, we videotaped women’s posture and the amount of space occupied through a two-way mirror. The blinds on the two-way mirror were lowered below the participant’s eye level, in order to eliminate the possibility of introducing a perceived “observer” and objectifying context (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313476477">Gapinski, Brownell, &amp; LaFrance, 2003</xref>). Participants consented (or not) to being videotaped prior to beginning the experiment; thus, they were aware that their behavior was somewhat public (i.e., could be seen by the researchers in the study). Most (82, 84.5%) participants agreed to be videotaped, which did not vary across experimental condition, χ<sup>2</sup>(2) = .52<italic>, p</italic> = .77.</p>

<sec id="section11-0361684313476477">
<title>Restrained eating</title>
<p>Restrained eating was assessed by asking participants to sample and rate pretzels (chocolate or plain)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0361684313476477">1</xref></sup> in the “marketing” portion of the experiment. Specifically, participants were given 10 pretzels and could eat as many pretzels as they wanted in 3 minutes. The number of pretzels participants ate ranged from 0 to 10 (<italic>M = </italic>3.38, <italic>SD </italic>= 2.37). The number of pretzels remaining at the end of the 3 minutes represented restrained eating because the pretzels were available to eat but participants restrained themselves from eating all of them; thus, the number of pretzels left served as the primary dependent measure. Our measure of restrained eating is consistent with previous research, which assessed symbolic restraint—eating only a portion of food presented (e.g., leaving a few bites of a cookie: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>Participants completed the 34-item Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>), which assesses the frequency of body shape and body evaluation concern over the last 4 weeks on a scale from 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 6 (<italic>always</italic>).<sup>

Among disordered eating samples, the BSQ was positively associated with body dissatisfaction and eating attitudes. The BSQ’s development technique (i.e., conducting interviews with anorexic and bulimic individuals) makes its items especially relevant to identifying restrained eating patterns in non-clinical samples who are at risk of developing a clinical eating disorder. Among a non-clinical sample, for example, participants expressing concern about their weight and shape reported higher BSQ scores relative to participants not expressing concern about their weight and shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>).

<p>Restrained eating was examined in a hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test our main hypotheses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0361684313476477">3</xref>
</sup> To interpret main effects, body shape concern (<italic>M </italic>= 82.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 28.61), BMI (<italic>M</italic> = 22.44, <italic>SD </italic>= 3.09), hunger (<italic>M</italic> = 2.06, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22), and difficulty (<italic>M</italic> = 4.21, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.59) were centered. Posture was analyzed using two dummy codes: DC 1 = expansive versus constrictive and DC 2 = baseline versus constrictive, with constrictive posture serving as the comparison group. Covariates (BMI, hunger, and difficulty) were entered in Step 1, body shape concern was entered in Step 2, posture was entered in Step 3, and the Posture × Body Shape Concern interaction was entered in Step 4 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0361684313476477">Table 1</xref>).

<p>To interpret the hypothesized interaction, we first compared simple slopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684313476477">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>) for body shape concern and restrained eating for constrictive, baseline, and expansive postures. In constrictive postures, more body shape concern was associated with more restrained eating, <italic>b</italic> = .04, <italic>SE</italic> = .02<italic>, t</italic>(83) = 2.24, <italic>p</italic> = .014, one-tailed. In expansive postures, more body shape concern was associated with less restrained eating, <italic>b</italic> = −.02, <italic>SE</italic> = .01<italic>, t</italic>(83) = −1.78, <italic>p</italic> = .039, one-tailed. In baseline postures, body shape concern and restrained eating were unrelated, <italic>b</italic> = −.009, <italic>SE</italic> = .02<italic>, t</italic>(83) = −.57, <italic>p</italic> = .286, one-tailed.</p>
<p>To further consider the interaction between posture and body shape concern, we compared condition differences at high (+2 <italic>SD</italic>) and low (−2 <italic>SD</italic>) levels of body shape concern.</p>
<p>As predicted, at high levels of body shape concern, women in expansive postures restrained their eating significantly less compared to women in constrictive postures (<italic>b </italic>= −3.27, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.26, <italic>p</italic> = .011). Furthermore, women with higher body shape concern in baseline postures engaged in less restrained eating relative to constrictive postures (<italic>b</italic> = −2.91, <italic>SE </italic>= 1.33, <italic>p</italic> = .032). Thus, among women with greater body shape concern, women in expansive and baseline postures restricted their eating less relative to women in constrictive postures. Regarding lower body shape concern, women in expansive postures restrained their eating more relative to women in constrictive postures (<italic>b</italic> = 3.19, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.20, <italic>p</italic> = .010), but women in baseline and constrictive postures did not differ (<italic>b</italic> = 1.96, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.26, <italic>p </italic>= .125).</p>
<p>To explore women’s relations with restrained eating in the baseline posture condition according to the secondary purpose of the present work, we conducted a partial correlation between actual space occupied and restrained eating, controlling for body shape concern. We reasoned that women sitting closer to the contrived constrictive posture would restrain their eating more whereas women sitting closer to the expansive posture would restrain their eating less. Indeed, a marginally significant negative correlation emerged between body space occupied and restrained eating in the baseline posture condition, <italic>r</italic>(23) = −.40, <italic>p </italic>= .051, suggesting that as women spontaneously occupied more body space, they were less likely to engage in restrained eating. Conversely, when women spontaneously occupied less space with their bodies, they were more likely to engage in restrained eating.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prescriptions for femininity suggest that women should occupy less physical body space through dieting and constricting their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>). Here we offered a novel integration of the body shape concern and posture literatures and provided experimental evidence that posture plays an important role in restrained eating, especially among women who are highly concerned with their body shape. Consistent with our rationale, women with lower body shape concern perceived themselves more in line with feminine prescriptions for appearance, and when they were seated in constrictive postures, the space their body occupied was consistent with self-perceptions, and therefore restraint was released; they felt thin and sat small, and thus, ate more. In this case, women felt they were meeting the cultural prescriptions so they could satiate. By contrast, when women with lower body shape concern were seated in expansive postures, the space their body occupied was inconsistent with self-perceptions, and therefore they increased their restraint; they felt thin, but sat big, and thus ate less. In this case, eating was restrained to maintain feelings of thinness (lower fatness) and reduce size (symbolically) in the expanded space.</p>
<p>Women with higher body shape concern perceived themselves less in line with feminine prescriptions for appearance, and when they were seated in constrictive postures, the space their body occupied was inconsistent with self-perceptions, and therefore they increased their restraint; they felt fat, but sat small, and thus, ate less. In this case, women ate less to align themselves with feminine appearance prescriptions. By contrast, when women with higher body shape concern were seated in expansive postures, the space their body occupied was consistent with self-perceptions, and therefore restraint was released; they felt fat and sat big, and thus, ate more. In this case, there was less pressure to conform to feminine appearance prescriptions and women could relax.</p>
<p>The inclusion of a novel baseline posture condition allowed us to examine women’s spontaneous postures. Baseline postures tending toward constriction were associated with more restrained eating and baseline postures tending toward expansion were associated with less restrained eating. Taken together, this pattern of data suggests that expanding one’s limbs outward may disrupt the link between body shape concern → restrained eating, and thus expansive postures appear to be serving as a protective factor. Furthermore, we identified a specific instance of gender performativity, in which discrepancies in women’s self-perception and body space occupied signaled a gender violation and led to modifications in eating behavior to reduce discrepancies and perform gender.</p>
<p>The novel contribution of our research is to offer an intervention geared toward healthy eating relying on situational, rather than dispositional, protective factors. We find utility in this approach, given that situational protective factors (i.e., sitting big) may offer innovative, immediate, and context-specific solutions to women’s restrained eating. For example, if a woman feels fat or negative toward her body size or shape, she could expand her body outward in order to minimize the salience or importance of feminine appearance prescriptions. In turn, she may not feel guilty for having more to eat in that situation. It is possible that “sitting big” might also be a longer-term solution for developing healthy eating habits in girls and young women, but sitting big all of the time may also result in negative backlash toward girls and women for violating their expected gender roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684313476477">Rudman, 1998</xref>). Future research should be conducted to explore whether this possibility is feasible. At the very least, however, the current study shows that expansive postures represent short-term strategies for women endorsing high body shape concern to reduce their restrained eating tendencies. Thus, our research suggests that short-term interventions are successful in disrupting the link between body shape concern and disordered eating.</p>
<p>Results also showed that baseline (vs. constrictive) postures were linked to less restrained eating for women higher in body shape concern. Because we videotaped participants, we documented whether women spontaneously adopted constricted postures in the baseline condition. Although a secondary aim of the project, to our knowledge, this is the first research to systematically examine whether women’s body postures are spontaneously constrictive and how such constriction contributes to restrained eating. Consistent with feminist theory on gendered negotiations of physical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>) and previous research on pre-adolescent girls’ tendencies toward postural constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684313476477">Martin, 1998</xref>), our data suggest that post-adolescent women, on average, in the baseline condition showed a tendency to sit constrictively. However, these same women did not engage in similar high levels of restrained eating when examining the baseline posture condition as a whole. Yet, closer examination of the baseline posture condition separately (based on actual body space occupied) revealed that more body space occupied was associated with less restrained eating, after controlling for body shape concern. This finding is telling because it suggests that women who spontaneously assume constrictive postures restrain their eating more, whereas women who assume expansive postures restrain their eating less—which is consistent with the results obtained from the experimentally manipulated constrictive and expansive postures.</p>
<p>Most feminist theory and research has focused on gender differences in posture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684313476477">Carney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684313476477">Roberts &amp; Arefi-Afshar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684313476477">Schubert, 2004</xref>), whereas we focused on the experience of different postures within gender. Uncovering the moderating role of posture in our study showed that women’s experiences are not universal; body shape concern does not consistently lead to restrained eating but rather it does so under specific conditions. Similarly, not every woman spontaneously engages in constrictive body postures, as evidenced by the variability within our baseline condition. We believe this critical analysis reflects an important contribution to feminist literature by empirically testing assertions articulated in feminist theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684313476477">Henley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684313476477">Young, 1990</xref>) and highlighting posture differences within women, thus representing the diversity of women’s experiences.</p>

<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>The current research has a number of theoretical implications for the body shape concern, posture, and restrained eating literatures. First, we showed that body shape concern predicts discrete eating experiences, which may contribute to disordered eating patterns over time. Previous research has focused primarily on eating attitudes or other long-term indicators of restrained eating, rather than actual eating behavior in a particular sitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684313476477">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). As well, by identifying a situational factor that changes immediate eating behavior, our work provides an important first step toward disrupting the established body shape concern → restrained eating link.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we project a feminist lens on Embodied Cognition Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313476477">Barsalou, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313476477">2010</xref>) by revealing how internalized social pressure to achieve the “thin ideal” can extend our understanding of women’s experiences in constricted and expanded body postures. Embodied Cognition Theory suggests that the body’s immediate functions or actions can activate representations in memory, which can lead to subsequent behavior consistent with the activated concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684313476477">Barsalou, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684313476477">2010</xref>). We believe the integration of feminist perspectives on notions of “small/skinny” and “large/overweight” helps to contextualize women’s actual experiences and constant battle to be thin and small. By examining the boundary conditions of embodied femininity, our understanding of this phenomenon is enhanced and contributes to an evolving, multidisciplinary Embodied Cognition Theory.</p>

<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>Our work carries a number of implications for women’s mentoring practices and disordered eating practitioners to improve women’s lives. Given the many possibilities for postural constriction that occur in actual behavior (e.g., sitting in a tight space), symbolic behavior (e.g., eating and talking less), and internalized views of the self (e.g., body image concern), our results may underestimate the long-term effects of feminine stereotypes to be small on restrained eating. It is possible that young women develop habits to become and be viewed as taking up less physical space, such as wearing form-fitting, corset-like sculpting undergarments and tight clothing (e.g., Spanx shapewear) or engaging in fat talk with their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684313476477">Gapinski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684313476477">Salk &amp; Engeln-Maddox, 2011</xref>). These behaviors may reinforce the social rewards obtained for possessing a smaller, more compact body and thus lead to habitual patterns of body constriction. However, female mentors may advocate awareness of this culturally prescribed phenomenon and its negative consequences and instead encourage female mentees to behave in a more empowered manner, requesting a larger chair, opting to wear looser clothing, or consciously uncrossing their legs and arms in order to practice expanding their bodies outward.</p>
<p>Further, because we investigated an outcome that disproportionately affects women compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313476477">Cash &amp; Hicks, 1990</xref>), our work offers a possible intervention for disordered eating among this higher risk population through postural expansion. Although restricted eating itself may not always translate directly into eating disorders, experimental proxies such as our measure of restrained eating provide an objective measure of how the relationship may operate among clinical populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684313476477">Tiggemann, 2011</xref>). Our data suggest that by engaging in postural expansion, even women high in body shape concern may be able to, at least temporarily, overcome restrained eating. Future research should further examine whether expansive postures can also contribute to healthy eating over time.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>The current studies examined young women from primarily Caucasian backgrounds with average body size, which limits the generalizability of our results. A complete understanding of constrictive versus expansive postures should consider multiple identities including comparisons with men, various BMI levels (e.g., overweight or obese), different race and ethnicities, and diverse sexual identities. These important social identities may help determine what is considered attractive; for instance, gay men may understand postural constriction similarly to heterosexual women as in objectification research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684313476477">Wiseman &amp; Moradi, 2010</xref>) or differently based on outward social cues offered to potential relationship partners. To the extent that constrictive postures are perceived as feminine, heterosexual men may experience such postures as violating heteronormative stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684313476477">Allen &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>) and thus reactively overeat in such conditions. Although our initial test with young, Caucasian women offers an important first step, extensions of our work may consider other social groups and intersecting identities.</p>
<p>As well, our research did not contain an individual difference measure of eating restraint to compare how much eating behavior changed in response to being seated in expansive, constrictive, or baseline postures. Because many college-age women do restrict their eating to some degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684313476477">Cash &amp; Hicks, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 1998</xref>), it may be useful to measure the extent to which eating is constrained or released from participants’ chronic levels under specific posture conditions. Future research could assess participants’ individual levels of eating restraint to be used as a covariate in analyses.</p>
<p>Our work also sets the stage for additional inquiries on gender, posture, and eating behavior. In the current study, we manipulated body posture and measured body shape concern; together, they predicted restrained eating among women. We focused on one indicator of body image most relevant to the “phenomenological experience of feeling fat” and related to internalized feminine stereotypes about being small: body shape concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684313476477">Cooper et al., 1987</xref>, p. 490). Yet, future work could expand on why baseline and expansive postures help reduce restrained eating among women with body shape concern and its correlates (e.g., body shame, body dissatisfaction, and appearance anxiety). It is possible that the negative relation among body shape concern and restrained eating in expansive postures in the current study emerged because the stereotypically masculine posture suppressed prescribed feminine stereotypes of powerlessness and activated powerfulness. For instance, if masculine postures cause less restrained eating in women with high body shape concern because they are stereotype-inconsistent with femininity then cognitive mechanisms (e.g., gender stereotype, power, food consumption stereotype activation) could also be investigated, in addition to behavioral outcomes shown in the current work. Beyond investigating mediators, moderating variables such as participants’ gender identity, endorsement of sexism, anti-fat prejudice, and internalization of the thin ideal could be assessed to determine how personal factors modify the relation between body image, posture, and restrained eating. For instance, women who strongly identify with their gender may restrain their eating even more when sitting in expansive postures and having high body shape concern because this individual difference reinforces the thin ideal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313476477">Chaiken &amp; Pliner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313476477">Mori et al., 1987</xref>). Future research will benefit from investigating these possible explanations and moderating factors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our research may be expanded by manipulating body posture, as in the current study, as well as body shape concern. For example, body shape concern could be experimentally manipulated by introducing a critically objectifying context. One might predict that expansive (vs. constrictive) postures would reduce restrained eating for objectified women similar to the findings reported in our study. Additionally, men’s intake of muscle-enhancing energy bars and protein shakes could be assessed under expansive (vs. constrictive) postures to better understand the relations between body shape concerns, posture, and the drive for muscularity. We believe gendered eating patterns are an interesting area of future inquiry because they may represent gender performativity and strategic self-presentation.</p>
<p>Scholars have recently renewed their interest in food consumption as gender performance. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684313476477">Vartanian, Herman, and Polivy (2007)</xref> suggested that public displays of eating small amounts of food and healthy food items are connected to attempts to appear more feminine, less masculine, and morally pure (especially for women, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684313476477">Chaiken &amp; Pliner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684313476477">Mori et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684313476477">Pliner &amp; Chaiken, 1990</xref>). Performativity, then, serves as an important component of women’s body displays and helps bring the gendered body back into psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684313476477">Fredrickson et al., 2011</xref>). Future research could manipulate the public or private nature of the body posture, in order to examine if attempts to appear more feminine are enhanced in public situations comprised of men, other women, or mixed-gender interactions. As well, future research could examine whether these effects vary as a function of type of food (e.g., high vs. low fat food). Taken together, the current research generates several critical future directions for fully understanding the interplay of gendered postural experiences, body image, and eating behavior.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Our research revealed an important moderator of the body image and restrained eating relationship observed in past research. We attempted to disrupt this relationship by simply prompting women to sit in stereotype inconsistent, expansive body postures. Such postural expansion resulted in less restrained eating among women high in body shape concern. Interestingly, we observed a similar pattern for restrained eating among women prompted to sit spontaneously who occupied a body space closer to expansive than constrictive. Constrictive postures, on the other hand, exacerbated the link between body image concern and restrained eating. We suggest that among women who feel fat, “those who sit big to eat big” may be doing themselves a favor by ripping away the shackles of rigid feminine stereotypes, whereas “those who sit small to eat small” may remain enslaved to these gendered expectations.</p>

<p>In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684313476477">Krahé &amp; Krause, 2010</xref>), we also opted to assess food type in addition to food amount. There were two possibilities for restrained eating: either choosing a healthy food option (plain pretzel) or leaving more food remaining. Only one participant did not eat any pretzels. Pretzel choice (chocolate or plain) did not vary as a function of posture, and thus the type of food variable was collapsed and only number of pretzels remaining was reported in the main analyses.</p>
