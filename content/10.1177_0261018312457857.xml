<abstract>
<p>Australian social policy and legislation in relation to gay men, lesbians and their families have been ‘revolutionized’ over recent years. Between 2008 and 2010 alone we have seen an incredible 84 separate pieces of legislation amended to recognize same sex relationships in Commonwealth legislation. For some rights activists, these reforms have been too long coming but for others they have created real disquiet about the way they position non-heterosexual relationships. This article draws on qualitative interviews undertaken with lesbian women who parent in New South Wales, Australia. Two waves of interviews are drawn on, the first occurring prior to Australian government reforms and the second after the reforms. The interviews provide an insight into the lived experiences of social policy reforms, highlighting how these women weigh up and reconcile legal recognition. These women’s experiences remind us again of the limitations of legal reform to bring about social or cultural change, particularly in the context of neo-liberalism. This paper seeks to ask what is the nature of this ‘revolution’ and, why now?</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over recent years there has been a quiet revolution in social policy responses to same sex relationships in Australia. These reforms have occurred with minimal fanfare. This ‘revolution’ has taken place at a time when social inclusion policies sit uncomfortably with neo-liberalism in Australia. This paper, drawing on two waves of in-depth interviews with lesbian parents, explores the lived experiences of policy reforms affecting same sex relationships. In particular it focuses on the experience of ‘recognition’ in the context of neo-liberalism, asking whether the momentum for these changes reflects four decades of calls for social justice and human rights or economic imperatives and neo-liberal ‘normalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457857">Duggan, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The paper firstly sets the context of these experiences by looking at the broad policy context as well as the detail of the legislative reforms, which affect all same sex people. The paper then describes the methodology, the participants and the findings from the two waves of interviews. The paper concludes with a discussion of the light thrown by these lived experiences on the origins and intent of these policy reforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0261018312457857">
<title>Broad policy context</title>
<p>The gay men and lesbian rights movement in Australia, similar to those in other western democracies, emerged in the late 1960s. The first rights march (which five decades later has morphed into the ‘Sydney Mardi Gras’) in Sydney was held in 1978 and violently opposed by the police. Central planks to the gay men and lesbian movement have historically been equal rights and recognition. The Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby, a leading Australian advocacy organization, chart on their website a sustained campaign of consultation, advocacy and research dating from 1992 for law reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261018312457857">Gay &amp; Lesbian Rights Lobby, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261018312457857">2010</xref>). Legal recognition has also been highlighted by research with 80% of same sex couples (<italic>n</italic> = 316) surveyed by Sarantakos calling for legal recognition of their relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261018312457857">1998</xref>: 223). Those respondents most likely to support legal recognition were in long-standing relationships, in custody of young children and over 30 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0261018312457857">Sarantakos, 1998</xref>: 223).</p>
<p>Through this activism the gay and lesbian rights movement sought to discursively construct their experiences as worthy of social policy attention. The collective action and the skilful practice of a large number of individuals transformed individual needs or problems into an issue of social policy, garnering widespread support in the general Australian population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261018312457857">Dalton et al., 1996</xref>: 4). As Iris Marion Young notes, achieving greater justice and social change through democratic processes is hard work, takes a long time and ‘requires determination and continued mobilization by advocates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457857">2000</xref>: 3–4). This activism has sought to address unequal processes of power, resource allocation and the discursive hegemony of heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0261018312457857">Young, 2000</xref>: 86).</p>
<p>The struggle for legal recognition has not been without fierce debate. Legal recognition was highly contested, from both the left and the right. Socially conservative governments, such as the Howard Coalition Government (1996–2007) resisted social policy change in relation to same sex relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261018312457857">Kentlyn, 2008</xref>). Fawcett et al. argue that ‘government inaction and non-decision, particularly when consistently pursued against pressure to the contrary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457857">2010</xref>: 10) is a form of social policy making that can be easily overlooked. For some conservative politicians opposition to recognition reflected a desire to protect the heterosexual institution of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261018312457857">Kentlyn, 2008</xref>). For others the resistance reflected broader debates about the proper role of the state and the family in which sexuality (among other issues) is regarded as a ‘private’ issue ‘immune from government action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457857">Fawcett et al., 2010</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>The election of the Rudd Labour Government in 2007 increased the likelihood of social policy reform in relation to gay men and lesbians. These reforms formed part of a broad ‘social inclusion agenda’ of the government which also sought to address other outstanding issues of justice, including issuing a formal apology to Indigenous Australians for past wrongs. As Bottrell and Goodwin note ‘social inclusion’ is a ‘relatively oblique concept … often employed in a catch-all way to articulate a range of hopes and desires for enhancing the lives of individuals and groups within society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261018312457857">2011a</xref>: 7). The concept (and its counterpart social exclusion) extends our understanding of what constitutes disadvantage beyond material poverty or low income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457857">Fawcett et al., 2010</xref>: 160–161). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457857">Ward (2009)</xref> notes the exclusion of gay men and lesbian women arises not only from material circumstances (poverty) but also from cultural/symbolical practices. Cultural discursive practices such as definitions of ‘de facto’ and ‘family’ in taxation, social security and other legislation resulted in gay men and lesbian women experiencing stigma, non-recognition and disrespect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457857">Ward, 2009</xref>). The policy shifts enacted by the Rudd Government contributed to ‘a politics of recognition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261018312457857">Fraser, 1997</xref>) aimed at the ‘revaluing of devalued identities so that they are accorded the recognition they need’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0261018312457857">Ward, 2009</xref>: 248).</p>

<title>Australian legislative reform</title>
<p>Between 2008 and 2010 reforms were introduced that covered tax (July 2009), superannuation (July 2008), aged care (July 2009), fair work legislation (January 2010), citizenship (March 2009), the Australian Government Hearing Services Program (January 2009), Medicare Safety Net (January 2009), immigration (July 2009), social security (July 2009) and veterans’ affairs (July 2009). Overall, these reforms stipulated that same sex couples would have the same entitlements as opposite sex de facto couples and be treated equally under Australian law as opposite sex de facto couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457857">Attorney General’s Department, 2010</xref>). The financial impact of these changes was diverse, with some individuals and families gaining and others losing.</p>
<p>For same sex families, some of the most significant outcomes from the federal legislative reform are reflected in changes to Social Security and Family Assistance, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare Safety Net and Child Support. Same sex couples and their children are now recognized under Australian law as a family in the same way that opposite sex families are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457857">Attorney-General’s Department, 2010</xref>: 2–4). In addition, changes to superannuation legislation and veterans’ affairs provide for the children of same sex couples to access death benefits and other financial benefits to which they were previously not entitled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261018312457857">Attorney General’s Department, 2010</xref>: 2–4)</p>
<p>At a state level law reform in relation to same sex couples and their children had been under way from 1999 when the <italic>NSW Property (Relationships) Legislation Amendment Act 1999</italic> broadened the definition of ‘de facto’ to include same sex couples. In New South Wales (the state in which this study was undertaken), the <italic>Miscellaneous Acts Amendment (Same Sex Relationships) Bill</italic> was passed on 11 June 2008. The major outcomes of the Bill were:</p>
<list id="list1-0261018312457857" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the recognition of female partners of women with children born as a result of artificial fertilization procedures. This was a retrospective change applying to children born prior to the legislation being enacted</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the inclusion of both mothers (birth mother and co-mother) in this case on the child’s birth certificate</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the right to parental leave for female partners on the birth of a child to their partner</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>changing the definition of ‘marital status’ to ‘marital or domestic status’ in anti-discrimination law to include same sex relationships. This meant that it became illegal to discriminate on the basis of same sex relationship status in relation to accommodation, employment, education, registered clubs, or the provision of goods and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0261018312457857">New South Wales Parliament, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A number of gay men and lesbian groups, however, raised significant concerns about the federal law reform, particularly as it related to Centrelink payments. The Coalition of Activist Lesbians (COAL) campaigned for the inclusion of a ‘grandfather clause’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0261018312457857">1</xref></sup> in the Centrelink legislative reforms to ensure that those receiving individual benefits at the time of the changes would not be disadvantaged by the new rules that define them as part of a de facto relationship. In a 2009 press release, COAL argued that the inclusion of a grandfather clause was essential in order to protect some lesbians facing a reduction in income by a third as a result of the changes. A quote from a COAL activist, Sand Hall, outlines their concerns:
<disp-quote>
<p>The new legislation will create hardship to a great many lesbians who have planned their living, financial, social and retirement arrangements – including mortgages – on the basis of two financially independent beings. The changes have come too suddenly for lesbians to plan or rearrange their long-term finances and housing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261018312457857">COAL, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A broad coalition of over 30 community, professional and advocacy organizations campaigned for policy changes to protect the entitlements of same sex people receiving pensions or carers benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261018312457857">ACON, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261018312457857">2010</xref>). In May 2009, the Australian federal government released a package of reforms in response to this campaign addressing some of but not the entire issues. While this was welcomed by the coalition as ‘an important win for the GLBT community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457857">ACON, 2009b</xref>), a number of key proposals were not adopted. In the press release ACON CEO Stevie Clayton goes on to say,
<disp-quote>
<p>While it’s disappointing that we could not achieve ‘grandfathering’ of these reforms – as has occurred with most such changes in the past – the fact that the Government is consulting GLBT representatives about changes to policy is a significant step forward and these concessions will have lasting impact in protecting the most vulnerable in our community. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457857">ACON, 2009b</xref>)</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The study sought to understand the experiences of lesbian couples with dependent children in a range of areas such as work/family balance, relationships and social policy. Participants were included in the study if they self-identified as ‘lesbian’ and ‘parenting’ a dependent child or children under the age of 17 years. Among the participants there was considerable diversity in both the enactment of ‘lesbianism’ as well as ‘parenting’. Participants were interviewed twice: firstly in 2006 (Wave 1 – 21 participants) and secondly in 2009 (Wave 2 – 8 participants). This article includes the experiences of only those women who were interviewed in both Wave 1 and Wave 2 in order to explore change over time.</p>
<p>Studying the experiences of a relatively small, stigmatized group has many challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261018312457857">McNair et al., 2002</xref>). Whilst there have been some improvements with the inclusion of same sex couples in the Census collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0261018312457857">Rawsthorne, 2009b</xref>), demographic data on lesbian parents remain poor and unlikely to be comprehensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0261018312457857">McNair et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0261018312457857">Millbank, 2003</xref>). As a result recruitment strategies with hard to reach communities such as lesbian parents tend to rely more on informal processes to generate purposive samples rather than a more randomized or representative sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261018312457857">Bryman, 2004</xref>: 333). At Wave 1 of this study an advertisement seeking participation in the study was disseminated through lesbian websites and services. A number of participants also came to learn about the study from word of mouth promotion. All participants in Wave 1 were asked whether they wanted to be kept informed about the reports or papers arising from the study. An email list was constructed and regular correspondence maintained with 18 Wave 1 participants from 2007 onwards. An invitation was sent via email to these 18 Wave 1 participants to participate in a follow-up interview. A total of 7 families and 8 participants agreed to participate in Wave 2. None of the participants with sole care of children at Wave 1 made contact in relation to Wave 2. The loss of participants between Wave 1 and Wave 2 suggests that email does not provide a stable contact point. It is noteworthy that all 8 participants in Wave 2 were in the same employment as in Wave 1 and were contacted via work email addresses.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were used to explore participants’ understandings and experiences of lesbian parenting, reconciling work/family arrangements and social policy. Qualitative research enables the exploration of social phenomena without defining or limiting potential responses. Through qualitative interviewing, the diversity and richness of participants’ experiences shaped by social processes are unearthed. Accordingly this study documents participants’ shared or common understandings, experiences, opinions, attitudes and feelings. The interview schedule for Wave 1 covered: paid work; childcare arrangements; home duties; approaches to parenting; lesbian identity; formal and informal supports; and social policy. The interview schedule for Wave 2 particularly focused on the changes in participants’ lives over the last 3 years. The interviews ranged in length from 60 minutes to 90 minutes and were recorded with permission. The interviews were professionally transcribed and a thematic analysis was undertaken with the support of NVivo7. The quotes used in this article have been selected to support the specific argument and are not seeking to represent the views and experiences of all participants.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the social policy issues raised in the interviews with other issues discussed elsewhere (family support see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0261018312457857">Rawsthorne, 2009a</xref>; reconciling work/family responsibilities see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0261018312457857">Rawsthorne and Costello, 2010</xref>; and lesbian motherhood see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0261018312457857">Rawsthorne, 2010b</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Eight lesbian women parenting children less than 17 years old in seven families participated in both Wave 1 (2006) and Wave 2 (2009) interviews. All participants lived in New South Wales (NSW), including four families that lived outside of the Sydney basin, in either the Illawarra region or the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>Most of the lesbian parents interviewed and their partners were aged between 36 and 45 years, although some partners were aged 46–54 years. All participants were current living with their lesbian partners. In two families the youngest child was a teenager whilst the remaining five families had at least one pre-school child. Four sole biological parents were interviewed. In the remaining three families both parents had given birth. At the time of the Wave 2 interviews only one of the seven families had only one child, four families had two children and two families had three or more children. Six of the families had children conceived in lesbian relationships (one a previous lesbian relationship) and one participant’s children were conceived in a previous heterosexual relationship. Unlike in a number of previous UK and USA studies, in this study the concept of ‘birth mother’ proved to have less analytic power as three of the seven couples were both birth mothers. Three participants had given birth to children between Wave 1 and Wave 2. Another participant and her partner were both actively trying to conceive again. Other significant changes between Wave 1 and Wave 2 included: commencing higher degree study; completing higher education degrees; extended family deaths; children completing high school and becoming more independent; renovating homes; and building new homes.</p>
<p>The lesbian parents in the study were comparatively well off. The participants were highly qualified, with all but one holding a bachelor degree or higher. Health care dominated the occupations of participants; however, there was a wide range of other prestigious occupations such as science management, law, higher education and management. In five of the families both partners were working effectively full time, one family had a part time/full time mix and the other had a full time carer/full time worker arrangement. Six of the families worked in some form of the public sector. As such the study does not include the experiences of less privileged or working class lesbians. This limitation needs to be borne in mind, as social security, taxation and other changes are likely to have differing material or class effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457857">Taylor, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>This section reports the major findings from Wave 1 and Wave 2 interviews. These include: the recognition of parenting rights of co-parents; institutional recognition; and the impetus for change.</p>
<sec id="section7-0261018312457857">
<title>Recognition of parenting rights of co-parents</title>
<p>One of the key themes that emerged from Wave 1 interviews overall was an undercurrent of anxiety about the recognition of their family units, the impact on children and the rights of co-parents. Participants at Wave 1 were concerned about the lack of formal ‘evidence’ of a parenting relationship between co-parents and children particularly in relation to dealing with institutions such as hospitals and schools. Concern about co-parents’ right to make medical decisions on behalf of children created ‘what if’ in participants’ minds. At Wave 1 some participants also expressed concern about the legality of signing school notes for excursions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Legal recognition] would remove the complexity and confusion around those issues. There are those complexities that are not there for heterosexual couples. (Jenny, Wave 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This undercurrent of anxiety was present in both families formed from previous heterosexual relationships and those formed in lesbian relationships. Negotiating the inclusion of new lesbian partners into families was fraught and the source of considerable relationship stress. For those participants with children born into lesbian relationships the lack of formal recognition of the co-parent was a real concern. Two very specific policy changes were identified at Wave 1 as providing important symbolic recognition: the inclusion of both mothers on birth certificates and having a Medicare Card which included all family members.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I worry about if something happens to me because Sue’s not registered on the birth certificate. I remember when [our daughter] was born I was really annoyed that the way the form is structured it’s mother and father. That really annoyed the crap out of me. There was no option for other parent, other genders. It really annoyed me that it was gendered. (Jenny, Wave 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For those whose relationships with extended biological families were fractured, there was a real concern that co-parents may lose care of children if the biological mother died. Even for those not in this situation the lack of certainty about what would happen if one parent died was something they wished to see changed. At Wave 1 the legal recognition of the parenting rights of co-parents was the major social policy change desired by participants.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So if something happened to me I’d be concerned that legally that my family would have a claim for [our daughter] even though Sue’s her mother. So that does scare me the lack of legal recognition if something were to happen to me. Absolutely, look I’m quite sure that if something happened to me my mother would try to take [our daughter]. (Kelly, Wave 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among the participants in Wave 1, a number of families had re-negotiated and re-designed ideas of parenthood, family and kinship in ways that challenge the social meanings of ‘family’ in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261018312457857">Dunne, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261018312457857">2000</xref>). In these lesbian families effort was made to create ‘families’ that did not adhere to or reflect more traditional forms of the heterosexual nuclear family. For these lesbian families complex networks of kinship based on both biological (donors, grandfathers, grandmothers) and non-biological (friends, ex-partners and unrelated others) ties combined to create more complex, fluid, family forms. For these families legal recognition of co-parents was less of an issue, with some expressing a desire to have nothing to do with the state.</p>
<p>By Wave 2 legislative reform had significantly improved the legal recognition of co-parents. The legislative reforms challenged the domination of genetic parenting in legal and community thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457857">Millbank, 2008</xref>: 165). The reforms addressed some of the concerns specifically identified in Wave 1, such as recognition through birth certificates and Medicare Cards. The significance of this symbolism was highlighted by one couple who sent copies of revised birth certificates to all their family members. One partner’s 70-year-old father shed tears of joy on receiving the birth certificate. Whilst the Medicare Card change may appear somewhat minor, this change addressed concerns expressed at Wave 1 about legal rights of health related decision making. Whilst few had experienced difficulties in their dealings with health professionals at Wave 1, the change gave participants the confidence and assurance that their parental rights would be paramount. For others, such as Lisa, the changes were a matter of rights.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As I understand it, is that I have rights to make medical decisions in relation to [our son] and his mother, as his parent and I would not have to adopt him. (Sarah, Wave 2)</p>
<p>Well I guess for me it’s about recognition. Like that recognition of relationships. But also anything that – anything to do with the recognition of the children within our relationship, like that’s the key thing from my point of view. I just think anything that gives us equal rights and equal recognition just has to happen. (Lisa, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, on returning to talk with these lesbian parents (Wave 2) the reforms were <italic>not</italic> in the forefront of all participants’ minds. In fact on at least three occasions I had to remind participants that there had been a change of government and law reform in relation to their families. In one case this was despite legislative reform being identified as very important at Wave 1. These participants were more eager to discuss children beginning school, new babies, changed jobs or houses. They gave the impression they were simply ‘living their lives’. The challenges of parenting, maintaining meaningful relationships and organizing home/work/school were given more weight by participants. In this way they shared the common concerns of other Australian families. Lisa captured this with the comment,
<disp-quote>
<p>I think that it’s just that I’m so busy I don’t even know what I can do. (Lisa, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At Wave 2 at least half of the participants were circumspect about the outcome of formal recognition of co-parents. For Kelly, formal recognition had not overcome her concern about the potential impact of her partner’s death on her parenting rights. She described her partner’s mother as ‘the kind of person’ who would do anything to destroy her relationship with her partner’s biological child if her partner died. She felt that no formal policy change would prevent this. Another participant, Jenny, reflected that policy changes do not protect families from ‘ugly’ and angry family breakdowns. Formal recognition and involvement with the Family Law Court may in fact make things worse. Likewise, Anne felt that formal recognition of her partner’s co-parenting rights had jeopardized her future security and plans due to the treatment of her relationship as marriage as under the Family Law Act.</p>

<title>Institutional recognition</title>
<p>The reform of the social security and tax legislation (to recognize same sex relationships as de facto relationships) had the most day-to-day impact on participants. Interestingly, given how long rights activists had campaigned for recognition, the lived experience to formal recognition in social security and tax legislation was quite mixed. This was influenced by both material and philosophical factors.</p>
<p>In 2006 the lesbian parents in this study, owing to lack of recognition of their relationship in law, were treated as sole parents within the social security and tax systems. This affected access to Parenting Payment (Single) (known commonly as the sole parent pension, which included a Health Care Card), family tax benefits and childcare subsidies. Two of the participants were receiving the Parenting Payment (Single) at Wave 1. The remainder of the families received additional social security benefits in terms of family tax benefits and childcare subsidies. The participants were mixed in how they responded to these ‘entitlements’ with some seeing them as one of the few ‘perks’ of homophobia or lack of recognition.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Look, I have to say that it’s, I feel like that’s, because the government doesn’t recognise same sex couples – we haven’t gone down the track of getting a sole parent pension or anything like that – but they only calculate the childcare benefit on my income so we benefit, compared to my heterosexual friends our childcare’s very cheap. So we benefit, thanks Johnnie. (Jenny, Wave 1)</p>
<p>I kind of think, I know it’s terrible but I think well I’ve worked all my life, it’s the one thing that I can get from the government in my favour in terms of being a lesbian so bugger it. If their homophobia works in my favour great, I kind of like it in some ways. It’s sort of like you can get to them. No problem, I’ll take your money. (Kelly, Wave 1)</p>

<p>By Wave 2, of those families with dependent children two families had declared their relationships to Centrelink, two were intending to and one other was reluctant to do so due to the financial implications. For the two families that had declared their relationships the process of declaring their relationship was symbolically powerful, creating a sense of citizenship and inclusion. Pauline and Sarah contacted Centrelink well before the legislation came into effect. Their enthusiasm was somewhat soured when Centrelink could provide no advice about the likely impact of the changes on their social security entitlements. This made financial planning and decision making (such as changes to employment hours or childcare arrangements) impossible.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Pauline:</speaker>
<p>No, they did it very badly in our view. They told us to declare our relationship early so they could be in a position to advise us of our financial situation and of course then when it came to the crunch they couldn’t tell us until the legislation kicked in on the 1st July.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah:</speaker>
<p>And they still didn’t, they still haven’t informed us in writing. It just changed.</p>
</speech>
<p>For both the families that had declared their relationship, formal recognition was accompanied by a significant loss in income (in one case, $800 per week). For Lisa, with more than one child in long-day childcare, the financial cost of recognition included $300 per week in additional childcare costs.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We always knew that it was going to be the case that when there was recognition across a raft of pieces of legislation then financially we would not be as well off but we used to think that the money we had under Howard was kind of compensating for the discrimination. So we’re happy. (Lisa, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For participants without dependent children at Wave 2, the actual impact of the changes to social security and taxation were still somewhat unknown. Anne, whose children were in their late teens/early twenties, expressed real concern about the lack of transitional arrangements or a ‘grandfather clause’ in the implementation of the change. She expressed concern about older friends who had not structured their relationship as involving financial dependency now facing loss of independently assessed pensions or superannuation. Activist groups such as COAL (Coalition of Activist Lesbians) have also documented concerns about the impact of the social security and taxation changes on older lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261018312457857">COAL, 2009</xref>). Anne felt the legislative reform had re-interpreted her relationship as ‘marriage like’ without her making a conscious decision to that effect. She does, however, recognize the dilemma of ‘one size fits all policy’, which brings with it benefits and disadvantages.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[I]n the event of separation – that potentially has for me the most enormous impact and life changing. I feel completely blindsided by it, I didn’t realise that that was one of the effects of that legislative change. And I just feel that it’s a retrospective application of the law, that wasn’t the arrangement when we got together, the fact that it now exists means that … I think they should have done what they do with other major pieces of social legislation is that you actually tell people about it, that you’re clear about the effect of the change, and you give a lead time. I think people should have been able to opt in or opt out for example, do you want your relationship to be regarded as a marriage or if not then you’ve got two years to sort your finances out or you’re deemed in but just to say any separation after 1st March this year will be dealt with by the Family Law provisions. … I think it’s fair enough to bring anyone in under the tent if we want to have the benefits of being treated the same as everyone else in the community you have to deal with the disadvantages but I do think a bit of lead time would have been good. (Anne, Wave 2)</p>

<title>Impetus for change: Social justice or economics?</title>
<p>Legal recognition was understood by the participants within a social justice frame. Their desire for recognition was motivated by a desire for inclusion, of being treated as equal within Australian laws and the community. Lack of recognition affected the cultural practices of participants. Anne, for example, negotiated symbolic exclusion by portraying herself as a single parent at her daughter’s new private school. On moving their daughter to a new school Anne’s family chose to be ‘more circumspect’ as they were ‘unsure how people will react’. This resulted in a loss of social validation and visibility of the family in an important part of their daughter’s life. At Wave 1 many participants spoke of the difficulties of living in a period of strong social conservatism and the change of government with a more inclusive approach was welcomed at Wave 2.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think [the hardest thing is] probably just the prejudices and just the negatives … the sort of influences that you have to endure from other people in the community. People everywhere really. There is a lot of prejudice out there and I think that, for me, is the hardest thing. I found it quite threatening for my children as well, because I didn’t want them to be exposed to any sort of bullying and stuff, which I know they were. It’s not only that, it’s all the other conservative stuff that is creeping into our lives in generally, socially, in terms of even just low tolerance for homosexuals, just that overall conservative; everything that’s changing, everything. (Mary, Wave 1)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, we all had a huge celebration over it, couldn’t believe that Maxine McKew beat John Howard, because I used to work in his electorate. I had my little wish list of what was going to happen, that the government would change was one thing, and it was would just be an absolute bonus if Maxine beat John. And she did, it was unbelievable. I think it’s far more socially normal, and happier, just the whole Aboriginal apology, and things like that I think have been brilliant. (Kelly, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The legislative reforms and a shift in rhetoric towards a more inclusive and tolerant community were viewed positively by most participants. The reforms were viewed as going some way to addressing concerns raised by the participants at Wave 1. Whilst the changes were welcomed at Wave 2, some participants expressed cynicism about the motives whilst others like Mary wondered at how quickly the changes had been achieved.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The ease with which they’ve been passed, come into being, just makes you think, oh stinking rotters, how long in the wilderness? … I mean. (Mary, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Philosophically some participants were unsure about the ‘sameness’ implied by the changes, particularly as they had not conceived of their relationship in these terms. Lisa wondered whether the changes had more to do with economics (saving money) than a commitment to redressing inequality.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s really appalling that there wasn’t a phasing in financial terms. I mean, I’m not worried about it for me personally, but it created a big contention for lots of people, and also particularly couples that might be nearing retirement age, or something like that, that there was no – you know, there’s a phasing pension reform. Why does this have to happen? It’s all about revenue really. I mean, that’s the only thing that I have to be critical about, is how much is actually driven by a commitment to social change. (Lisa, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among some participants, however, the changes have created opportunities for conversations and inclusion, as Liz describes below. In this way individuals such as Jane and Liz are able to ‘subvert the opportunities neoliberalisation opens up’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457857">Bondi and Laurie, 2005</xref>: 2).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Jane went to Medicare the other day, and was claiming something and the woman behind the counter said ‘I don’t quite know how to say this about your partner,’ and Jane said ‘Are you wanting to ask me if she’s same sex?’ She said ‘Yes.’ She said ‘I didn’t know how to put it.’ And Jane said ‘No, that’s all right.’ And she said ‘You can all be on the same Medicare card now’, [that] was what she wanted to convey, but she didn’t – And Jane wouldn’t strike you as being a gay person I don’t think, but yeah, this woman just obviously read the form, but didn’t know how to approach her about it. But it was good, it was a nice encounter. (Liz, Wave 2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significantly, the reforms excluded any changes to the Marriage Act. These changes are viewed as the key outstanding areas of social reform by some rights activists, although others such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457857">A’bello (2009)</xref> are highly critical of advocacy for the ‘oxymoron gay marriage’ which would impose heterosexual norms on the lives of queers. Among the participants there was no consensus about the importance of marriage rights. One participant had been through a formal wedding ceremony, two others would like to be able to marry and the remainder (four of the seven families) were supportive of marriage rights but could not see they would marry.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>So I don’t feel strongly about same sex marriage, I’m not the marrying kind. I understand the political reasons for pushing that, but I think it’s actually – for me it’s about recognition of the relationship, it’s not about duplicating a heterosexual institution, which actually creates some kind of social control.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reveals the diversity of ways in which social policy change can be experienced and is understood. It highlights the multiple discourses at play in shaping social policy outcomes and the lived experiences of these policies. The ‘revolution’ in social policy treatment of same sex families in Australia has taken place in the context of a social inclusion agenda although this sits uncomfortably within a broader neo-liberal political, economic and social context. The lack of a ‘grandfather clause’, the refusal to amend the Marriage Act and the economic benefits for the government of the social policy change suggest that neo-liberalism is as much at play in these changes as are notions of social inclusion. The extension of the definition of ‘de facto’ to include same sex couples signals a ‘normalization’ of these relationships. The reforms have brought these relationships ‘under the tent’ but did not in any way change the tent. This is evident in the portrayal of ‘consultation’ as a ‘win’ for gay men and lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261018312457857">ACON, 2009b</xref>). In this way the reforms can be seen as similar to those highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457857">Duggan (2003)</xref> in the United States who argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>The new neoliberal sexual politics … might be termed <italic>the new homonormativity</italic> – it is a politics that does not contest dominant heteronormative assumptions and institutions, but upholds and sustains them, while promising the possibility of a demobilized gay constituency and a privatized depoliticized gay culture anchored in domesticity and consumption. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457857">2003</xref>: 50)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The social policy reforms, rather than a triumph of social justice, signal the acceptance of heterosexual norms and the depoliticizing of the gay and lesbian movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457857">A’bello, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457857">Duggan, 2003</xref>). Legal recognition without changes to any of the legal frames can be seen as part of the cultural project of neo-liberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261018312457857">Duggan, 2003</xref>: 49), which ‘incorporates, co-opts, constrains and depletes activism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457857">Bondi and Laurie, 2005</xref>: 2). As Taylor argues ‘rights in liberal democracies can be pursued … without significantly challenging heteronormativity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457857">2005</xref>: 376).</p>
<p>The lack of protection provided to those adversely affected by the changes suggests less powerful members of the community have been ‘abandoned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261018312457857">A’bello, 2009</xref>) by both the government and the wealthy professional elites within the community. This reveals the inability of a social inclusion agenda to redistribute resources and power. As Taylor notes ‘the voices of the working class it seems are increasingly hushed in inclusive debates, a covert exclusion whereby classed outsiders become so, given their lack of social networks, social capital, and general social pulling power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0261018312457857">2005</xref>: 378).</p>
<p>This research confirms the observations of Australian policy commentators: ‘social change happens in various ways and at different paces. Its effects vary and its outcomes are experienced and evaluated divergently by people in different social positions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261018312457857">Fawcett et al., 2010</xref>: 19). At Wave 1, most participants expressed anxiety about the lack of formal recognition of their relationships and their families. At Wave 2, following the most significant social policy reforms in Australia’s history, these anxieties had not disappeared. In fact, for some participants the anxiety caused by the unknown continued. For these participants the hoped for certainty created by formal recognition had not materialized. The imposition of heterosexual norms on same sex relationships together with a lack of a ‘grandfather clause’ created an ongoing source of disquiet and unease. They suggest that ‘recognition’ was driven by factors other than genuine acceptance.</p>
<p>This study contributes to the body of Australian literature on the experiences of lesbian women that draws our attention to the critical role of cultural change alongside legislative reform if real advances are to be made in relation to equity for same sex families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261018312457857">Lindsay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0261018312457857">McNair, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0261018312457857">McNair et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0261018312457857">Millbank, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0261018312457857">Perlesz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0261018312457857">Rawsthorne, 2010a</xref>). Cultural change requires change to the fundamentals of institutions and systems, not merely extending who is included within existing processes.</p>
<p>Participants’ disquiet and unease reflected awareness that legal reform could not guarantee community recognition or social inclusion. Participants questioned whether legislative reform reflected a shift in social values. There was a strong sense of ‘more to do’ in terms of changing cultural attitudes, although legislative reforms enabled the development of new conversations. The complex nature of the relationship between community values and practices and legislative reforms was highlighted in the health arena. At Wave 1 participants reported very few difficulties in their dealings with health professionals. Most in fact were glowing in their assessment of the treatment they received from health professionals as lesbian families. In this way the community values and practices were in advance of the legislation. Despite this lived reality, the changes to the Medicare Card (the inclusion of all family members) were greeted with enthusiasm. The changes appeared to give participants more confidence about what they could expect. In this way the lack of discrimination would not be seen as a ‘pleasant surprise’ but as a right.</p>
<p>The possibility of ‘new conversations’ identified by a number of participants highlights the ability of individuals to creatively ‘work the spaces of neo-liberalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261018312457857">Bottrell and Goodwin, 2011b</xref>: 283). This included constituting new formations of ‘family’, conversations of inclusion, challenging the dominance of biology and disrupting social ‘norms’ (through both parents giving birth, for example). Whilst resisting the individualizing citizen-consumer subjectivity of neo-liberalism remains a ‘troublingly difficult question’, activists need to be mindful that ‘every contestation effectively mobilises the contesting subject’s claim to be able to think for her- or himself, and therefore the salience of self government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457857">Bondi and Laurie, 2005</xref>: 5–6). It is evident from the participants’ stories that meaning is contested and negotiated, not merely passively imposed. The participants appear willing to <italic>inhabit</italic> and <italic>subvert</italic> neo-liberal ‘normalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261018312457857">Bondi and Laurie, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It is through the lived experiences of social policy reforms that a deeper understanding of democratic processes can emerge. This paper has sought to contribute to this deepening understanding through the experiences of lesbian women who parent in Australia. While significant progress has been made both in Australia and internationally to address discrimination for same sex families in terms of both law reform and policy change, how these changes impact will evolve over time. Social inclusion in the context of neo-liberalism is problematic. As these stories suggest, however, it is possible to creatively use spaces within neo-liberalism for positive social change.</p>

<p>A ‘grandfather clause’ refers to the practice in Australia of protecting those currently affected by a specific policy from adverse impact arising from policy reforms. Effectively it has acted to protect individuals from the introduction of retrospective policy that adversely affects their circumstances.</p>
