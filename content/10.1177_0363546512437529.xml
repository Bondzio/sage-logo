<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury can be decreased through the use of intervention programs. However, the success of these programs is dependent on access to a skilled trainer who provides feedback; as such, these programs would benefit from a simple device with the capacity to provide high-quality feedback.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> Feedback based on kinematic measurements from a simple inertial sensor-based system can be used to modify key ACL injury risk metrics (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, knee abduction moment) during jump landing.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Controlled laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventeen subjects (7 male) were tested during drop jump tasks. Their movements were measured simultaneously with inertial, optoelectronic, and force platform systems. Feedback provided to the subjects was based only on measurements from the inertial sensor-based system (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, and thigh coronal velocity). The subjects conducted a baseline session (without landing instructions), then a training session (with immediate feedback), and finally an evaluation session (without feedback). The baseline and evaluation sessions were then tested for changes in the key risk metrics.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The subjects increased their knee flexion angle (16.2°) and trunk lean (17.4°) after the training. They also altered their thigh coronal angular velocity by 29.4 deg/s and reduced their knee abduction moment by 0.5 %BW·Ht. There was a significant correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.55) between the change in thigh coronal angular velocity and the change in knee abduction moment.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Subjects reduced key risk metrics for ACL injury after training with the system, suggesting the potential benefit of instrumented feedback for interventional training.</p>
<p><bold>Clinical Relevance:</bold> Interventional training for reducing the risk of ACL injury could be improved with a simple device that provides immediate feedback.</p>

<body>
<p>The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most commonly injured knee ligament requiring operative intervention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546512437529">47</xref></sup> and loss of this ligament often leads to premature degenerative arthritis of the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546512437529">31</xref></sup> As such, researchers have developed intervention programs that can successfully decrease the incidence of ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437529">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437529">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437529">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546512437529">47</xref></sup> These prevention programs are generally 6 to 8 weeks in duration and require 2 to 3 training sessions per week that are focused on altering lower extremity biomechanics. Most of these training sessions occur during team practices because the participants cannot perform the intervention training independently. As a result, compliance rates can be as low as 28%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546512437529">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, either an instructor or a physical therapist must be present to coach the participants to ensure that they are properly performing the training intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512437529">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512437529">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512437529">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546512437529">47</xref></sup> This coaching generally consists of oral instructions based on visual observations and can vary depending on the skill of the observer. An independent and quantitative feedback system could improve these intervention programs by allowing the subjects to conduct the training sessions on their own while still receiving consistent instructions. Autonomous feedback systems have already been shown to effectively modify walking and running<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512437529">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437529">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437529">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512437529">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512437529">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546512437529">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546512437529">49</xref></sup> and provide assistance during rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512437529">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0363546512437529">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many of the successful intervention programs emphasize proper jump-landing technique because landing from a jump is one of the primary noncontact ACL injury mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512437529">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512437529">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512437529">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512437529">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512437529">41</xref></sup> Specific kinematic and kinetic risk metrics, such as a small knee flexion angle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437529">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546512437529">50</xref></sup> small trunk flexion angle,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437529">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437529">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437529">23</xref></sup> and large knee abduction moment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437529">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437529">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437529">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref></sup> have been shown to increase the risk for ACL injury during a jump landing. Consequently, these risk factors have been the focus of several intervention studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546512437529">‖</xref></sup> Measuring these parameters requires a complex setup (eg, gait laboratory) as well as a substantial amount of time to prepare the subject and process the data. In general, these parameters are not rigorously measured outside of a research environment and are instead estimated through visual observation.</p>
<p>In the past decade, inertial sensor-based systems have been developed to simplify the measurement of human movement and monitor subjects in their natural environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512437529">2</xref></sup> One system in particular has been recently designed and validated to analyze the knee flexion angle and trunk lean during a drop-jump task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref></sup> Although inertial sensor-based systems alone cannot yet measure joint kinetics, they can measure other interesting properties of the movement, such as segment acceleration or angular velocity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437529">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512437529">18</xref></sup> Specifically, Dowling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref></sup> described an association between the thigh coronal angular velocity and the knee abduction moment during a drop-jump task and suggested that this measurement could be used to differentiate between subjects with high or low knee abduction moment. Altogether, the literature suggests that an inertial sensor-based system could be used to assist subjects during the training sessions of intervention programs by providing quantitative feedback.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512437529">13</xref></sup> However, it is currently unknown if subjects can respond to feedback provided by an inertial sensor-based system for a jumping task.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that immediate feedback based on measurements (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, and thigh coronal angular velocity) from a simple inertial sensor-based system can be used to modify specific ACL injury risk metrics (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, knee abduction moment) during jump landing. This study also evaluated the correlation between the change in the thigh coronal angular velocity (obtained from the inertial sensor-based system) and the change in the knee abduction moment (obtained from a laboratory-based system).</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Seventeen subjects (7 men and 10 women) with an average age of 27.5 ± 2.9 years and body mass index (BMI) of 22.8 ± 2.3 were selected for this study. All were regular participants in sports involving jumping maneuvers at the recreational level. Those with previous lower limb musculoskeletal injuries requiring surgery or any current symptoms of pain or injury were excluded. This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed written consent was obtained from all subjects before data collection.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546512437529">
<title>Jump Task</title>
<p>The jump task for this study was a bilateral support drop-jump maneuver in a gait laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512437529">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546512437529">40</xref></sup> For this task, each subject dropped off a 36-cm box, landed with both feet on the ground, and then immediately performed a maximum height vertical jump. The landing directly after the drop from the box was used for the analysis. The jump was considered acceptable if the subject dropped off the box with both feet at the same time and fully impacted a force plate embedded in the ground with their right-side foot.</p>

<title>Feedback</title>
<sec id="section5-0363546512437529">
<title>Hardware</title>
<p>The feedback system consisted of 3 small inertial measurement units (Physilog; BioAGM, La Tour-de peilz, Switzerland) affixed on the chest, thigh, and shank segment, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437529">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437529">2</xref>). These units were connected to a computer that recorded the signal from the inertial sensors at 240 Hz during the jump task. Using custom software, the knee flexion angle, trunk lean, coronal thigh angular velocity, and vertical jump height were calculated immediately after the subject completed the jump trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437529">Figure 2</xref>). The technical details of this system, as well as its validation for drop-jump analysis, have been presented elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437529">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512437529">20</xref></sup> Finally, a projector was used to display the results of the jump analysis.</p>

<title>Parameters</title>
<p>The feedback consisted of 3 kinematic parameters (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, and coronal thigh angular velocity) plus the jump height. One characteristic feature previously identified as being associated with ACL injury was extracted from each kinematic time series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512437529">Figure 2B</xref>). For the knee flexion angle and trunk lean, the maximum values achieved during stance were chosen as feedback parameters because they have been suggested as risk factors for ACL injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437529">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437529">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437529">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437529">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546512437529">50</xref></sup> and are common components of intervention programs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363546512437529">¶</xref></sup> For the thigh coronal angular velocity, the first maximum (inward) peak during stance was selected because it is correlated to the knee abduction moment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref></sup> which is a strong predictor of ACL injury risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437529">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437529">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437529">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref></sup> In addition, the jump height<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref></sup> was included to ensure that the modifications of the jump-landing mechanics did not adversely affect the performance of the jump.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546512437529">
<title>Relative Risk</title>
<p>Based on the literature described earlier, a direction associated with a higher risk for injury was determined for the 3 kinematic feedback parameters (ie, knee extension, backward trunk lean, and inward thigh coronal angular velocity). Then, the actual target values for the feedback were determined based on previous research on healthy subjects conducting drop jumps that used the same inertial sensor-based system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref></sup> Knee flexion angle and trunk lean have been widely documented in the context of ACL injury; therefore, “lower risk” ranges were defined for these 2 parameters, and the subjects were instructed to be within those ranges. The lower risk ranges, [88°; 120°] for the knee flexion angle and [25°; 60°] for the trunk lean, corresponded to the upper half [median; maximum] of the data previously collected with healthy subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref></sup> No target range was defined for the thigh coronal angular velocity because a risk threshold has never been reported for this parameter, and this parameter was never used in an intervention program. Instead, the subjects were instructed to land in a neutral manner (ie, with the first peak of the thigh coronal angular velocity equal to 0 deg/s).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0363546512437529">
<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>The experimental protocol consisted of 7 parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512437529">Figure 3</xref>). During the preparation, the feedback system and the reflective markers for an optoelectronic system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437529">3</xref></sup> were placed on the subjects. The subjects then performed a short warm-up consisting of light jogging and/or squatting. When they felt ready, calibration procedures were performed for the feedback<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512437529">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512437529">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512437529">19</xref></sup> and optoelectronic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437529">3</xref></sup> systems. After that, the jumping task was explained to the subjects, and they were allowed to practice until they felt confident with the task. At this point, the subjects conducted a baseline testing session consisting of 3 drop jumps. For the baseline session, no landing instructions were provided, and the subjects were not aware of what the feedback parameters would be. After the baseline testing, the subjects completed a training session of 15 to 20 jumps within approximately 30 minutes, at which time they received feedback on their jumping technique after each jump. Immediately after the training session, the subjects conducted an evaluation session also consisting of 3 drop jumps, where no feedback was provided. For the evaluation testing, the subjects were asked to maintain the jumping technique that they learned during the training session. They also had the opportunity to repeat a jump during this session if they felt that they did not successfully accomplish the movement modification.

<title>Training Session</title>
<p>Once the baseline testing was complete, the average values over the 3 baseline jumps were calculated for each feedback parameter. These averages were then projected onto the wall in front of the subject (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512437529">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512437529">Figure 4</xref>), and the 4 feedback parameters were explained to the subject using a standardized speech. For the knee flexion angle and trunk lean, the lower risk range was shaded green to give the subjects a visual representation of a lower risk jump, thus allowing them to interpret their own values. For the thigh coronal velocity, the 0-deg/s line was presented as the lower risk. The subjects were also given a standardized set of movement modifications for each parameter that would potentially reduce their risk of injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512437529">Table 1</xref>) and were told they would have between 15 and 20 jumps to incorporate the modifications into their jumping technique. The same set of movement modifications was given to each subject regardless of his or her baseline values. The subjects were then instructed to modify their landing mechanics in order, starting with the knee flexion angle (if necessary), then the trunk lean (if necessary), and finally the thigh coronal angular velocity (if necessary). Regarding the jump height, the subjects were instructed to maintain their baseline height for all the subsequent jumping trials. After each jump, the display was immediately updated to add the results of the latest jump to the subject’s training history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512437529">Figure 4</xref>). The researchers assisted the subjects by repeating the standardized set of movement modifications as many times as requested by the subjects. However, the subjects alone decided how to alter their jumping technique based on the values of the feedback parameters and the standardized set of movement modifications. Also, if the researchers observed that the subjects were demonstrating a consistent landing technique and were not progressing anymore, the researchers would suggest to the subjects that they could move on to the next feedback parameter. But again, the subjects made the decisions as to when to incorporate a new feedback parameter. When the subjects achieved a jumping technique that optimized all the feedback parameters to the best of their ability or when they reached 20 training jumps, they were asked to maintain that technique for the evaluation trials.</p>

<title>Knee Abduction Moment Measurement</title>
<p>The feedback system included the first peak of the thigh coronal angular velocity because it has been shown to be associated with the peak of the knee abduction moment during a drop-jump landing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref></sup> which is a strong predictor of ACL injury risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437529">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437529">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437529">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref></sup> However, the thigh coronal angular velocity has never been directly related to ACL injury, nor has the effect of a modification of this parameter on the knee abduction moment been investigated. Therefore, an auxiliary system was used to measure the knee kinetics in order to determine whether the intervention decreased the risk of injury in terms of the knee abduction moment as well as to test the association between a change in the thigh coronal angular velocity and a change in the knee abduction moment. This system consisted of an optoelectronic motion capture system (Qualisys Medical, Gothenburg, Sweden) with 10 infrared cameras collecting at 120 Hz and 1 force plate (Bertec, Columbus, Ohio) collecting at 1200 Hz. The point cluster technique was used to track the orientation of the shank and foot frames,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512437529">3</xref></sup> and the knee abduction moment was calculated using an inverse dynamic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512437529">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512437529">16</xref></sup> The subjects demonstrated 2 landing strategies for the knee abduction moment: some landed with primarily an abduction moment, whereas others landed with primarily an adduction moment. To preserve these strategies, the researchers calculated the average moment during the deceleration phase of the landing. If this average was positive (mainly in abduction), then the maximum value (abduction peak) was reported; otherwise, the minimum value (adduction peak) was reported. To allow for comparison between subjects, the knee abduction moment was normalized to percent body weight and height (%BW·Ht).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For each of the 5 parameters considered in this study (knee flexion angle, trunk lean, thigh coronal angular velocity, knee abduction moment, and jump height) during both the baseline and the evaluation sessions, the values from the 3 jumps were averaged to have 1 mean value per subject per session. Paired Student <italic>t</italic> tests (baseline vs evaluation) were used to evaluate the effects of the training. In addition, the association between the change in the thigh coronal angular velocity from baseline to evaluation and the change in the knee abduction moment from baseline to evaluation was assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>). All statistical tests were performed in MATLAB version R2010b (The Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts), and the significance level was set a priori to .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Within a 20-jump training session, all of the 17 subjects were able to respond to the feedback from the inertial sensor-based system in terms of the knee flexion angle and the trunk lean, and 13 of the 17 subjects were also able to change the amplitude of their thigh coronal angular velocity. The feedback history for a full test (baseline to evaluation) is shown for a typical subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0363546512437529">Figure 4</xref>. In terms of the maximum knee flexion angle, 9 subjects were outside the lower risk range at baseline, and all subjects were inside the predefined range at evaluation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512437529">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512437529">Figure 5</xref>). All but 1 subject increased their knee flexion angle during the training (average change: 16.2°, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and the 1 subject who did not had a relatively high baseline value (104°). The results were similar for the maximum trunk lean. Ten subjects were outside the lower risk range at baseline, and all subjects were inside the range at evaluation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512437529">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512437529">Figure 5</xref>). All 17 subjects increased their trunk lean during the training (average change: 17.4°, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In terms of thigh coronal angular velocity, at baseline, 16 subjects had a positive value (indicating an inward movement of the thigh after initial contact), and 1 subject had a negative value (indicating an outward movement of the thigh after initial contact). After training, 13 subjects landed with a more neutral thigh coronal angular velocity, and 4 subjects were not able to complete the third modification. Overall, the subjects decreased the absolute amplitude of the first peak of the thigh coronal angular velocity by 20.1 deg/s (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512437529">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0363546512437529">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>Regarding the peak knee abduction moment, the average change for all subjects was −0.5 %BW·Ht (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). For further analysis, the subjects were split into 2 cohorts based on their baseline values because previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref></sup> has shown that only an abduction moment increases the risk of ACL injury. At baseline, 8 subjects had an abduction (positive) moment and were classified as “at risk,” whereas 9 subjects had an adduction (negative) moment and were classified as “not at risk” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512437529">Figure 6</xref>). For the at-risk cohort, 6 subjects decreased their knee abduction moment during the training (−1.2 %BW·Ht), whereas 2 increased their knee abduction moment (0.4 %BW·Ht). For the entire at-risk cohort, the average change was −0.8 BW·Ht (trend to significance: <italic>P</italic> = .06) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546512437529">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0363546512437529">Figure 6</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results from this study show that the subjects could effectively respond to the feedback from an inertial sensor-based system in a single training session of up to 20 training jumps while maintaining the same jump height. Although the system did not explicitly suggest movement alterations, the subjects were able to positively modify their jumping technique in terms of 3 key risk metrics for ACL injury based on the quantitative feedback from the system combined with a standardized set of instructions. All of the subjects were able to maintain or to modify their knee flexion angle and trunk lean to be within the lower risk ranges after training. For the thigh coronal angular velocity, 13 subjects (77% of the cohort) were able to modify their jumping technique in order to land with more neutral velocity, suggesting that this parameter was more difficult to alter. However, it is important to note that the subjects were instructed to modify their landing mechanics one parameter at a time and that the thigh coronal angular velocity was the final parameter. Because the majority of the subjects were able to decrease their thigh coronal angular velocity, this result also suggests that some subjects might need more than 1 training session.</p>
<p>At evaluation, the subjects had significantly reduced key risk metrics for ACL injury in terms of the kinematic risk factors. After training, the subjects increased both their maximum knee flexion angle and their maximum trunk lean during stance. The 16.2° increase obtained for the knee flexion angle is comparable with previous intervention programs consisting of a single training session. Mizner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512437529">34</xref></sup> reported a change of 11.3° for female athletes instructed to increase their knee flexion angle during a drop-jump landing. Another study that investigated different combinations of feedback during a vertical jumping task reported changes in knee flexion angle between 27° and 40°.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512437529">43</xref></sup> Although no study has directly reported the change in trunk lean after an intervention, the 17.4° increase observed in this study agrees with the change reported by Blackburn and Padua<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437529">7</xref></sup> for trunk flexion angle during a controlled drop-jump landing task. Furthermore, it is important to note that in this study, the amplitude of change for each kinematic parameter was driven by the lower risk range; it is assumed that with enough training, any subject could land with an exact amplitude of knee flexion angle and trunk lean.</p>
<p>As hypothesized, by decreasing their thigh coronal angular velocity, the subjects also decreased their knee abduction moment. In fact, there was a strong association between the change in these parameters from baseline to evaluation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.55). This result clearly indicates that the thigh coronal angular velocity could be related to ACL injury. Although Dowling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref></sup> suggested that the thigh coronal angular velocity could be used to differentiate subjects with high or low knee abduction moment, this study showed that the thigh coronal angular velocity could be used to estimate the change in the knee abduction moment as a result of an intervention. This is important because the knee abduction moment is a complex parameter to measure and therefore cannot be used in large-scale intervention programs. Although the thigh coronal angular velocity alone cannot accurately predict the actual value of the knee abduction moment, it can provide a strong overall assessment of the effect of a movement alteration (eg, upper body positioning or foot stance) on the knee abduction moment and therefore on the risk for ACL injury. A more complex model needs to be developed to predict the actual value of the knee abduction moment from the thigh coronal angular velocity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512437529">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The decrease in the knee abduction moment between baseline and evaluation also suggested that the feedback system successfully guided the subjects to decrease key risk metrics for ACL injury during the training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref></sup> The average decrease of 0.8 %BW·Ht for the at-risk cohort is comparable to the results from previous intervention programs. Mizner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512437529">34</xref></sup> reported a 0.65 %BW·Ht reduction in the knee abduction moment for female athletes instructed to land softly and avoid knee valgus during a drop-jump landing. In another study, female athletes considered at higher risk for ACL injury displayed a decrease of 0.5 %BW·Ht during a drop-jump landing after a 7-week neuromuscular training program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437529">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>One limitation of this study was that it included only a small number of healthy subjects who were evaluated during a single training session. However, by using each subject as his or her own control, this study demonstrated that significant changes in key risk metrics are possible with immediate feedback. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term training effects of this system, which are clinically relevant because subjects must be able to maintain these altered techniques to reduce their risk of injury. Furthermore, this study used key risk metrics as surrogates for risk of ACL injury. A full prospective study is necessary to determine the efficacy of the system at reducing actual ACL injury. However, the use of risk metrics provided an efficient approach to establish the potential efficacy of this system before embarking on a longer and more costly prospective study. Another limitation of this study is that during the training session, the researchers instructed the subjects by giving them the standardized set of movement modifications and by suggesting to them that they could move on to the next feedback parameter. To reduce the potential coaching effect of this involvement, the researchers used a standardized set of instructions that were given to all the subjects regardless of their feedback values, and the subjects alone made all decisions regarding how to alter their jumping technique. Although these precautions were taken, a potential coaching effect cannot be excluded from this intervention; as such, in the future, these actions should be programmed into the inertial sensor-based system. Finally, this study did not include a comparison group of subjects who were trained with verbal instruction but without feedback from the inertial sensor-based system. Future prospective research should focus on showing the efficacy of feedback from an inertial sensor-based system versus verbal instruction. The objective of this first investigation was to demonstrate that subjects can effectively respond to feedback from an inertial sensor-based system, thereby providing a scientific foundation for further testing of similar approaches.</p>
<p>In this study, only 3 parameters were used for the feedback because preliminary testing of the system suggested that the subjects would not be able to alter more than 3 parameters during a single training session. Preliminary testing also indicated that modifying the parameters sequentially was easier for the subjects than modifying the parameters concurrently. Knee flexion angle and trunk lean were chosen as feedback parameters because they are important risk factors for ACL injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512437529">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512437529">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512437529">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512437529">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546512437529">50</xref></sup> and thigh coronal angular velocity was chosen because it is correlated to knee abduction moment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512437529">14</xref></sup> a major ACL injury risk factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512437529">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512437529">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512437529">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546512437529">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512437529">45</xref></sup> In addition, these specific parameters were selected because they can be measured easily and accurately with an inertial sensor-based system. The specific sequence of feedback parameters was chosen based on ease of modification for the subjects as it was easiest for them to alter their knee flexion angle and hardest for them to alter their thigh coronal angular velocity. The feedback consisted of multiple parameters because previous intervention studies have focused on changing sets of biomechanical parameters during a training session to achieve the most significant reduction in risk for injury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363546512437529">#</xref></sup> Many other known ACL injury risk factors could be included in the feedback to improve the intervention without modifying the hardware or the data collection procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363546512437529">**</xref></sup> Therefore, future research with this system should focus on determining an optimal set of feedback parameters.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study demonstrated that feedback derived from a simple device can be used for interventional training aimed at reducing the risk of ACL injury. The subjects effectively responded to the feedback in a single training session and reduced key ACL injury risk metrics. Immediate and quantitative feedback is valuable because it continuously indicates which movement modifications are most effective for the individual subject, and therefore the movement modifications can be customized for each subject. Altogether, this study suggests that interventional training for reducing the risk of ACL injury could be improved with a simple device that provides immediate feedback because this device would allow the subjects to conduct the training sessions on their own and still receive consistent instructions.</p>
