<abstract>
<p>There is a lack of evidence-based research in the use of Telehealth within palliative care in the UK, particularly in Scotland. The aim of this project was to evaluate the current use of Telehealth applications within palliative care across Scotland, and how these and future applications are perceived by patients, carers and professionals. This paper reports on the qualitative findings from focus groups with patients and carers in three geographical areas in Scotland, and individual interviews with key stakeholders from across Scotland, who currently work within areas of high and low Telehealth activity. The key findings indicated that Telehealth initiatives are welcomed by patients and carers but that these should be an adjunct to clinical care rather than an alternative. The stakeholder interviews revealed several notable differences between those working within areas of high and low Telehealth activity. Principally, areas of high Telehealth activity appear to be driven by national and local policy and seem to benefit from a greater level of investment in Telehealth equipment and facilities than in the more central, and hence accessible, parts of Scotland.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>We are experiencing a paradigm shift in the way healthcare services are being provided throughout the UK. It is anticipated that there will be an increasing number of patients being cared for within their own communities as a result of UK health policy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311398698">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311398698">2</xref></sup> With one of the health services’ main objectives being to involve patients in their own care, new ways to support and sustain engagement must be found. Information technology (IT) developments are being harnessed throughout society and there is growing interest in the ways in which these can be used to meet and support patients’ health needs in the community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311398698">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Remote monitoring of patients through information and communication technologies is termed ‘Telecare’ or ‘Telehealth’ and is being evidenced increasingly as a means of addressing the increased demand on health services alongside more patient-focused care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311398698">3</xref></sup> The term has been coined in the literature, as in this paper, to encompass a variety of technologies, including mobile phones, laptop computers, cameras and remote monitors, and can offer a wide range of functions from transmitting medical images or data to health advice via the telephone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311398698">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is growing potential for the development and application of computer technologies in many healthcare settings, not only enabling increased involvement of patients in their own care, but also in symptom monitoring and management, and thus preventing unnecessary hospital/hospice admissions for crisis intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311398698">5</xref></sup> The use of Telehealth that can facilitate the assessment of symptoms reported by patients themselves, may enhance effective symptom management in palliative care and provide a means to overcome identified barriers to home care, improving the patients’ experience of care. The application of the use of Telemedicine in the delivery of health services in the Highlands of Scotland has been shown to be encouraging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311398698">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311398698">7</xref></sup> Many patients with advanced illness wish to remain at home and in their own communities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311398698">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311398698">9</xref></sup> but are unsure of whom to contact and how, when they experience problems. Although some applications have been evaluated, informatics to date has played only a minor role in the evolution of palliative care, and the model of the ‘e-Hospice’ is full of challenge as well as opportunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311398698">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311398698">12</xref></sup> The use of Telehealth can help to empower individuals experiencing life-limiting illnesses, and their carers, by facilitating the provision of real-time communication between patients and healthcare providers. This can be used to complement current transitions within healthcare from the acute to the home setting and rationalize services based on patient need.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311398698">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311398698">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Medical computerized handheld devices have been in use for some time for purposes such as patient tracking, accessing medical literature, e-prescribing, patient confidentiality and speciality specific diagnostics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311398698">14</xref></sup> The effectiveness of Telehealth in potentially improving symptom management and quality of life in patients with long-term chronic conditions, as well as potentially reducing healthcare costs, has been more recently demonstrated in a number of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311398698">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311398698">18</xref></sup> Studies have also consistently reported positive patient experiences in the use of technology and demonstrated improved communication between health professionals and patients that have enabled better continuity of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311398698">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311398698">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311398698">23</xref></sup> In addition, effective tools, including quality control procedures for Telemedicine and Telehealth projects and applications with a standardized quality, have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311398698">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>This scoping study used a Qualitative Evaluation design. Qualitative Evaluation is the systematic acquisition and assessment of information to provide useful feedback about an organization or intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311398698">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311398698">26</xref></sup> The overall aim of the project was to scope, map and assess current use of Telehealth applications within palliative care in Scotland and how these and future applications were perceived by patients, carers and professionals, with a view towards improving the use and provision of Telehealth applications within palliative care in the future. The project involved two phases. Phase 1 included key informant interviews for initial scoping and mapping and a literature review of published and unpublished research. The findings from the literature review have been published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311398698">27</xref></sup> Phase 2 involved focus groups comprising patients and carers and follow-up semi-structured interviews with key informants to obtain rich detail on their perceptions of current and future use of Telehealth applications in palliative care settings across Scotland. It is the findings from Phase 2 that we report on in this paper.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<sec id="section7-0269216311398698">
<title>Focus groups</title>
<p>Members of three patient advisory groups (a hospice day care, a mixed tumour type support group and a breast cancer support group) were invited to participate in a focus group discussion about their experiences and perceptions of current and future uses of Telehealth applications within palliative care in Scotland. Each focus group consisted of both people living with cancer or other life-limiting conditions and/or those looking after someone with cancer and were all conducted by two researchers (LK, BJ) during October and November 2009. The rationale for choosing these groups was that the groups had either experienced palliative care themselves or cared for someone with palliative care needs. The groups were also chosen for their location: one group was an urban group, one rural and one a group located on a Scottish Island, in order to provide a broad spectrum of Telehealth experience. Discussions were guided by a semi-structured interview guide, which allowed for flexibility of discussion from both the perspectives of the researcher, and patients and carers.</p>

<sec id="section8-0269216311398698">
<title>Key stakeholder interviews</title>
<p>Key stakeholders were identified from an initial brief scoping exercise conducted during phase 1. In phase 2, follow-up interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of participants selected on the basis of whether they currently worked within, or had relevant knowledge of, areas of high and low Telehealth activity. The participants who responded to our invitation and were subsequently interviewed comprised a variety of professional groups, including a radiographer, palliative care consultants, specialist nurses and general practitioners (GPs) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311398698">Table 1</xref>). All participants had a clinical remit for, or relevant to, cancer and palliative care. Participants were located across Scotland, including the central belt, the Western Isles and Shetland. A semi-structured interview guide was used to facilitate the stakeholder interviews.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data from the participant focus groups and key stakeholder interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. A rapid approach to analysis adopting ‘thematic content analysis’ was used to identify emergent themes and trends, as it offers an accessible and flexible approach to the analysis of qualitative data. The analysis was performed in the following steps, as outlined by Braun and Clarke:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311398698">28</xref></sup> (1) the transcribed interviews were read through with the aim of obtaining an overall picture and to familiarize ourselves with the data; (2) initial codes were generated; (3) codes were then collated into potential themes; (4) themes were then reviewed to check they still worked with our coded extracts; and (5) continual analysis was carried out to refine themes in preparation for discussion in the final report. For reliability and validity purposes, two researchers coded some focus group and interview transcripts and compared the results. No disagreements were found between the two researchers.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The findings from the focus groups and key stakeholder interviews are integrated to provide a totality of the results. In total, 22 patients and carers participated with a minimum of four and a maximum of 10 people in each focus group discussion. Each focus group lasted between 40 and 60 minutes. In total, eight stakeholders participated in the individual follow-up interviews (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311398698">Table 1</xref> for detail on stakeholders). Attempts were made to contact more stakeholders but they were either too busy to participate or did not reply to our invitation within the data collection timeframe. Interviews lasted between 30 and 60 minutes and were conducted face to face or by telephone.</p>
<p>In the following sections, quotations from the participants are used to demonstrate the key themes that emerged from the analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311398698">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Experiences with, and perceived value of, Telehealth</title>
<p>Generally, participants across each of the focus groups were unfamiliar with the terms Telehealth and Telemedicine, with the exception of the FG3 (Island-based group) group. This was believed to be because of their geographical location and the fact that their local health infrastructure relied on the use of such technology as a key component of current service delivery. All participants across each of the groups did, however, appear to be aware of the existence of different types of technology, such as videoconferencing facilities and webcams, which would come under the scope of Telehealth.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think the distance and the expense … the costs of bringing patients over on a monthly basis makes videoconferencing necessary. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Telehealth activity amongst the key stakeholders centred on the use of videoconferencing equipment for networking, consultations, multidisciplinary meetings and for education and training. Such activities were principally conducted between professionals, with little involvement of, or use by, patients and carers. Although each of the stakeholders interviewed acknowledged the value of Telehealth for supporting such activities, it was those working in areas of high Telehealth activity that commented on the necessity of Telehealth not only to support but also to enable such activities. For example, one participant based in one of the Islands off the coast of Scotland acknowledged that without Telehealth equipment, clinical meetings between the wider multidisciplinary team simply would not be possible.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We [use videoconferencing] to support the multidisciplinary team decision making … we link into the MDT [on the mainland] … [now] for example, the surgeon who did the operation can link with the oncology nurse in X Island … it allows a much more informed decision where the local guys can input to that. <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other benefits of the use of videoconferencing were reported by key stakeholder participants as being a more effective use of time and staff resources, and improved communication and enhanced trust through promoting face-to-face contact and enabling body language to be observed.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can do some very good networking [using videoconferencing] … we tend to link across Scotland with clinicians. It’s done informally but the body language is quite important I use the telephone a huge amount in my job but it’s much easier once I know the people I am speaking to. <italic>(KS2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>None of the focus group participants were aware of Telehealth technologies, such as videoconferencing, mobile phones or webcams, being used in the delivery of hands-on patient care or, for example, by patients themselves. They also reported that they had not come across any other Telehealth initiatives within the clinical setting, such as audio-taped consultations. Most of the participants from across the groups were, however, familiar with the availability of specialist telephone advice and support lines provided by Cancer Backup/Macmillan and NHS24. Many of the participants reported having used these services and their websites for information and advice and found them extremely valuable in offering support and reassurance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I looked on the Cancer backup website … you could put in whatever your question was and something would come up that was relevant. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Awareness of the provision of Internet forums where people can ‘post’ a question or problem and receive responses from the public was high. Two of the participants from different groups spoke of personally using these forums to obtain advice and support from a peer group of people with similar experiences to theirs. They also spoke of the social support network that this type of initiative creates.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve just to go on the computer to try and get the self help because I’m having a lot of problems with my stoma. I’ve been on the computers to see if I can get any advice from other people suffering the same symptoms and things … I tried all their suggestions just to see if I could resolve the matter myself. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In particular, it was perceived by several of the participants that such forums were particularly valuable for people who did not wish to attend a formalized support group or wished to obtain information but without face-to-face contact.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It might be that men … they might not want to go to a support group like this one … they can go on to these websites and things and gain some kind of support without having to give away who they are or folk knowing them. <italic>(FG2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was also evidence of local Telehealth initiatives, either already established or in the process of being set up. Examples include a specialist nurse-led telephone advice line or people who have come to the end of their treatment and need advice or support. Other local examples included GP telephone triage systems whereby a GP would phone the person back and triage their problem or concern, making a recommendation for a subsequent face-to-face appointment or offering them some self-care advice. Some innovative uses of Telehealth to support clinical practice and to enhance the involvement of patients and carers were evident in settings in the Island communities, including the use of Telehealth in virtual follow-up clinics.</p>
<p>Another Telehealth initiative reported by several of the participants included the use of personal safety alarms, whereby help is available at the push of a button should a person become ill, fall or injure themselves within the home. Several of the participants commented on the value of having such a system in place because it provided them with reassurance that someone would be available to automatically help them, as well as for families who lived at a distance to the person.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These things are also useful for me as the family member … my father lives a fair bit away from me so to know that he has that [alarm] and that someone will respond to it is so reassuring for me. <italic>(FG21)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Telehealth equipment was also reported to have a large role in the education and training of clinical staff, particularly for clinicians working in remote and rural areas, where professionals were perceived as being at particular risk of becoming isolated in their clinical practice. A participant, based in the central belt of Scotland, also described the use of videoconferencing to support palliative care education and the current provision of online palliative care educational modules, accessible to people from all over the world.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The main thing I’ve been involved in is using videoconferencing for palliative care education … Just now we provide palliative care modules online … I’ve got students from all over the World now …, we’ve got people from Africa and the Far and Middle East bringing their different perspectives on palliative care. <italic>(KS3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Telehealth was also seen as a useful means of providing mentorship, clinical supervision and peer support between professionals, as well as a decisional support for professionals, for example, during out of hours or for specialist services.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What we’ve found is that in X Island over the years, people’s practice has become quite isolated and perhaps not as sharp as it should be .… so it offers a degree of support and mentoring that you would find it difficult to sustain by travel. <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Innovative uses of Telehealth appeared, therefore, to be more limited amongst those working within the central belt of Scotland.</p>
<sec id="section12-0269216311398698">
<title>Challenges of using Telehealth</title>
<p>Several of the focus group participants commented that for the development of effective Telehealth initiatives, the infrastructure to support its use had to be improved. This included the capabilities of the technology itself and also the range of broadband coverage for a larger Telehealth initiative.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Broadband coverage is not as good as it would need to be, because I imagine it has got to be pretty fast [to support patient care delivery]. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants across each of the groups commented that Telehealth initiatives should not be designed to replace an existing service, but should be offered as a supplement to existing practice; an alternative and something that could be accessed based on personal choice rather than being offered as a single approach within standard care.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The one fear is though that you are dependent too much because if things then go wrong, who knows anything that’s happening if it’s getting done all that way [using Telehealth]. I think you need to have both. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, it was perceived that if Telehealth was to be effective and valuable, it had to be careful not to discriminate against its users. For example, participants reported that many people are at risk of falling through the net because they do not perceive themselves to be capable of using technology, because they may feel intimidated by the technology, or may not be able to afford to use the technology, or not be able to physically use the technology because of, for example, poor eyesight.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everything is online nowadays … you can be made to feel like the odd man out. <italic>(FG2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, to be perceived as a valuable adjunct to clinical care, Telehealth initiatives need to be of perceived value to the person themselves and easy to use. In illustrating this point many of the participants across the groups commented on the unsatisfactory nature of the existing telephone optioning systems that many primary, secondary and tertiary care settings use. In particular, they found it frustrating, confusing and time consuming.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was like press 1 for this and 2 for that … press 4 if you’re dying you know? <italic>(FG21)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, although all of the key stakeholders were proponents of the use of Telehealth, even in cases where Telehealth activity was currently limited, they all acknowledged that there were several ongoing challenges associated with current Telehealth use. In particular, to ensure that Telehealth activity becomes widespread and is delivered in an effective and consistent way, further investment is needed in developing the technology itself as well as in the infrastructure to support its use.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Videoconferencing has reduced the burden of travel for patients, for X Island, it’s reduced the travel costs but the travel costs are picked up by the Scottish Government, we don’t pay for those as a health board. <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was recognized that funding for Telehealth initiatives had to be fought for and that investment in the services themselves was very much needed. The training and educational needs of professionals in actually becoming familiar with and in using the technology is also an important issue.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It [the technology] frequently didn’t work … we’d have to stop the call and switch the equipment off and then switch it on again and try and re-establish the kind of contact so we were quite on our own. <italic>(KS3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Enhancing understanding of what is meant by the term ‘Telehealth’ and the possible tools that comprise Telehealth was also perceived as an ongoing issue. It was perceived by one of the stakeholders that there was a lack of understanding of Telehealth within professional circles and amongst patients and carers. There was also a perceived need for seminars and training days that would increase awareness of the use and value of Telehealth solutions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have the technology but there isn’t a broad understanding of what Telehealth is, either from staff or from patients and carers. <italic>(KS4)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another issue was how to manage the level of expectation that may accompany the development of a new initiative to support patients and carers. One stakeholder commented that the provision of Telehealth equipment may have the result of raising the expectation of professionals by patients and their carers and rather than empowering them, create a sense of dependency.</p>

<title>Drivers of Telehealth activity</title>
<p>This theme emerged from the key stakeholder data only. Most commonly, key stakeholders working within areas of high Telehealth activity were those considered to be remote and/or rural, including the Islands off the coast of Scotland. Within the central belt of Scotland, the pattern of Telehealth activity was far more limited in use and scope. These stakeholders were therefore considered to be working within areas of low Telehealth activity.</p>
<p>There were notable differences within the interview data, relating to possible drivers of Telehealth activity across Scotland between stakeholders working in areas of high and low Telehealth activity. Most importantly, the geographical location of the participants, being split between the central belt of Scotland and more remote and rural parts, such as the Scottish Highlands and the Islands, was perceived as the largest driver of the perceived need for, and value of, Telehealth use. The many benefits that Telehealth solutions offer to people living and working in Island communities and the convenience that these offer have helped to make Telehealth ‘<italic>part of our normal service delivery model</italic>’ (KS1).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We are a small island [health] board and in order to survive, really, my belief and the belief of a lot of others here is that Telehealth is the way we have to go. We have to provide services locally and if we can we should do that now [using Telehealth]. <italic>(KS4)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants from the Island health boards also spoke of there being a higher level of investment in Telehealth generally and, although more work remains, efforts had been made to provide an infrastructure to support the widespread use of Telehealth in these areas. Currently, there is also a Telehealth strategy being developed within the Western Isles, demonstrating their commitment to ensuring that Telehealth activity is firmly embedded within clinical practice and service delivery.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’ve got a very clear steer from our [Health] board that we need to continue to extend this [using Telehealth] because it just makes sense … we are looking at every opportunity to use for instance, videoconferencing. There’s been a lot of investment in the kit … It’s just so convenient … it has become as easy for us as using a telephone. <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, participants in areas of low Telehealth activity perceived that they had little need for Telehealth at present. This principally related to their geographical location, being within the central belt of Scotland, and their subsequent ability to travel easily between clinical sites, where distance was not an issue. The stakeholders identified that it remained a very paper-based culture.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s not something we’ve invested in as there’s not really the need … the equipment for videoconferencing is not installed in many of the GP practices around here and therefore, people have to move in order to be part of the videolink, they won’t really do it. <italic>(KS7)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Subsequently, cultural and organizational attitudes amongst staff were also reported as influencing the extent to which Telehealth was viewed as an important and valuable adjunct to standard practice, whereas participants from the Scottish Highlands and Islands reported great enthusiasm for the use and necessity of Telehealth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216311398698">
<title>The future … is there a need or desire for Telehealth?</title>
<p>The majority of the focus group participants commented that they were relatively satisfied with their current system of care. If in need of primary or hospice care or advice, many people perceived that they would continue to phone direct to make an appointment or seek advice and are happy to do so. Several of the participants commented that it was preferable to speak with someone immediately, and preferably someone who was familiar with them and their care plan, and to keep that personal touch.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s good to talk face-to-face and it’s important to keep that personal touch … better than talking into a machine. <italic>(FG2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both focus group participants and key stakeholders identified that the use of Telehealth offered many opportunities for enhancing personal involvement in care, enhancing personal control and for improving communication with, and between, health professionals. It was also seen as particularly beneficial for people who were too ill to travel, housebound or too intimidated to be part of a support group or seek face-to-face contact and support.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Anything in Telehealth would improve communication, it would be welcomed. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was the participants of the Island-based focus group (FG3) who identified the greatest perceived need for Telehealth to supplement their current system of care. This was essentially because of their geographical location and the costs, time and relative disruption involved in travelling to the mainland. In particular, they described how Telehealth was particularly welcomed in their area, since current service provision demands that they make frequent trips to the mainland for investigations, diagnostic tests, treatment and follow-up care. It was perceived that Telehealth initiatives, for example, videoconferencing and using webcams, could reduce travel time and costs and also, in many cases, it could circumvent the physical and emotional impact of travelling when feeling unwell.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was given bad news, when I thought I was going for a routine appointment, and I wasn’t prepared and I didn’t have anybody with me and had to you know come back on my own to the B&amp;B and get my luggage and get myself home again … it was quite traumatic. Whereas if I’d had a webcam the doctor would have said ‘well I’m very suspicious about what I can see’ or whatever, and I could have had somebody like my husband with me. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants of this group also described the way in which consultations frequently took place between health professionals on the island and the mainland via videoconference but patients were not invited to be part of such discussions. It was commented upon that patients and their carers wanted to be part of such discussions and that it would be valuable to have the opportunity to speak with their consultant via videophone or webcam. Subsequently, this would retain the personal touch and face-to-face contact that people so desire.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we used videoconferencing or webcams … you could be in on the discussion with the oncologist and have the opportunity to ask questions. <italic>(FG3)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several of the focus group participants commented on the need for a more joined-up system where information could be shared between NHS services, such as general practice and out-of-hours services.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It would be good, if, when you phoned somewhere like NHS 24, they were able to access your medical notes or your details so that you didn’t have to go through them all time and again to whoever ended up on the line. It would be very helpful to have your information flagged up. <italic>(FG2)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All participants acknowledged the potential growth in the use of Telehealth in palliative care settings in the future. Several of the stakeholder participants saw the future as one in which patients and carers became active users themselves of Telehealth equipment, such as telemetry for remote monitoring and videoconferencing for communicating and consulting with health professionals. Others described what patient and carer use of Telehealth activity might look like, for example, using laptops and video screens at patients’ bedsides and the more frequent use of virtual assessment and follow-up clinics.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We’re piloting other e-health solutions … some of the patient monitoring stuff which is about monitoring patients’ blood pressure, weight for heart failure and all sorts of things …. it be useful from the telemedicine point of view if the oncology nurse in X for instance could dial into somebody’s home two days after [they have been discharged] to check that they are doing well after chemotherapy? <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such initiatives were not only seen as having major benefits for patients and carers in terms of reduced time, travel and costs but were also seen as a means of enhancing perceptions of control, offering reassurance and empowering patients and carers to self-care. The development of one initiative in particular, described as a ‘virtual hospice’ is currently underway in a particularly rural part of Scotland, which aims to provide a virtual network of care and support and enable patients and carers to have access to all the members of the multidisciplinary team via videoconferencing facilities using Skype.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The idea was to try and look at the essence of what we do in the hospice and how much of that can be reproduced on a virtual platform. The idea of the virtual hospice is to have it very much more interactive all the way from using video consultations using interactive creative arts projects to interactive counselling in terms of bereavement … to a virtual ward scenario where you have physiological monitoring actually within the patient’s home. <italic>(KS7)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was acknowledged by several of the participants that out-of-hours care often remained one of their biggest challenges.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our out-of-hours care is run by the X Hub in X so if you ring NHS 24, the out-of-hours doctor would be called, who is based in X Island, to come and visit … but there’s no telemedicine involved in that. I’d love to do it [link out-of- hours with Telehealth} <italic>(KS1)</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>The findings reveal that there is a growing degree of Telehealth activity within palliative care settings across Scotland. Many of the ideas that were identified during the discussions hold great potential for the future care and experiences of patients and carers, as well as being able to influence and impact upon clinicians’ clinical practice and modes of service delivery. Further research is needed to examine the impact of Telehealth use within palliative care and how it can be integrated into clinical care delivery.</p>
<p>The literature suggests that Telehealth is currently being used to support and enable clinical consultations, communication and networking between professionals, and education and training of professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311398698">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311398698">29</xref></sup> The findings from the interviews and focus groups appear to reinforce these uses by professionals and key stakeholders working in oncology and palliative care settings across Scotland. The findings also reinforce the many benefits cited in the literature of using such tools, including improved reliability and accuracy of information exchanged, reduced costs, and improved clinical effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311398698">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Presently there is little Telehealth activity across Scotland that is aimed towards remotely monitoring patients living with long-term conditions and less so in terms of locating Telehealth tools within patients’ own homes, to avoid travel, although there has been some preliminary, exploratory work done.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311398698">7</xref></sup> There is, however, great enthusiasm for the concept of patient and carer use of Telehealth as voiced by patients and carers themselves and professionals and other stakeholders involved in the development of Telehealth. This drive makes it entirely plausible that, particularly in remote and rural parts of Scotland, remote and home monitoring will become a more frequent addition to the standard clinical care offered to patients and carers.</p>
<p>The findings from the participant focus groups support the findings in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311398698">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311398698">32</xref></sup> that Telehealth initiatives are welcomed by patients and carers but that these should be carefully designed, piloted and implemented and should be offered as an adjunct to clinical care and not an alternative. Offering people a choice with regards to Telehealth would also alleviate some of the concerns raised about discrimination and people potentially falling through the net because of a fear of technology, their demographics, the frail and elderly, and perhaps less likely to wish to use technology, or because they are unable to articulate their information and support needs.</p>
<p>A strong thread throughout the focus groups was that face-to-face contact, a degree of familiarity and the personal touch remained important requirements for people receiving palliative care from primary, secondary and specialist care centres, as well as out-of-hours care. Naturally they would prefer to see these aspects built into Telehealth solutions.</p>
<p>The key stakeholder interviews revealed differences between those working within areas of high and low Telehealth activity. Areas of high Telehealth activity appear to be driven by national and local policy and benefit from a greater level of investment in Telehealth equipment and facilities than in the more central, and seemingly accessible, parts of Scotland. It is most likely that Telehealth use is essentially of greater priority in remote and rural areas, since travel is time consuming and expensive, and may also be a product of the acceptance of such technologies and modes of service delivery.</p>
<p>For many clinicians working in remote and rural areas, Telehealth is the simplest and often most effective way of facilitating informed and effective discussion and decision making with members of the multidisciplinary team, accessing networks of care and enabling their involvement in education, training, peer supervision and peer support. In this way, it would appear that Telehealth does indeed have an impact on clinical practice and care delivery but that these appear to remain small pockets of activity and in no way has the use of Telehealth in oncology and palliative care settings proliferated across Scotland. Questions also remain about how Telehealth initiatives can and will link up to existing systems of care, for example, out-of-hours care. These are most certainly important considerations for the development of Telehealth technologies in the coming future that are to have real impact and potential, as well as sustainability.</p>
<p>It may also be said that people living in remote and rural areas are less likely to have access to several specialist services than those living in central Scotland, and hence, there is a growing need to offer alternatives that would enable them to enjoy equitable access to care and service delivery regardless of their geographical location.</p>
<p>In relation to patients and carers, those living and working within remote and rural areas appear to be the more likely users of Telehealth equipment than those living in the central belt of Scotland. Again, this is most likely due to necessity and the perception that Telehealth is a way to overcome problems with travel, distance and communication. Although limited at present, there seems to be real enthusiasm for developing Telehealth initiatives that are designed for use by patients and carers in the coming future. Many of the participants involved in this study welcomed the idea that they could be part of video-linked consultations and follow-up clinics in the future and were particularly accepting of tools that would allow them to remain close to home and close to their network of support from family and friends. The outcomes of its impact on patient and carer experience have yet to be fully explored. In addition, further investment is needed to manage the infrastructure to support and sustain the use of such technologies by patients and carers and, in particular, to ensure their safety and security as well as their reliability.</p>
<p>This project has revealed some encouraging findings about current attitudes towards, and thoughts on, the use of Telehealth in palliative care settings across Scotland. It is clear that in some areas of Scotland, where patients are receiving palliative care, work has begun to progress Telehealth activity within palliative care to better support professionals, patients and their carers. Initial findings indicate that current technology appears both usable and acceptable to patients and health professionals in palliative care settings, which is especially important given that the goal of increased home care for palliative patients is seen as the preferred option of patients and health professionals.</p>
