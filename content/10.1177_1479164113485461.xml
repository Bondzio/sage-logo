<abstract>
<p>We investigated the effect of angiotensin II (Ang II) on matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) balance in regulating collagen metabolism of diabetic skin. Skin tissues from diabetic model were collected, and the primary cultured fibroblasts were treated with Ang II receptor inhibitors before Ang II treatment. The collagen type I (Coll I) and collagen type III (Coll III) were measured by histochemistry. The expressions of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), MMP-1, TIMP-1 and propeptides of types I and III procollagens in skin tissues and fibroblasts were quantified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Collagen dysfunction was documented by changed collagen I/III ratio in streptozotocin (STZ)-injected mice compared with controls. This was accompanied by increased expression of TGF-β, TIMP-1 and propeptides of types I and III procollagens in diabetic skin tissues. In primary cultured fibroblasts, Ang II prompted collagen synthesis accompanied by increases in the expressions of TGF-β, TIMP-1 and types I and III procollagens, and these increases were inhibited by losartan, an Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, but not affected by PD123319, an Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist. These findings present evidence that Ang-II-mediated changes in the productions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 occur via AT1 receptors and a TGF-β-dependent mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetic skin tissues manifest reduced growth capacity of the dermal fibroblasts associated with abnormalities in extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism. Disturbance in the balance between ECM production and degradation leads to the formation of chronic ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113485461">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1479164113485461">2</xref></sup> As an extracellular macromolecule, collagen is the main component of ECM and the most abundant structural protein in skin tissues. The dermis of skin consists of 80% collagen type I (Coll I), and the rest is mostly collagen type III (Coll III).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113485461">3</xref></sup> The fibroblast is pivotal for collagen production, and numerous collagen structures need to be reconstituted after skin injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1479164113485461">4</xref></sup> Special tissue growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), the most potent growth factor involved in wound healing, play a key role in the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, re-epithelialisation, ECM deposition and remodelling in abnormal collagen metabolism within diabetic skin tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1479164113485461">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1479164113485461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113485461">7</xref></sup> TGF-β could modulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that are collectively capable of cleaving all the components of ECM and basement membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164113485461">8</xref></sup> In diabetic skin, the balance between MMPs and its preferential inhibitors [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1)] is disturbed, leading to the microstructural change of skin tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164113485461">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164113485461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113485461">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>There has been evidence to suggest that diabetic chronic complications, such as diabetic nephropathy and skin lesion, are related to the local components of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). RAS expressed by tissues and organs is called local/tissue RAS, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of wound repair and tissue reconstruction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164113485461">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164113485461">13</xref></sup> Angiotensin II (Ang II) affects proliferation, apoptosis, migration, collagen metabolism and capillary formation of skin cells via its receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164113485461">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164113485461">15</xref></sup> Our previous study has suggested that Ang II and its functional receptors were significantly increased in diabetic skin fibroblasts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113485461">16</xref></sup> indicating that the upregulation of Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor might influence diabetic fibroblast functions related to ECM remodelling. Previous reports also suggested the role of Ang II in MMP and TIMP system regulation through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism in some cell lines, including proximal tubule cells;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164113485461">17</xref></sup> however, the effect of Ang II on MMP-1/TIMP-1 balance in collagen metabolism of diabetic skin remains unknown.</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of our study is to gain insight into collagen synthesis and degradation in diabetic skin tissues and determine the role of Ang II on collagen metabolism in skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, the relationship between Ang II and TGF-β-mediating MMP-1/TIMP-1 balance in collagen metabolism is also explored.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1479164113485461">
<title>Animal experiment</title>
<p>In total, 16 clean-grade Spreqne-Dawley rats, each weighted about 220 g, were randomised into control and experimental groups after fed adaptively for 1 week. Diabetes was induced by injection [intraperitoneally (i.p.)] of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma, USA) at 35 mg/kg prepared in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH = 4.2) for three consecutive days. Animals injected with buffer alone were used as normal controls (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Blood glucose (BG) was measured by a OneTouch II<sup>®</sup> Glucometer (LifeScan, USA) 72 h after STZ injection, and animals were considered to be diabetic when the concentration of BG was ≥16.7 mmol/L. Rats were further housed for 8 weeks before being killed. All interventions and experiments with animals were performed in accordance with the Guidelines and Policies for Animal Surgery provided by our university (Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1479164113485461">
<title>Histological examination and Sirius red staining</title>
<p>At the end of the 8-week period, animals were i.p. injected with 1% pentobarbital (40 mg/kg), and central dorsal skin tissues, 1–5 cm from the skull, were obtained. Skin tissues were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and then embedded in paraffin. Skin tissue sections were stained for collagen with Sirius red as described by Junqueira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113485461">18</xref></sup> Unbound dye was removed by washing, and the bound complex was dissolved in 0.5% sodium hydroxide. Polarised light microscope was used to observe Coll I and Coll III. The percentage of the stained Coll I and Coll III in skin tissues was measured with a computerised image analysis system (Photoshop).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1479164113485461">
<title>Fibroblast cell culture</title>
<p>The dorsal skin tissues of Spreqne-Dawley rats were cut into 2 mm × 5 mm stripes and placed in 0.2% dispase (Sigma) at 4°C for digestion of about 20 h. Then, epidermis and dermis were separated, and dermis was cut into small pieces with addition of 0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA (Sigma), which were kept at 37°C for 15 min to digest into single-cell suspension. Fibroblasts from diabetic and normal rats were resuspended, respectively, with high-glucose or normal-glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Guangzhou, China) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cells were cultured in 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> condition, and culture medium was changed every 2 days. After reaching 80% confluence, the cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA at 37°C and then subcultured. The second-generation fibroblasts were used in this study. To identify fibroblasts, antibody to vimentin was used (data not shown).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1479164113485461">
<title>Cell treatment</title>
<p>Primary fibroblasts from diabetic and normal rats were cultured with high-glucose or normal-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS (Hyclone, Rockville, MD). After reaching 80% confluence, cells were shifted into DMEM containing 0.5% FCS for 24 h. For some experiments, the AT1 receptor inhibitor losartan (10<sup>−5</sup> mol/L) or the Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor inhibitor PD123319 (10<sup>−5</sup> mol/L) was added 30 min before Ang II treatment. Then, 10<sup>−7</sup> mol/L Ang II was added and cells were treated for 24 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1479164113485461">
<title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</title>
<p>Homogenate of skin tissues was centrifuged at 4°C, 3000 r/min for 15 min. Supernatant was stored at −80°C or below. Cell culture medium of fibroblast in different groups was collected and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min. The concentration of TGF-β, carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) and cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I procollagen (ICTP) in skin homogenate from diabetic and normal rats, and fibroblasts of different groups were analysed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&amp;D systems, China).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1479164113485461">
<title>Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>Total RNA in skin tissues was extracted (TRIzol, Invitrogen) and was then transcribed reversely by the reverse transcriptase (First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Fermentas) into complementary DNA (cDNA) for PCR. Primers were designed and synthesised by Bioengineering Techniques from Shanghai Public Health Services Ltd. PCR primer sequences and product sizes were shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1479164113485461">Table 1</xref>. Primers against rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were used as an internal control. After electrophoresis, they were photographed and scanned for electrophoretic bands with AlphaImager 2200 software. The semi-quantitative test results of target-amplified fragments were the greyscale ratio of the specially amplified DNA fragment bands with the inner reference bands at the same time (optical density of the target gene/optical density of GAPDH).</p>

<title>Western blot</title>
<p>Total proteins in skin tissues and fibroblasts were extracted. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein Concentration Determination Kit (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). An amount of 25 µg of protein was separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Then blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-MMP-1 antibody (1:500; Abcam), anti-MMP-9 antibody (1:800; Abcam), anti-MMP-2 antibody (1:800; Abcam) or anti-TIMP-1 antibody (1:800; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).

<title>Collagen structure in normal and diabetic rat skin tissues</title>
<p>Our previous results of haematoxylin and eosin–stained sections revealed that dermal features from normal and diabetic skin were consistently different. The thickness of dermis of diabetic skin tissues was significantly thinner, with thin, degenerated and fractured collagen fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113485461">16</xref></sup> In this study, we observed the distribution of collagen and calculated the percentages of Coll I and Coll III in skin tissues. When observed in light microscope, the collagen demonstrated red colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164113485461">Figure 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164113485461">(b)</xref>). Specifically, results from polarised light microscope observation showed that Coll I presented red or yellow colour with strong light refraction, while Coll III demonstrated green fibre bundles with weak light refraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164113485461">Figure 1(c)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1479164113485461">(d)</xref>). In normal skin tissues, Coll I fibres were thick and arranged densely, while in diabetic skin tissues, Coll I fibres were arranged sparsely with wide spaces. The percentages of Coll I and Coll III in normal skin tissues were 83.31% ± 15.80% and 13.93% ± 5.60%, respectively, while the percentages of these two kinds of collagen were 58.42% ± 9.43% and 35.75% ± 4.31% in diabetic skin tissues.</p>

The concentrations of TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113485461">Figure 3(c)</xref>), PICP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113485461">Figure 3(d)</xref>), ICTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113485461">Figure 3(e)</xref>) and PIIINP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1479164113485461">Figure 3(f)</xref>) were measured through ELISA. In diabetic skin homogenate, the concentrations of TGF-β, ICTP and PIIINP were all higher than those in normal control, while PICP level did not show any significant difference between these two groups. Furthermore, the concentrations of these four factors could also be measured in the supernatant of primary cultured fibroblasts. Similar to the results of skin tissues, the concentrations of TGF-β, PICP, ICTP and PIIINP were all higher in diabetic fibroblasts, especially the concentration of ICTP. Thus, the ratio of ICTP to PICP increased to 40% in diabetic group as compared to that in control.</p>

<p>We further examined the mRNA expressions of TGF-β, MMP-1, TIMP-1, Coll I and Coll III under the treatment of Ang II and its inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1479164113485461">Figure 4</xref>). Results demonstrated that Ang II increased TGF-β, TIMP-1, Coll I and Coll III mRNA expressions, which was inhibited by an Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor–specific blocker, losartan, but was not influenced by the AT2 receptor blocker, PD123319. Similar effects of Ang II on the levels of protein expression were also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1479164113485461">Figure 5</xref>). Ang II increased the protein expression of TIMP-1 and enhanced the concentrations of TGF-β, PICP, ICTP and PIIINP (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1479164113485461">Table 2</xref>). This increase was also inhibited by losartan, whereas PD123319 did not show any inhibitory effect.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The delicate dynamic balance of collagen synthesis and degradation participates in ECM metabolism of skin tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1479164113485461">1</xref></sup> Modification of the collagen I/III ratio might contribute to the weakness of dermal and is involved in the pathogenesis of abnormal skin microstructure in diabetes. In this study, decreased collagen I/III ratio was accompanied by increased expression of TGF-β, TIMP-1 and propeptides of types I and III procollagens in diabetic skin tissues. In primary cultured fibroblasts, Ang-II-mediated changes in the productions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 occur via AT1 receptors and a TGF-β-dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>It is known that collagen degradation and synthesis are regulated by many inflammatory factors and cytokines in diabetic skin tissues. TGF-β is known to be the most potent growth factor involved in wound healing throughout the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164113485461">20</xref></sup> The induction of TGF-β expression in diabetes plays an important role in stimulating ECM protein synthesis and inhibiting ECM degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164113485461">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164113485461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1479164113485461">23</xref></sup> Recent findings demonstrated that the binding of TGF-β with its receptors in fibroblasts regulated the balance between MMPs and TIMPs, which influenced wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1479164113485461">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1479164113485461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1479164113485461">26</xref></sup> In this study, we focused on MMP-1 and TIMP-1 in these experiments because these are the main regulators of Coll I and Coll III metabolism in diabetic skin tissues. We demonstrated a marked elevation in TGF-β expression and secretion in diabetic skin tissues as well as in isolated dermal fibroblasts. Although the MMP-1 level remained unchanged no matter in skin tissues or fibroblasts, the TIMP-1 expression decreased significantly, thus the ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1 increased dramatically, which in part accounted for the imbalance of collagen metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1479164113485461">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1479164113485461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1479164113485461">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The imbalance of collagen metabolism may lead to the change of collagen quality and quantity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1479164113485461">30</xref></sup> Here, we demonstrated that no matter in normal or diabetic skin tissues, both Coll I and Coll III were the major collagen types. The ratio of Coll I to Coll III changed obviously in diabetic skin tissues compared to that in normal control. The collagen synthesis markers of Coll I and Coll III include PICP, aminoterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and PIIINP, while ICTP is a marker of collagen degradation. Our data showed that the ratio of ICTP to PICP declined, indicating excessive degradation of collagen. Together with the results of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expressions, we speculated that the increased ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1 led to the changes of collagen propeptide levels and participated in the pathological changes of diabetic skin collagen.</p>
<p>In diabetic skin, the local RAS system was activated, with elevated Ang II level and increased AT1 to AT2 receptor expression ratio. Our previous study showed that skin tissues synthesised Ang II itself locally, and local expression of Ang II was significantly increased in diabetic skin, which was closely associated with collagen metabolism and ECM production in diabetic skin tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113485461">16</xref></sup> Recently, evidence has been presented that defined a role of Ang II in stimulation of collagen gene expression and protein turnover in cultured cardiac fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1479164113485461">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1479164113485461">32</xref></sup> Here, our results demonstrated TGF-β activation induced by Ang II, which was in line with other studies that demonstrated Ang II regulated synthesis of TGF-β.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113485461">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164113485461">17</xref></sup> However, the effect of Ang II on MMPs and TIMPs in different studies remains controversial. In accordance with our observation, Chua et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1479164113485461">33</xref></sup> have reported that Ang II induced TIMP-1 production in rat endothelial cells. While in human cardiocytes, Ang II had opposite and antagonistic effects on regulation of transcription of MMPs and TIMPs. These effects led to increased ratios of MMPs to TIMPs after Ang II stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1479164113485461">34</xref></sup> In our study, MMP-1 expression did not change after Ang II stimulation, so the ratio of MMP-1 to TIMP-1 decreased when stimulated with Ang II. The controversial results might be related with different cell types or even opposite mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Ang II plays its biological roles through two receptors, designated as AT1 and AT2 receptors. AT1 and AT2 receptors of Ang II are both expressed in skin, suggesting that skin is not only a source of Ang II but also a target organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1479164113485461">35</xref></sup> Ang II is known to stimulate fibrous tissue formation and coronary matrix remodelling by promoting TGF-β synthesis via AT1 receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1479164113485461">36</xref></sup> AT2 receptor stimulation counteracts AT1 receptor activation, and the effect of Ang II is regulated by the interaction of AT1 and AT2 receptor–mediated signalling in various target tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1479164113485461">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1479164113485461">38</xref></sup> Consequently, in skin tissues and fibroblasts expressing both AT1 and AT2 receptors, Ang II may establish its own regulatory system through these two receptor subtypes. This study demonstrated that losartan, an AT1 receptor inhibitor, decreased TGF-β, TIMP-1, PICP and PIIINP expressions in diabetic skin fibroblasts, while AT2 receptor did not show any effect in the process. These results suggest that Ang II regulates collagen metabolism in skin fibroblasts at least in part due to the inhibition of collagen degradation via the increase in TIMP-1 expression, and this effect is mediated through AT1 receptor stimulation, independent of AT2 receptor.</p>
<p>All taken together, abnormal collagen synthesis and degradation play important roles in ECM metabolism and structure changes of diabetic skin tissues. Ang II, as a kind of fibrogenic factor, influences TGF-β-mediating MMP-1/TIMP-1 balance in collagen metabolism mediated by AT1 receptor. An imbalance between the expressions of MMP-1 and TIMP-1, caused primarily by an increase in TIMP-1 activity, may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic skin tissues.</p>
