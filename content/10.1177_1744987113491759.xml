<sec id="sec22-1744987113491759"><title>Background</title>
<p>Paediatric oncology palliative care in the community is rare and nationally there is a lack of standardisation of out of hours nursing service provision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1744987113491759"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>This paper seeks to explore influences on the experiences of paediatric nurses providing out of hours palliative care within the family home to children with cancer. The study used social worlds theory to aid identification and demonstration of the findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1744987113491759"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Twelve community-based palliative cases were purposively selected from children with cancer treated at one regional centre. Tape-recorded interviews were undertaken with 54 health professionals (general practitioners, community nurses and allied health professionals) involved in providing their palliative care and five facilitated case discussions completed. Data analysis followed a grounded theory approach; chronological comparative data analysis identifying generated themes. Social worlds theory was used as a framework to examine the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-1744987113491759"><title>Results</title>
<p>Nurses’ experiences are shaped by their social world and those of the nursing team, child and family and the inter-professional team providing the care. The lack of a formalised service, sub-optimal inter-professional working and impact of social worlds influence the experience of the nurse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-1744987113491759"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Social worlds theory provided a new perspective in understanding these experiences based within a paediatric palliative care setting, knowledge that can be used to inform service provision.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987113491759" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although more than 70% of the 1:500 children under the age of 15 years who develop a cancer achieve cure (Children’s Cancer and Leukaemia Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113491759">CCLG, 2012</xref>)), cancers cause the greatest number of deaths by disease in 0–14 year olds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113491759">Cancer Research UK, 2010</xref>). The rarity of childhood cancer can result in community-based health professionals having limited experience in caring for children with cancer and even less experience in providing their palliative care. It is well recognised that the provision of palliative care falls beyond the remit of any one profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987113491759">Freeth, 2001</xref>) with inter-professional working being the standard model of care provision. Within the setting of paediatric oncology palliative care effective interprofessional working is hindered through these professionals often coming together for the first and only time in providing the palliative care for one child and family. Although this study focuses on paediatric oncology palliative care provision an understanding of the complexities of factors that inform inter-professional working in all specialties is essential if effective working is to be achieved and optimal care provided.</p>
<p>A recent qualitative study of the range of health professionals involved in providing palliative care at home for children with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987113491759">Neilson et al., 2010</xref>) used social worlds theory (SWT) to examine inter-professional collaboration and identify specific areas of the organisation or provision of care that could be enhanced through changes in practice. Using theories, such as SWT, can provide a different perspective to the analytical process in qualitative research. This paper focuses on one aspect of care, the provision of out of hours palliative care from a nursing perspective, using SWT to explore the influences on nurses’ experiences.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1744987113491759"><title>Study aim</title>
<p>This paper reports on one aspect, the experience of paediatric nurses, of a wider study which aimed to explore the experiences of the community nurse, GP and allied health professional (physiotherapist and occupational therapist) following the involvement in the care of a child with cancer receiving palliative care at home. SWT was used as a framework to facilitate the examination of their experiences.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1744987113491759" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec4-1744987113491759"><title>Study design</title>
<p>The wider study design was a community-based qualitative study using in-depth 1:1 interviews, facilitated case discussion (FCD) (group interviews with all the health professionals involved in the care of a child and family) and field notes for data collection and grounded theory analysis. This paper focuses only on the community nurses’ 1:1 interviews and their discourse in the FCDs with the other professionals.</p>
<p>Using theories within qualitative research can provide ways of examining complex situations or interactions and can also provide a framework for analysis. The deeper understanding of situations or phenomena that can result from the use of theories is important for guiding health policy and informing delivery of patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987113491759">Reeves et al., 2008</xref>). Inter-professional working within a palliative care setting is an example of a complex set of interactions.</p>
<p>SWT has previously been used as a framework for analysing contemporary primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113491759">Tovey and Adams, 2001</xref>) but has not been used within a primary care palliative setting. Although other theories were looked at, such as ‘group development theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987113491759">Farrell et al., 2001</xref>) (defining how specialists from different disciplines can work together pooling expertise in order to become more effective and efficient), it was felt that SWT was appropriate for this study as it facilitated examination of the inter-professional working that occurs within paediatric palliative care as well as the individual professionals’ experiences.</p>
<p>The early work of Chicago social world ethnographers first led to the term ‘social world’ (SW) being used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987113491759">Strauss, 1978</xref>). SWs arise when people come together either individually or collectively in groups, each bringing their own areas of expertise and background. A SW has a common interest or activity and is linked through communication networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113491759">Unruh, 1980</xref>). SWs can be adjacent to, or intertwined with, other SWs.</p>
<p>Within SWT an ‘arena’ is defined as an issue or area of interest that is characterised by the interaction of SWs, each world bringing ways of working and interacting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987113491759">Goode (1957)</xref> highlights the importance of patterns of communication in pulling together important aspects of the SWs of occupations and professions. Within the context of this study, the arena was the actual provision of palliative care and the SWs those of the individual professional, the wider team, the team management and the child and family. The developing character of the arena, the palliative care provision, is shaped by the processes that evolve both between and within the SWs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987113491759">Tovey and Adams, 2001</xref>). The formation of sub-social worlds (SSWs) is one such process. SSWs develop from SWs as an activity or focus of interest that can be differentiated from that of the wider SW. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987113491759">Strauss (1982)</xref> described the processes both within the SW and between SWs as being the cause of their differentiation into SSWs, a SSW developing as a result of the individual perceiving their role as having changed into something significantly different, such as nurses actively involved in providing palliative care to one child combining to form a unique SSW differentiating themselves from their colleagues who are not directly involved. The legitimisation of the SSW in the context of palliative care, the justification for its formation, is achieved through the distancing from peers and providing effective care; the development of a unique inter-professional team with enhanced knowledge and expertise in palliative care.</p>
<p>SWT has been used to aid examination of the influences of the experiences of one of these professional groups, community nurses, in providing an out of hours paediatric palliative care service. Out of hours care was selected as the focus for this paper as nationally in the United Kingdom there is a lack of standardisation in the availability of nurses providing out of hours care for all children, not just those with a cancer diagnosis, receiving palliative care at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987113491759">Craft and Killen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The definition of out of hours care in this study refers to evening, overnight and weekend periods when care is handed to an out of hours or ‘or on-call’ services. The community nurses encompass both children’s community nurses (CCN) and children’s palliative care nurses (CPCN).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987113491759"><title>Study setting</title>
<p>The geographical area of the study location was the West Midlands region and parts of Powys in Wales as defined by referrals to a regional childhood cancer centre.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987113491759"><title>Sample</title>
<p>The purposeful sample comprised community nurses involved in the care of a sample of 12 children (aged 0–18 years) who were receiving palliative care for cancer at home.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987113491759"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>Ethical approval was sought and obtained from Northern and Yorkshire Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee prior to commencing the data collection and proved to be a straightforward process. The data were collected between February 2005 and January 2006. The community nurses were contacted shortly after the child they were caring for died. Details of the study were provided and consent to participate sought. Individual in-depth tape-recorded 1:1 interviews were undertaken. On completion of the individual interviews all the professionals involved in the child’s care were invited to an FCD. During the tape recorded FCD individuals talked about their experiences and perceptions of good care as well as areas of concern.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987113491759"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was on-going throughout the data collection period and was a complex process due to the large amount of data obtained. The transcripts and data from all sources were downloaded onto NVivo and open coding undertaken, the themes and categories being constantly compared and contrasted with new data as they were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113491759">Charmaz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987113491759">Hewitt-Taylor 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987113491759">Strauss and Corbin, 1990</xref>). Throughout this process the codes evolved as they were revised until theoretical saturation was reached and open codes were categorised according to the final axial codes (category headings) identified. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987113491759">Table 1</xref> gives the example of this process for the category ‘Out of hours care’ which was one of five categories identified the others being; establishing contact with the family, role uncertainty, role undertaken and emotional toll.

<sec id="sec9-1744987113491759"><title>Application of SWT</title>
<p>Determining axial codes aided the process of identifying SWs through enabling each category to be individually examined within a context, such as contact with the family. This paper focuses on the identified axial code that forms the arena (the areas of interest) of the SW; ‘Out of hours service provision’ as it is an important but currently under resourced, aspect of paediatric palliative care. Using the open code headings for this axial code, the transcripts were systematically compared and contrasted in order to identify the SWs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744987113491759">Table 2</xref> shows the open codes and SWs identified in the axial code ‘Out of hours service provision’. The process of examining each SW, and the intersections and the abutting of SWs in relation to the data collected, was followed until an in-depth picture was obtained. This enabled the individual’s SW as well as that of the wider group they belonged to be identified.

<p>The SW of the individual nurse is influenced by such factors as their prior experience of palliative care, personal beliefs and values shaping practice and the emotive influences of the case. Two SWs were identified from the data that impacted upon experience of the individual community nurses; the SWs of the wider nursing team (including the team management) and the child and family. In addition, an SSW, that of the inter-professional team providing the care to the individual child, was identified.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987113491759" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>For contextualisation of the data a description of the cases is given and then examples of the findings are presented to exemplify the identified SWs and SSWs using extracts from the interview transcripts. The findings highlight the impact of SWs on all aspects of care provision; from the strategic management of an out of hours service to one to one interaction between a nurse and family member.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1744987113491759"><title>The cases</title>
<p>Within the 12 cases the ages of the children ranged from 18 months to 17 years in age with diagnoses including solid tumours (including brain tumours) and leukaemias. Care was provided within the family home with cases coming from both rural and urban locations. In all the cases, the SSWs providing palliative care to an individual child were unique, with individuals working together for often the first and only time. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744987113491759">Table 3</xref> provides a summary of case characteristics.

<sec id="sec12-1744987113491759"><title>SW of the nursing team</title>
<p>This study has identified a substantial variation in care provision between CCN/CPCN teams with some teams (of which cases 2 and 6 are exemplified) providing formalised (part of their contract), others (Case 3) ‘voluntary’, out of hours care. When out of hours care was a ‘voluntary’ aspect of the role it was not always perceived as being acknowledged, or recompensed, by management.<disp-quote>
<p> … it was felt management did not understand that when we’re on call that isn’t really part of our working hours or we don’t get paid for it or that it is voluntary basis and you don’t have to do it. (Case 3 CCN 3)</p></disp-quote>Although nurse managers acknowledged that out of hours care was being provided, no formal structure existed to ensure that the service provision was equitable and sustainable. If properly executed and reviewed voluntary out of hours service provision could provide evidence for the need for a formalised service.</p>
<p>Although not examined in this study, the current lack of standardisation in out of hours care payment for nurses may well impact upon the ability of the wider teams to both recruit and retain staff.<disp-quote>
<p> … it’s always been sort of, our managers describe that it’s our goodwill, because we don’t seek extra payment for it, we take time back in lieu … (Case 6 CCN 2)</p></disp-quote>In Case 6 the nursing out of hours care provision was formalised and the managers appeared responsive to service needs. Practice had been deemed untenable due to the numbers of nurses on duty, numbers of patients requiring the service and the distances the nurses’ had to travel. The nurse managers took the decision to reduce the service stating that it would be offered to only one child and family at a time.<disp-quote>
<p> … until that point there’d been one child at a time … we were looking at three children with very similar needs living in opposite ends of the county and who do you prioritise? (Case 6 CCN 2)</p></disp-quote>Although the rationale for the decision was acknowledged by the nurses, they were faced with striving to ensure that families who would previously have received care out of hours still received optimal care. Case 6 CCN 2 who had a close working relationship with a child and family and described it as ‘ … difficult … ’ and ‘ … frustrating … ’ not being able to offer out of hours support to the child and family, particularly as they had ‘ … known her for so long … ’</p>
<p>The SWs of the nurses and the management team, even where a formalised out of hours service existed, proved not to be completely intersected.</p>
<p>The SW of the individual nurse is influenced by their prior experience of, and training and education in, palliative care. This, in turn, can affect the SW of the wider team if a nurse is unable to carry out care due to a lack of specialist skills. Developing and maintaining practical specialist skills, such as the management of syringe drivers, were highlighted by this study as a particular difficulty for some nurses. The potential implications arising from such training and/or competence deficits could not only affect patient care and safety but also nurses’ professional accountability in working within their level of skill and competence. An identified contributing factor was that these skills were infrequently used by nurses, with often many months passing between individual children requiring syringe drivers in palliative care<disp-quote>
<p> … the problem is eighteen months can elapse before we are asked to do it again and the staff feel less confident … (Case 2 CCN)</p></disp-quote>Despite ‘in-house’ training sessions arranged by the nurse team leaders in Case 2 some of the nurses never gained sufficient competence or confidence in the management of syringe drivers to be able to participate in their formalised out of hours care provision service. The team leaders faced additional difficulties in covering the service as some of nurses held ‘flexible contracts’ giving them the option to decide whether or not they participated in out of hours care whilst others declined to participate when they did not know the family.<disp-quote>
<p> … people have commitments, which is something that needed to be overcome as certain people in the team do work on a flexible contract, but weren’t actually as flexible as it was envisaged … first of all people felt that they needed to know the family well to go on call for them … (Case 2 CCN)</p></disp-quote>What is not known from the data collected on Case 2 is whether this was a unique situation that the team leaders were facing arising for example, from inexperienced nurses joining the team, or whether it was an on-going issue they faced with each episode of palliative care. The combination of factors resulted in all the out of hours care for the child being provided by just two nurses, the team leaders. This deficit of background information does not however detract from achieving the study’s aim of examining the individual’s experience; the impact on the individual team leaders was clearly evident; even for these experienced nurses providing an effective out of hours care service with just two people proved challenging.<disp-quote>
<p>(it was) … quite a major undertaking to provide a core service for four weeks … because it was a long time it was actually quite draining, we did the day job as well … (Case 2 CPCN)</p></disp-quote>The experiences of nurses in out of hours care provision is influenced by the organisation of the service, whether it is a formalised part of their contract or something they provide voluntarily. Decisions made by management, as well as fellow team members, can impact upon their working environment further influencing their experience. What this study does not explore (due to the sampling method used) is the potential impact on the SWs of the nurses who declined to participate in out of hours care (for example, whether they addressed their learning deficits), or how their decisions impacted on the working relationships within the SW of the nursing team.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1744987113491759"><title>SW of the Child and Family</title>
<p>The SW of each child and family is unique. Developing a good relationship with the family from the outset was seen as essential in order to fully identify and meet their needs.<disp-quote>
<p>I think if you can build up a good relationship with the family that certainly anchors everything else in place. (Case 11 CCN)</p></disp-quote>There was a fine balance between the nurses’ wanting to undertake their perceived role and their meeting the needs of the family.<disp-quote>
<p> …very clearly at the beginning that they didn’t want phone calls … they wanted to mange it all the way through … It’s very hard as a nurse you want to get hands on and do but they didn’t want that … It’s trying to get that balance. Is it feeling uncomfortable for us? As long as it’s right for the family then actually that’s the main issue. (Case 4 CCN 2)</p></disp-quote>The emotive nature of palliative care often results in close working relationships being developed between the nurses and family members, with the risk of a blurring of boundaries.<disp-quote>
<p> … Mum at the end she said I don’t see you as nurses I see you as friends coming in the door … She said something like you know I’m more closer to you as my own family … (Case 3 CCN 2)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>It was like going out to some friend’s house, we like the same sort of things, going to someone’s house for you know 18 months to 2 years you get to know them really well don’t you? You can’t keep it totally professional all the time. You blur the boundaries. (Case 3 CCN 5)</p></disp-quote>Recognition of the potential difficulties in balancing and establishing close working relationships with the child and family whilst maintaining a professional boundary was found<disp-quote>
<p>We’re a service, we’re not friends to a family, we’re a service. (Case 4 CCN 1)</p></disp-quote>The experience of the care provision is influenced by the unique working relationship between the individual nurse and the child and family, essentially the effectiveness of the integration of these two SWs. The relationship is shaped by many factors, such as the depth and frequency of intervention the family accepts or the individual personalities of family members and nurses. The findings illustrate the complexities that nurses face in striving to develop a close working relationship with the child and family in what can be a short period of time; a relationship that will enable them to identify and meet the needs of the child and family whilst maintaining professional boundaries.</p>
<sec id="sec14-1744987113491759"><title>SSW of the inter-professional team providing the care to the child</title>
<p>The individual team providing the actual palliative care to a child with cancer may consist of a number of different professionals such as general practitioners, nurses and allied health professionals, for example physiotherapists. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987113491759">Figure 1</xref> depicts an example of an SSW that may form to provide care to a child requiring palliative care at home. This SSW is often working together for the first and only time in providing care to one child and family. Effective inter-professional working requires a clear understanding of colleagues’ roles and responsibilities and knowledge and expertise in order to utilise each individual’s skills and expertise to the best ability. In addition there is a need to develop effective communication pathways both between and within the professional groups. The duration of palliative care impacts upon the ability for effective working relationships and communication pathways to develop between the SWs and for the sharing of knowledge and expertise to be fully utilised.
<fig id="fig1-1744987113491759" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Representation of an SSW that may form to provide care to a child requiring palliative care at home. The inner circle represents the SSW comprising the individual health care professionals that may be involved in providing palliative care to one child, the outer circle the professional group. These SSWs are fluid, abutting and intersecting with each other at different times during the trajectory of the palliative care. Key: OT, occupational therapist; CCN, community children’s nurse; CPCN, children’s palliative care nurse; SN, school nurse; HV, health visitor; GP, general practitioner</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1744987113491759-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>In examining the SWs of the nurses, the CCNs and CPCNs’ were found to often intersect, the teams frequently integrated through undertaking joint visits or communicating by telephone. Only one further example of intersecting SWs was identified in the study arising from a joint CCN and GP visit, but this proved not to be planned and appeared to have occurred coincidentally,<disp-quote>
<p> … on a couple of occasions he just happened to turn up whilst we were there. (Case 3 CCN 1)</p></disp-quote>Inter-professional collaborative working, such as joint visits, can be beneficial in the transmission of knowledge, with opportunities for knowledge to be gained through observation, discussion and co-working. The geographical location of team members and lack of established working relationships and communication pathways can affect inter-professional collaborative working. Within paediatric palliative care CCNs and CPCN teams are rarely based within GP practices, unlike district nursing teams who are often based within the same premises.<disp-quote>
<p> … because I work in this area and cover a lot of GPs I don’t have the same working relationship as maybe say an adult district nurse would with a GP. (Case 2 CCN)</p></disp-quote>The SSW of the team providing care to the child and family faces many challenges but also offers opportunities. The effectiveness of the team working is influenced by the SWs of the individual professionals and their wider teams, including management. Good communication pathways are fundamental to effective team working and can help address challenges and enhance opportunities.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1744987113491759" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>SWT was used in this study, for the first time in this health care setting, to examine influences on experiences of nurses providing out of hours paediatric palliative care for a child with cancer. Using SWT as a theoretical framework in this study was valuable in providing a systematic approach to understanding the influences on individual experiences in a paediatric palliative care setting.</p>
<p>The discussion will be presented following the format of the SWs of nursing team and child and family and the SSW of the interprofessional team incorporating the intersections between the SWs. The activities of each SW and SSW varied according to wide-ranging influences such as the SWs of the individual nurses. The nurses’ individual beliefs and values, professional codes of conduct and working environment informed their SW and their experience of the palliative care provision. Their experience was also informed by the level of intersection with the SWs of their nursing team, the child and family and the inter-professional team providing the direct care to the child and family.</p>
<p>The provision of out of hours nursing care was not standardised across the cases. The lack of standardisation not only arose from the organisation of the service but from individual nurses’ skills and training and decisions on working patterns. Where services were not formalised care provision appeared to be reliant on individual nurses within a team to provide a ‘voluntary’ service. Although not ideal for reasons already described, such as sustainability, this could, if properly implemented, be a means of collecting evidence for the need for an optimal formalised service.</p>
<p>The SWs of the nurse and management showed signs of intersection (such as described earlier in Case 6 where services were reduced and offered to only one child and family at a time in order to promote manageable workloads for nurses) but also identified areas where communication between the worlds could have been enhanced. The impact of ‘voluntary’ on-call contracts and individual nurses’ determining whether they participate in out of hours care are examples of where intersection between the SWs of nurses and management could have been improved.</p>
<p>The out of hours palliative care provision, the arena characterising the interaction of the SWs, is shaped by processes; processes arising from the organisation of the service and from the actions of individuals or individual teams. This study has identified multi-factorial impacts on the care provision which demonstrate the often indeterminable factors that affect the ability for a team to provide effective care. This study has shown the difficulties team leaders face in not being able to accurately factor in decisions that individual nurses may make with regard to their participating in out of hours care, even when a formal service exists.</p>
<p>The influence of the SWs of the child and family on the experience of the nurse was more complex in that although intersection and establishment of effective communication pathways were paramount, there was also a need to ensure professional boundaries were maintained as their working relationships developed in an emotive environment. The nurses’ level of involvement was influenced by both the family’s acceptance of their input and the care required.</p>
<p>The SSW of the inter-professional team providing the care to the child was often unique in that it was the first time the health professionals had worked together. Effective team working was influenced by the team’s ability to overcome potential problems arising from their disparate geographical locations, working together for the first time and the often short duration of the palliative care.</p>
<p>The independent report on children’s and young people palliative care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987113491759">Craft and Killen, 2007</xref>) which informed the focus of this paper, was undertaken between November 2006 and January 2007, after the completion of the data collection for this study. This oncology focused study supports and provides further insights into, and evidence of, the substantial variation in children’s out of hours specialist palliative care provision highlighted in the review and the day to day difficulties staff face in striving to provide the service. In 2008 Better care: Better Lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987113491759">Department of Health, 2008</xref>) was published detailing the way forward for children’s palliative care services highlighting the need for out of hours specialist palliative care services and confirms that the need to standardise out of hours palliative care provision is now widely recognised.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1744987113491759"><title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>Nurses providing out of hours paediatric palliative care should work within a contracted, optimal formalised service.</p>
<p>The unique relationship developed between the nurse and the child and family can be influenced by the emotive nature of the care provision and leads to blurred professional boundaries.</p>
<p>Effective inter-professional working can be beneficial to both the individual nurse and their wider team as well as to the child and family.</p>
<p>Using SWT has helped identify influences on the experiences of nurses providing palliative care. Experiences were shaped by the SWs of the individual, the nursing team, the child and family and the inter-professional team providing the care to the child and family. Individual’s attributes, the organisation of the service provision (whether formalised or voluntary) as well as the actions of colleagues, management and the child and family, all can influence the experience. This study has identified the need for greater intersection of the SWs in order to enhance opportunities for peer education, learning and mutual support. Standardising a formal out of hours palliative care nursing service, providing clear roles and responsibilities, will aid teams in providing an effective out of hours service.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987113491759"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>A limitation to this study is that it did not examine the views of the family although it is recognised that this could inform the development if service provision in out of hours care. A further study is currently being undertaken looking at families and GPs’ views in order to obtain a wider understanding of these SWs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1744987113491759" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although the aim of this paper was to explore influences on the experiences of paediatric nurses providing out of hours palliative care within the family home to children with cancer, findings could inform practice in other specialties that encompass inter-professional working, such as palliative care for children with non-malignant disease. Providing paediatric palliative care requires a coordinated inter-professional approach with knowledge and skills being transferred both across and within the identified SWs. Each individual health professional is a key player in the care in their own right. However, it is through a collective approach, the individual segmenting from a SW and integrating into a newly formed unique SSW providing care to one child, that the provision of comprehensive care is facilitated.</p>
<p>This paper has highlighted examples of wide-ranging factors that inform the experiences of nurses providing palliative care, some arising from their own SW, others from the worlds that they intersect. Through the intersecting of SWs the nurses have the opportunity to enhance their knowledge and expertise and receive support. Enhanced intersection and communication will provide managers with better insight into the wider implications of care provision, enabling potential problems to be identified and addressed at the earliest opportunity and promoting dialogue initiated by the nurses providing the care.</p>
<p>SWT has facilitated exploration of the influences on community nurses’ experiences of providing out of hours paediatric palliative care. The relevant and applicable framework has enabled the impact of a wide range of variables to be explored from both the perspectives of the SWs of the individual nurse, the nursing team, the child and family, and the inter-professional team providing the care. Awareness and knowledge of the influences of SWs on the experience of the individual nurse can be useful in informing service development.</p>
