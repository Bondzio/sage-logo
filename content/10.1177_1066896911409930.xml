<abstract>
<p>A 37-year-old woman was found to have multiple peritoneal nodules, including on the uterine serosa, at Cesarean section. Histology showed yellow crystalline material surrounded by histiocytes and occasional multinucleate giant cells. Further enquiry revealed that the patient underwent a cholecystectomy for a perforated gallbladder 3 years earlier. Pathologists should be aware of this uncommon complication of bile leakage, which has the potential to clinically mimic disseminated malignancy. This may become increasingly common in the future since bile leakage is more likely to occur with laparoscopic than open cholecystectomy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The presence of multiple peritoneal nodules typically results in clinical suspicion of a disseminated malignancy. In this report, we describe the unusual occurrence of multiple peritoneal bile granulomas, mainly affecting the pelvis, as a complication of prior gallbladder perforation. Given the increasing propensity for laparoscopic rather than open cholecystectomy, it is likely that bile granulomas will be encountered more commonly in the future since the former is more likely to result in bile leakage and spillage of gallstones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911409930">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911409930">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 37-year-old para 2 + 1 woman underwent Cesarean section at 37 weeks gestation following spontaneous rupture of membranes (she had 2 previous Cesarean sections because of breech presentations). At the time of Cesarean section, several peritoneal nodules were identified, mainly involving the uterine serosa and pelvic peritoneum. This resulted in suspicion of a malignant process. Both fallopian tubes and ovaries were noted to be grossly normal. Two small nodules were removed. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery.</p>
<p>Following histological examination of the biopsy, review of the case notes and prior pathology reports revealed that the patient had acute cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation and subsequent open cholecystectomy 3 years previously.</p>

<title>Pathological Findings</title>
<p>Each biopsy consisted of a 5-mm diameter piece of tissue.</p>
<p>Histological examination showed the biopsies to consist of yellow crystalline material, morphologically in keeping with bile, surrounded by a rim of histiocytes with foamy cytoplasm and occasional multinucleate giant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911409930">Figure 1</xref>). A little surrounding adipose tissue was present, which was focally decidualised. No tumor was present.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gallstones (calculi) are extremely common in Western society, especially in multiparous females. The majority of patients with gallstones are asymptomatic but symptomatic patients often proceed to cholecystectomy. Previously, this was performed by an open technique but since the mid 1990s, laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the operation of choice for elective treatment of symptomatic gallstone disease. Laparascopic techniques have benefits in terms of decreased postoperative pain and recovery time. However, there is an increased risk of bile leakage or gallstone spillage with greater difficulties in irrigation and retrieval when compared to open techniques. A literature review in 2004 found an incidence of intraoperative gallbladder perforation of 18.3% with laparoscopic surgery and a gallstone spillage rate of 7.3% with 37% of stones remaining unretrieved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911409930">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Early complications of intraoperative and postoperative bile leakage or stone spillage include bile peritonitis, which presents with acute symptoms. However, a large number of patients experience bile leakage without developing acute symptoms. This may be explained in some cases by intraoperative observation of leakage or spillage with immediate irrigation or stone retrieval. However, minor bile leaks may occur postoperatively with no corrective measures being undertaken and in most cases acute symptoms are not experienced. Initially, bile leakage and stone spillage, if not associated with acute symptoms, were thought to be silent events of no consequence and with no adverse sequelae. However, several studies have highlighted medium to long-term complications including abscess or fistula formation and other rare events such as expectoration of the stone or dyspareunia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911409930">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We describe an apparently uncommon complication of bile leakage, namely the occurrence of multiple bile granulomas, which at Cesarean section resulted in a clinical suspicion of disseminated malignancy. The nodules were mainly situated in the pelvis, including on the uterine serosa. As far as we are aware, there are only 2 somewhat similar cases in the literature. In one case, multiple red-brown pigmented pelvic adhesions that mimicked endometriosis were identified in a 20-year-old who presented with abdominal pain several months following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911409930">4</xref></sup> In the other case, a 32-year-old was found to have hard nodules in the omentum at a Cesarean section performed 2 years following splitting of gallstones at laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911409930">5</xref></sup> There have also been occasional reports of gallstones implanting in the ovary following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911409930">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911409930">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the increasing frequency of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the relatively high incidence of bile leakage, it is probable that cases such as we report will be more commonly encountered in the future. Bile granulomas should be added to the potential list of causes of peritoneal granulomatous inflammation, which may include a reaction to suture, starch, bowel contents, or other foreign materials, Crohn’s disease or diverticular disease, previous diathermy, tuberculous, fungal or parasitic infections, sarcoidosis, postoperative necrotizing reaction, and endometriosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911409930">5</xref></sup>; these are similar to the causes of ovarian granulomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911409930">8</xref></sup> In the case we report, yellow crystalline material, consistent with bile, was present within the granulomas making the diagnosis straightforward once the past history became apparent.</p>
<p>The patient in our case was pregnant and the most common cause of peritoneal nodules in this scenario is ectopic decidua, which is extremely common on the surfaces of the ovary, omentum and peritoneum and which may clinically mimic malignancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911409930">9</xref></sup>; in our case, there was focal decidualization of the adipose tissue in the biopsy. Other potential benign causes of multiple peritoneal nodules in pregnancy include endometriosis and disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911409930">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we report a case of multiple peritoneal bile granulomas discovered in a young woman at Cesarean section. This was secondary to prior gallbladder rupture and bile leakage 3 years previously. Bile granulomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of peritoneal granulomas. These are likely to be encountered more commonly in the future given the increasing use of laparoscopic techniques.</p>
