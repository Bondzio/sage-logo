<p>Charles Barbour tells us early on in his book that: “no matter how much of that massive assemblage of documents we now call ‘Karl Marx’ has been scrutinized and examined over the decades, there is still, and there will be for some time, a great deal more that has hardly been considered even once, let alone subjected to a meaningful history of interpretation.” (5) The very idea of Karl Marx being an assemblage of documents, not to mention being called “Karl Marx” (in quotation marks) alerts us to the tones and methods of this superb book. The author drills deep down into Marxist textual analysis, offering us a kind of metanarrative of Marxist thought that is both highly de Manian (Barbour excels at terms like “parody of parodies” and other such de Manian style locutions) and deeply original.</p>
<p>The central animating idea of <italic>The Marx Machine</italic> may be found in Barbour’s analysis of a typically (for this book) obscure-seeming document: Marx’s doctoral dissertation entitled <italic>On the Difference Between Democritean and Epicurean Philosophies of Nature</italic>. In favoring Epicurus over Democritus’ respective understandings of Greek atomism, Marx argued that the Democritean version, wherein atoms ceaselessly fall in straight lines ‘“surrenders its individuality’ to the line.” (94) That is, in Democritean theory, there is no place for resistance, no way to express anything that is not already given. Epicurus, who amended Democritean theory with a theory of the “swerve” (or <italic>clinament</italic>) is, for Marx, the correct thinker insofar as “In doing so, in asserting its individuality, the atom enters into relations with other atoms. Thus the <italic>clinament</italic> cedes both singularity and relation. The atom withdraws from determination so as to enter into relation.” (94).</p>
<p>Barbour reads this, very persuasively, as a central metaphor to explain Marx’s own approach to individualism, resistance, and humanity’s social nature. Avoiding many of the orthodoxies associated with Marx (which are swatted away in vast numbers over the course of this book), Barbour uses this example of Marxist theory to suggest the way that Marxism as a whole (i.e. “that massive assemblage of documents we now call ‘Karl Marx’”) is not deterministic, but rather is based on, and welcoming of, the swerves, the political practices and unexpected results of political action.</p>
<p>More tellingly, although Barbour doesn’t quite say this explicitly, the engagement with Greek atomism in Marx’s dissertation suggests a deeper point that lies at the heart of <italic>The Marx Machine</italic>. When encountering two esoteric Greek forms of natural philosophy, Marx picks one, not because it is “true” but rather because it better serves his own purposes. He is, in effect, choosing to believe (or portray a belief in) humanity’s ability for self-determination and, in so choosing, he in effect gives himself the ability to self-determine. This is an illustration of the Althusserian/Žižekian notion of ideology that Barbour supports. As he argues “an ideology is not an illusion that conceals something real, but the illusion that something real has been concealed.” (107)</p>
<p>Barbour reads the entirety of Marx’s writings (and Engel’s as well – Barbour repeatedly and fascinatingly engages in the collaborative nature of their writing, the way it reproduces a kind of Marxist division of labor insofar as Engels did most of the handwriting) through this lens. There is a constant tension, Barbour argues, between the constative and performative aspects of these texts, where the appearance of constative utterances – with their seeming determinism – are in fact simultaneously performative or strategic, oriented not towards what is but what could be (insofar as its possibility is determined by its own self assertion: a swerve).</p>
<p>Barbour cites for example a line from “Towards a Critique of Hegel’s <italic>Philosophy of Right</italic>” where Marx writes: “The deficiency of all society must be inversely concentrated in another class; a particular class must be a class that rouses universal scandal and incorporates all limitations: a particular social sphere must be regarded as the notorious crime of the whole society, so that the liberation of the sphere appears as the universal self liberation. So that one class par excellence may appear as the class of liberation, another class must inversely be the manifest class of oppression.” (32)</p>
<p>In Barbour’s hands, this statement becomes a moment of revealing, not the “meaning” of the text (since that is something that is always being determined and redetermined) but rather an indication of strategy. It’s not that the proletariat are actually a “universal class” or that their defeat of the bourgeoisie is inevitable, it’s that it is strategic to use this language so as to create what is, in effect, a universal class (and, in the process emphasize the bourgeoisie as “the manifest class of oppression”). Such a reading is consistent with a line from <italic>The German Ideology</italic> that Barbour returns to repeatedly: ‘“communism is not a <italic>state of affairs</italic> which is to be established, an ideal to which reality will have to adjust itself’ but instead ‘the <italic>real</italic> movement that abolishes the present state of things.”’ (34) Thus politics is “any real movement that cannot be entirely contained by recognized political forms,” a swerve or clinamen from what already is, from the idea of all that “must be.” More accurately, Marx and Engels – and Barbour too for that matter – appropriate the “must be” from constative utterances and the “recognized political forms” in order to subvert them for revolutionary purposes.</p>
<p>The idea behind the title of <italic>The Marx Machine</italic> comes from a Deleuzian take on de Man’s notion of the “text as body.” Barbour offers instead “the text as machine,” wherein the contradictions and peculiarities of the text allow “meaning to multiply.” (11) Barbour relates this notion to a reading of Marx’s “fragment on machines” from the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>. This fragment offers both a reading of how machines, far from alienating human beings, are in fact a key component in creating sociality in the workplace (by coordinating and uniting workers) and, more critically for Barbour, a notion of how writing about machines influences Marx’s own writing. Barbour writes: “Precisely there where Marx writes about machines, his writing becomes mechanical, or concerned with the kind of repetition and doubling that we associate with mechanical processes, rather than the surfaces and depths that we associate with specifically human or psychic ones.” (121)</p>
<p>For Barbour, the machine-like quality of Marx’s writing is especially manifest in the central tropes Marx engages with, especially the trope of parody. Contrasting his own reading to that of Robert Paul Wolff’s <italic>Moneybags Must be So Lucky: On the Literary Structure of Capital</italic>, Barbour argues against Wolff’s position that Marx writes with irony. Instead of irony, which emphasizes some forms of insider knowledge, a basic inequality of access to knowledge, Barbour offers parody, a repetition of other texts which both steals their best assets from them and, at the same time, lets them be damned by their own words (Barbour is great at showing how Marx and Engels mercilessly skewer Max Stirner with this devise even as they abscond with what is best about his work).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872113479228">6</xref></sup> Repetition, parody and copying are constant motifs in Barbour’s analysis and they do indeed offer a kind of mechanical understanding of literature as iteration. Here, there is no “original” to Marx, no kernel of truth beneath his words. There are only copies and iterations, collaboration and vast assemblages of texts.</p>
<p>Such a reading also fits into the political upshot of this book wherein treating the text as machine (and, in particular, the text of “Karl Marx”) allows for – or rather simply posits – a notion that “all audiences have access to everything, and all intelligences are assumed to be equal.” (123) Specifically linking such a view to the contemporary work of Badiou and Rancière, Barbour sees this mechanical approach as offering an alternative, not only Marx’s own contemporaries such as Bruno Bauer, but also to their modern day antecedents, the “new republicans” such as Arendt, Lefort, and Mouffe. Against a view of politics wherein groups or sets of individuals battle it out in the political sphere (the republican view), Barbour posits a “sense in which humans create the social bond, or constitute what unifies them through their speech and deeds” that is, their politics. (132)</p>
<p>What is fascinating about this book is that it does not so much upgrade Marx so that he is compatible with contemporary theories of post-structuralism, as argue that Marx was already a post-structuralist even (or maybe especially) at the earliest part of his career – before the “break” that Althusser sees (and, as a result of his reading, we all similarly “see”) between Marx’s early humanism and his later “scientific” writings. Barbour’s readings of Marx tend to group around the early and the obscure. He reads a <italic>lot</italic> of the <italic>German Ideology</italic>, especially the parts that he argues (and I’m sure he is right) that no one ever reads, and, in particular, “the Leipzig Council.”</p>
<p>I suppose it would be fair to judge <italic>The Marx Machine</italic> on the basis of its own stated focus on performativity; that is to say, how well does this book perform its own argument? On the whole, I would say it does so excellently. There are a few stumbles or oddities (such as one point where the author, taking the metaphor of philosophy as masturbation a bit too far, contemplates an orgy between Marx and Engels. Even if this meant only metaphorically, it suggests an imposition of the theoretical on the actual that is, I think, antithetical to Barbour’s overall argument). Early on in the book, the de Manian insights come in a bit too fast and furiously. In a way, I’d have liked this book to have been much longer because Barbour has a habit of saying these amazing, dense things and then swiftly moving on to leave the reader wanting much, much more. He is, however, to be commended (and I realize this is contradicting what I just wrote) for his wonderful brevity; extremely complicated notions are engaged with – and often dismissed – in a matter of two or three swift and fierce sentences.</p>
<p>There have been a plethora of new, and great books on communism and Marxism recently – Jodi Dean and Bruno Bosteels, among others (including, of course, Badiou, Rancière, and Žižek), are part of a resurgence of thinking about the role of Marx and the possibility of communism in thinking about the future of the left. This book is a welcome and highly significant addition to this engagement; it not only overcomes the longstanding sense of division between the old and new left, it argues that it never actually existed in the first place. <italic>The Marx Machine</italic> permits us to return to Marx (for those of us who left him), to take him seriously and to see how his message (not just in terms of its content, but just as crucially in terms of its form) continues to resonate, continues to matter deeply for our own times and predicaments.</p>

<p>One way in which Barbour himself epitomizes this aspect of parody is when he refers to Marx, as already noted, as “Karl Marx.” This deploys a trick used by Marx and Engels when they call Max Stirner “Max Stirner” (among other epithets) only in this case, such a usage serves, not to undermine the argument of the figure in question (as with Stirner) but to pay homage.</p>
