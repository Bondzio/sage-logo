<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Interferon-beta is used to reduce disease activity in multiple sclerosis, but its action is incompletely understood, individual treatment response varies among patients, and biological markers predicting clinical benefits have yet to be identified. Since it is known that multiple sclerosis patients have a deficit of the regulatory T-cell subsets, we investigated whether interferon-beta therapy induced modifications of the two main categories of regulatory T cells (Tregs), natural and IL-10-secreting inducible Tr1 subset, in patients who are biologically responsive to the therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> T-cell phenotype was determined by flow cytometry, while real-time PCR was used to evaluate interferon-beta bioactivity through MxA determination, and to measure the RNA for IL-10 and CD46 molecule in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with anti-CD46 and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, which are known to expand a Tr1-like population.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Interferon-beta induced a redistribution of natural Treg subsets with a shift of naive Tregs towards the ‘central memory-like’ Treg population that expresses the CCR7 molecule required for the in vivo suppressive activity. Furthermore, in a subgroup of treated patients, the CD46/CD3 co-stimulation, probably through the Tr1-like subset modulation, increased the production of RNA for IL-10 and CD46. The same group showed a lower median EDSS score after two years of therapy.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The selective increase of ‘central memory-like’ subset and the involvement of the Tr1-like population may be two of the mechanisms by which interferon-beta achieves its beneficial effects. The quantification of RNA for IL-10 and CD46 could be used to identify patients with a different response to interferon-beta therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Evidences suggesting a role for regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the control and suppression of autoaggressive immune responses have been progressively growing over the years and the definition of which cells are actually regulatory as well as the methods used for their quantification have evolved over time. Tregs can be divided into two main categories: naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs), which are thymic-derived CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells that suppress T-cell response through contact with surface molecules,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511427720">1</xref></sup> and inducible Tregs, which are generated in the periphery and are capable of inhibiting immune responses in a contact independent manner. There are at least two populations of inducible Tregs, identified because of interleukin (IL)-10 (Tr1 subset)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511427720">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511427720">3</xref></sup> or transforming growth factor beta (Th3 subset) secretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511427720">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511427720">5</xref></sup> In multiple sclerosis (MS) most researches have been mainly focused on nTregs, demonstrating their decreased suppressor capacity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511427720">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511427720"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511427720"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511427720">9</xref></sup> most often in the context of a conserved number.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511427720">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511427720">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511427720">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511427720"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511427720">11</xref></sup> While the majority of data suggested a functional defect more than an absolute quantitative nTreg deficit as a possible cause of reduced suppressor activity, Michel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511427720">12</xref></sup> proposed that the deficient Treg activity observed in MS results from artefactual incorporation of effector CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>high</sup> T cell in Treg activity assays, when for Treg preparation only CD4 and CD25 were used for cell subset purification. In addition, there were also contrasting reports suggesting a decrease of Treg proportion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511427720">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511427720">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511427720">14</xref></sup> as well as data indicating a lower production of Tregs recently released from the thymus, called ‘recent thymic emigrants-Tregs’ or RTE-Tregs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511427720">15</xref></sup> A further, major, Treg defect in MS appeared to be associated with the CD46 pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511427720">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511427720">17</xref></sup> CD46 is a potent costimulatory molecule for human T cells that can induce a Tr1-like phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511427720">18</xref></sup> Earlier results by Astier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511427720">16</xref></sup> indicated that CD46 activation was impaired in some patients with MS because T cells stimulated with CD46 and CD3 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) showed a reduced production of IL-10, which was associated with an increased expression of one of the two cytoplasmic isoforms of CD46 molecule. The expression of the two isoforms fluctuated dynamically in a time-dependent fashion after T-cell stimulation with anti-CD46/CD3 MoAbs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511427720">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Up to now, a few studies have evaluated the effects of interferon-beta (IFNβ) treatment on Treg number or activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511427720">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511427720">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511427720">20</xref></sup> but neither has investigated both nTregs and Tr1-like cells’ modulation in the same group of patients, nor taken into account the possibility that results could be biased by the presence of patients with impaired IFNβ bioactivity due to anti-IFNβ antibodies, which has been shown to reach high levels of up to 12% even in the early months of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511427720">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>One way to detect the loss of bioactivity due to the presence of anti-IFNβ antibodies is the quantification of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511427720">21</xref></sup> Indeed, the induction of MxA RNA is inhibited by the presence of anti-IFNβ antibodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511427720">22</xref></sup> and its quantification has the highest specificity in detecting IFN receptor stimulation by the type I IFNs.</p>
<p>Here, in an attempt to understand whether the modulation of Treg subsets can be used as a possible marker of the best responders to the treatment, we enrolled patients treated for at least two years with IFNβ and patients followed up for 12 months since therapy start. After identifying MS patients who are likely to be IFNβ responders, given the presence of MxA induction, nTregs were quantified by flow cytometry, while Tr1-like cells, obtained after CD46/CD3 in vitro co-stimulation, were indirectly studied by quantifying the expression of the RNA for IL-10 and CD46 with real-time PCR.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1352458511427720">
<title>Patients and blood sampling</title>
<p>One hundred and three patients (age from 19 to 63 years) with relapsing–remitting MS according to the McDonald criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511427720">23</xref></sup> were enrolled. Their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, evaluated in each MS Centre by a single physician in order to maintain reliability, ranged from 0 to 2.5. Among them, 49 had been treated with IFNβ-1a (22 and 44 µg s.c. three times per week, or 30 µg i.m. once per week) for at least 24 months, and 50 (the ‘follow-up’ group) began the treatment with either one of the three IFNβ preparations at the moment of the inclusion in the study and were then followed up for 12 months; samplings were done before treatment beginning (T0), and then after 6 and 12 (T6 and T12) months. Furthermore, a single blood sample was also obtained from four untreated patients. All patients signed a written informed consent at the start of the study, which was approved by the Spedali Civili of Brescia ethics committee (resolution no. 113/2006). Exclusion criteria were: concomitant treatment with other immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs or with steroids 30 days before blood drawing, fever or symptoms of infectious illness a week before blood sampling, history of poor therapy adherence, and other concomitant autoimmune diseases. Controls were 28 age-matched healthy donors (HDs) who had not been treated with steroids and did not show fever or flu-like symptoms. Blood samples (which in IFNβ-treated patients were drawn 12 hours after the drug injections) were collected into two tubes: one PAXgene tube (PreAnalytiX, Hilden, Germany) for blood mRNA extraction, and one heparin-coated tube for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolation by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were immediately cryopreserved in aliquots from 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells in ice-cold freezing medium (90% heat-inactivated low-endotoxin foetal calf serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) and stored overnight at -80°C before transfer into the vapour phase of a liquid nitrogen tank.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511427720">
<title>T-cell phenotype analysis</title>
<p>Cryopreserved PBMCs were rapidly thawed in a 37°C water bath and then added dropwise into 10 ml of culture media at 37°C. Cells were washed, rested for 2 h in 1–2 ml of culture media, resuspended in an appropriate volume of culture media and counted using trypan blue dye exclusion (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). T-cell subpopulations were assessed by six-colour flow cytometry analysis on 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs stained using various combinations of optimal staining concentrations (previously determined by titrations) of allophycocyanin-H7 anti-CD4, fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-CD45RA (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), phycoerythrin anti-CD25, peridinin-chlorophyll protein-Cy5.5 anti-CCR7 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), phycoerythrin-Cy7 anti-CD127 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), and allophycocyanin anti-CD31 (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) MoAbs. The staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and washes and incubations were done in RPMI supplemented with 4% foetal calf serum and 0.02% sodium azide. One million events were collected for each tube. Data acquisition was performed with a FACSCanto II cytometer and analysed with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>

<sec id="section5-1352458511427720">
<title>PBMC co-stimulation with anti-CD46 and anti-CD3 MoAbs</title>
<p>For PBMC stimulation, 24-well plates were coated with 10 µg/ml of: mouse non-specific isotype-matched control antibody (clone UPC 10; IgG2a; Sigma-Aldrich) alone or with anti-CD3 (IgG2a; eBioscience) MoAbs; anti-CD3 MoAb alone; anti-CD46 (IgG2a; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) alone or with anti-CD3 in 500 µl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin for 3 h at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. These MoAbs were functional grade purified, sterile-filtered, without azide, and with an endotoxin amount less than 0.001 ng/µg. After thawing, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> of cells from HDs and patients, diluted in 500 µl of complete RPMI 1640 containing 20% FCS and 80 U/ml of human recombinant IL-2 (Sigma-Aldrich), were added, in duplicate for each condition, to the wells and incubated for 24 h; the MoAbs used for coating were not eliminated, therefore their final concentration was 5 µg/ml. In separate experiments, PBMCs of four other untreated patients and three HDs were incubated under the above reported conditions in the presence or absence of 200 U/ml of IFNβ-1a.</p>

<sec id="section6-1352458511427720">
<title>Real-time PCR for quantification of RNA for MxA, IL-10 and CD46</title>
<p>Total RNA was prepared either from whole blood collected into PAXgene tubes using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (PreAnalytiX), or extracted from unstimulated and CD46/CD3 co-stimulated PBMCs using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Düren, Germany). To remove contaminating DNA, samples were treated with DNase, then eluted from the column and stored at -80°C. RNA yield and purity were assessed spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm. The amount of recovered RNA was about 0.5–1 µg for each sample. In some samples, to obtain 500 ng of RNA in a reaction volume of 30 µl used for the reverse transcription, RNA was precipitated with 1/10 of sodium acetate 3 M pH 5.2, 1 µl of glycogen 5 mg/ml (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and 2.5 v/v ethanol. Transcription of total RNA to cDNA was then performed with Taqman reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using random hexamers. cDNA for MxA quantification was subjected to real-time PCR in a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), using primers and probes specific for MxA and, as reference gene, the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase was employed, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511427720">21</xref></sup> As calibrator sample, in each run we used the same RNA extracted from the blood of a single healthy control, stored at -80°C. The relative quantification of MxA mRNA was calculated by the comparative Ct method according to the following formula: normalization ratio (NR) = 2<sup>-</sup>ΔΔ<italic><sup>Ct</sup></italic>, where the ΔΔ<italic>Ct</italic> value was obtained by the difference between the Δ<italic>Ct</italic> of the sample and the Δ<italic>Ct</italic> of the calibrator. The Δ<italic>Ct</italic> value was obtained by subtracting the <italic>Ct</italic> of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate-dehydrogenase from the <italic>Ct</italic> of MxA in each sample. According to the formula, the NR of the calibrator in each run is = 1.</p>
<p>Hs 99999035-m1 and Hs 00174507-m1 Taqman gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) were respectively used to analyse the expression of RNA for IL-10 and for CD46 molecules by real-time PCR. For these assays the beta-D-glucuronidase gene (Hs 9999908-m1; Applied Biosystems) was chosen as housekeeping gene after verifying that its expression was not altered after CD46/CD3 co-stimulation. Both assays consisted of a 20× mixture of a FAM™ dye-labelled TaqMan MGB probe and two unlabelled specific primers which were used respectively at the final concentration of 250 and 900 nM. The amplification programme and the formula used to calculate the RNA relative expression were the same as used for MxA. The level of IL-10 RNA in whole blood was calculated using the RNA extracted from the pooled PBMCs of 10 HDs as calibrator sample in each plate, while IL-10 and CD46 isoform expression after CD46/CD3 co-stimulation was calculated as fold-change relative to their amount detected in the RNA of the unstimulated PBMCs of each patient. Therefore, in the latter case, the NR of IL-10 and CD46 represents the change of expression induced by the co-stimulation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511427720">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Univariate comparisons were performed by non-parametrical methods, using the Mann–Whitney test in the case of single comparisons, and the Friedman test for the analysis of multiple datasets changing over time, which was followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test. Correlations were assessed by Spearman’s test. After identifying, graphically, two subgroups of treated patients with low and high RNA for CD46 isoform expression, the changes over time of immunological parameter within and between the two groups were analysed by two-way mixed factorial ANOVA. When the interaction between the factors’ ‘follow-up time’ and ‘low/high CD46 RNA group’ was significant, contrasts were performed to compare the values of the dependent variables between the two groups before (T0) and after (T12) IFNβ therapy. For all tests, the criterion for statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

The remaining MxA induced patients showed MxA values similar to those obtained in the subjects of the MxA induced ‘control’ patients. On the basis of MxA quantification, patients were therefore divided into MxA non-induced patients (MxA<sup>-</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 12), MxA induced follow-up patients (MxA<sup>+</sup>; <italic>n</italic> = 44) and MxA induced patients undergoing therapy for &gt; 24 months (MxA<sup>+</sup> &gt; 24; <italic>n</italic> = 43).</p>

<p>The percentages of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and RTEs, which are the ‘youngest’ among peripheral T cells and differ functionally and phenotypically from the rest of the naive T-cell pool, as well as of T<sub>CM</sub> and T<sub>EM</sub>, were equally represented in untreated patients, in those non-responsive to IFNβ, in the group of patients treated for more than 24 months, and in HDs (data not shown). On the contrary, in the follow-up group, there was a significant increase of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and RTEs, accompanied by a decrease of T<sub>CM</sub> cells after the therapy (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511427720">Figure 1A</xref>). According to previous observations that in healthy subjects RTEs constantly decreased during ageing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511427720">32</xref></sup> the percentage of RTEs was largely influenced by age in both untreated and treated patients, while the percentage of T<sub>CM</sub> cells significantly increased with increasing age only in patients without therapy (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511427720">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>No differences in the percentage of Treg and RTE-Treg populations were detected in untreated patients, in those non-responsive to IFNβ, in patients treated for more than 24 months, in the follow-up patients, and in HDs (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511427720">Figure 2</xref>). However, the fine analysis of Treg subpopulations demonstrated a redistribution of the Treg subsets within the total Treg population with the proportion of Treg<sub>CM</sub> cells significantly higher in patients treated for more than 24 months in comparison with untreated patients (T0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1352458511427720">Figure 2A</xref>); an opposite situation was observed for naive Tregs.

<title>Quantification of IL-10 and CD46 molecule RNA</title>
<p>IL-10 RNA levels quantified in whole blood were similar in samples of 25 HDs and of 50 MS patients analysed before therapy start, but were significantly higher in samples of the same patients taken after 12 months of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511427720">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, in PBMCs stimulated with a mouse IgG2a non-specific isotype-matched control antibody, with anti-CD3 or anti-CD46 MoAbs, the levels of IL-10 RNA were higher in IFNβ-treated patients in comparison with HDs and MS untreated patients. Concomitant stimulation with non-specific isotype-matched antibody and anti-CD3 MoAb was done only in HDs and yielded IL-10 levels similar to those found with IgG2a control antibody alone. When PBMCs prepared from 26 MxA induced patients and 25 HDs were stimulated with anti-CD46 plus anti-CD3 MoAbs and IL-2, IL-10 RNA values, although largely dispersed over a wide range, were significantly lower in both treated and untreated MS patients than in HDs. To investigate the reasons for this lower IL-10 RNA production in PBMCs of MS patients, we examined the expression of the CD46 molecule. After CD46/CD3 co-stimulation of PBMCs, RNA encoding for CD46 was significantly higher in both treated and untreated MS patients than in HDs, and was also higher than in PBMCs cultured with anti-CD3 or anti-CD46 MoAbs and with the non-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511427720">Figure 3A</xref>). However, CD46/CD3 co-cultured samples of patients treated with IFNβ could be divided into two groups with different RNA levels for CD46 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001): in one group the RNA was above and in the other one was below the median value. These two subgroups of patients, who were not observed in the pre-therapy period, showed some differential features. First of all, they differed in the ability to produce IL-10 ex vivo in response to IFNβ treatment because, while IL-10 RNA increased from T0 to T12 in both groups, the increase was steeper in the group with higher CD46 isoform RNA expression, leading to a significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) mean IL-10 RNA production after 12 months of therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511427720">Figure 3C</xref>). The patients belonging to the group with higher post-therapy CD46 RNA were neither those with higher production of IL-10 RNA in the pre-therapy CD46/CD3 co-stimulated PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511427720">Figure 3C</xref>; <italic>p</italic> = NS), nor those with more IL-10 mRNA content in whole blood (data not shown). Finally, patients whose cells contained a higher level of RNA for CD46 and IL-10 were those with a significantly lower median EDSS score 24 months after therapy beginning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1352458511427720">Figure 3D</xref>), while no differences in EDSS scores were found in the two groups before therapy start. In addition, in the patients of the low-CD46-RNA group, the EDSS increase from T0 to T24 resulted as significantly higher (mean EDSS difference from T24 to T0: 0.13 ± 0.48 <italic>vs</italic>. -0.38 ± 0.64, <italic>p</italic> = 0.023). The in vitro addition of IFNβ-1a induced an increased production of IL-10 in PBMCs of untreated patients and HDs cultured with IL-2 alone, IgG2a control antibody alone, CD3 MoAb alone, CD46 MoAb alone and with CD46/CD3 MoAbs, but only in PBMCs of untreated MS patients stimulated with anti-CD46 alone IL-10 showed a significant fold-change increase in comparison with PBMCs of HDs (Supplementary Table). This effect, however, was due to the very low basal level of IL-10 RNA produced in anti-CD46 culture, which was by far lower than that found in all other cultures performed in the absence of IFNβ-1a. In none of the culture conditions did the in vitro addition of IFNβ-1a induce significant differences in the expression of the CD46 molecule between patients and controls.</p>

Furthermore, attempts to identify Tregs in the peripheral blood of patients gave rise to conflicting results, with some investigators finding normal levels of Tregs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511427720">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511427720">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511427720">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511427720"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511427720">11</xref></sup> and others showing subsets of cells with typical markers of Tregs or of RTE-Tregs whose quantity was decreased in untreated patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511427720">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511427720">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511427720"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511427720"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511427720"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511427720"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511427720"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511427720">15</xref></sup> but then recovered after IFNβ treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511427720">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1352458511427720">34</xref></sup> These discrepancies can be due to the fact that the human Treg population is very heterogeneous, as gauged by both cell surface phenotype and functional capabilities, and to the different technologies and reagents used for the identification of these cells. For this study, we decided to identify nTregs as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>low/-</sup> lymphocytes, and RTE-Tregs as Tregs expressing the CD45RA, CCR7, and CD31 markers. However, CD127 expression does not discriminate nTregs from Tr1 cells, which, generated in the periphery against both self and foreign antigens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511427720">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1352458511427720">36</xref></sup> might and might not express FoxP3 and show variable expression of CD25.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1352458511427720">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511427720">37</xref></sup> Here, we tried to study Tr1-like subset by taking advantage of anti-CD3/CD46 co-stimulation inducing an expansion of this population, with a subsequent modulation of the two isoforms of CD46<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511427720">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511427720">19</xref></sup> and of IL-10 production. Since the expression of the two isoforms of CD46 seems to fluctuate differently during T-cell stimulation, depending on the timing of in vitro stimulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511427720">19</xref></sup> we investigated whether the modulation of CD46 RNA at a single time point could discriminate patients showing different clinical progression.</p>
<p>Finally, since a variable percentage of MS patients do not respond to IFNβ therapy, we have first identified biologically responder patients by quantifying MxA RNA induction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511427720">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511427720">24</xref></sup> In MxA induced patients we found that naive CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and RTEs progressively increased after 6 and 12 months of therapy, while total Tregs and RTE-Tregs remained unchanged during the follow-up. Considering that both RTEs and RTE-Tregs should be randomly released by the thymus, it is unlikely that IFNβ preferentially affects the output of only one of these two cell subsets. Rather, it is known that naive Tregs proliferate significantly less than the memory Treg counterpart and, on division, they soon differentiate into memory cells, thus ‘disappearing’ from the naive pool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511427720">38</xref></sup> In addition, memory Tregs represent a rapidly dividing population that is prone to apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511427720">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511427720">40</xref></sup> and this can be the reason for the lack of any detectable increment of total Tregs and RTE-Tregs despite the increase of total RTEs after IFNβ therapy. On the contrary, when the Treg population was divided, on the basis of CD45RA and CCR7 expression, in the naive Tregs, Treg<sub>CM</sub> and Treg<sub>EM</sub> cell subsets, after IFNβ therapy we observed a shift in the frequency of naive Tregs towards the Treg<sub>CM</sub> cell phenotype. Apparently, our data do not agree with those published by Korporal et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511427720">41</xref></sup> indicating that there was an increase in RTE-Tregs and a decrease in memory Tregs with IFNβ treatment in MS. However, the reagents for the identification of Tregs (intracellular staining for FOXP3 <italic>vs</italic>. cell surface staining for CD127) and Treg subsets (CD45RA and CD45RO <italic>vs</italic>. CD45RA and CCR7), the time after IFNβ therapy in which the experiments were performed (3–6 months <italic>vs</italic>. 6–24 months of therapy), the use of different IFNβ formulations (IFNβ-1a and IFNβ-1b <italic>vs</italic>. only IFNβ-1a) may explain this discrepancy.</p>
<p>It is known that, in healthy subjects, owing to thymic involution, the naive Treg number declines with age, while the total Treg level is maintained throughout life because they undergo continuous homeostatic proliferation in the periphery, which can be activated by (self) antigens, or Tregs can be generated from activated effector/memory T cells in the periphery depending on changes in local environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511427720">33</xref></sup> Accordingly, our results demonstrated that naive Treg percentage declines with age but only in untreated and not in IFNβ-treated patients: these results, together with the finding that Treg<sub>CM</sub> cells are not influenced by ageing in the untreated patients, while they increase in older IFNβ-treated subjects, further support the homeostatic redistribution of Treg subsets after therapy.</p>
<p>This finding may indicate a role of IFNβ in inducing the suppressive activity of Tregs, because results obtained in CCR7-deficient knock-out mice suggest that Tregs require CCR7 expression for their suppressive function. Indeed, Tregs use CCR7 to home in to lymph nodes, where they expand upon antigen stimulation and suppress the immune cell responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511427720">31</xref></sup> On the other hand, it has also been demonstrated that the lack of CCR7, which characterizes Treg<sub>EM</sub>-like cells, inhibits the emigration from the inflamed site, resulting in more efficient suppression when Treg<sub>EM</sub>-like cells are trapped in the tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1352458511427720">42</xref></sup> Therefore, by regulating Treg trafficking both in lymphoid and inflamed sites, CCR7 critically determines their in vivo function, underlining the importance of appropriate Treg localization for their in vivo suppressive capacity. The weakness of this hypothesis is that we have identified this cell subset only according to its flow cytometry phenotype, without verifying its regulatory potential. However, the main objective of study was to find a marker that could be easily used for distinguishing subtypes of MS patients with different responses to IFNβ therapy.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of definite phenotypic markers characterizing Tr1 cells, we looked for a possible role of IFNβ in the modulation of this subset by analysing the production of IL-10 RNA. A therapeutic significance of IL-10 RNA induction after IFNβ treatment is supported by in vivo studies showing that the increase of IL-10 in cerebrospinal fluid correlates with the clinical response to the therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1352458511427720">43</xref></sup> In agreement to findings by Krakauer et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1352458511427720">44</xref></sup> we observed that IL-10 RNA is higher in whole blood of patients treated with IFNβ than in that of untreated patients and HDs.</p>
<p>IL-10 RNA production increased in PBMCs stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD46 MoAbs, but also with a non-specific control antibody, probably because there is an effect of the Fc gamma receptor in the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511427720">45</xref></sup> but, again, IL-10 stimulation was more evident in samples of patients treated with IFNβ for 12 months. Its rise was considerable in PBMCs incubated for 24 h with anti-CD46 MoAb, which, together with anti-CD3 and in the presence of IL-2, is known to induce the expansion of human peripheral blood naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes resembling Tr1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511427720">18</xref></sup> However, the increase of IL-10 level was significantly lower in anti-CD46/CD3 cultures prepared with PBMCs of MS patients, both treated and untreated, in comparison with that of HDs. In the same cultures there was a differential expression of the CD46 RNA, with a median rise, in respect to the pre-incubation levels, of 3.5 and 3 times in PBMCs of untreated and treated patients, respectively, while in HDs the increase was only of 0.5 times. A similar low CD46 RNA increase was observed after stimulation of the PBMCs of three groups of subjects with anti-CD3 or anti-CD46 MoAbs and with a non-specific control antibody. Therefore, in PBMCs of patients treated with IFNβ co-cultured with anti-CD46 and anti-CD3 we obtained similar results to those found by Astier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511427720">16</xref></sup> in CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Furthermore, although we did not observe any significant difference in CD46 isoform RNA levels between the stimulated cells of untreated and IFNβ-treated patients, the samples of patients treated for 12 months with IFNβ (but not of the untreated ones), appeared clearly divided into two groups, differing in their levels of CD46 RNA after treatment: in one, CD46 expression increased upon treatment, while in the other one it actually decreased. In IFNβ-treated patients the CD46/CD3 co-stimulated cells producing high CD46 level also produced higher IL-10 RNA.</p>
<p>In order to verify whether the effect of IFNβ observed in vivo was observed also in vitro, PBMCs of untreated patients and controls were incubated with IL-2, control antibody, and anti-CD3, anti-CD46 and with anti-CD46/CD3 MoAbs in the presence or absence of IFNβ-1a. While IL-10 RNA increased in all cultures, the in vitro effect of IFNβ-1a on CD46 expression did not reproduce the effects observed in cells from treated patients. However, the cellular response to IFNβ involves a large number of genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1352458511427720">46</xref></sup> and is under the influence of numerous physiological regulations, and therefore its in vitro activity cannot be expected to reflect the events arising in vivo.</p>
<p>The possibility of an involvement of IL-10 gene polymorphism in the promoter region, which is known to regulate the levels of IL-10 production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1352458511427720">47</xref></sup> in the different capability to produce IL-10 in the two groups was ruled out by the lack of different IL-10 RNA distribution in the pre-therapy samples and in whole blood of the same patients. This is also in agreement with the similar frequency of the different IL-10 genotypes found in MS patients and HDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511427720">48</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients whose cultures produced higher IL-10 and CD46 RNA levels were also those showing lower disease progression, as indicated by their lower EDSS increase at 24 months after therapy start. The appearance of an EDSS change only after 24 months of treatment is not surprising and, considering the low disability levels of our patients at baseline and the high mean length of stay of the MS patients at this impairment level,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1352458511427720">49</xref></sup> we could not expect a more relevant increase in a short time. Furthermore, while this scale is not entirely objective and incorporates subjective judgement for scoring, even very small EDSS modifications could represent a clinically significant trend when applied at group levels.</p>
<p>Therefore, the anti-CD46/CD3 stimulation of PBMCs of IFNβ treated patients and the quantification of CD46 RNA leads to the early identification of a subset of patients with lower disease progression probably because of their high production of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine. Such analysis is very easy to be performed because it does not need the separation of T-cell subpopulations and avoids the hassle of analysing the differential modulation of CD46 isoforms, which is related to the timing of anti-CD46/CD3 cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511427720">19</xref></sup> The increase of CD46 isoform RNA can be due to the expansion of a Tr1-like cell subset preferentially expressing the Cyt1 isoform of CD46, which, in a CD46-transgenic murine model, has been shown to inhibit inflammation and secrete high IL-10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1352458511427720">50</xref></sup> However, while Kemper et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511427720">18</xref></sup> reported that isolated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, or B lymphocytes did not produce IL-10 after activation with CD3/CD46 plus IL-2, we cannot exclude that coated anti-CD3/CD46 MoAbs may also act not only on T lymphocytes but also on other cells contained in the PBMC preparation and that the modulation of IL-10 and CD46 mRNA might be a combined effect of fluctuations in several different cell types. Indeed, CD46 activation could also modulate the production of IL-23 in dendritic cells of MS patients and, when cross-linked to CD40, CD23 expression and IgE isotype switching in B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1352458511427720">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1352458511427720">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, the increase of Treg<sub>CM</sub> cells and the identification of a group of patients with increased levels of IL-10 and CD46 isoforms after anti-CD3/CD46 stimulation are features of IFNβ treated MS patients. Further study will be undertaken to better define the clinical characteristics of the patients and to assess whether these two markers could be employed to identify the patients that best respond to IFNβ therapy.</p>
