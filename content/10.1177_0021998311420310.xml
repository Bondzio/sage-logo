<abstract>
<p>Fluidity of metal matrix composites can greatly influence the recyclability of the material in the conventional ingot metallurgy process. The fluidity evolution of the AA6063–10% B<sub>4</sub>C composite in the form of cast billets and extruded plates, as well as the AA1100–16% B<sub>4</sub>C composite of cast ingots and rolled sheets was investigated by the vacuum fluidity test. The results showed that the fluidity decline of cast billets was much faster than that of extruded plates. However, the fluidity of both the cast ingots and rolled sheets decreased at the same rate with the holding time. To understand the flow behavior and recyclability of different composites, the microstructure of process materials before and after remelting was examined. The distribution of B<sub>4</sub>C particles and their reaction products, as well as the effective volume fraction, were quantitatively characterized. It was found that the fluidity of the extruded material, hence its recyclability, was better than that of the cast material due to a more uniform particle distribution and less particle agglomerates. Contrary to the extruded material, the rolled material did not show any fluidity improvement to the cast material due to damage of the TiB<sub>2</sub> protective layer around the B<sub>4</sub>C surfaces during severe rolling deformation.</p>

<p>In recent years, Al–B<sub>4</sub>C metal matrix composites (MMCs) have been increasingly used as neutron-absorber components in the nuclear industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311420310">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311420310">3</xref></sup> During manufacturing processes, the process scraps from the casting and transformation processes (extrusion and rolling) can reach 50–60% of the total materials produced. The need to recycle Al–B<sub>4</sub>C composites becomes urgent to meet environmental goals and to reduce the production cost. Compared to the standard aluminum alloys, the fluidity of the MMCs is already limited due to the presence of a large quantity of ceramic particles. For the conventional ingot metallurgy process, the fluidity ofthe composites can greatly influence the ability of the composites to be recycled for reuse. Remelting is a promising method to recycle process scrap materials because of its simplicity. Good fluidity is a basic requirement for the materials to be recycled with the remelting process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311420310">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311420310">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fluidity of Al-based alloys and composites has been studied by several researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311420310">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311420310">10</xref></sup> In an alloy with rich solute, the flow arrest is due to choking of the flow at the leading tip of the stream.

<p>In this study, the fluidity of the AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite in the form of cast billets and extruded plates, as well as the AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite in the form of cast ingots and rolled sheets was examined during long holding time. The microstructure of these materials was investigated in order to understand the flow behaviors. Emphasis was put on the quantitativecharacterization of particle distribution, its reaction products, and particle agglomeration, in order to enable distinguishing the flow behaviors of different process scrap materials.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311420310" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Process scrap materials of the AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite in the form of cast billets and extruded plates, as well as of the AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite in the form of cast ingots and rolled sheets supplied by Rio Tinto Alcan, were used in this investigation. The average B<sub>4</sub>C particle size in both materials was approximately 17 µm. The AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C round cast billets had a 178 mm diameter. The extrusion plates were rectangular with a sectional dimension of 8 × 144 mm<sup>2</sup> and the extrusion ratio was about 22:1. The AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C cast ingots had a rectangular section of 152 × 152 mm<sup>2</sup>; the thickness of the hot-rolled flat sheets was approximately 4.5 mm, and the rolling reduction ratio was about 95%. The AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C and the AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composites, respectively, contained 1.0 and 1.5 wt% Ti in the matrix. The materials were sectioned for the fluidity testing. For each test, approximately 3 kg of material was remelted in an electrical resistance furnace and held at 730 ± 5°C for approximately 8.5 h for the AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite and 2.5 h for the AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite. During holding, the composite melt was under mechanical stirring using an impeller with a rotation speed of 200 rpm to insure a uniform distribution of particles in the liquid. The diameters of the impeller and the melting crucible were 8 and 12 cm, respectively. The experiment set-up for the fluidity evaluation is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311420310">Figure 1</xref>. In the fluidity tests, composite melt was drawn into a glass tube with 6 mm inside diameter under a predetermined pressure of 215 mmHg. Fluidity samples were regularly taken at 30- to 60-min intervals. After solidification, the lengths of the fluidity samples (length of flow) were measured.

<p>For metallographical observation, the fluidity samples with different holding times were transversely sectioned and polished at various positions along the flow path from the flow entrance to the flow end. Prior to remelting, the microstructures of the original scrap materials (cast billets and ingots, extruded plates and rolled sheets) were also examined.</p>
<p>The volume fraction and distribution of B<sub>4</sub>C particles and the reaction products were quantitatively measured using an image analyzer (CLEMEX JS-2000, PE4.0) under optical microscopy. Some selected samples were deeply etched using a 10 vol.% NaOH solution at 50–60°C for approximately 70 s and examined under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6480LV). To reflect the flow resistance of solid particle agglomerations, a concept of the effective volume fraction of particle complexes was introduced. When several particles in the Al matrix were close together, they likely moved as a whole mass during the fluid flow and occupied a much greater space than the sum of individual particles. Forthe particle agglomeration in a MMC microstructure,three different cases were classified in the effective volume models: small particle aggregates, dense particle clusters, and particle networks induced by oxide films. The microimages of the fluidity samples were automatically treated by the image analyzer <italic>via</italic> a Clemex routine according to the corresponding model, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311420310">Figure 2</xref>.

<p>The fluidity of AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite scrap materials in the form of cast billets and extruded plates was evaluated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311420310">Figure 3</xref> shows the fluidity evolution of both materials for a long holding period (8.5 h). The fluidity of these materials generally decreased with the increase of the holding time. However, the fluidity decline rate of the two materials was different. At the beginning of the holding time, the fluidity of the extruded plates was slightly higher than that of the cast billets. When prolonging the holding time, the fluidity of the extruded plates decreased very slowly. On the other hand, the fluidity of the cast billets decreased more quickly than that of the extruded plates. Moreover, the fluidity deterioration rate of the cast billets was not constant. In the first stage, the flow length of the cast billets decreased rapidly from roughly 55 to 40 cm (holding time up to 150 min), which represents approximately 90% of the total fluidity decrease. After this period, the fluidity decline rate slowed down remarkably. The continuous fluidity decrease indicated that the rheological properties of the composite melt had changed during the holding time.

<p>Original scrap materials. In order to understand the flow behaviors of the composites, the microstructure of the original scrap materials of the cast billets and extruded plates were examined. Other than B<sub>4</sub>C particles, the reaction-induced particles, mostly Al<sub>3</sub>BC and TiB<sub>2</sub>, were observed in both materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311420310">Figure 4</xref>). A few AlB<sub>2</sub> particles were occasionally found in the matrix of these materials. In the cast billets, these reaction-induced particles were mostly attached and close to the B<sub>4</sub>C particles and formed a layer around the B<sub>4</sub>C surfaces, while many of these particles in the extruded plates were separated from the B<sub>4</sub>C surface due to the hot deformation of the extrusion.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Micrographs of AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composites: (a) cast billets and (b) extruded plates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Particle clusters, a dense solid particle complex consisting of tens to hundreds of particles,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311420310">19</xref></sup> could be observed in both the cast billets and the extruded plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311420310">Figure 5</xref>). However, comparing the clusters in two scrap materials, many particle clusters in the extruded plates were broken down along the extrusion direction and appeared much less dense than that in thecast billets. The particles in the original clusters were more or less separated from each other. Due to the deformation of the extrusion process, it was observed that the amount and size of the clusters in the extruded plates were considerably less and smaller than those found in the cast billets.
<fig id="fig5-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Particle clusters in AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C: (a) in cast billets and (b) in extruded plates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Oxide films are one type of defects in Al-based MMCs. These films could also be observed in both scrap materials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311420310">Figure 6</xref>). However, in the cast billets, B<sub>4</sub>C particles and reaction-induced particles were often enclosed by oxide films and could easily form particle networks that acted as a whole mass moving in the liquid during the remelting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311420310">19</xref></sup> On the other hand, the oxide films were squeezed and broken down along the extrusion direction in the extruded plates. Under deformation of the extrusion, these oxide films became discontinuous tiny slices which hardly left a tendency for particle networks to form in the remelting process.
<fig id="fig6-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Oxide films in AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C: (a) in cast billets and (b) in extruded plates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Based on the above observation, it is obvious that the microstructural uniformity of the cast billets and the extruded plates was different in terms of the distribution of the reaction-induced particles, the amount and size of particle clusters, and the oxide films. Extrusion could considerably improve the microstructural uniformity of the composite materials. As described subsequently, this microstructural difference in both scrap materials has a significant impact on the particle and flow behaviors of the composite melts during remelting.</p>
<p>Fluidity samples. During the remelting and holding times, interfacial reactions continued in both cast and extruded materials. The volume fraction of the total particles slowly increased with the increased holding time. However, there was no remarkable difference in the total particle amount for both the cast and extruded materials during holding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311420310">Figure 7</xref> gives an example of the microstructural evolution at the entrance of the fluidity samples with 510-min holding time. In both materials, the amount and size of Al<sub>3</sub>BC and AlB<sub>2</sub> became larger than those of the original scrap materials. However, it is interesting to notice that, in the cast billet samples, most of the reaction-induced particles were still attached and close to the B<sub>4</sub>C particles after remelting and holding, and therefore indicates a strong tendency to form solid particle aggregates. On the other hand, in the extruded plate samples, many of those particles were separated from the B<sub>4</sub>C particles and more or less uniformly distributed in the matrix. As previously mentioned, many small reaction-induced particles were separated from the B<sub>4</sub>C particles in the original extruded plates. These pre-existing particles might provide favorite sites for further precipitation of Al<sub>3</sub>BC and AlB<sub>2</sub> during the remelting and holding period. Consequently, after remelting, the extruded material had more uniformed distribution of all the solid particles in the matrix.
<fig id="fig7-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Micrographs with 510-min holding time: (a) cast billets and (b) extruded plates.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311420310">Figure 8</xref> shows the effective volume fraction of solidparticles along the flow path in both cast and extruded materials for different holding times. It was observed during the fluid flow of fluidity tests, that the solid particles and its agglomerates tended to migrate to the center of the section and then toward the flow end of the fluidity samples. It has been reported that ceramic particles can be pushed away from the freezing front and migrated to the center of the fluid when the fluid flow ahead of the freezing front is large enough.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311420310">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311420310">22</xref></sup> Owing to a high speed of the fluid flow in the vacuum tube, the migration of solid particles occurred and hence the effective volume fraction increased along the flow path. The nearer to the flow end of the fluidity sample was, thehigher was the effective volume fraction.
<fig id="fig8-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Evolution of particle effective volume fraction of the fluidity samples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Shortly after remelting (30-min holding time), the cast billet sample showed a higher effective volume fraction toward the flow end than the extruded plate sample, indicating that more severe particle agglomerations existed in the cast materials directly after remelting. With increased holding times (150 and 330 min), the cast billet samples possessed a much higher effective volume fraction than the extruded plate samples all along the flow path. It was evident that the particle agglomeration process accelerated with the increased holding time in the cast materials, and led to a rapid increase of the flow resistance. On the other hand, the effective volume fraction of extruded materials increased only slightly with the holding time, which corresponded well with a slight decrease of the fluidity with time. It was also observed on the microimages that the particle agglomerates (small particle aggregates, particle clusters, and networks) in the extruded materials were smaller and fewer than that in cast materials, probably due tothe uniformed particle distribution and the absence ofthe continuous oxide films in the extruded materials. Since the amount of the total particles in both materialswas almost the same, it is believed that particle agglomeration was the dominant factor influencing the fluidity.</p>
<p>The volume fractions induced by particle clusters and particle networks at the flow end of the fluidity samples are given separately in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311420310">Figure 9</xref>. Results showed that these two types of particle agglomerates increased with the increase of the holding time and played an important role in the flow resistance of the composite melt, due to their large portion on the effective volume. Moreover, it could clearly be seen that the fraction of both the particle clusters and the oxide films induced particle networks in the cast billet samples remarkably higher than those of the extruded plates.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311420310">Figure 10</xref> gives an example of particle networks in the cast material with 510-min holding time. It was observed that the B<sub>4</sub>C and the reaction-induced particles were entrapped by the oxide films to form particle networks. In addition, the reaction-induced particles TiB<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>3</sub>BC, and AlB<sub>2</sub>, were likely to be attached to the extended oxide film surface. However, as mentioned previously, a major part of the oxide films in the original extruded plates was broken down into tiny slices or squeezed after the extrusion deformation. Therefore, there was less chance for the formation of particle networks in the extruded material after remelting.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311420310">Figure 11</xref> shows the volume fraction and the effective volume fraction of the total particles at the flow end of the fluidity samples for cast and extruded materials as a function of the holding time. Generally, the volume fractions of solid particles for both materials increased with the increased holding time. During the entire holding period, the volume fraction of the extruded material was lower than the cast material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311420310">Figure 11(a)</xref>) but the difference remained almost constant, which did not adequately reflect the fluidity changes of both materials with the holding time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311420310">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, the measured effective volume fractions of both materials were higher than the volume fractions. At the beginning of holding, the effective volume fraction of the extruded plates was slightly lower than that of the cast billets. When prolonging the holding time, and while the effective volume fraction of the extruded plates increased relatively slowly, the effective volume fraction of the cast billets increased more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311420310">Figure 11(b)</xref>). It is evident that the effective volume fraction of total particles gave a better indication of the composite fluidity than the volume fraction.
<fig id="fig11-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><p>(a) Particle volume fraction at the flow end of the fluidity samples and (b) particle effective volume fraction at the flow end of the fluidity samples with holding time (AA6063–10 vol.% B4C).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig11.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Due to the high tendency of particle agglomeration in the cast material, numerous particles enriched at the flow ends of the fluidity samples in the cast billet material than those in the extruded material. When the effective volume fraction of the particles and the solidified aluminum reached a critical level at the flow end, the viscosity of the composite melt rose rapidly and the flow stopped abruptly. Therefore, the flow length of the cast material was shorter than that of the extruded material at the same holding time. When using the remelting process for reuse of the valuable composite materials, it was expected that the recyclability of the extruded composite, in terms of fluidity and melt quality, be better than that of the cast composite due to a more uniform particle distribution and less particle agglomerations.</p></sec></sec>

<p>In addition to the AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C composite, the fluidity of a higher B<sub>4</sub>C content composite (AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C) in the form of cast ingots and rolled sheets was also investigated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311420310">Figure 12</xref> illustrates the fluidity evolution of both materials for a 150-min holding period. The fluidity of these materials deceased sharply with the increase of the holding time. At the beginning of the holding time, the fluidity of the rolled sheets was higher than that of the cast ingots. With the increase of the holding time, the fluidity of the rolled sheets decreased slightly faster than that of the cast ingots. After 90-min holding, the flow lengths of the two materials were almost the same. During further holding, the fluidity of both materials continued decreasing until the fluidity was too poor for testing.

<p>It should be pointed out that, at the beginning of holding, the fluidity of high B<sub>4</sub>C content composites (AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C) was similar to that of low B<sub>4</sub>C content composites (AA6063–10 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C), as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311420310">Figure 3</xref>. However, during the holding, the fluidity of high B<sub>4</sub>C content composites decreased more rapidly than that of low B<sub>4</sub>C content composites. Besides, the rolled material (AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C) did not show any improvement of the fluidity to the cast material of the same composite.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0021998311420310"><title>Microstructure and quantitative analyses</title>
<p>Original scrap materials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311420310">Figure 13</xref> shows the microstructure of the original scrap materials of the cast ingots and rolled sheets. Other than B<sub>4</sub>C particles, reaction products Al<sub>3</sub>BC and TiB<sub>2</sub> were observed in both materials. In the cast ingots, these reaction-induced particles were mostly attached and close to the B<sub>4</sub>C particles. Furthermore, the TiB<sub>2</sub> particles were visually present in needle form around the B<sub>4</sub>C particles due to a highTi addition (1.5%) into the composite. On theother hand, many of these reaction-induced particlesin the rolled sheets were flaked away from the B<sub>4</sub>C surfaces after the severe rolling deformation, and it was rare to see the reaction particles attached to the B<sub>4</sub>C surfaces.

<p>In cast ingots, the particle clusters were formed by the interconnection of B<sub>4</sub>C and reaction-induced particles, while many particle clusters in the rolled sheets were broken down along the rolling direction and appeared much less dense than those in the cast ingots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311420310">Figure 14</xref>). In addition, the amount and size of the clusters in the rolled sheets were less and smaller than those found in the cast ingots.
<fig id="fig14-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Particle clusters in AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C: (a) in cast ingots and (b) in rolled sheets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Similarly, the quantity of particle networks in the cast ingots was greater than that in the rolled sheets. The B<sub>4</sub>C particles and reaction-induced particles could easily form the network by the entrapment of oxide films in the cast ingots. On the other hand, the oxide films were squeezed and broken down along the rolling direction in the rolled sheets, and therefore, the oxide films became discontinuous and hardly left a tendency to form particle networks.</p>
<p>In brief, similar to extrusion, rolling could significantly improve the microstructural uniformity of the composite materials in terms of the particle distribution.</p>
<p>Fluidity samples. The microstructural changes of both cast and rolled materials at the entrance of the fluidity samples with 150-min holding time are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311420310">Figure 15</xref>. In both materials, there was an increase in the amount and size of the reaction products Al<sub>3</sub>BC and AlB<sub>2</sub> than in those of the original materials. Furthermore, it was found that, in the cast samples, most of the reaction-induced particles were still attached and close to the B<sub>4</sub>C particles after remelting and holding. In the rolled samples, some of those particles were separated from the B<sub>4</sub>C particles due to the fact that the pre-existing particles were broken down during the rolling process, and might then provide favorite sites for further precipitation of Al<sub>3</sub>BC and AlB<sub>2</sub> during remelting and holding. However, after the long holding time, anumber of freshly formed reaction-induced particles were attached to the surface of B<sub>4</sub>C particles in the rolled material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998311420310">Figure 15(b)</xref>), a situation not observed in the extruded material. Finally, the rolled material showed a similar non-homogeneous distribution of particles as the cast material.
<fig id="fig15-0021998311420310" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>Micrographs of the fluidity samples with 150-min holding time: (a) cast ingots and (b) rolled sheets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311420310-fig15.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To understand the impact of rolling deformation on the microstructure evolution with holding time, the original materials, as well as the fluidity samples with different holding times, were closely examined by SEM. In original cast ingots, the B<sub>4</sub>C particles were enclosed by a dense TiB<sub>2</sub> protective layer, which could limit the interfacial reaction between the B<sub>4</sub>C particles and the liquid Al during remelting to some extent. However, due to a severe deformation of the hot rolling, this dense TiB<sub>2</sub> layer was partially damaged and peeled from the B<sub>4</sub>C particle surface in the rolled sheets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311420310">Figure 16(a)</xref>), leading to a more severe interfacial reaction between the B<sub>4</sub>C and the Al melt during remelting. It was found that the B<sub>4</sub>C particle was enclosed by the TiB<sub>2</sub> layer in the cast material after 60 min holding, and that only a few reaction-induced particles, AlB<sub>2</sub> and Al<sub>3</sub>BC, were formed and attached the to B<sub>4</sub>C particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311420310">Figure 16(b)</xref>). In the rolled material on the other hand, a large amount of reaction-induced particles were formed and attached to the B<sub>4</sub>C surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998311420310">Figure 16(c)</xref>). This deteriorated the uniformity of particle distribution and caused a strong tendency to form particle agglomerates during holding.

<p>The volume fraction and the effective volume fraction of the total particles at the flow end of fluidity samples for cast and rolled materials with the holding time are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998311420310">Figure 17</xref>. At the beginning of the holding, both the volume fraction and effective volume fraction of the rolled material were lower than those of the cast material, which resulted in a better fluidity of the rolled material. With the increase of holding time, the volume fraction and the effective volume fraction of the rolled material increased more rapidly than those of the cast material, and caused a fast increase of the reaction particles and the particle agglomeration. Therefore, the fluidity of rolled material decreased slightly faster than the cast material. After a 90–100-min holding time, the volume fraction and the effective volume fraction of both materials were getting closer and the fluidity of both materials also showed no remarkable difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311420310">Figure 12</xref>).

<p>Volume fractions of the particle clusters and the networks at the flow end of the fluidity samples are separately shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0021998311420310">Figure 18</xref>. Results show that these two types of particle agglomerates increased with the increase of the holding time. The volume fractions of the particle clusters and networks of the rolled material were slightly lower than those of the cast material. However, the rolled material possessed a faster increase rate of particle clusters than that of cast ingots.

<p>Two contrary factors may affect the fluidity of rolled materials during remelting. First, the rolling deformation improved the uniformity of the particle distribution and helped to enhance the fluidity at the beginning of the holding. On the other hand, the much more severe rolling deformation (compared to the extrusion) damaged the TiB<sub>2</sub> protective layer around B<sub>4</sub>C particles, and caused an increase of reaction particles. Hence, the amount of the total solid particles in the composite melt increased and the probability of agglomeration to form particle clusters also increased. As a result, the deterioration of the fluidity of the rolled material fell into the same category as the cast material.</p></sec></sec></sec>

<list-item><p>In AA1100–16 vol.% B<sub>4</sub>C MMCs, the fluidity of the rolled sheets was higher than that of the cast ingots at the beginning of the remelting. With the increase of holding time, the fluidity of the rolled sheets decreased as rapidly as the cast ingots.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Contrary to the extruded material, the rolled material did not show any improvement in the fluidity to the cast material due to damage of the TiB<sub>2</sub> protective layer around the B<sub>4</sub>C surfaces during severe rolling deformation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The particle agglomerates in the form of particle clusters and networks were commonly encountered in a MMC cast microstructure. The effective volume fraction of particles was introduced to reflect the influence of particle agglomeration on flow resistance in a MMC melt. The fluidity evolution of composites can be well described by the effective volume fraction of particles.</p></list-item>
