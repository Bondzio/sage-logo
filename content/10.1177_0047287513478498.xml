<abstract>
<p>The present study is designed to expand the current literature in the effects of User-Generated Content (UGC) on firm performance, specifically to delineate the unique effects of the UGC components on market share results using a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model. A longitudinal panel-data sample of 138 hotel reviews and ratings, along with monthly market share and several control variables is used for the empirical modeling. Overall, the analysis reveals that UGC has a positive impact on market share. A curvilinear mechanism explains the relationship between ratings and market share, discouraging lower-tiered firms from seeking a high rating. Moderating factors were also found to diminish the impact of a review length on market share. Theoretical explanations and managerial suggestions are offered in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We live in a service economy, and the growth of the Internet has accelerated the trend away from brick-and-mortar traditional business models toward click-and-mortar models (e.g., buy at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BestBuy.com">BestBuy.com</ext-link> and pick up at the store) or toward pure Internet-based models (e.g., Amazon.com). For the service industry, relying on the “mortar” part of the equation to deliver the service purchased, the Internet represents a great medium for communication and distribution. Yet, at the same time as the Internet gives more visibility to the service firms, it also gives more visibility and power to the user-consumer by empowering him or her to share postpurchase opinions and experiences with millions of potential viewers. This User-Generated Content (UGC) takes the form of any material created and uploaded to the Internet by nonmedia professionals, whether it is a comment left on Amazon.com, a video uploaded to YouTube, or a profile on Facebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287513478498">Interactive Advertising Bureau 2008</xref>). UGC constitutes a form of online customer engagement resulting in the shaping of the relationship between brands and consumers. UGC is a form of many-to-many communication, affecting not only the brand-customer relation but also the competitive landscape and consumers at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287513478498">Hoffman and Novak 1996</xref>). In some instances, UGC can be devastating for the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287513478498">Kirkpatrick and Roth 2005</xref>) because of its multiplicative negative word-of-mouth (WOM) effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287513478498">Bansal and Voyer 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Potential service clients concerned about their prepurchase decision increasingly turn to what are called “third party” websites (e.g., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Zagat.com">Zagat.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Yelp.com">Yelp.com</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Angieslist.com">Angieslist.com</ext-link>) for reassurance. User reviews and ratings on services such as hotels, airlines, car rentals, restaurants, plumbers, doctors, or movies help consumers make decisions. These reviews are perceived as unbiased since they are posted by the service provider’s past customers, who appear to trust websites, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</ext-link>, to make their decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0047287513478498">Verna 2008</xref>). These reviews can be used as a proxy for WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Zhang, and Awad 2007</xref>), and modeled to improve revenue forecasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Zhang, and Awad 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287513478498">Liu 2006</xref>). Some researchers, however, have found no effects between ratings and sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287513478498">Chen and Xie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287513478498">Duan, Gu, and Whinston 2008a</xref>), although the observed effects could be confounded by a between segment or product category effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287513478498">Zhu and Zhang 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these contrasted results, some firms have been shown to strategically manipulate online reviews in an effort to influence consumers’ purchase decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Awad, and Zhang 2006</xref>). A recent user reviews and ratings report from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TripAdvisor.com">TripAdvisor.com</ext-link> titled “2010 Dirtiest Hotels Lists” created an uproar in Europe. Published in the popular press, the report caused a group of hotelier to ask the government for regulation of third-party sites and UGC. A British newspaper reported that hotels throughout Europe were “seeking to persuade the European Union Commission to overhaul the rules governing web site reviews to ensure that they have been posted by genuine guests and not by rivals or people simply out to cause mischief” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0047287513478498">Sharkey 2010</xref>). Hotel managers now monitor online critiques to improve service and “listen-in” on the online conversation using sophisticated algorithms in an attempt to preserve their market share (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287513478498">Yu 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, the same paper claims that consumers seem to be able to accept, or understand that a 70% rating is “good enough.” In fact, the latest American Consumer Satisfaction Index rates the average hotel industry satisfaction score at 77% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287513478498">ACSI 2011</xref>), while J.D. Power’s hotel guest satisfaction averages 76.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047287513478498">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current findings in the tourism and hospitality literature show support for a relationship between the postconsumption behaviors: satisfaction, WOM, and loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478498">Bronner and de Hoog 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287513478498">Simpson and Siguaw 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0047287513478498">Susskind, Bonn, and Dev 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287513478498">Xie et al. 2011</xref>), while other research links WOM to purchase consideration and sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287513478498">Vermeulen and Seegers 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478498">Ye, Law, and Gu 2009</xref>). While some findings show online reviews as less credible to consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287513478498">Cox et al. 2009</xref>), others see a link to trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287513478498">Dickinger 2011</xref>) and behavioral intent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0047287513478498">Stringham, Gerdes, and Vanleeuwen 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In their recent review of electronic WOM (eWOM), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287513478498">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan (2008)</xref> call for future research related to the application of eWOM strategies; particularly to studies that will measure cognitive, affective, and behavioral implications upon consumer behavior and the new dynamics created by eWOM. Others have suggested the need for the study of the effects of UGC within and between different service segments of the same category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287513478498">Zhu and Zhang 2010</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287513478498">Anderson and Mittal (2000)</xref> mentioned the importance of understanding the nonlinearity inherent in the service evaluation-consumer outcomes chain. Other researchers also point to the lack of research in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287513478498">Vlachos, Pramatari, and Vrechopoulos 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the aim of the present paper is to extend the literature on the nonlinear and dynamic relationship between UGC and the hotel performance, and more specifically, to demonstrate the detailed impact of each component of UGC on hotel market share. Through this research, we aim to make several contributions. First, our study advances the literature on UGC by including the dynamic effect of competition. Second, using a unique opportunity of a cross-segment panel data set we extend the current literature by modeling the effects of UGC within and between different service segments of the same category, thus answering researchers’ call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0047287513478498">Zhu and Zhang 2010</xref>). Finally, the managerial implications of the present study might shed light in support of the recent trend for brands, such as Marriott or Hilton, to volunteer consumers’ reviews and ratings directly on their website despite the fear associated with this transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287513478498">De Lollis 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0047287513478498">
<title>Conceptual Model and Hypotheses</title>
<p>A burgeoning area of the UGC spectrum is customer reviews and ratings providing an important source of information for the consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478498">Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287513478498">Jeong and Jeon 2008</xref>). Third-party firms such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Tripadvisor.com">Tripadvisor.com</ext-link>, Yelp.com or Angieslist.com, who offer a platform for UGC as their core offering, play an essential role in the competitive dynamic. Consumers can now share their opinions, complaints, and recommendations concerning products and services online, thereby engaging in eWOM behavior. The result of the rise of these third-party websites, along with the distribution websites (i.e., Orbitz, Expedia, Amazon, OpenTable) offering UGC and inventory in one place, is that consumers have an increasing amount of information available to them in order to make purchase decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287513478498">O’Connor 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287513478498">Sparks and Browning 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287513478498">Chen and Xie (2008)</xref> suggest that these online customer communications may have a significant influence on product search and product choice. Other studies have found that consumers are more likely to trust brands that offer user ratings and reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478498">Chevalier and Mayzlin 2006</xref>). In that respect, UGC, in the form of reviews and ratings, can be associated to eWOM behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287513478498">Chen and Xie 2008</xref>), and used as a proxy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Zhang, and Awad 2007</xref>). eWOM communication often occurs as part of the external search activities undertaken by consumers in their decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478498">Sénécal and Nantel 2004</xref>). However, trust is necessary for consumer reviews to be effective as decision-making aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0047287513478498">Smith, Menon, and Sivakumar 2005</xref>). The eWOM receiver faces greater difficulty in judging the credibility of online product reviews, since the antecedents that are common in traditional WOM to determine information credibility, such as source similarity, expertise and accessibility, are not very appropriate in the online context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287513478498">Feick and Higie 1992</xref>). Any evaluation of reviewer credibility or helpfulness is likely to come from the reviews themselves. Furthermore, differences between consumers’ motivation for engaging in eWOM have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287513478498">Bronner and de Hoog 2010</xref>). Individuals with different characteristics view online information seeking and online transactions differently. For example, consumers’ apprehensiveness about the Internet leads them to seek less information online and to limit their purchasing behavior (Susskind, Bonn, and Dev 2011). On the other hand, a well-known phenomenon in the tourism and hospitality industry describes a “billboard” effect, and suggests that online consumers might not all book through online travel agencies (OTAs), but are still seeking information on the web site in order to reach a decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287513478498">Hood 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the research on the relationship between WOM and trust places trust as a consequence of WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287513478498">De Matos and Rossi 2008</xref>). Other researchers have explored the mediating role of trust in the link between eWOM and brand commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287513478498">Bansal, Taylor, and St. James 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287513478498">Ha 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0047287513478498">Sparks and Browning (2011)</xref>, for their part, have shown that a relationship exists between trust, the valence of the reviews and the purchase behavior of the consumer. Furthermore, consumers have been known to demonstrate a level of trust in using products’ reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287513478498">Riegner 2007</xref>). However, reviews and ratings of services might suffer from the subjective nature of the assessment and judgment made by the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287513478498">Laczniak, DeCarlo, and Ramaswami 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287513478498">Folkes 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287513478498">Sen and Lerman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287513478498">Weiner 2000</xref>). Research also shows that a weak relationship exists between the third-party consumer and the consumer posting the ratings and reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287513478498">Bansal and Voyer 2000</xref>). It also shows that the perception of risk in a website transaction is perceived to be greater than a traditional face-to-face service encounter given the level of technology readiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287513478498">Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Malhotra 2002</xref>), the amount of negative information posted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287513478498">Ha 2004</xref>), and the complexity of the transaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287513478498">Harris and Goode 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0047287513478498">
<title>Conceptual Model</title>
<p>In this study, we conceptualize UGC as a bundle of two distinct but related components: ratings and reviews. Ratings are the numeric evaluations of the service satisfaction using a scale (often stars or points), and reviews are attached to the evaluations by the customers in the form of a narrative of different lengths and different tones (positive or negative) expressing a sentiment. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287513478498">Figure 1</xref> depicts our conceptual model. It integrates temporal relationships between the UGC components, reviews and ratings, and market share. It also shows the within time period dynamic nature between market share and UGC, controlling for other factors such as location and segment, as well as the between time period correlations.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0047287513478498-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The uniqueness of the present research lies in the fact that actual hotel market share will be modeled as being dependent on UGC, thus extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478498">Ye, Law, and Gu’s (2009)</xref> findings that demonstrate the positive impact of online reviews on hotel sales using the number of reviews as a proxy for hotel bookings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0047287513478498">
<title>The Dynamic Link between UGC and Market Share</title>
<p>There is strong evidence for the effect of UGC on companies’ sales. For instance, in a comparison of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BN.com">BN.com</ext-link>, two online book sellers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478498">Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006)</xref> found that the addition of a new favorable review on one site resulted in an increase in the book sales at that website relative to the other one. Others found that online user-generated movie eWOM volume at Yahoo.com significantly affected aggregate and weekly box office revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287513478498">Liu 2006</xref>). Similar results have been observed in the hospitality industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478498">Ye, Law, and Gu 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies have come short of integrating the effect of competition. Competition in the hotel industry is bounded by the location in which the service will be delivered. Hotel capacity is limited to its number of rooms, and its demand is location driven. Thus, local conditions will influence consumers’ choice, and a cheaper hotel located in another town has a low probability to be part of a consumer’s consideration set. Therefore, the effect of UGC on hotel sales is dependent on the competitive setting. For instance, a market in which only one hotel is present might behave differently than a market in which 20 hotels are competing. In the former case, the management might be able to lower the quality and increase the price to take advantage of the setting.</p>
<p>Along with the extensive WOM research body, we believe that alternative attractiveness, or the attraction to the alternative service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287513478498">Bansal et al. 2005</xref>), needs to be accounted for. Previous self-reporting studies have found that alternative attractiveness is an important variable affecting customer decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287513478498">McDougall and Levesque 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287513478498">Jones, Mothersbaugh, and Beatty 2000</xref>). Thus, an econometric model relying on time series data has to include the effect of the alternative choices (i.e., the competition) by modeling the dynamic relationship between a particular observed hotel performance and that of its competition.</p>
<p>Once the competition is added to the model, the relationship between ratings of past customers and the trust current customers experience reading these ratings can be dynamic (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287513478498">Figure 1</xref>). In other words, a customer might patronize the market leader because she or he trusts the ratings provided on the website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287513478498">Bansal, Taylor, and St. James 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287513478498">Ha 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287513478498">Riegner 2007</xref>), making it more attractive as an alternative. The superior ratings increase the consumer’s trust level and lower the perceived risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287513478498">Ratnasingham 1998</xref>), which leads to more purchases of the service leading the market with the highest rating level. Therefore, we hypothesize the following:</p>
<list id="list1-0047287513478498" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: A hotel leading the market in ratings will see, on average, a significant increase of its market share.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0047287513478498">
<title>Endogeneity Issues</title>
<p>Endogeneity is a well-known issue in the econometrics world. A variable is said to be endogenous when there is a correlation between the variable and the error term. It can arise from several reasons: serial autocorrelation, omitted confounding variables, measurement error and bias, and circularity (dynamic model). The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287513478498">Figure 1</xref> outlines all of the endogeneity issues. Past UGC can influence future UGC and/or market share; variables such as trust are missing by design from a panel data set relying on time series; and property selection can introduce a bias. Our modeling strategy will therefore control for the endogeneity issues by using a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287513478498">Arellano and Bover 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478498">Greene 2008</xref>) and by testing its pertinence. Therefore, we hypothesize:</p>
<list id="list2-0047287513478498" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: There will be a dynamic relationship between market share and UGC.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0047287513478498">
<title>Ratings and Reviews</title>
<p>Ratings and reviews are expressions of past customers’ experiences. However, we need to make a distinction between ratings and reviews. In line with other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Zhang, and Awad 2007</xref>), this article considers reviews as a proxy for eWOM. Reviews play a role similar to what WOM plays in the more traditional setting and are sources of information in the consumer decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478498">Brown, Broderick, and Lee 2007</xref>). The impact of online reviews on consumers’ online choices was the topic of research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0047287513478498">Sénécal and Nantel (2004)</xref>. Their results showed that products were selected twice as often when they were recommended. The type of website on which the recommendation is published (i.e., retailer websites versus independent third-party websites) did not have an influence on the perceived trustworthiness and the consumers’ tendency to follow the recommendations. Others have shown the positive impact of online reviews on awareness and purchase consideration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0047287513478498">Vermeulen and Seegers 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Ratings for their part can be closely assimilated to an overall service evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287513478498">Jeong and Jeon 2008</xref>). In that sense, the customer uses a single scale to express his or her judgment of the experience. Hence, ratings can be assimilated and used as a proxy of quality as perceived by the past customers. Thus, the ratings viewed by the customer browsing the Internet are a signal of the overall quality to be expected by the reader and should be linked to behavior, such as hotel reservation via the trust customers endow in these ratings. Unfortunately, trust cannot only be measured from each customer browsing the OTA website; hence, it is an omitted variable in our model. Therefore, we hypothesize that ratings are endogenous.</p>

<p>Researchers have found that the relationship between WOM and satisfaction in the context of destination tourism and identity salience is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0047287513478498">Simpson and Siguaw 2008</xref>). Similarly, a relationship between reviews and ratings has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478498">Ye, Law, and Gu 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287513478498">Duan, Gu, and Whinston (2008a)</xref> found in a study of online reviews and ratings’ impact on movie revenues that the volume of reviews influences significantly the movie’s revenues. Thus, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0047287513478498">Figure 1</xref>, we suggest that rating, as an expression of satisfaction, not only influences hotel bookings directly but also leads to increased reviews as a form of WOM, which then leads to increased market share by repeat bookings and switching from the competing hotels’ customers.

Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287513478498">Vlachos, Pramatari, and Vrechopoulos (2011)</xref> found in trust a mediator between satisfaction and WOM.

According to the social judgment theory, consumers would assimilate ratings as an expression of satisfaction and quality, falling in the zone of tolerance, to be good and worthy of trust, resulting in booking the hotel; whereby, lower ratings or higher ratings would be rejected. This curvilinear relationship is in line with other service research. Rating, as a reflection of past consumer judgments of quality, does follow a quadratic shape in several findings. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287513478498">Anderson and Mittal (2000)</xref> argue in favor of a nonlinear relationship between satisfaction and retention, which, if not accounted for, would “seriously overestimate the impact of satisfaction” (p. 115).

<title>Interaction between Review Length and Valence</title>
<p>Online reviews, when largely ambivalent (positives and negatives), are perceived to be less credible than traditional WOM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0047287513478498">Xie et al. 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478498">Chevalier and Mayzlin’s (2006)</xref> findings suggest there is a strong impact of negative eWOM compared to positive eWOM, because an incremental negative review was more powerful in decreasing book sales than an incremental positive review was in increasing sales.</p>
<p>A distinction between negative and positive eWOM in the eWOM–sales relationship is offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478498">Samson (2006)</xref>. His study proposes that negative eWOM affects service firms more than positive eWOM does. An experiment by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287513478498">Laczniak, DeCarlo, and Ramaswami (2001)</xref> focused on the influence of negative eWOM on purchase decisions for personal computers. Their results indicated that consumers considered the source of information, particularly negative information, before having a change of opinion about a product or service. Furthermore, recent findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287513478498">Duan, Gu, and Whinston (2008b)</xref> show a dynamic relationship between eWOM valence, eWOM volume and revenues. This nonlinear relationship could be approached from the framework of the social judgment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287513478498">Sherif and Howland 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the theory, consumers would judge reviews’ valence and reviews’ length falling within a zone of tolerance (not too negative [positive] or/and not too lengthy [short]) to be worthy of trust, resulting in an increased chance to book the hotel. The lack of trust associated with the very negative (positive) or very short (long) reviews might also be related to the weak relationship that exists between the third-party consumer and the consumer posting the ratings and reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287513478498">Bansal and Voyer 2000</xref>). This relationship can be further supported by the attribution theory and is in line with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0047287513478498">Vlachos, Pramatari, and Vrechopoulos (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287513478498">Chevalier and Mayzlin (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus, we suggest that reviews’ valence might interact with reviews’ length, whereby too many words or too many positive reviews might have an opposite effect on trust and diminish the overall impact of UGC on market share. Thus, we hypothesize:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To empirically test the hypotheses, we assembled a database using several sources. First, proprietary data from a sample of hotel properties located in different markets and positioned in different segments were obtained. These data contain monthly market-level performance data over a period of 18 months, as well as a description of the properties’ characteristics. Second, publicly available UGC was extracted from an OTA for each of the properties participating in the study. The sampling strategy and measures are detailed below.</p>
<sec id="section12-0047287513478498">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample of hotels for this study is shaped by the following constraints. First, firms must have substantial UGC volume on a monthly basis in order to capture the variability in UGC characteristics needed for the parameters estimation. Second, the segmentation (e.g., star rating) of these firms should be inclusive of all categories (i.e., from economy to luxury), and their brand must be regarded as an inspiration for UGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287513478498">Berthon, Pitt, and Campbell 2008</xref>). Finally, the study needs longitudinal data on financial metrics used as the dependent variable (i.e., revenue per month for each hotel) and control variables (i.e., market performance, and market concentration) used in the analysis. As such, the present study uses firms located in North America representing branded and independent hotels operating in all market segments (i.e., Luxury, Upper–Midscale, and Economy–Budget) and in all location categories (i.e., Resort, Downtown, Suburbs, and Airport).</p>

<sec id="section13-0047287513478498">
<title>Measures and Model Specification</title>
<p>Industry practice uses the RevPAR or Revenue per Available Room index (Rindex) as the metric of choice to measure fair market share (i.e., market share with respect to direct competition). The Rindex is the ratio of the property RevPar to the aggregate competition’s (i.e., the market’s) RevPar. A Rindex of 100 signals a property at par with the market, where a RevPar above (below) 100 suggests a better (worst) performance than the market. Rindex is calculated using the properties’ RevPAR. The RevPAR is the benchmark of the hotel industry performance; it is used by operators, owners, developers, and lodging analysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287513478498">Ismail, Dalbor, and Mills 2002</xref>). RevPAR captures the interaction of average daily room rate (ADR) and hotel occupancy (OCC) at different phases of the lodging cycle and simultaneously reveals both the supply-and-demand dynamics of a lodging-market cycle in one index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287513478498">Ismail, Dalbor, and Mills 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0047287513478498">Woods 1994</xref>). The market RevPAR is an important performance measure to compare a property’s RevPAR against. In each market (defined as the property competitive set by management and located within a geographical area around the property) a hotel property that performs well against the market will achieve a RevPAR greater than the market’s RevPAR (the mean RevPAR of all competing hotels). Consequently, a hotel property that underperforms will see its RevPAR fall below the market’s RevPAR. Conceivably, if the market is doing well (i.e., the demand is high with respect to supply) a property that is not marketed well, or that is not managed well, will see its RevPAR moving in the lower range of the market, or at a different pace, possibly with a lag.</p>

<title>Description of the Sample and Data</title>
<p>Because of the sensitivity of the data needed (i.e., individual hotel sales over time) across locations, segments, and within markets, the sample strategy was largely driven by the willingness of several anonymous property owners, property management companies, and brand managers to share their Smith Travel Accommodation Report<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047287513478498">4</xref></sup> under confidentiality. One hundred thirty-eight hotels participated, representing all segments and located in 13 markets, of which 22 properties were considered at random to be the group of reference while the rest constituted the competition sets. A postcheck was done to compare the RevPar of the sample (<italic>n</italic> = 138) to that of the U.S. industry’s overall aggregate for the same period (September 2008 to February 2010). It yielded no apparent eye-balling differences<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047287513478498">5</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287513478498">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Collecting UGC Data</title>
<p>Since the research aim is to disentangle the effect of the different components of UGC on hotel market share, and since theory suggests that consumers’ trust is one of the main antecedents in the UGC–behavior relationship, we sought to get UGC that would be representative of all web-based consumers. As a prior analysis, a sample of 10 properties’ publically available UGC data was extracted directly from the three main OTAs: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TripAdvisor.com">TripAdvisor.com</ext-link>, Orbitz.com, and Expedia.com, in order to evaluate the convergence of each of these website’s ratings. Using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) method, means of satisfaction (i.e., the mean rating out of 5) for each hotel were compared and a post hoc Sheffé test revealed that the mean difference of Orbitz.com was not significantly different from that of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TripAdvisor.com">TripAdvisor.com</ext-link> (mean difference = 0.251, SD = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = .372) or Expedia.com (mean difference = −0.262, SD = 0.17, <italic>p</italic> = .342). Thus, we focused solely on Orbitz.com. We concluded that Orbitz.com UGC data are representative of the different web sites allowing consumers to review and rate hotels, and that its policies allow the variance of these ratings to be directly related to actual customer experiences; hence, allowing greater external validity than those of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://TripAdvisor.com">TripAdvisor.com</ext-link>, which accepts noncustomer’s comments.</p>

<p>We notice that the RevPar index of the sample is 30% greater than that of the competitors in the data set for the economy-budget segment (Rindex = 130), followed by the Luxury segment with an 11% Rindex above competition, and finally the Upper–Midscale segment showing a 5% increase over competition. Although it appears that the sample is biased toward successful properties, it should be noted that these results are aggregated over each segment and that their standard deviations imply that the confidence interval would include 100 RevPar index or parity with competition in close to 50% of the sample. Of notable importance, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0047287513478498">Table 2</xref>, we notice that the market concentration (HHI) of Economy–Budget hotels tends to lean toward a more competitive setting (HHI = 1.33, SD = 0.47) than for the Luxury market (HHI = 3.87, SD = 3.03). Demand growth (DGR) seems to reflect the recessionary pattern of the period under study (September 2008 to February 2010), although the Upper–Midscale segment seems to fare better (DGR of −11.77, SD = 9.66, compared to a DGR of −18.99, SD = 8.61, for the Economy–Budget segment and −18.40, SD = 6.76, for the Luxury segment).</p>
<p>Additionally, the demand instability (DI) or volatility in growth confirms that the Upper–Midscale segment is faring somewhat better than the other two with almost half a DI value on average.</p>

<sec id="section21-0047287513478498">
<title>UGC Results by Segment</title>
<p>The first element of UGC is the mean rating of the properties (AvgM) compared to the competitors’ mean ratings (AvgMkM). Although Economy–Budget and Luxury segments have slightly lower AvgM than their competition, and the Upper–Midscale segment has a slightly higher AvgM than competition, the differences once tested statistically were not significant (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>Eco-Budget, df=136</sub> = 1.43; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>Upper-Mid, df=136</sub> = 0.48; <italic>t</italic>
<sub>Luxury, df=136</sub> = 1.20). However, differences between segments were found to be significant between the Eco-Budget segment and the Upper–Midscale and Luxury segments (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>df=117</sub> = 7.33). No significant difference was uncovered between the Upper–Midscale and the Luxury segments (<italic>t</italic>
<sub>df=106</sub> = 1.81). This would imply that segmentation does play a role in the rating of properties and that a gap in ratings exists between the lowest level (Eco-Budget) and the highest (Upper–Midscale and Luxury). These results are also in accordance with results obtained by research firms across segments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287513478498">J.D. Power and Associates Reports 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287513478498">ACSI 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The number of words on average per message per segment suggests that the Economy–Budget customers tend to write fewer words than the Upper–Midscale or Luxury customers. However, it seems that the most prolific customers reside in the Upper–Midscale segment, where 41 words on average per message is used with a large variability (SD = 69.13) within the group. The valence of the messages, or whether they are positive or negative, shows that the Upper–Midscale and Luxury segment customers use more positive messages (95%) than the Economy–Budget customers (22%) on average.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Our most likely appropriate GMM model treats <italic>Rindex<sub>it</sub></italic> and the <italic>UGC<sub>it</sub></italic> variables as endogenous using lag 3 as a starting point. All the control variables are considered strictly exogenous. The AR(1) term is significant, AR(1) = −2.86, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, as predicted, but yields a nonsignificant AR(2) effect, AR(2) = −1.33, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. The results from the GMM pass the instrument validity test (Hansen test = 149.33, <italic>p</italic> = .053; difference in Hansen test, <italic>p</italic> = .58) suggesting an appropriate model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287513478498">Greene 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The GMM model explains 74.5% of the total variance in <italic>Rindex<sub>it</sub></italic>. As expected, a large portion of the variance is explained by the lag variable (<italic>Rindex<sub>it</sub></italic>
<sub>-1</sub>), showing that 59% of the average hotel RevPar index is simply due to the past month’s business. The control variables’ estimates are significant, with the exception of HHI<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, DGR<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and DI<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. This could indicate that market conditions such as concentration, growth, and volatility do not significantly impact hotel market shares relative to other competing hotels. In other words, all hotels located in the same market suffer the same way from market conditions. The selection correction variable (IM<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) is positive and significant (IM<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = 11.18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), underscoring the need to control for selection bias. We now turn to the <italic>UGC<sub>it</sub></italic> estimates and the hypotheses testing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0047287513478498">
<title>Results of Hypotheses Testing</title>
<p>Evidenced by the good-fit GMM model, we can be confident that the variables exhibit a dynamic relationship with endogeneity in the dependent variable, as well as the UGC variables, and a lag effect; thus, showing support to hypothesis 2 (There will be a dynamic relationship between market share and ratings and reviews), as well as hypotheses 3 and 4 (Ratings and reviews will be an endogenous variable in the relationship between UGC and market share).</p>
<p>A hotel that would get ratings, on average, above its competitive set (<italic>MMkM<sub>it</sub></italic>), would not fare better than a hotel that would be consistently below its competition. In fact, the estimate for <italic>MMkM<sub>it</sub></italic> is not different from zero (<italic>MMkM<sub>it</sub></italic> = −0.412, <italic>t</italic> = −0.34). Thus, hypothesis 1 (A hotel leading the market in ratings will see, on average, a significant increase of its market share) is not supported.</p>
<p>The positive parameter estimate for the effect of <italic>AvgM<sub>it</sub></italic> on <italic>Rindex<sub>it</sub></italic> in the final model (<italic>AvgM</italic>
<sub>it</sub> = 86.48, <italic>t</italic> = 6.53) demonstrates that hotels with higher <italic>AvgM<sub>it</sub></italic> will tend to secure higher market shares, thus supporting hypothesis 5 (There will be both contemporary and lagging positive effects of reviews and ratings on market share). Furthermore, <italic>AvgM<sub>it-1</sub></italic> estimate is positive and significant (<italic>AvgM<sub>it</sub></italic>
<sub>-1</sub> = 6.08, <italic>t</italic> = 1.92) suggesting that past rating affects current market share. This is not surprising since the first page of OTA shows a cumulative running rating for each hotel, where consumers have to click on the particular hotel in order to view individual comments and ratings.</p>
<p>The estimate for <italic>AvgM2<sub>it</sub></italic> is negative and significant (<italic>AvgM2<sub>it</sub></italic> = −12.79, <italic>t</italic> = −7.82), indicating a quadratic relationship between <italic>AvgM<sub>it</sub></italic> and <italic>Rindex<sub>it</sub></italic>, supporting hypothesis 2 (The relationship between the service firm’s ratings and its market share will show diminishing return). Furthermore, the estimate for the cross-level interaction effect of segmentation on rating (<italic>STAR<sub>i</sub>xAvgM<sub>it</sub></italic>) is positive and significant (<italic>STAR<sub>i</sub>xAvgM<sub>it</sub></italic> = 18.90, <italic>t</italic> = 2.34), indicating that the maximum for the effect of <italic>AvgM<sub>it</sub></italic> is increasing as hotels are positioned in higher tiers, showing support for hypothesis 6 (Ratings will exhibit a curvilinear relationship with market share). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287513478498">Table 4</xref> displays the maxima by segment (STAR). Hotels competing in the Economy–Budget segment might be able to trade quality for profit since a rating of only 3.62 out of 5, or 72%, would not affect market share negatively, but a rating higher than 3.62 would. Hotels in the Midscale segment will see market share decline around a maximum rating of 4.32 out of 5, or 87%. As would be expected, hotels competing in the Luxury segment must strive for the highest ratings. It seems that short of a perfect 5 out of 5 Luxury properties would be doomed to lose market share to the competition.</p>

<p>As positive reviews increase as a percentage of all reviews, market share tends to decrease (<italic>Posit<sub>it</sub></italic> = −102.53, <italic>t</italic> = −5.76). Similarly, reviews that tend to have more words tend to decrease market share on average (<italic>Word<sub>it</sub></italic> = −27.96, <italic>t</italic> = −7.92). The interaction term between review valence and length (<italic>Posit<sub>it</sub></italic> × <italic>Word<sub>it</sub></italic>) is positive and significant (<italic>Posit<sub>it</sub></italic> × <italic>Word<sub>it</sub></italic> = 26.61, <italic>t</italic> = −6.57). Using a low (high) value of 5 (100) words for <italic>Word</italic>, and a low (high) value of 25% (75%) for <italic>Posit<sub>it</sub></italic>, we can estimate that the net impact on market share, including the interaction effect when <italic>Word<sub>it</sub></italic> is high but <italic>Posit<sub>it</sub></italic> is low or high, seems fairly equivalent (low <italic>Posit</italic>–high <italic>Word</italic> = −113 vs. high <italic>Posit</italic>–high <italic>Word</italic> = −124). However, when <italic>Word<sub>it</sub></italic> is low, negative reviews will amplify the negative impact on market share (high <italic>Posit</italic>–low <italic>Word</italic> = −30 vs. low <italic>Posit</italic>–low <italic>Word</italic> = −60) in the magnitude of 100%. Thus, overall reviews’ valence and length impact market share negatively. Positive reviews associated with fewer words will reduce the negative impact on market share, but not enough to be positive. The more words in a review whether positive or negative, the more negative effect it has on market share. The overall negative effect of Word and Posit on market share supports hypothesis 8 (There will be an interaction between review length and review valence that will result in an overall negative effect on market share).</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Overall, our analysis reveals that UGC, as a whole, has a positive impact on market share. However, several counterintuitive results make UGC an important marketing metrics to monitor and to integrate as part of an overall customer relationship management initiative. Ratings have been shown to exhibit a curvilinear relationship with market share, more pronounced in the lower-tiered segments than the upper-tier or luxury ones. More surprising are the findings that reviews no matter how good they can be for the property, seem to have a negative impact overall on market share less when they are positive than when they are negative. Furthermore, properties that would lead the competition with respect to their ratings would not necessarily see a benefit in market share. All results seem to point to the fact that UGC, per segment, has a “sweet spot” where maximum effect on market share is obtained, but causes the reverse effect when they are too good to be true. The issue at the core of the relationship between UGC and market share seems to be consumers’ trust level and choice mechanism when using OTAs.</p>
<sec id="section25-0047287513478498">
<title>Theoretical Contributions</title>
<p>Our study makes several contributions to the marketing theory. First, it addresses researchers’ recent calls to use qualitative research methods to inform longitudinal analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287513478498">Banyai and Glover 2012</xref>) and to link UGC, not only to customer satisfaction and delight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287513478498">Crotts, Mason, and Davis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287513478498">Magnini, Crotts, and Zehrer 2011</xref>) but also to consumer behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287513478498">Litvin, Goldsmith, and Pan 2008</xref>) using nonlinear relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287513478498">Rust, Danaher, and Varki 2000</xref>). Second, several recent pieces of research have linked UGC to sales of products or movies, yet no study has linked UGC to firms’ market share in a longitudinal panel-data design. Third, and unlike prior research that provided only partial insights into the effects of UGC on product-level sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0047287513478498">Ye, Law, and Gu 2009</xref>), the current study extends the finding to show the impact of UGC relative to competition and not simply as a correlation to sales. Finally, in the empirical context of hotels, the study shows that UGC characteristics act differently on market share than other studies have found. Specifically, review volume and valence impact market share to a lesser degree than ratings. This finding is contrary to other research, but it is important to note that these researches were conducted in different empirical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287513478498">Dellarocas, Awad, and Zhang 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0047287513478498">Duan, Gu, and Whinston 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287513478498">Liu 2006</xref>). The empirical setting might be the underlying reason for the differences in results. Following are different possible explanations for our results along with theoretical support.</p>
<p>Ratings for Economy and Budget hotels culminate at 3.62 out of 5 (72.4%) with a quadratic relationship to market share. There is evidence of a shift toward higher maximum as the segmentation level increases. The curvilinear relationship shown between ratings and market share is known in service research. Rating as a reflection of past consumer judgments of quality has been shown to follow a quadratic shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287513478498">Anderson and Mittal 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0047287513478498">Voss et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0047287513478498">Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Malhotra 2002</xref>). The curvilinear effect of satisfaction involves a zone of tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287513478498">Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry 1994</xref>) and can also be explained in light of the social judgment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0047287513478498">Sherif and Howland 1961</xref>), particularly in the context of judgment made by the third party (i.e., the consumer reading the ratings of another consumer and evaluating its validity). Consistent with the social judgment theory, the latitude of rejection is greater toward the low end of the scale (between a rating of 1 and 3.62 for Economy–Budget hotels), than it is toward the high end of the scale (between a rating of 3.62 and 5). The perceived risk of negative reviews or low ratings might explain the negative skewness of the quadratic curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287513478498">Murray 1991</xref>). The relationship between perceived risk and the rating maximum is evidenced in the Luxury segment since the peak of the curve equates to the maximum rating, leaving no room for error and justifying the heavy emphasis on quality.</p>
<p>The lack of trust associated with the high ratings beyond the maximum in the Economy–Budget and Upper–Midscale segments might be related to the weak relationship that exists between the third-party consumer and the consumer posting the ratings and reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287513478498">Bansal and Voyer 2000</xref>). In a many-to-many communication environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287513478498">Hoffman and Novak 1996</xref>), interpersonal relationships between sender and receiver are not strong ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287513478498">Brown, Broderick, and Lee 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287513478498">Parks and Floyd 1996</xref>) and the expertise level of the customer posting reviews and ratings might be questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287513478498">Feick and Higie 1992</xref>). Although consumers have been known to demonstrate a level of trust in using product reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287513478498">Riegner 2007</xref>), reviews and ratings of service experiences might suffer from the subjective nature of the assessment and the judgment made by the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287513478498">Laczniak, DeCarlo, and Ramaswami 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287513478498">Folkes 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0047287513478498">Sen and Lerman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287513478498">Weiner 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the interactions in the model, and along with current research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287513478498">Laczniak, DeCarlo, and Ramaswami 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287513478498">Samson 2006</xref>), our study found that the length of the reviews is important especially when the review is negative. Our results show that although a long negative review has a similar impact as a long positive one does, short reviews affect market share less negatively, and positive short reviews have the least negative impact. We explain these results in light of the attribution theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287513478498">Folkes 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0047287513478498">Weiner 2000</xref>). Consumers, especially in the service context, attribute the extreme reviews to the reviewers’ personal level of expectation, and not necessarily to any locus of control or fault of the service provider.</p>
<p>Alternative explanations for our results could be explained in light of the low level of involvement a customer would exhibit when purchasing a hotel room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287513478498">Johnston 1995</xref>). It is proposed that within a low level of involvement, satisfaction rather than delight, might be enough; positive transactions might not be required and negative ones can be compensated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287513478498">Johnston 1995</xref>). This explanation is also in line with noncompensatory decision rules tendencies in the service industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287513478498">Rust, Danaher, and Varki 2000</xref>), which would suggest that heuristic rules are used when consumers are limited in their processing time. For instance, our results could suggest that the lexicographic rule be the underlying heuristic when choosing a hotel online. The most important attribute (the rating relative to the zone of tolerance) would prevail in the choice, except if the alternatives are tied; in which case the next attribute (reviews) would be evaluated, although one more “click” is needed for consumers to read reviews, hence requiring a deeper level of involvement. Further research could investigate models that would account for click-through behaviors in order to explain purchases.</p>

<sec id="section26-0047287513478498">
<title>Managerial Implications</title>
<p>This study has several useful implications for managers. First, managers should concentrate on quality to drive ratings. However, given the managerial pressure, service failures are bound to happen, triggering lower ratings and negative reviews; thus, the issue at large is more about complaint resolution and postservice management relation than it is about control, at least in the lower-tiered segments. Managers of Economy–Budget and Upper–Midscale hotels would want to encourage ratings and reviews, and would want to mitigate, rather than eliminate, the negative reviews. Unless operating in the Luxury segment, overly positive and lengthy reviews might be seen as suspect by consumers; hence, managers should not fear to be rated “in the middle” of the tolerance zone.</p>
<p>Consistent with some popular press opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0047287513478498">Yu 2010</xref>), our results empirically demonstrate that on average “70% quality is good enough.” This is true for the lowest-tiered segments, but the Upper–Midscale segment should strive for more (87.6%) and the Luxury for perfection. These levels of quality are consistent with the national average by segments. Unless located in the Luxury segment, managers might deal with internal and external pressures requiring different goals. For instance, corporate headquarters might request 100% quality as a nonnegotiable goal in order to be able to use the rating as a public relations talking point. Corporate headquarters might even go farther and set incentives for individual properties that are linked to the achievement of high levels of customer ratings. This is counterbalanced by the tendency of property owners to go in the opposite direction, as they often see quality as a cost and not as an investment. In light of our results, and independently of the public relations problem, goals and incentives should foster a system similar to that used in sales. For example, an Economy–Budget hotel manager that achieves a 72% rating might currently be sanctioned. However, that hotel rating is in the zone of tolerance and should be rewarded. Furthermore, reviews should be quantified for length and valence, possibly by a third-party vendor using an algorithm. Results could be incorporated in the monthly benchmarking analysis firms.</p>
<p>Even if an OTA represents only about 7% of the hotel’s business booked online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287513478498">Hood 2011</xref>), management should take OTAs seriously and consider the “billboard effect,” where consumers have been shown to visit between seven and eight OTAs before booking their hotel, and even then might end up using the hotel chain’s website to make their purchase in the end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287513478498">Green 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, a study reports that two of every three online traveler reviews are posted to an OTA website in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287513478498">Green 2011</xref>). Therefore, favorable UGC not only produces bookings via the OTAs but also can produce bookings directly, generating higher margins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-0047287513478498">
<title>Limitations and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>This study may suffer from several limitations. First, even if our sample of hotels show robustness when compared to the national average, it is possible that even while controlling for selection bias, our results will not be generalizable. Second, the empirical setting of hotels might be unique and not representative of purely web-based services or click-and-mortar retailers. Hence, these limitations can provide guidelines for future research.</p>
<p>Studies that will expand the empirical setting to other services presenting similar characteristics such as restaurants would help the generalizability of the results. Similarly, studies that will examine services in the context of high involvement (i.e., investments, car or house purchases, hospitals) would contribute to our understanding of the UGC phenomenon. As mentioned earlier, studies that would further our understanding of the relationship between click-through behavior and purchase decision, in the context of reviews and ratings, would also be of great interest to the field of marketing in general. Finally, studies that would integrate offline promotions in the model would further the understanding of the dynamic relationship off- and online.</p>
