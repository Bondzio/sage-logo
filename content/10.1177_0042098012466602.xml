<abstract>
<p>Recent research concerning the potential presence of a national trend in regionally disaggregated US crime data is extended. In light of the varying levels of criminal activity noted in differing regions of the US, the present analysis considers whether a trend is emerging rather than currently present. Using alternative methods, potential convergence in criminal activity across the states of the US is examined. The results presented provide clear evidence of a previously undetected finding of convergence over the period 1960–2009 for all classifications of criminal activity considered. The importance and implications of these findings, along with their support in previous research on, <italic>inter alia</italic>, socioeconomic conditions, sentencing policies and alternative theories, are discussed.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The statistical analysis of crime rate series and their possible relationships with other variables has generated a huge literature spanning a number of disciplines including criminology, economics, law, politics and sociology (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012466602">Becker, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098012466602">Cohen and Felson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098012466602">Cantor and Land, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098012466602">Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody, 2001</xref>). Within this literature, a wide range of potential determinants of crime has been considered including alcohol consumption, consumers’ expenditure, female employment, income inequality, policing levels, wage rates and, perhaps most frequently, unemployment (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0042098012466602">Wolpin, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098012466602">Cornwell and Trumbull, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042098012466602">Pyle and Deadman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012466602">Hale, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012466602">Kapuscinski <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0042098012466602">Witt and Witte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012466602">Carmichael and Ward, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012466602">Greenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098012466602">Paternoster and Bushway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0042098012466602">Saridakis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012466602">Baltagi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042098012466602">Rosenfeld and Fornago, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012466602">Mocan and Bali, 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098012466602">1</xref>
</sup> From a brief inspection of the literature providing an empirical analysis of crime, it is apparent immediately that studies have been conducted at a variety of levels of disaggregation. For example, while some studies operate at a national level considering aggregate data (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098012466602">Hale, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098012466602">Kapuscinski <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098012466602">Greenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042098012466602">Paternoster and Bushway, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012466602">LaFree, 2005</xref>), others employ data disaggregated at the level of states, counties and even neighbourhoods (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012466602">Mocan and Bali, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098012466602">Carmichael and Ward, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0042098012466602">Weisburd <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref> respectively). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> have noted that, despite a wealth of research into the properties of crime being undertaken using data at various levels of disaggregation, there is a substantial quantity of work which has employed national-level crime data without recognition of the possibility of informative variation being present at lower levels of aggregation. Failure to consider regional variation obviously overlooks the possibility that results obtained at a national or aggregated level may not hold at more disaggregated levels. This has led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> to question the extent to which such variations exist or, conversely, the extent to which disaggregated crime data follow a national trend.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098012466602">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098012466602">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The possibility that levels of criminal activity may vary across regions has prompted analysis of the relative properties of geographically disaggregated crime series. As noted earlier, prominent work in this area is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> which considers explicitly the potential existence of a national trend in crime rates. Alternatively expressed, such a hypothesis effectively considers limited variation in crime at a disaggregated level. The arguments presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> that prompt interest in this issue are the extent to which a detected national trend provides information on: the relative weight to attach to theories promoting the importance of national or sub-national factors in the determination of crime; the relative importance of national or sub-national concerns when constructing crime-fighting policies; and, the extent to which analyses conducted at an aggregate level fail to detect important variation present in disaggregated series. While these arguments have an initial obvious relevance, it can be argued that similarity in crime rates could result from regions with different characteristics experiencing different circumstances and hence requiring (and perhaps employing) different crime-fighting policies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098012466602">4</xref>
</sup> However, should a national trend exist, it would, to some extent, provide useful information concerning these issues. Similar examination of a potential national trend is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012466602">Cork (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012466602">Messner <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref>, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref> present related research considering the extent to which similarities exist in state level crime-rates for the US.</p>
<p>From an examination of crime data for the US over time, it is clear that some regions have a tendency to exhibit consistently higher rates of criminal activity than others. Indeed, in a formal examination of the ranking of states over alternative classifications of criminal activity, it can be seen that little movement in rankings is apparent through time. In other words, a distribution exists in which states occupying higher (lower) positions in the ranking of crime across the US tend to hold their positions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098012466602">5</xref>
</sup> Recognising that differing levels of crime are apparent in different areas or regions of America, the presence of a national trend, as considered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref>, is not examined herein. Crudely, a national trend is deemed not to be present in light of the varying crime levels observed. Instead, it is examined whether, despite not being present currently, such a trend might be emerging. In other words, it is questioned whether alternative states are moving closer or <italic>converging</italic>, whereby states with lower (higher) initial levels experience higher (lower) levels of growth. It is examined therefore whether such a trend is emerging, as while there may not be a statistically significant movement in rankings, the distance between ranks may be narrowing. Should evidence in support of the hypothesis of convergence be detected, this has clear implications similar to those outlined earlier for the presence of a national trend. However, beyond this, convergence within the analysis of criminal behaviour is of interest for further reasons. To illustrate the relevance of convergence, debates on the modernisation–conflict hypotheses and the Gastil–Hackney thesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012466602">Hackney, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012466602">Gastil, 1971</xref>) can be considered. In both cases, the detection of convergence, a lack of convergence or divergence has implications concerning the support offered to these theories. More precisely, whilst modernisation theory leads to the prediction of the convergence of crime rates, conflict theory predicts divergence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012466602">LaFree, 2005</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098012466602">6</xref>
</sup> Similarly, the presence (or absence) of convergence can shed light on the Gastil–Hackney thesis which relates to increased levels of (violent) crime in Southern states. The extent to which this is reducing or increasing through time via the convergence or divergence of crime rates provides evidence on the extent to which support of this thesis is present or has changed.</p>
<p>Before embarking on the proposed analysis, the level of analysis, or appropriate degree of data disaggregation, must be determined. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> have considered disaggregation in the form of city-level data for the US, the present study employs state-level data. An immediately obvious argument in support of this particular level of disaggregation is found in the large and dominant judicial role of states, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098012466602">Smith (1997)</xref>. This choice of disaggregation has further support in a number of studies which employ such data in the examination of various hypotheses and theories. Considering this large literature, a number of immediately apparent themes involving the explicit use of state-level crime data include the analysis of the relationship between crime rates and levels of incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042098012466602">Levitt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098012466602">Greenberg and West, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012466602">DeFina and Arvanites, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042098012466602">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012466602">Liedka <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098012466602">Vieraitis <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098012466602">Spelman, 2008</xref>), the correspondence between sentencing policies and crime levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098012466602">Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0042098012466602">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), the impact of the ‘three strikes’ and ‘shall-issue’ laws on crime rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012466602">Ludwig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012466602">Chen, 2008</xref>), the relationship between race and homicide rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042098012466602">Nelsen <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>), the relative properties of alternative classifications of homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012466602">Parker and Smith, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042098012466602">Smith and Parker, 1980</xref>) and asymmetries in the relationship between crime and unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042098012466602">Mocan and Bali, 2010</xref>). Given the large number of studies and research themes identified as employing state-level data, the close examination of the relative properties of crime at the level of the state is an issue of clear interest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098012466602">7</xref>
</sup> It can be noted also that state-level disaggregation is routinely employed in many other areas of empirical research, including studies which have appeared in this journal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0042098012466602">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The analysis herein employs alternative methods to analyse whether a statistically significant convergence in crime rates across states has been witnessed over time. Consideration of convergence allows examination of the possibility that, although some states may persistently exhibit higher or lower crime rates than others, there may be a closing of the gap between them over time. To explore this, the growth rates of crime in alternative states, and the dispersion of crime across states, will be considered to examine the notions of β-convergence and σ-convergence. To the extent that convergence is witnessed, the movement towards a national trend or similarity across regions is supported.</p>
<p>To achieve its objectives, the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, previous research related to the current analysis is reviewed. Section 3 discusses the data to be examined, with section 4 presenting an overview of the notion of convergence in the context of the analysis of time-series data. Section 5 presents results from the examination of potential β-convergence in US state-level crime rates, with section 6 providing analogous results for σ-convergence. Section 7 provides a discussion of the results obtained and the extent of their correspondence with existing findings in the criminological literature. Section 8 concludes.</p>

<title>2. Previous Research</title>
<p>In recent research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> have considered whether geographically disaggregated crime rates follow a national trend or are essentially idiosyncratic. In the process of examining this topic, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> discuss a number of closely related empirical issues, aside from broader concerns such as the role of national and sub-national factors in criminological theory. These interrelated empirical issues can be summarised as the extent to which previous research has: utilised national-level data in the analysis of crime and ignored the possibility of variation in disaggregated series; and, detected a correspondence between national and disaggregated crime rates. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref>, responses to these issues can be summarised crudely as follows. First, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> cite research employing city- and neighbourhood-level data (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012466602">Levitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0042098012466602">Zimring, 2007</xref>), it is noted also that substantial research has been undertaken using national-level data without consideration of potential variation at a more disaggregated level of analysis. Secondly, a close correspondence between behaviour at the national and disaggregated levels has not always been detected in previous research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> note the limited evidence of a national trend in crime rates being provided by the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012466602">Cork (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042098012466602">Messner <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)</xref>, before undertaking independent analysis of this issue. Via application of a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to a panel of changes in city-level crime rates, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> gauge the extent of the presence of a national trend in crime via examination of the correlation of a temporal dummy variable with changes in crime rates. Depending upon the particular pairing of crime classification and city size considered, national factors were estimated to explain something between approximately one-fifth to one-third of the variation in changes in city-level crime rates via the proxy dummy variable.</p>
<p>The research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin (2009)</xref> therefore provides an indirect examination of regional variation in US crime rates via consideration of the extent to which disaggregated city-level crime rates are driven by national factors. However, two studies have considered the relative properties of state-level data (the focus of the current analysis) more explicitly. The first of these studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref>, examines state-level data on violent and property crime rates over the period 1971–91. Motivated by the argument that differences in disaggregated crime rates would suggest the importance of sub-national rather than national-level crime-fighting policies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref> examines the correlation between crime in individual states and the national rate. From inspection of the results obtained, it was suggested that similar behaviour in crime across states was apparent over the period considered, particularly for property crime, despite it being noted that “throughout the 21 year period neither violent nor property crime became more similar” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg, 1993</xref>, p. 518). This statement is of particular interest as it clearly refers to an absence of convergence in crime across the states, despite this hypothesis not being examined. In contrast, the formal examination of convergence in crime across states provides the motivation for the present study.</p>
<p>A second study considering state-level crime rates is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref>. Relative to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref>, this study considers a slightly longer sample (1971–94) and a greater number of classifications of crime (violent crime, property, auto theft, murder and aggregate crime). To permit the comparison of levels of crime across states, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref> considers the rankings of states for the four crime classifications examined along with results obtained from a panel data regression model. Over the relatively short sample examined, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref> concludes that a variation in the experiences of states is apparent with some states not witnessing the early 1990s downturn apparent elsewhere.</p>
<p>As already noted, the analysis of the <italic>relative</italic> properties of state-level data provides the motivation for the present research. While discussions refer to a large literature employing state-level data to examine a range of interesting hypotheses involving incarceration and sentencing policies etc., the studies cited employ the state-level data as a means of focusing upon an underlying hypothesis or theory of interest without considering the <italic>relative</italic> properties of the data. At another level, a number of further studies operating at the higher level of disaggregation—such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012466602">Benson and Rasmussen (1991)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012466602">Benson <italic>et al</italic>. (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012466602">Kovandzic and Sloan (2002)</xref> for Florida, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098012466602">Baltagi (2006)</xref> for North Carolina and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012466602">Shepard and Blackley (2005)</xref> for New York State—consider a single particular region and not the <italic>comparison</italic> of regions. Similarly, studies such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042098012466602">Miller (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098012466602">Barker (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042098012466602">Lynch (2010)</xref> do not consider regional comparisons, focusing instead upon almost case study analysis to examine the difference between behaviour at national and disaggregated levels. In contrast, the data and their underlying properties provide the focus of the attention for the present study which provides an extension and development of the analyses of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref>. In particular, the issue of convergence touched upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg (1993)</xref> is developed, with two forms of convergence considered to examine explicitly and formally the possibility of a drawing together of crime rates across the states of America.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0042098012466602">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As already noted, the analysis of convergence is of interest for a number of reasons. First, if it is recognised that a national trend in crime does not exist, an obvious issue to consider is whether there are movements towards it, in which case arguments relating to a national trend gain increased importance. Secondly, the importance of examining convergence arises naturally when considering alternative hypotheses relating to the analysis of criminal activity. At one level, the debate between modernisation and conflict theories (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098012466602">LaFree, 2005</xref>) rests upon the presence, or absence, of convergence. In summary, while the ‘modernisation’ view argues that, as developments and advances spread across economies (or regions) crime levels will converge, conflict theory relates to an uneven speed of development across regions which will cause crime levels to diverge. While these arguments are usually aired at an international level involving the comparison of countries, they can be employed at a national level to consider alternative regions within a single country. This is a particularly straightforward extension when considering a large economy such as the US with noted variation in the distribution of wealth, income and other socioeconomic indicators across regions. Similarly, convergence in levels of criminal activity is of relevance in the examination of issues such as the Gastil–Hackney thesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098012466602">Hackney 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012466602">Gastil 1971</xref>). Based upon observed differences in the levels of (violent) crime in Southern regions of the US, any witnessed convergence of crime rates reduces the evidential support for this thesis, while divergence in the form of increasing levels of violent crime in Southern states provides additional support.</p>

<title>3. Data</title>
<p>The full set of data examined in this paper are annual observations on US crime rates in the 50 states of the US over the period 1965 to 2009.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0042098012466602">10</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the level of geographical disaggregation considered herein results in 50 cross-sectional, or regional, units. The data are obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation via the <italic>Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics</italic> website. The series considered are violent crime, murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, property crime, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0042098012466602">11</xref>
</sup> It should be noted that violent crime is an aggregation of the four categories of crime following it in ths listing, while property crime is an aggregation of the final three categories of crime listed.</p>
<p>Before commencing on the data analysis, the exact number of series to examine can be considered. This issue is more involved than might be thought initially, given the variation in number of regional units that have been considered in the literature to date. While some studies have employed 51 cross-sectional units via consideration of 50 states plus Washington, DC (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098012466602">DeFina and Arvanites, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042098012466602">Liedka <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0042098012466602">Spelman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0042098012466602">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), other research has employed a restricted or lesser number of regions. Research falling into this latter category includes a number of studies which examine the full 50 states but not the DC, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0042098012466602">Smith (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0042098012466602">Smith and Parker (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098012466602">Chen (2008)</xref>. In addition to this, a further body of work employing state-level data has considered anything from 49 to 46 states due either to data limitations or a focus on contiguous states only (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098012466602">Gastil, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042098012466602">Parker and Smith, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042098012466602">Ludwig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0042098012466602">Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0042098012466602">Vieraitis <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>).

<title>4. Measures of Convergence</title>
<p>Within the literature on economic growth, reference is frequently made to the notion of convergence. Simply expressed, convergence refers to the drawing together through time of a collection of variables, or series, of interest. Considering the present context, detection of convergence will have a number of implications as has already been noted, in the form of support for alternative theories and the potential design of policies.</p>
<p>Within economics, the examination of convergence in data series is commonplace, with a large literature now existing, primarily as a result of the prediction of convergence in per capita incomes by the neo-classical growth model (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0042098012466602">Solow, 1956</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0042098012466602">1970</xref>). While convergence has been considered in a number of ways, the forms of convergence which have come to dominate the literature are those of β-convergence and σ-convergence. The first of these forms of convergence, β-convergence, refers to the notion of processes with higher (lower) initial values experiencing slower (faster) growth than series with lower (higher) initial values. Therefore, β-convergence refers to a ‘catching-up’, or even ‘leap-frogging’, effect under which series initially occupying lower positions grow more quickly, while series starting in higher positions grow more slowly. In the economics literature, β-convergence has been examined typically via the use of cross-sectional Barro–Baumol regressions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098012466602">Barro, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098012466602">Baumol, 1986</xref>) with the growth in incomes regressed upon their initial levels for a range of regional series. The existence of β-convergence is then gauged via the sign of the coefficient on the initial-level term, as a significantly negative value indicates an inverse relationship between growth and initial values, thereby supporting the presence of convergence. While there has been some debate concerning the relative merits of this method (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012466602">Friedman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042098012466602">Quah, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042098012466602">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098012466602">Bliss, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098012466602">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098012466602">Cannon and Duck, 2000</xref>), it has come to occupy a central position in the literature on convergence, receiving widespread and frequent application (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098012466602">Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012466602">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042098012466602">Mankiw <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012466602">Sala-i-Martin, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The second notion of convergence, σ-convergence, relates to the spread of the cross-sectional distribution of a group of series over time. In essence, if the distribution as measured by the coefficient of variation is seen to narrow, convergence is deemed to be present. Clearly, there is a correspondence between this measure of convergence and that of β-convergence. If σ-convergence is present, the cross-sectional distribution has narrowed and hence β-convergence must have occurred also. However, β-convergence can occur with initially lower regions growing more rapidly than initially higher-placed regions, without the cross-sectional distribution shrinking. Therefore, while σ-convergence is both a necessary and sufficient condition for β-convergence, β-convergence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for σ-convergence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0042098012466602">12</xref>
</sup> Despite this noted relationship between the two forms of convergence, results for β-convergence are provided given the complementary information it provides in terms of point estimates and significance levels, which can be compared across alternative classifications of criminal activity.</p>

<p>This regression is therefore performed over 50 observations (<italic>i</italic> = 1, … 50), for each of the nine classifications of crime under consideration. The focus of attention is therefore on the estimated value and significance of β, with a negative value indicating the presence of β-convergence.

<p>While this analysis provides results for the whole sample available, convergence over sub-periods could be considered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0042098012466602">13</xref>
</sup> Consequently, the full sample of 1965–2009 is split into five equal sub-samples (1965–73; 1974–82; 1983–91; 1992–2000; 2001–09) with convergence considered for each using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0042098012466602">equation (1)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012466602">Table 2</xref>). Considering the results obtained, it is apparent that, while a number of series exhibit significant convergence in every sample considered (rape, assault, property crime and larceny), others display significance in a limited number of samples (murder and robbery being the prominent cases in this regard). However, it must be noted that convergence is essentially a longer-term issue and the use of small or short samples may not provide the opportunity to detect convergence between series. In the present case, the overwhelming significance presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098012466602">Table 1</xref> suggests that the short spans considered in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098012466602">Table 2</xref> do not provide a sufficient span of time to detect convergence.

<title>6. Examining σ-convergence</title>
<p>The use of σ-convergence as means of examining convergence between time-series has received application in a number of studies following its championing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098012466602">Friedman (1992)</xref>. In contrast to other methods of examining convergence, this is an uncontroversial method which is extremely straightforward to apply. For the present analysis, the method involves the calculation through time of the coefficient of variation across regions for a given classification of crime. Considering the first classification of crime (the violent crime rate), the coefficient of variation is calculated across the regions considered for 1965 and then for all subsequent years. The plot of this resulting series of 45 observations is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012466602">Figure 1</xref>, with the values scaled to ensure an initial value of 1 to ease interpretation.

<p>From inspection of the plots for violent crime and its components in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098012466602">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098012466602"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098012466602"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098012466602"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098012466602">5</xref>, a number of issues are apparent immediately. A pattern of σ-convergence is observed for all violent crime classifications over the entire sample with a scaled coefficient of less than 1 noted for all crime classifications at the end of the sample. In this regard, the sub-categories of rape and robbery exhibit the greatest convergence with the scaled coefficient approaching 0.6 by the final year of the sample (0.66 and 0.62 respectively). However, movement in the coefficient of variation is noted during the sample, with some divergence noted for assault rates in the late 1980s and early 1990s and also for rape rates, robbery rates and the aggregate violent crime rate in the 1980s. Turning to the plots for property crime and its components in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098012466602">Figures 6</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0042098012466602"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098012466602"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0042098012466602">9</xref>, property and larceny rates exhibit steady convergence. In general convergence is clearly witnessed, particularly for larceny rates where the scaled coefficient of variation falls to below 0.47 by the end of the sample. The graph for burglary rates is interesting as convergence turns to divergence in the early to mid 1980s, with further divergence noted from the mid 1990s onwards. However, the most interesting property component is that for motor vehicle thefts which can be seen to be highly volatile, exhibiting clear periods of both convergence and divergence throughout the sample period. However, as with murder within the context of violent crime, motor vehicle theft is the smallest component of property crime with its contribution varying between 8.5 per cent and 13 per cent over the sample period. Consequently, the graph for aggregate property crime is more similar to those of its other (larger) underlying components.</p>

<title>7. Discussion of Results</title>
<p>Before attempting to summarise the wealth of information provided by the statistical analyses, it is appropriate to consider what has been noted almost anecdotally in the literature to date concerning the evolution of crime. In previous research, repeated reference has been made to a rapid growth in crime from the 1960s ahead of a levelling-off around 1980 and a decline in the 1990s (see, <italic>inter alia</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098012466602">Cook and Zarkin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0042098012466602">Witt and Witte, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042098012466602">McDowall and Loftin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098012466602">Arvanites and DeFina, 2006</xref>). This leads to three almost distinct periods in the evolution of national crime rates for the US and has led to some associated references such as the ‘crime boom of the 1960s’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012466602">LaFree, 1999</xref>) and, in the context of the 1990s, a ‘crime drop’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098012466602">Blumstein, 2006</xref>) and a ‘crime decline’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0042098012466602">Zimring, 2007</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0042098012466602">14</xref>
</sup> In addition, the noted changes in the evolution of crime have prompted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012466602">Cook and Cook (2011)</xref> to explore the impact of the inclusion of potential breakpoints into the analysis of the temporal properties of US crime rates. The analysis undertaken resulted in the detection of statistically significant breakpoints matching the proposed periods of changing behaviour in crime. Therefore, the analysis of regional crime rates presented in here has been conducted over an interesting period in terms of changing properties and behaviour.</p>
<p>Moving to consider the results obtained for β-convergence, the analysis showed that, while regions may occupy different positions in the distribution of crime across the US, they tended to move together over the sample period. As a result of the negative coefficient obtained within the β-convergence regressions, it was seen that regions with lower (higher) initial crime rates tended to grow more quickly (slowly) than regions with higher (lower) initial crime rates. The analysis then proceeded to consider σ-convergence, noting that it has been recognised in the literature that β-convergence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for σ-convergence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098012466602">Furceri, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0042098012466602">Young <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Considering the results for σ-convergence, these are more difficult to summarise than those for β-convergence. Despite this, a number of features can be noted. It is apparent that all series apart from motor vehicle theft exhibit a tendency to converge, although some movement in the scaled coefficient of variation is apparent for all series, particularly in the 1980s. This coincides with the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, which has been associated with increased crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098012466602">Grogger and Willis, 2000</xref>) and homicide in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012466602">Cork, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A further interesting feature of the σ-convergence graphs concerns the speedy convergence during the period from the mid 1970s to around 1980 for all series apart from assault and motor vehicle theft. This coincides with the breakpoint dating results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012466602">Cook and Cook (2011)</xref> and illustrates that, as crime for the US overall began to plateau, regions drew together. In terms of underlying factors contributing to this observed behaviour, the period in question coincides with the ‘better policing strategies’ noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042098012466602">Marvell and Moody (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098012466602">Kovandzic and Sloan (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012466602">Levitt (2004)</xref>, the changes in ‘criminal justice sanctions’ cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098012466602">Shoesmith (2010)</xref> and the changes in ‘political legitimacy’ proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098012466602">LaFree (1999)</xref>. Considering the relative properties of violent and property crimes, it can be seen that the greatest levels of convergence are noted for property crime and larceny. That property crimes should differ from violent crimes is perhaps not surprising as a number of studies have noted the differing behaviour of, and factors influencing, these two classifications of crime. These factors include: the differential response of violent and property crimes to increased incarceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042098012466602">Levitt, 2004</xref>); differing levels of arrest rates for these two classifications of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0042098012466602">Shoesmith, 2010</xref>); the increased impact of the crack cocaine epidemic on violent crime relative to property crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098012466602">Cork, 1999</xref>); and, the differing responses of violent and property crimes to drug enforcement policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098012466602">Benson and Rasmussen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098012466602">Benson <italic>et al</italic>., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012466602">Shepard and Blackley, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0042098012466602">Shepard and Blackley (2005)</xref> focus upon larceny as a crime <italic>positively</italic> related to an increased drug enforcement policy (in contrast to its negative impact upon violent crime) in an analysis of New York State data. From inspection of the results for σ-convergence, larceny is clearly the series exhibiting the greatest degree of convergence.</p>
<p>A final feature of the σ-convergence results concerns the unusual plot obtained for motor vehicle theft, which does not illustrate a general tendency towards convergence seen elsewhere. Interestingly, the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098012466602">Cook and Cook (2011)</xref> found motor vehicle theft to be unlike other property crime series in terms of the structural change it exhibited and hence meriting further examination. The results herein again suggest motor vehicle theft to be at odds with other series to some extent and prompt further consideration of its underlying determinants.</p>

<title>8. Concluding Comments</title>
<p>The present analysis has sought to examine the relative properties of regionally disaggregated crime data for the US. This work was prompted by: the witnessed use of data of varying degrees of disaggregation in the empirical analysis of crime; recent research suggesting the benefits to be gained from the use and consideration of disaggregated crime data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098012466602">Cavender, 2010</xref>, and references therein); recent research considering the extent to which regional data follow a national trend (McDowall and Loftin, 2010); the limited extent to which variations in state-level crime data have been examined in the literature to date (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0042098012466602">Winsberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098012466602">Besci, 1999</xref>); and, the importance of convergence in relation to assessing the support present for alternative theories. In light of the vast research conducted within the literature using state-level data and the central judicial role of states, disaggregation was considered at the level of states. Employing convergence techniques previously unconsidered in the present context, a number of interesting results were obtained concerning the drawing together of alternative crime rates across the US. This finding was particularly apparent for β-convergence where lower crime regions at the start of the sample were found to exhibit a faster growth in crime over the sample period than regions with higher initial rates. While the results obtained for σ-convergence were less clear-cut, a tendency towards convergence was noted for all classifications of crime aside from motor vehicle theft.</p>
<p>Considering the results as a whole, a number of issues arise. First, the literature considering whether a national trend exists in crime rates has been extended via evidence that, although regions occupy differing positions in the distribution of crime, they have been drawing together over recent decades. Secondly, periods of divergence warrant further examination, with the factors underlying the episodes in which regions pull apart in terms of their crime levels being potentially informative in the understanding of crime. Thirdly, while the focus of the present analysis concerns the existence, rather than explanation, of convergence, it can be questioned what underlies the convergence observed. Possible explanations can be sought for the convergence witnessed in underlying potential determinants of crime. As examples of this, the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098012466602">Johnson (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098012466602">Jones and Newburn (2006)</xref> can be considered. While the former study provides evidence of convergence in income levels across the states, the latter considers convergence in sentencing policies. Clearly, the convergence in socioeconomic conditions and judicial factors can be related to the convergence in criminal activity presented in the current analysis. However, given the current study’s objective to introduce the concept of convergence in the analysis of crime and its detection, this warrants closer, more detailed examination. This is the subject of future research.</p>

<p>Further support for the utilisation of state-level data in the analysis of the variation in crime across the US can be found in the economic literature within which states provide a common level of disaggregation. Examples of studies in this literature include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098012466602">Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042098012466602">Sala-i-Martin (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0042098012466602">Vohra (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042098012466602">Miller and Genc (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098012466602">Cook (2008a)</xref> which explore the distribution of income across the US via the analysis of state-level data. In light of the voluminous research into the relationship between a variety of economic variables and crime following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098012466602">Becker (1968)</xref>, close scrutiny of the properties of state-level crime data has a natural appeal given the use of this level of disaggregation in economics. The use of state-level data is also apparent in other areas of economic research with, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042098012466602">Payne (1998)</xref> exploring the relationship between state-level expenditures and revenues. Similarly, the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042098012466602">Miniou and Andres (2008)</xref> and of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098012466602">Howell-Moroney (2007)</xref> published in this journal, utilise state-level data to analyse suicide rates and land development respectively.</p>

<p>It can be noted that ‘convergence’ in crime has been examined previously in the criminology literature, albeit in a very different context. More precisely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098012466602">Austin (1993)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042098012466602">O’Brien (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0042098012466602">Steffensmeier <italic>et al</italic>. (2006)</xref> consider convergence in the form of trends in male and female arrest (or crime) rates moving together over time. The present analysis clearly differs not only in terms of the form of analysis, which introduces alternative methods into the criminology literature, but also in terms of context given the focus of convergence across 50 geographical regions rather than two genders.</p>

<p>It has been suggested in the literature that <italic>some</italic> of the crime classification series have been subject to a change in recording practices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042098012466602">O’Brien, 2003</xref>). However, this is a familiar issue in many areas of empirical research as data are frequently subject to revision (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098012466602">Cook, 2008b</xref>). Moreover, this is even less important for the present analysis for two reasons. First, and more importantly, any revision to recording practices will be felt across all states considered. Secondly, there is no evidence of apparent differences between the results obtained for series which are, and are not, subject to the suggested revisions. For these reasons, changes in recording practices can be deemed unimportant for the present analysis.</p>
