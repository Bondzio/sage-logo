<p>Economic prospects deteriorated sharply towards the end of 2011, as the Euro Area sovereign debt crisis threatened to ignite a second global banking crisis. Policy actions by the European Central Bank appear to have averted the immediate danger, by pumping €530 billion in 3-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) into the European banking system in February. Tensions in European financial markets have eased since February.</p>
<p>However, fiscal austerity is depressing growth in those countries most affected by the crisis; this in turn reduces tax revenues, making the restoration of fiscal sustainability and hence market confidence even more difficult. This risks a negative feedback loop; downside risks, both economic and political, therefore remain high.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, while short-term global prospects have improved marginally since January, a rise in the oil price has largely offset the gains from the decline in short-term uncertainty. We continue to expect a recession in the Euro Area and the UK in the first half of 2012. We forecast relatively slow growth (about 2 percent) in other developed economies. In the US, this assumes that fiscal policy is not tightened abruptly; were this to be the case, growth would be significantly slower. Fast, although slightly slowing, growth in China and India, continues to drive global growth, for the year as a whole.</p>
<p>In 2013, we see some rebalancing of global growth, as the Euro Area recovers somewhat, growth picks up further in the US, and China continues to slow. Global current account imbalances, however, remain elevated, although not at pre-crisis levels.</p>
<p>A summary of our main global forecast figures is below:</p>
