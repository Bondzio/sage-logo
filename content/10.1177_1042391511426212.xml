<abstract>
<p>Previously, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed simulations using fire dynamics simulator (FDS) software to predict the response of spent nuclear fuel transport packages in severe naturally ventilated tunnel fires. The long-range objective of the authors’ current project is to predict the response of such a package to those tunnel fires using different computational methods. The first stage of the project, which is the subject of this article, is to determine the accuracy of Container Analysis Fire Environment (CAFE) computer simulations in predicting gas speed and temperature measurements made in forced-ventilated and naturally ventilated fires from the Memorial tunnel test series performed for the Massachusetts Highway Department in the 1990s. The CAFE simulations accurately predict the average heat release rate in both types of tests. Gas speeds and temperatures are obtained from the simulations at the same locations as for the measurements. For the forced-ventilated test, CAFE predicts those quantities more accurately upstream of the fire than downstream. In addition, the predictions are less accurate for the naturally ventilated test than they are for the forced-ventilated experiment. However, the accuracy of the CAFE prediction in the naturally ventilated test is on par with that from FDS.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1042391511426212" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is transported away from reactor sites in thick-walled cylindrical packages that have large honeycomb or wood-filled impact limiters on each end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1042391511426212">1</xref>]. Before a package can be used, it must receive a Certificate of Compliance from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1042391511426212">2</xref>]. To do this, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the package will maintain its containment, shielding, and criticality control functions after a series of severe events. These events include a 9-m drop onto an unyielding flat surface, a 1-m drop onto a steel puncture bar, full engulfment in an 800°C (1472°F) fire for 30 min, and water submersion.</p>
<p>Transportation risk studies assess the response of certified packages to all possible types of accidents, as well as the likelihood that packages will be involved in those types of events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1042391511426212">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1042391511426212">4</xref>]. The NRC worked with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to evaluate the ability of certified SNF packages to withstand the conditions of <italic>specific</italic> severe, long-duration fire accidents. To do this, NIST and PNNL conducted analyses that predict the response of those packages assuming they were in proximity to two different tunnel fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1042391511426212">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1042391511426212">6</xref>]. The first occurred in the Caldecott roadway tunnel near Oakland, CA, USA in 1982 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1042391511426212">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1042391511426212">8</xref>]. That fire was fueled by 33.3 m<sup>3</sup> (8800 gal) of gasoline from a tanker truck and trailer. The second took place in the Howard Street rail tunnel in Baltimore, MD, USA in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1042391511426212">9</xref>]. It was fueled by 108 m<sup>3</sup> (28,600 gal) of tripropylene from a derailed tank car. The first two columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391511426212">Table 1</xref> summarize the tunnel slope and dimensions, as well as the fuel quantity and fire duration for the two events. The forced-ventilation blowers in neither tunnel were active during the fires.

<p>In the NRC analyses, NIST used the fire dynamics simulator (FDS) computer program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1042391511426212">10</xref>] to predict the thermal environments that existed during and after the Caldecott [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1042391511426212">11</xref>] and Howard Street [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391511426212">12</xref>] tunnel fires. The PNNL constructed computational models of two rails and one truck SNF packages. These models were subjected to conservative versions of the environment that NIST calculated to exist during the fires. Simulations were used to predict the temperature of key internal cask components, including the fuel cladding, package seals, and radiation shields. The studies concluded that there would have been no significant release of radioactive material because neither fire would have caused the fuel cladding within any of the packages to reach its burst rupture temperature of 750°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1042391511426212">13</xref>]. Based on the experimental data available at the time of the NRC study, cladding was assumed to lose its containment function at that temperature.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the current research program is to simulate the response of a truck SNF package to the Caldecott and Howard Street tunnel fires using different computational methods than were used by NIST and PNNL. This work has several stages. The first, which is the subject of the current article, is to benchmark a fire simulation code against data acquired in a tunnel fire. Subsequently, a finite element (FE) model of a truck package will be constructed. Finally, the benchmarked code will be used to simulate the response of the truck package in the two fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1042391511426212">14</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1042391511426212"><title>Container Analysis Fire Environment simulations</title>
<p>The Container Analysis Fire Environment (CAFE) computer code was developed at Sandia National Laboratories to predict the response of SNF transport packages to severe accident conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1042391511426212">15</xref>]. The CAFE links a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and radiation heat transfer fire simulator with a FE model of a package. These two components employ separate computational meshes, and they do not run simultaneously. The CFD code runs for a user-defined time, such as 1 s, to calculate the fire behavior and heat transfer to the package surfaces. The package surface temperature is an internal boundary condition of the fire simulation. The FE model then calculates the package temperatures response to the heat transfer from the fire for another user-defined period of time. The new FE package surface temperature is then used to update the temperature boundary condition of the fire simulation. The two components were run alternately until the fire/postfire simulation is complete.</p>
<p>The CAFE uses a Rosseland effective conductivity to calculate radiation heat transfer exchange within the heavily sooty regions within the fire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1042391511426212">16</xref>]. Those regions are defined as locations where the products-of-combustion mass fraction is above a user-defined value. Surface-to-surface view factors are used to calculate radiation transport outside those regions.</p>
<p>The CAFE’s fire simulator employs a number of physics-based fuel evaporation, turbulent transport, reaction chemistry, and radiation heat transfer models. These models allow the fire simulator to accurately predict heat transfer to objects even when relative coarse (and fast running) computational meshes are employed. Parameters for these models include the fuel surface absorptivity, the products-of-combustion mass fraction used to define the edge of the diffusely radiating fire zone, and combustion reaction constants. The values of these parameters must be determined based on comparison of CAFE simulation results with measured data acquired in large fire experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1042391511426212">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1042391511426212">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Large-scale outdoor fire tests have been performed to acquire data to benchmark CAFE for large-scale outdoor fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1042391511426212">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1042391511426212">20</xref>]. In these experiments, large pipe calorimeters were suspended over JP8 jet fuel fires. The wind conditions and calorimeter interior surface temperatures were measured during and after a series of roughly 30-min fires. The CAFE simulations were performed using computational domains that modeled the experimental facility and boundary conditions based on the measured winds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1042391511426212">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1042391511426212">23</xref>]. These simulations were performed with different values for the model parameters. The calorimeter temperature results from these simulations were compared to the experimental data to determine the most appropriate model parameter values and to benchmark the simulation methods.</p>
<p>The behavior of tunnel fires can be quite different from outdoor fires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1042391511426212">24</xref>]. For example, outdoor fires generally lose heat to the cooler surrounding environment. In contrast, heat from a fire to the tunnel surfaces may be conducted into the tunnel walls, or it may be reflected or absorbed and radiated back to the tunnel. Moreover, tunnel fires, unlike outdoor fires, may have a limited supply of oxygen. This is especially true in long tunnels and if the fire lasts long enough to consume the oxygen in the immediate vicinity. This can significantly reduce the fire heat release rate compared to outdoor fires.</p>
<p>The buoyancy-induced flow of fresh air to the fire, which is affected by the flow of combustion products away from it, must be accurately calculated to predict fire effects. In some tunnels, blowers and/or vents are used to ventilate the tunnel. However, if buoyancy is the main driver of fresh air to the fire then it may be necessary to model the entire tunnel length to accurately simulate fire effects. This can be computationally intensive since some tunnels are kilometers in length. Before CAFE simulations can be used with confidence to predict tunnel fire behavior, they must be benchmarked against relevant experimental data.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1042391511426212"><title>Memorial tunnel fire ventilation test program</title>
<p>A series of 98 fire tests was conducted in the abandoned Memorial tunnel, which was originally built for two traffic lanes as part of the West Virginia Turnpike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1042391511426212">25</xref>]. The fires had nominal heat release rates between 10 and 100 MW, and they were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different ventilation schemes during fires. The FDS computer code, which was used in the NIST analyses of the Caldecott and Howard Street tunnel fires, was benchmarked using data from Test 321A from this series, which employed forced ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1042391511426212">26</xref>], and Test 502, which used natural ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391511426212">12</xref>]. The Memorial tunnel dimensions and slope, and parameters of the two tests are compared to those of the Howard Street and Caldecott tunnel fires in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1042391511426212">Table 1</xref>. The Memorial tunnel length and slope are similar to those of the Caldecott tunnel, but the Memorial fire durations are shorter than those of the accidental fires. Tests 321A and 502 from the Memorial tunnel series are also used here to determine the accuracy of CAFE simulations for tunnel fires.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391511426212">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the Memorial tunnel cross section. There is a lower rectangular roadway region, with height and width of 4.33 m (14.2 ft) and 8.77 m (28.7 ft), and an upper semicircular ventilation duct, with radius 4.38 m (14.3 ft). They are separated by a relatively thin removable false ceiling suspended from vertical support structures. There are sidewalks on both sides of the roadway. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1042391511426212">Figure 1(b)</xref> shows a schematic axial slice (not to scale) through the tunnel, including the roadway and duct regions. The tunnel is 850 m (2788 ft) long and has a 3.2% upgrade from the south (lower) to the north (upper) portals. A 22.3-m<sup>2</sup> (240 ft<sup>2</sup>) open-surface fuel pan was installed approximately one-quarter of the tunnel length (238 m) from the south portal to produce nominally 50-MW fires. Air from the duct can be forced into the roadway region through a 28-m<sup>2</sup> port (300 ft<sup>2</sup>) in the false ceiling 135 m (443 ft) uphill from the fuel pan. Fan rooms are located near both portals and their lower surfaces align with the false ceiling. A movable panel can be used to seal different fractions of the north portal. Note that the <italic>z</italic>-coordinate is aligned with the tunnel axis, with an origin at the center of the fire pan and with positive values uphill (north) of the fuel pan. The axial speed, <italic>S</italic>, is also positive when gas flows toward the north portal.
<fig id="fig1-1042391511426212" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Memorial tunnel configuration (a) cross section (b) axial slice.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1042391511426212-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Both tests considered in this work used the 22.3-m<sup>2</sup> (240-ft<sup>2</sup>) fuel pan. A 150-mm-deep (0.5 ft) layer of water was placed in the pan and fuel oil (low sulfur Number 2) floated on top. The fuel surface was about 750 mm (2.5 ft) above the tunnel floor. A closed-loop system was used to monitor the fuel level and then pump fuel into the pan at a rate that caused the level to be fairly constant. The pump flow rate versus time was recorded during the tests. The time-dependent fire heat release rate was determined by multiplying the time-dependent fuel pump flow rate by the fuel heat of reaction. This rate was then reduced based on measured unburned fuel vapor near the fire.</p>
<p>In forced-ventilation test 321A, the north portal was completely sealed by a panel, and air was forced into the roadway through the port in the false ceiling. In natural-ventilation test 502, the false ceiling was completely removed and the panel on the north portal covered half the area between the fan room and roadway.</p>
<p>Three vertical tubes were placed at 14 different <italic>z</italic>-locations. At each <italic>z</italic>-location, one tube was placed near the channel centerline, while the others were placed closer to the walls. The tubes supported thermocouples and bidirectional flow probes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1042391511426212">27</xref>] that were used to measure the gas temperature and axial speed, respectively. Each flow probe is a metal tube aligned with the <italic>z</italic>-axis. A wall inside the tube separates it into two cups. The pressure difference between the cups is measured and used to determine the axial component of the gas speed. In the work described in this report, all probes were assumed to be placed on the center vertical tube, but this was not explicitly stated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1042391511426212">25</xref>].</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1042391511426212">Table 2</xref> shows the axial location of important components within the tunnel. The dimensions of the experimental fuel pan were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1042391511426212">25</xref>]. The current work assumes the walls of the pan are at <italic>z</italic> = ±5 m (±16 ft) and <italic>x</italic> = ±1.12 m (±3.4 ft; where the <italic>x</italic>-coordinate is toward the side walls). The gas temperature was measured at 14 axial locations between <italic>z</italic> = −218 and 596 m (715 ft and 1955 ft). The axial component of the gas speed was measured at 10 of these locations. The <italic>z</italic>-locations of the edges of the fuel pool, the North and South portals, and the ceiling ventilation port are all given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1042391511426212">Table 2</xref>. During forced-ventilation tests, thermocouples are located at seven different elevations above the roadway at each axial measurement station. During natural-ventilation tests, these measurements were made at eight different elevations. Their <italic>y</italic>-coordinates (elevation above the roadbed) are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1042391511426212">Table 3</xref>.

<p>There are three important shortcomings of using the Memorial tunnel test results for determining the accuracy of CAFE for calculating the response of a transport package in tunnel fires. The first is that while gas speeds and temperatures were measured, the response of large objects in or near the fires was not. The second is that the Memorial fire durations are shorter than those of the Caldecott or Howard Street fires. As a result, the ability of CAFE to predict the possible effect of limited oxygen on the fire is not fully benchmarked. Finally, it is difficult for the current authors, who did not conduct the fire tests, to know all details of the fires. This adds uncertainty to the benchmarking process. Future work may consider benchmarking CAFE against other tunnel fire data such as that from the Runehamar experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1042391511426212">28</xref>].</p>

<p>The false ceiling was removed for natural-ventilation test 502. The domain used to simulate that test has a stair-stepped semicircular ceiling with a maximum tunnel height of <italic>y</italic> = 7.9 m (26 ft). The grid configurations for the coarse, nominal, and fine meshes are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1042391511426212">Table 4</xref>. For both tests, the axial location of the fuel pan center is <italic>z</italic> = 0, and its surface was at <italic>y</italic> = 1 m (3.3 ft).</p>

The tunnel surface emissivity used in this work was assumed to be 0.9 (no sensitivity study was performed for this assumption). In all simulations, pressure boundary conditions were used at the tunnel entrance/exit portals. At the beginning of the simulations, the gas and wall temperatures at all locations is 25°C (77°F), and the initial speed is zero. The air entering the tunnel portals is also 25°C (77°F).</p>

<p>For the forced-ventilation test, fuel was supplied to the pan for 18 min, and air entered the tunnel through the false ceiling port at <italic>z</italic> = 135 m (443 ft). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1042391511426212">Figure 3(a)</xref> shows the ventilation air volume flow rate versus time, <italic>t</italic>, after the fire was started.

For the current simulations, a time-dependent downward air speed was specified at the ceiling port. It was uniform over the port and equal to the volume flow rate divided by the port area.

The measured rate rose quickly for the first 2 min, and then oscillated about a fairly constant value. The measured heat release rate does not exhibit a strong decrease during the fire duration. This indicates that the fire did not completely consume the oxygen in its vicinity. The mean heat release rate over the 18-min fire test is shown by line marked ‘Average.’ Even though this test is categorized as a 50 MW fire, the actual average heat release rate is 34 MW.</p>
<p>In the current simulations, the fuel mass flux rate from the pan is uniform over the pan area but varied with time. It was determined by dividing the measured heat release rate by fuel heat of reaction and the fuel pan surface area. The properties of JP8 jet fuel were used for the fuel.

After the ventilation is activated, the flow reverses and moves downhill (toward the south portal). Even though the plotted simulation results are a moving-average, they are much more oscillatory than the measured data. This may be because the experimental bidirectional flow probe pressure measurement filters out high frequencies. A moving-average of the simulation results exhibits a similar time-dependence as the measured data.

<p>The magnitude of the measured steady state speed is very low between the sealed northern portal and the ventilation port. It increases downhill of the ventilation port due to air injection. It increases again downhill of the fuel pan because the gas has expanded due to fire heating. The gas speed magnitude decreases further downhill of the fire because it loses heat to the walls and is diluted by entraining cool air from below. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measured data uphill of the fire. However, the magnitude of the simulated speed just downhill of the fire is not as great as the measured values. This may be because the simulated energy addition to the gas from the fire is not as great as the actual addition. Further downhill, the simulated gas speed magnitude decreases by roughly the same amount as the measured value.</p>

<p>During the steady state period, the gas flow for locations downhill of the ventilation port (<italic>z</italic> &lt; 135 m [443 ft]) is to the right (toward the South Portal).

<p>For the natural-ventilation test, the flow is generally uphill (this is from right to left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1042391511426212">Figure 15</xref>). The gas temperatures increase as they approach the fire, reach a peak at <italic>z</italic> = 11 m (36 ft), which is just uphill of the fire, and then drop off. The simulated average and maximum temperatures are slightly higher than the measurements downhill of the fire. However, the simulations are significantly cooler than the measurements uphill of the fire. The measured peak in the maximum temperature profile is 952°C (1745°F), while it is 802°C (1475°F) from the fine-mesh CAFE simulation. These values are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1042391511426212">Table 5</xref>. The NIST study used Test 502 to benchmark FDS simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391511426212">12</xref>]. That study compared the simulated peak maximum temperature at <italic>t</italic> = 14 min to the measured data. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1042391511426212">Table 5</xref> indicates that the measured peak maximum temperature at that time was 826°C (1519°F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1042391511426212">25</xref>], while the value calculated by FDS was 704°C (1300°F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1042391511426212">12</xref>]. The value calculated by CAFE is 795°C (1463°F). Based on this assessment, the accuracy of the CAFE-calculated result is roughly on par with that of the FDS-calculated result.</p>

<p>In this article, the fire model in CAFE is applied to one forced and one naturally ventilated fire test from the Memorial tunnel fire test sequence. Both tests were conducted in an 850 m long tunnel with a 3.2% slope. In the forced-ventilation test, the tunnel had a rectangular cross section and the upper tunnel portal was sealed. A total of 2 min after the fire was started, air was forced through a port in the tunnel ceiling at a location uphill of the fire. CAFE simulations accurately predicted the gas speeds uphill of the fire, and gas temperatures uphill and just downhill of the fire. The CAFE simulations were not as accurate downhill of the fire as they were uphill.</p>
<p>For the natural-ventilation tests, a false ceiling between the rectangular cross-section roadway and semicircular duct was removed, so the full tunnel cross section was much larger than it was during the forced-ventilation test. The air flowed uphill in the naturally ventilated test. The simulations did not predict the gas temperature or speed as accurately for the naturally ventilated test as was the case for the forced-ventilated test; however, the accuracy of the temperature predictions was on par with that of the FDS.</p>
