<abstract>
<p>‘Microclasses’, detailed occupational groups, have recently been suggested as being the basis of research in social stratification; occupations represent ‘real’ social groups in contrast to the purely ‘nominal’ categories of either ‘big class’ schemata or socio-economic status scales. The microclass approach in social mobility research has been applied in a recent paper, the authors claiming to show that a strong propensity exists for intergenerational occupational inheritance, and that such inheritance is the dominant factor in social reproduction and limits equality of opportunity. We model a larger version of the same Swedish dataset as used by these authors. We show: (i) that while with many occupational groups a marked degree of intergenerational inheritance occurs among men, such inheritance is far less apparent among women, and, for both men and women, accounts for less than half of the total association in the occupational mobility table; (ii) that the microclass approach does not deal in a theoretically consistent way with the remaining associational underlying patterns of occupational mobility, since appeal is made to the theoretically alien idea of ‘socio-economic closeness’; and (iii) that a standard class approach, modified to account for occupational inheritance, can provide a more integrated understanding of patterns of immobility and mobility alike. We also give reasons for doubting whether it will prove possible to establish a theoretically consistent microclass approach to explaining intergenerational mobility propensities. Finally, on the basis of our empirical results and of the relevant philosophical literature, we argue that the microclass approach is unlikely to be helpful in addressing normative questions of equality of opportunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade, David Grusky, together with a number of associates, has argued that if claims of the ‘death of class’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0001699312447633">Kingston, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0001699312447633">Pakulski and Waters, 1996</xref>) are to be effectively resisted, a radical reorientation of class analysis is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0001699312447633">Grusky and Galescu, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699312447633">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0001699312447633">Grusky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0001699312447633">Grusky and Sørensen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312447633">Grusky and Weeden, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0001699312447633">2002</xref>). The ‘big class’ concepts that are typically applied, whether from a neo-Marxist or a neo-Weberian standpoint, have to be recognized as having, at least in modern societies, no more than ‘nominal’ significance. They relate simply to aggregates of individuals allocated to one or other class category according to criteria that are imposed by the analyst rather than mapping out actual socio-cultural entities recognized by and meaningful to their members. ‘Big classes’ therefore provide an inadequate basis for understanding and demonstrating the extent of class-based attitudes and behaviour and forms of collective action. In order for class analysts to overcome this problem and to move towards more ‘realist’ concepts of class, the level of analysis needs to be ‘ratcheted down’ to that of detailed occupational groups occupying specific niches within the division of labour and understood, from a neo-Durkheimian standpoint, as ‘microclasses’. It is only at this level that individuals are brought together at ‘the site of production’, through processes of selection (including self-selection) and socialization, into collectivities with which they can identify and which create among them a sense of a shared way of life and shared interests.</p>
<p>The microclass initiative has already attracted some amount of sceptical commentary relating to theoretical and empirical issues that arise at a rather general level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699312447633">Birkelund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0001699312447633">Brooks and Svallfors, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0001699312447633">Goldthorpe, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699312447633">2007</xref>: vol. 2, ch. 6). In the present article we investigate the suitability of the microclass approach for the analysis of intergenerational social mobility. We do this in relation to, and as a critique of, a recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0001699312447633">2009</xref>) by Jonsson et al. (henceforth JGDPB). As this attempt of theirs follows on from the previous work of Grusky and his associates in a highly consistent way, the analysis we present here necessarily carries wider implications for the microclass approach.</p>
<p>Two rival approaches have for long been established in the field of social mobility research: the ‘gradational’ approach that sees mobility as occurring within a continuous social hierarchy, typically, one of socio-economic status; and the ‘class’ approach that sees mobility as occurring within a discontinuous class structure, with class positions being defined in terms of relations within labour markets and production units. JGDPB question whether these two approaches, even if taken together, can provide an adequate basis for capturing the full extent of the ‘rigidities’ that exist within the mobility regimes of modern societies, or thus for revealing the full extent of inequalities of opportunity. What is overlooked, they maintain, is that it is only at the occupational, or microclass, level that certain mechanisms operate that are crucial to processes of ‘social reproduction’: in particular, the intergenerational transmission of ‘occupation-specific’ human, cultural and social capital and various more institutionalized forms of ‘social closure’. In the gradational approach these mechanisms are left out of account because of the assumption that children have ‘generic access’ to all occupations of similar ranking in the socio-economic hierarchy; and in the class approach, because of the assumption that it is class-linked, rather than occupation-linked, resources and opportunities that predominantly determine mobility chances.</p>
<p>JGDPB then propose, and aim to implement, a new programme for social mobility research based on microclass analysis. We recognize that in this way they are able to add to our knowledge of how occupation-specific processes contribute to intergenerational class immobility. However, while sharing their reservations about the gradational approach, we doubt that their new programme is capable of actually competing with, and perhaps substituting for, the standard class approach. We use a compilation of census data for Sweden in order to scrutinize empirically the application of the microclass approach to the analysis of social mobility in this country – one of the few, we argue, for which datasets can be formed of sufficient size to allow for individuals to be coded to detailed occupational groups as well as to ‘big classes’. The results of our analyses bring out a number of different problems. While a tendency for occupational immobility does show up as between sons and their fathers, this is far less the case as between daughters and their fathers – or as between daughters and their mothers – and even in the case of sons and fathers the tendency for immobility is variable across occupations. Furthermore, this variation is clearly related to father’s class, and as regards individuals’ occupational attainment overall, whether entailing immobility or mobility, this proves to be structured far more by father’s social class than by father’s occupation within a given class. A further focus of our critique is in fact on the failure of exponents of the microclass approach to treat immobility and mobility in a theoretically consistent way. We show how, with our Swedish occupational mobility tables at least, JGDPB would have done better by modelling occupational immobility in conjunction with a model of both immobility and mobility deriving from the class approach than through the hybrid microclass and gradational model that they actually apply, although in neither case are the data of these ‘ratcheted-down’ tables adequately reproduced – a goal which, we argue, microclass analysts are, in principle, unlikely to achieve. Finally, we question certain aspects of the position, deriving from the microclass approach, that JGDPB take up on normative questions of inequality of opportunity (cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0001699312447633">Jonsson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The dataset we use for our analyses of mobility is based on the Swedish censuses of 1960, 1970 and 1990. Our data for children come from the 1990 census and are restricted to men and women born between 1943 and 1960, i.e. aged 30 to 47 in 1990. Our data for the fathers of these individuals, by reference to whom their social origins are determined, come from the 1960 and 1970 censuses, with priority being given to the latest information available. Children and fathers are linked through a multigenerational register based on birth records.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0001699312447633">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We code children and their fathers to an eight-category version of the EGP class schema, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312447633">Table 1</xref>, on the basis of the Nordic classification of occupations, NYK80, a variant of the ISCO 1958 classification. We also use this classification in essentially the same way as JGDPB in order to allocate children and their fathers to occupational groups. However, in quite a number of cases the occupational groups cut across EGP classes, which creates a problem for us in that we want these groups to be perfectly nested within our eight classes. In cases where there were sufficient numbers, we have simply divided the problematic groups so that different sets of their component occupations are included in different classes. In cases where numbers were too small to make this procedure practicable, we have maintained the occupational groups intact and have allocated them to the EGP class appropriate to the majority of their component occupations. In addition, we have modified – that is, slightly extended – the JGDPB occupational groups so as to give greater differentiation in the case of the self-employed. We have created three new groups in order to distinguish, as well as proprietors, self-employed workers in skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled occupations, respectively.</p>

<p>In all, then, we have 108 occupational groups. Our basic data arrays thus take the form of 108 × 108 occupational mobility tables for men and for women, each of which is overlaid by an 8 × 8 class mobility table (for full details on the occupational classification, see Table A1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699312447633">Erikson et al.

<p>Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> is the independence model that postulates no association between child’s and father’s occupational group. We can therefore take the likelihood ratio (G<sup>2</sup>) returned under this model as representing the total association existing between child’s and father’s occupational group, and we are then interested in how far subsequent models can account for this association. We are also interested in how far these models reduce the dissimilarity index (DI) for the independence model – i.e. the percentage of all cases misclassified – and in changes in the BIC statistic.<sup>

<p>Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> is the quasi-independence model that postulates no association between child’s and father’s occupational group except in the 108 cells on the main diagonal of the mobility table, i.e. cells implying intergenerational immobility. These cells are fitted exactly, and thus via this model we give the fullest possible expression to JGDPB’s δ<sup>
<italic>M</italic>
</sup>
<sub>
<italic>ij</italic>
</sub> term. In the case of men, it can be seen that, for the loss of 108 degrees of freedom, a substantial reduction in G<sup>2</sup> is achieved: immobility, or occupational inheritance, can be taken as accounting for about 44 per cent of the total association in the 108 × 108 table. At the same time, the DI falls from 19.4 for the independence model to 15.2. However, in the case of women, the outcome is very different. The reduction in G<sup>2</sup> is only around 14 per cent and the fall in the DI is almost negligible.</p>
<p>These findings then have clearly divergent implications for JGDPB’s arguments. One of their central claims is that a strong propensity for occupational inheritance means that much of what shows up as immobility in intergenerational class mobility tables will in fact be driven by occupation-specific rather than by class-wide factors. This claim finds some support in our results for men but very little in our results for women. JGDPB do indeed recognize that their approach is likely to appear less successful in regard to women’s mobility than to men’s, and they advance two quite different reasons for this (1012–1014). The first is that the extent of occupational sex segregation limits the possibilities for father-to-daughter occupational inheritance. The second is that the datasets so far available that are suitable for microclass analysis rarely contain information on mother’s occupations, which, if available, might reveal occupational inheritance between mothers and daughters at a level similar to that between fathers and sons.</p>
<p>In response, we would make two observations. First, occupational sex segregation is simply a feature of modern societies that any effective approach to the analysis of social mobility must be able to accommodate, and in any event the parameters of a log-linear model do in fact relate to the association in a mobility table net of the differences between the marginal distributions – as between those of the occupations of fathers and daughters. Second, whether considering mother-to-daughter mobility tables would be helpful to JGDPB’s position is an empirical issue that we can in fact address. In the Swedish case, we do have data on mother’s occupation, and in the case of women we can therefore construct a 108 × 108 mobility table in which the origin variable is mother’s occupation in all cases where an occupation is recorded, and father’s occupation otherwise. Fitting Model 2, the quasi-independence model, to this table produces results that are in all respects very similar to those reported for the father–daughter table. The reduction achieved in the total G<sup>2</sup> is 14.9 per cent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0001699312447633">3</xref>
</sup> It thus remains the case, for Swedish women at least, that the argument that seeming class immobility will to a substantial degree be driven by occupation-specific effects has little force.</p>
<p>Moreover, following from the foregoing analyses, another claim made by JGDPB (991) can also be called into question: that is, the claim that ‘the vast majority of association in a mobility table is generated by simple reproduction’, i.e. by immobility. Even with men, where the quasi-independence model accounts for 44 per cent of the total association in the 108 × 108 table, this still means that more than half has to be accounted for in terms of patterns of <italic>mobility</italic>; and with women this proportion increases to over 85 per cent. The further important point that then arises – and that is pursued at length below – is that the success of a new research programme based on microclass analysis must depend on this association deriving from patterns of mobility being also open to explanation <italic>in a way consistent with</italic> <italic>the theoretical thinking on occupation-specific processes that underlies the programme</italic>, as set out in Grusky’s previous work (see, esp., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0001699312447633">Grusky and Weeden, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699312447633">Grusky and Galescu, 2005b</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, it may also be observed here that even if there is what JGDPB call a ‘palisade’ along the main diagonal of occupational mobility tables, ‘protecting occupational positions from intruders’ – or in the case of women more ‘a dilapidated picket fence’ (1013 f.) – much variation still occurs in the height of the individual ‘pales’, i.e. in the propensity for immobility that exists from one occupational group to another. Indeed, JGDBP do at various points acknowledge, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0001699312447633">Grusky and Galescu (2005b)</xref>, that occupations will in fact differ significantly in the extent to which they are ‘real’ social groups with an institutional capacity for ‘closure’. But they do not then offer any systematic treatment of this differentiation, nor consider its relation to class. In order to take these matters further, we have fitted independence and quasi-independence models to separate occupational mobility tables for men and women <italic>in each class of origin</italic>. This allows us, first, to scrutinize heterogeneity in occupational inheritance across classes, and, second, to separate out the effects on child’s occupational attainment of fathers’ occupation and social class, respectively.</p>
<p>From the results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312447633">Table 3</xref>, it can be seen that our previous findings regarding the total association in our 108 × 108 tables that is accounted for by occupational immobility do indeed conceal the fact that much variation is present within classes of origin. Thus, in the 3 × 108 occupational mobility table for men originating in Class IVc, that of farmers, as much as 70 per cent of the association lies in the cells indicating occupational immobility;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0001699312447633">4</xref>
</sup> and in the 23 × 108 table for men originating in Class V+VI, that of technicians, supervisors and skilled manual workers, 63 per cent of the association lies in such cells. However, in the 12 × 108 table for men originating in Class III, that of routine non-manual employees, the corresponding figure is as low as 16 per cent. With women, as would be expected, the importance of immobility is generally much less, and a particularly striking and significant contrast with men arises with those of Class V+VI origin in that now only 14 per cent of the total association lies in cells indicating immobility. This will of course in important part reflect occupational sex segregation, but it has also to be noted that it is among skilled manual workers<italic> in almost exclusively male occupations</italic> that cases of highly developed ‘occupational communities’ have most often been documented (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0001699312447633">Salaman, 1974</xref>). The apparent infrequency of such communities in female dominated occupations could therefore be an important part of the explanation of why bringing mother’s occupation into the analysis may do little to make the microclass approach more applicable in the case of women.</p>

<p>Turning to the contributions of father’s occupation and father’s social class to child’s occupational attainment, our analyses allow us to determine what part of the total association in our 108 × 108 tables derives from the association between father’s occupation and child’s occupation <italic>holding father’s class constant</italic>, and what part from the overall association between father’s <italic>class</italic> and child’s occupation. That is to say, we can partition the G<sup>2 </sup>s for the independence model as fitted to our 108 × 108 tables into two components: (i) that which is the sum of the G<sup>2 </sup>s for the independence model as fitted to each of the eight separate ‘class-of-origin’ occupational mobility tables, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312447633">Table 3</xref>; and (ii) that which is the G<sup>2</sup> for the independence model fitted to a single 8 × 108, father’s class by child’s occupation table.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0001699312447633">5</xref>
</sup> As reported at the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312447633">Table 3</xref>, for fathers and sons the association between their occupations within classes of origin accounts for 35 per cent of the total association in the 108 × 108 table, while the association between father’s class and son’s occupation accounts for 65 per cent; for fathers and daughters the corresponding proportions are 30 per cent and 70 per cent.</p>
<p>These results then serve to confirm our view that an emphasis on the importance of specifically occupational, as distinct from class, effects in intergenerational immobility can easily be exaggerated. Overall, occupational attainment among both men and women alike is structured more by the class positions of their fathers than by the occupations of their fathers within a given class.</p>
<p>Returning now to the main line of our results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref>, we may note that JGDPB do accept (e.g. 1008) that some class immobility effects occur <italic>over and above</italic> occupational immobility effects, and we seek then to capture these effects by means of Model 3. In this model, as well as the main diagonal cells of the 108 × 108 occupational mobility table being fitted exactly, so also are the main diagonal cells of the overlaid 8 × 8 class mobility table. (The non-diagonal cells of the 108 × 108 table falling within each of the diagonal cells of the class mobility table are not themselves fitted exactly, but are rather given a common density parameter.) Now, as can be seen, about 53 per cent of the total association in the men’s 108 × 108 table and 29 per cent of that in the women’s table is accounted for. This is something of an improvement. However, the question still obviously arises of how the substantial degree of association that remains is to be dealt with and, crucially, of how it is to be dealt with from the theoretical position underlying microclass analysis.</p>
<p>In this regard, we note what is, for us, a very strange feature of JGDPB’s general model, as set out above. Although this is explicitly described as a ‘<italic>mobility</italic> model’ (1001, our emphasis) that aims to incorporate simultaneously gradational, class and occupational effects, the only term in the model that relates to mobility as well as immobility is the gradational <italic>φ<sup>uu</sup>
<sub>ij</sub> </italic>term, i.e. no terms are included that aim to capture either class <italic>or</italic> occupational, i.e. for JGDPB, microclass, effects on mobility <italic>per se</italic>. In the spirit of JGDPB’s model, we thus fit to our Swedish data Model 4 in the series of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> which is Model 3 plus the <italic>φ<sup>uu</sup>
<sub>ij</sub>
</italic> gradational term, as implemented, following JGDPB, through the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0001699312447633">Ganzeboom et al., 1992</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0001699312447633">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A further improvement in fit is in this way produced – and especially for women. The proportion of the total association accounted for in the 108 × 108 table for women now approaches a half, while in that for men it is close to two-thirds. Also, the negative BIC statistic is increased substantially in both cases. But what has at the same time to be recognized is that, apart from the model still being far from reproducing the data, the improvement in fit is only achieved through an abandonment of the idea of the occupational specificity of mobility processes and by an appeal instead to the ‘generic’ processes implicit in the gradational approach – one of the two established approaches that JGDPB wish set their own position <italic>against</italic>. In commenting on the general pattern of their comparative results, which are on similar lines to those we obtain for Sweden, JGDPB do indeed state (1011) that as regards the mobility chances of children who exit from their parental microclass, these are primarily shaped by ‘the simple tendency to move to occupations that are socioeconomically close’.</p>
<p>The rather perplexing situation that thus arises – given JGDPB’s apparent ambition to develop a whole new approach to mobility research based on occupation-specific effects – is that they do not even <italic>attempt</italic> to implement this approach in the case of mobility as opposed to immobility. In some seeming awareness of this, they offer various remarks on the possibility that there may be other kinds of affinity existing between occupations apart from that of socio-economic closeness. But the important point remains that these affinities do not figure in their mobility model, nor are they in any way treated in their empirical analyses. Rather, in seeking to account for mobility propensities <italic>per se</italic>, i.e. for association in the off-diagonal cells of the occupational, or, supposedly, microclass, mobility table, JGDPB simply fall back on the gradational approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0001699312447633">
<title>Results – II</title>
<p>As well as having no term that aims to capture occupation-specific effects on mobility, as opposed to immobility, JGDPB’s mobility model, as noted above, also has no term or terms that aim to capture corresponding class effects. However, JGDPB at various points acknowledge (e.g. 985) that some class analysts do aim to model both immobility and mobility processes <italic>together</italic> (as indeed do gradational analysts) and we would in fact regard this as the approach that has been most commonly followed. It is therefore of some interest to take such an approach to our Swedish data. We should stress that we would not expect a model specifically designed to account for <italic>class</italic> mobility to be able to satisfactorily reproduce the data of detailed occupational mobility tables, such as the 108 × 108 tables with which we are concerned here. Indeed, on grounds that we set out later, we would doubt if such tables can be successfully modelled in <italic>any</italic> systematic way. The point of the exercise we undertake is to see how well a theoretically coherent class approach performs in comparison with the theoretically problematic Model 4 on which we have commented above.</p>
<p>The model with which we work is a version of the ‘core model’ of social fluidity, proposed on the basis of the EGP class schema, and with a corresponding theoretical rationale, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699312447633">Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992a</xref>: ch. 4). The model aims to capture the generic pattern of social fluidity found within the class structures of advanced societies in terms of four kinds of effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0001699312447633">7</xref>
</sup> How far these four effects can be differentiated is dependent on the degree of detail in the data to be used. In the case of our Swedish data, we can apply a version of the core model intermediate between that developed in the CASMIN project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0001699312447633">Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992a</xref>) and an extended version that was developed later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312447633">Erikson and Goldthorpe, 1992b</xref>).

<sec id="section6-0001699312447633">
<title>Hierarchy effects</title>
<p>These are effects on fluidity deriving from differences in the general desirability of positions within classes; and further from the relative advantages offered by different classes (e.g. in terms of economic, cultural and social resources) when considered as classes of origin, and from the relative barriers to access to them (e.g. in terms of formal qualifications, skills or capital) when considered as classes of destination. We include four hierarchy effects, HI1–HI4, based on the ordering of our eight classes as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0001699312447633">Table 1</xref>, i.e. by separating Classes I, II, III+IVab, V+VI+IVc and VIIa+VIIb, respectively.

<title>Inheritance effects</title>
<p>These are effects deriving from the special attractiveness to individuals of positions falling within their own class of origin, and further from distinctive opportunities for the inheritance of class positions (e.g. via the transmission of capital or ‘going concerns’ or special skills) or from distinctive constraints on mobility away from classes of origin (e.g. limited opportunities in local labour markets). Three inheritance effects, IN1–IN3, are included to operate in cells on the main diagonal of the class mobility table. IN1 represents a base level for all eight classes, and IN2 and IN3 imply successively increasing propensities for class immobility, with IN2 applying additionally to Classes I and IVc, those of higher-grade professionals and managers and of farmers, and IN3, additionally again, to IVc.<sup>

<title>Sector effects</title>
<p>These are effects deriving from economic divisions that create vertical rather than horizontal, or hierarchical, barriers to mobility (e.g. in that mobility across sectors is likely to require geographical and/or sociocultural relocation). Two sector effects, SE1 and SE2, are included. SE1 operates as between the two classes in the agricultural sector, Classes IVc and VIIb, and all other classes, and SE2 as between the two classes of ‘independents’, Classes IVab and IVc, and all others.</p>

<sec id="section9-0001699312447633">
<title>Affinity and disaffinity effects</title>
<p>These are effects deriving from specific linkages or discontinuities between classes that influence patterns of social fluidity over and above the more generalized hierarchy, inheritance and sector effects. Three such effects, AF1, AF2 and AF4 are included. AF1 is a disaffinity effect representing the exceptional barriers to mobility, in either direction, between Class I and Class VIIb on account of the interaction of hierarchy and sector effects. AF2 represents the affinities existing in the cases of Classes I, II and III on account of their common ‘white-collar’ social status and in the cases of Classes V+VI and VIIa on account of their common ‘blue-collar’ status, which are taken to facilitate fluidity among these classes. AF4 is a further affinity, but of a ‘one-way’ kind, representing the high propensity for mobility from the two agricultural classes, IVc and VIIb, to Class VIIa, that of non-skilled manual workers.<sup>

<p>We may report, first of all, that if the core model, as described above, is fitted to the 8 × 8 class mobility tables that overlie our 108 × 108 occupational mobility tables reasonably satisfactory results are achieved, despite the return of positive BIC statistics. In the case of men, 93.1 per cent of the total association in the table is accounted for and in the case of women 87.6 per cent, while the DIs are quite low at 4.5 and 4.0, respectively. Moreover, the parameter estimates, as reported in the (a) columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0001699312447633">Table 4</xref>, are all significant and take their expected signs.</p>

<p>Our main concern here, however, is with the further results that we report in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref>. Model 5 in this table is simply the core model fitted now to the 108 × 108 mobility tables for men and women. Not surprisingly, while the parameter estimates are the same as when the model is applied to the 8 × 8 class mobility tables, the fit is much worse, even though close to 50 per cent of the total association is accounted for. But Model 5 serves primarily as a basis for introducing Model 6. In this case, we supplement the core model to take account of what we see as JGDPB’s most significant finding: that in the case of men, if not of women, there is a propensity for occupational inheritance that, though variable, is often quite strong. That is to say, we add the quasi-independence model for the 108 × 108 table – Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> – to the core model, to which we have then to make some slight modifications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0001699312447633">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref>, Model 6 makes a big improvement on Model 5 and, more importantly for present purposes, gives a fit to the data of our 108 × 108 tables that proves, and particularly for women, to be better than that of Model 4 while remaining theoretically more coherent. Model 4, as earlier observed, treats mobility – as distinct from immobility – as being determined by the generic effects of socio-economic ‘closeness’ and thus leads JGDPB to diverge from the emphasis on occupation-specific effects that is, theoretically, at the heart of the microclass approach. In contrast, Model 6 treats mobility, and in part also immobility, through the core model and thus consistently with the standard class approach<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0001699312447633">12</xref>
</sup> – although with due recognition also being given, in the case of a detailed occupational mobility table, to immobility as created by occupation-specific in addition to class-wide effects.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that Model 6 does better than Model 4 without the need for a gradational socio-economic effect, it is of some further interest to see how far Model 6 can itself be improved by, in Model 7, introducing such an effect, i.e. by means of the ISEI association term as included in Model 4. As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref>, some further improvement is achieved but, for men and women alike, of only a rather meagre kind. In other words, the core model would appear to capture within a coherent class perspective a large amount of what within a gradational perspective would be seen as socio-economic ‘closeness’. The indication then is that in their comparative analyses JGDPB might have done better by combining their microclass approach with a standard class approach rather than, anomalously, with the gradational approach.</p>
<p>Finally, though, what has once again to be recognized is that none of the models represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> comes at all close to giving a good fit to the data of our 108 × 108 occupational mobility tables. Even when, as in Model 7, terms are included to capture occupational inheritance effects plus class and socio-economic status effects on both immobility and mobility, still over 30 per cent of the total association in the tables is unaccounted for and DIs of more than 11 for men and more than 9 for women are returned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0001699312447633">13</xref>
</sup> For adherents of the standard class approach to social mobility research, this need be of no great concern. Their focus is on mobility among what JGDPB would call ‘big classes’ rather than among microclasses or, that is, detailed occupational groups. The one qualification to their position that is suggested is that they should accept JGDPB’s observation that, with men, some non-negligible part of class immobility is likely to be the product of occupation-specific rather than class-wide effects. However, for JGDPB themselves the situation is far more serious for reasons on which we elaborate in the following section.</p>

<sec id="section10-0001699312447633">
<title>The problem of mobility in microclass analyses</title>
<p>If the case is to be made out for ‘ratcheting down’ the analysis of social mobility to the level of occupational groups in order to give due recognition to social processes determining mobility chances that operate only at this level, then it is clearly not enough for analyses to focus on occupational immobility, or inheritance, alone. The microclass approach must also be able to account for mobility. And simply to revert in this case to the gradational approach and invoke generic socio-economic status effects, as JGDPB do, can scarcely be regarded as satisfactory. The major challenge that microclass analysts must face up to is to show how occupation-specific effects determine propensities for occupational inheritance <italic>and</italic> for intergenerational mobility among occupations alike</p>
<p>As earlier noted, JGDPB do from time to time show an awareness of this issue and raise the possibility that occupational affinities might be identified that structure mobility, apart from that of socio-economic closeness. Thus, at one point, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0001699312447633">Hout (1988)</xref>, they suggest (991) that occupations might in some way be scaled by the kinds of skills or of cultural capital or social networks that are distinctively associated with them, with the expectation that mobility between occupations would then be greater, the closer they were according to such scaling. However, this idea is not taken further.</p>
<p>Instead, at a later point, JGDPB (1012) proceed more empirically by examining residuals under their basic mobility model for clues as to occupational affinities that might serve their theoretical purposes. They do in fact note a number instances of ‘excess exchange’ that, they appear to believe, could be of wider significance. For example, excess intergenerational mobility shows up between the categories of ships officers and fishermen – suggesting a sea-faring affinity; between those of health professionals and semi-professionals – suggesting a health sector affinity; between those of authors and librarians – suggesting a literary affinity; and between those of accountants and bookkeepers – suggesting a financial sector affinity. Again, though, JGDPB do not pursue the possibilities they raise – and perhaps wisely so. What it would seem they are in effect envisaging here is a return to the long-forgotten concept of ‘situs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699312447633">Morris and Murphy, 1959</xref>), relating to a form of ‘horizontal’ occupational differentiation, orthogonal to that of socio-economic status. However, this is a concept that appears never to have paid off empirically, whether in the study of social mobility or otherwise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0001699312447633">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In sum, JGDPB do very little to show how in microclass analyses it is possible to bring out occupation-specific effects in regard to mobility as well as to immobility. And this then raises another possibility that, we believe, has to be seriously considered: namely, that a detailed occupational mobility table, unlike a class mobility table, is not in fact open to successful modelling in <italic>any</italic> systematic way. This is because, as the degree of detail – of ratcheting down – increases, the content of such a table is increasingly likely to express mere happenstance rather than the effects of any regularly operating factors: that is, instances of mobility that are <italic>highly specific to time and place</italic> as, say, in resulting from the shifting conditions of local labour markets – the very particular constraints and opportunities that come and go as these markets adjust to wider cyclical or structural economic change.<sup>

<title>Normative issues</title>
<p>JGDPB regard the microclass approach to social mobility research as marking an advance on the gradational or standard class approaches not just in revealing hitherto unappreciated sources of the structuring of mobility propensities but further in throwing new light on normative issues of equality of opportunity. In this respect also we find their arguments in various respects unconvincing.</p>
<p>Social reproduction, JGDPB write, ‘can in large part be equated with inequality of opportunity’ (979), and this, they claim, is just as true of reproduction in the form of occupational inheritance as in the form of status or class inheritance. In the end, ‘all ascriptive constraints on choice, even those pertaining to purely horizontal inequalities, are inconsistent with a commitment to an open society’ (1023).</p>
<p>We find this argument difficult to understand and, even as best we can interpret it, still inadequate. Difficulties of understanding arise on account of the concept of ‘horizontal inequalities’ which seems oxymoronic. However, even if we suppose that what JGDPB wish to refer to here is simply occupational <italic>differentiation</italic>, their argument, as it stands, is incomplete. In philosophical discussion of the principle of equality of opportunity, the possibility is indeed recognized that this principle may be contravened even where the positions that individuals should have equal opportunity to achieve are not themselves unequal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0001699312447633">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>: Appendix E). But what has to be made out is a rather special case: namely, that inequality arises <italic>in individuals’ chances for self-fulfilment</italic>, that is, for present purposes, in their chances of entering an occupation which they wish to enter and in which, they believe, their particular human potentialities could be most fully realized. However, JGDPB do not present any case of this kind. They simply demonstrate a statistical disparity in the form of the high propensity for occupational inheritance and then <italic>assume </italic>that this is essentially a matter of lack of opportunity or, in other words, of constraint. Chance in the sense of ‘statistical probability’ is confounded with chance in the sense of ‘opportunity set’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699312447633">Swift, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In some particular circumstances, we would accept that JGDPB’s assumption might be reasonable: for example, where a high level of occupational inheritance results from local labour markets being dominated by one industry and the occupations associated with it – as in the ‘isolated mass’ situations of coal miners, loggers or in some cases textile workers, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0001699312447633">Kerr and Siegel (1954)</xref>. But, more generally, the question of whether children follow in their parents’ occupational footsteps on account of constraint rather than of their own preferences is a far more complex one. At certain points (e.g. 988 f.), JGDPB do indeed emphasize that children ‘cathect’ with their parents and thus tend to view their occupations in a favourable light, even if they are relatively disadvantaged ones. But, rather than accepting that where children then enter these same occupations, this may be because they actually want to do so – and as perhaps their best way of pursuing self-fulfilment – JGDPB always come back to their underlying position: ‘Even though some reproduction may partly be due to differences in taste … we nonetheless refer to it as “inequality” <italic>under the assumption</italic> that tastes are themselves largely endogenous’ (979, our emphasis). In other words, tastes, as they result, say, from parental socialization, are constraints on the individual of just another kind, and <italic>all</italic> choice must be regarded as essentially ‘adaptive’. Thus, for JGDPB, a mobility table would indicate a genuine equality of opportunity only if the independence model fitted: <italic>any</italic> departure from ‘perfect mobility’ has, by fiat, to be seen as incompatible with ‘a commitment to an open society’. However, the serious philosophical difficulties that arise in taking perfect mobility as a benchmark for the assessment of equality of opportunity, even where mobility is understood as ‘vertical’, have been well set out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0001699312447633">Swift (2004</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0001699312447633">Roemer, 2004</xref>), and are only compounded where ‘horizontal’ mobility is involved.</p>
<p>JGDPB do in fact seem to have some awareness that their stance here is a precarious one and seek to strengthen it with a further argument. They note (1023) that it may be ‘tempting’ to suggest that ‘the extreme microclass inequalities uncovered … are not all that objectionable’ and that it may be asked whether one should care all that much if the child of a truck driver has a special propensity to become a truck driver while the child of a gardener has a special propensity to become a gardener. Their answer is that one should care, because, even if one is not impressed by their position on ‘horizontal inequalities’, one should recognize that such inequalities ‘contribute directly to the perpetuation of vertical ones’. The propensity for occupational immobility within occupational groups such as truck drivers and gardeners matters if not because they are ‘crucially different in their relative attractiveness’ but because ‘microclass immobility of this sort is the principal mechanism ensuring that the working class reproduces itself’ (1023 f.).</p>
<p>Again, though, we do not find JGDPB’s argument at all compelling. It relies on the very questionable supposition that if fewer children of truck drivers became truck drivers and fewer children of gardeners, gardeners, then those who escaped from occupational ‘closure’ would move up out of the working class rather than entering other working-class occupations. However, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0001699312447633">Table 3</xref> above shows that in accounting for the total association in our Swedish occupational mobility tables, the association between father’s class and child’s occupation is in fact around twice as important as the association between father’s and child’s occupations given father’s class. Indeed, JGDPB’s argument would make more sense if stood on its head, i.e. if it were held that it is the inequalities of opportunity for attaining more advantaged class positions that working-class children face that promote occupational immobility within the working class. Where it is apparent to working-class children that their chances of upward mobility are slight – on account, say, of their relatively poor academic attainments - then it may well make sense for them to exploit any occupation-specific forms of human, cultural and social ‘capital’ that they can acquire from their family and to follow in their family’s occupational tradition – if it has one – rather than seeking to move into some other occupation within the working class (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0001699312447633">Goldthorpe, 2007</xref>: vol. 2, 173 f.). That is to say, occupation-specific effects would be better understood as subordinate to, and conditional on, class effects.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Grusky’s proposal for the ‘ratcheting down’ of class analysis to the level of microclasses, or, in other words, to that of detailed occupational groups, finds an important expression in JGDPB’s article. The authors’ aim would appear to be that of presenting the microclass analysis of social mobility not as in some way supplementary to the established gradational and class approaches but rather as a fully-fledged competitor with them. They focus on ‘social reproduction’, i.e. on <italic>im</italic>mobility, and in this regard, as we recognize, they have one good point to make, even if they exaggerate its quantitative importance and especially in regard to women: namely, that at the level of occupations quite strong propensities for inheritance may exist, so that some part of what in the standard class approach would be treated as class immobility in fact results from occupation-specific rather than from class-wide effects. However, the main aim of our critique has been to bring out the seriousness of the problems for the microclass analysis of mobility that JGDPB’s article leaves unresolved, and indeed largely unaddressed, and that thus stand in the way of the realization of their larger ambitions.</p>
<p>The nub of the matter is this. The class approach to mobility research that we would ourselves favour – and likewise the gradational approach – aims to model propensities for <italic>both</italic> immobility and mobility simultaneously and on the same theoretical basis. However, while within their proposed new approach JGDPB have developed a theoretical basis for understanding immobility at least to some extent, i.e. in terms of occupationally specific resources, occupational closure, etc. – they have not shown how their approach might be extended to the treatment of mobility as distinct from immobility. In the ‘mobility model’ they present in their article, the only term relating to mobility <italic>per se</italic> is in fact the gradational <italic>φ<sup>uu</sup>
<sub>ij</sub>
</italic> term which would seem theoretically anomalous given their emphasis on occupation-specific as opposed to generic socio-economic status effects in shaping mobility propensities. And in turn in their empirical analyses, JGDPB can only treat these propensities as a matter of socio-economic closeness – a difficulty on which they opt not to comment. Moreover, our own analyses of Swedish mobility tables reveal that this difficulty is likely to be a major one. In the first set of results we report, we show that adding the ISEI association term to a model incorporating maximum occupational and class immobility effects does give an improvement in fit, but that still with this theoretically incongruous model, a third of the total association in the table for men and a half in that for women remains unaccounted for. The crucial question facing JGDPB is then that of how this remaining association, in the off-diagonal cells of the tables, is to be dealt with.</p>
<p>In our second set of results, we further show that a class approach via the core model of social fluidity, supplemented by the occupational immobility effect, gives a better fit than the model with the ISEI association term while retaining greater theoretical consistency. But even so, as would be expected with a model designed to account for class rather than for detailed occupational mobility, the fit remains far from good. And again the point that is underlined is that if JGDPB are to justify their ratcheting down of mobility analysis to the occupational level, they need to find factors patterning mobility propensities at this level, i.e. below that of classes, and ones that are distinct from, and more powerful than, that simply of socio-economic closeness.</p>
<p>In this regard, JGDPB put forward some ideas, derived from inspection of residuals under their mobility model, that would in effect appear to hark back to the concept of situs. However, they do not then set these ideas to work, and we have indicated grounds for supposing that they would not in fact prove to be very productive. The major challenge for JGDPB thus remains. Having proposed the ratcheting down of mobility analyses to the occupational level, they have usefully drawn attention to processes creating immobility, chiefly in the case of men, that other approaches overlook; but they then need to identify analogous occupation-specific processes generating and structuring mobility. This they have so far failed to do, and there are reasons for believing that it may not in fact be possible: in this sense, there may well be no way back up from ratcheting down.</p>
<p>The deficiencies we have revealed in JGDPB’s attempt to apply the microclass approach to the analysis of intergenerational social mobility then lead on to larger questions concerning not only the viability of, but also the need for, the entire project of salvaging class analysis through in effect ignoring what occupations within a class have in common, as regards the relations in which their members are involved in labour markets and production units, and concentrating instead on their particularities. Occupation, we would agree, can provide a useful basis for the understanding of many social processes and outcomes in modern societies. But as regards issues of social stratification, social mobility and inequality of opportunity, it is class that, at both a conceptual and empirical level, has to be regarded as dominant. This becomes most apparent once ‘social reproduction’ is understood not in the limited sense of intergenerational immobility, as favoured by JGDPB, but rather as referring to persisting patterns of intergenerational immobility <italic>and mobility. </italic>Class analysis, as exemplified by our application of the core model, may not capture many of the highly specific processes that are involved in occupational mobility – processes that often reflect simply social differentiation rather than social stratification – but neither, as we have shown, does the microclass approach, despite its theoretical focus on these processes; and in class analysis, in contrast to microclass analysis as represented by JGDPB, immobility and mobility are at all events treated together in a coherent way. Moreover, we have also shown that insofar as individuals’ detailed occupational attainment is open to systematic analysis, it proves to be structured far more by father’s class position than by father’s occupation within a given class, and in turn that tendencies for occupational immobility within less advantaged classes are far more plausibly understood as following from, rather than as creating, class immobility and related restrictions on opportunity. In sum, the analysis of occupational mobility can, at best, supplement that of class mobility, not replace it – and even if occupations are collectivities with which individuals more readily identify than with classes. Grusky’s distinction between ‘nominalist’ and ‘realist’ conceptions would seem in this connection to be rather beside the point: nominal classes are real enough in their consequences.</p>

<p>JGDPB use a random sample of the same database, while they also analyse data from the United States, Germany and Japan. However, we restrict our analyses to Sweden since we in fact believe that it is only in this case that JGDPB’s analyses are likely to be free of potentially serious problems of sparsity in the mobility tables they use, although these problems are concealed in that their analyses are based on the pooled data for all four of the countries they consider. For the US, the German and the Japanese mobility tables that they construct, the average cell counts are, respectively, 6.9, 1.9 and 1.3 for men and 1.8, 0.9 and 0.6 for women (as compared with the averages for Sweden of 27.0 and 26.0) and it may therefore be supposed that many zero cells exist. As an experiment, we undertook (with generous help from Reinhard Pollak) similar analyses to those we report below for Sweden using the German microclass mobility table for men. The results, available on request, are highly anomalous and indicate that sparsity, in the off-diagonal cells, is indeed a problem. For example, with a 97 x 97 table and an N of 12,178, the quasi-independence model returns a likelihood ratio of 7994 which is much smaller than the degrees of freedom of 9119 while the DI is as large as 26.0.

<p>A high propensity for occupational immobility in this instance is scarcely surprising. In addition to any socio-cultural influences of the kind that JGDPB would wish to highlight, the intergenerational transmission of land as a form of fixed capital – more a class effect than an occupationally specific one – and geographical constraints are also likely to be involved.</p>

<p>The results of fitting this model are available from the authors on request. The partitioning can be understood in the following way. We model the association in a table of 108 x 108 = 11,664 cells. The 108 origin occupations are nested within eight class origins. Thus, we have in effect a three-way table of class origin by occupational origin by occupational destination. Three models of independence can be set up.

<p>where i refers occupational origin, j to occupational destination and k to class origin. Model (1) is the independence model for the full table, model (2) refers to the eight independence models for each class origin, and model (3) is the independence model for class origins by occupational destinations. Models (2) and (3) can be regarded as nested within model (1), with the consequence that the G<sup>2 </sup>for model (1) can be partitioned into the G<sup>2 </sup>s for models (2) and (3), if model (3) is fitted to a table of class origin by occupational destination with 8 ×108 cells.

<p>As well as being used in Erikson and Goldthorpe’s own work, as cited, the model has been applied in much other comparative mobility research as, for example, by contributors to the collections edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0001699312447633">Breen (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0001699312447633">Ishida (2008)</xref>.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0001699312447633">

<p>In other words, all ‘1s’ in the design matrices of Table A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0001699312447633">Erikson et al., 2012</xref>) imply an additive contribution to the expected log frequencies under the model. For example, in the case of a move from Class I to Class VIIb, all four hierarchy effects have to be included, together with, as explained further below, a sector and a disaffinity effect.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0001699312447633">
<label>9.</label>
<p>In the version of the core model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312447633">Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992b</xref>), the IN2 term was also included in the diagonal cell for Class IVa, that of small employers. However, since in the present dataset we cannot distinguish between Class IVa and Class IVb, that of self-employed workers, we do not include the IN2 term in the diagonal cell for these combined classes.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn10-0001699312447633">

<p>The AF3 term in the version of the core model in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0001699312447633">Erikson and Goldthorpe (1992b</xref>) involves Class IVa and has to be omitted here in view of the fact that, as referred to in the preceding note, we cannot separate Class IVa from Class IVb.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn11-0001699312447633">
<label>11.</label>
<p>Fitting exactly the cell in the 108 x 108 table that indicates immobility among farmers means fitting almost exactly (almost, because Class IVc includes in addition to farmers small numbers of other self-employed workers in primary production) the cell indicating immobility among farmers in the class mobility table, i.e. the IVc–IVc cell. We need therefore to drop from the core model the IN3 term which applies solely to this cell and in turn to include zeros rather than ones for this cell in the design matrices for the IN1 and IN2 terms.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn12-0001699312447633">
<label>12.</label>
<p>It may be observed from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0001699312447633">Table 4</xref> that the parameter estimates of the core model under Model 6 – the (b) column estimates – are little different, except of course in the case of the modified IN parameters, from those under Model 5 or when the core model is fitted to the 8 x 8 class mobility table.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn13-0001699312447633">

<p>It should be noted that in their comparative analyses JGDPB likewise fail to produce well-fitting models of the detailed occupational mobility tables with which they work; see, e.g., their <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0001699312447633">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>We have in fact checked whether the fit of the models of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0001699312447633">Table 2</xref> could be improved by including a measure of occupational situs, based on the categories proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0001699312447633">Morris and Murphy (1959)</xref>. The improvement achieved is minimal. Details of our analysis are available on request.</p>

<p>For example, although the evidence comes from journalistic accounts rather than academic social research, it seems that after the collapse of the British coal mining industry in the later 1980s, the occupations that the sons of former miners most often took up, when they could no longer follow in their fathers’ footsteps, were those of lorry or van driver, food factory operative or security guard – clearly not because of any affinity with coal-mining but simply because these were the occupations most readily available.</p>
