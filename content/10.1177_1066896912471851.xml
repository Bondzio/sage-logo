<abstract>
<p>Metastases to cervical lymph nodes (LNs) are an important independent adverse indicator in the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). An accurate evaluation of molecular patterns favoring the metastatic process can be helpful in predicting cases of OSCC with elevated probability of early or late metastases and, moreover, in planning the proper therapeutic procedures before surgery. To this end, immunohistochemical expressions of both E-cadherin and podoplanin were evaluated on preoperative incisional biopsies of OSCC from 102 patients. The probability to have or develop metastases was very low when high E-cadherin expression was found in a preoperative sample or when a low podoplanin expression was found. Therefore, because of the strong association with LN metastases, high E-cadherin/low podoplanin immunohistochemical expression should also be assessed on preoperative incisional biopsies as a useful tool for evaluating the probability of early or late LN metastases of OSCCs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oral cancer is an important health issue with more than 36 000 annual new cases, representing 2.4% of all newly diagnosed tumors and responsible for approximately 1.4% of cancer related deaths per year in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912471851">1</xref></sup> Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common cancer of the oral cavity for which preoperative incisional biopsy is widely used to allow a correct diagnosis and management.</p>
<p>Metastases to cervical lymph nodes (LNs) are an important independent adverse prognostic indicator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912471851">2</xref></sup> Primary OSCCs harboring metastases have shown gene expression profiles different from OSCCs without metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912471851">3</xref></sup> Therefore, an accurate evaluation of genetic alterations favoring the metastatic process can be helpful in predicting cases of OSCC with an elevated probability of early or late metastases.</p>
<p>For this purpose, in the past decade, several studies investigated and identified alterations underlying the biology of the disease by evaluating the expressions of single genetic or immunohistochemical markers, including cadherins, p63, and podoplanin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912471851">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To date, all the studies have focused on tissue samples obtained after complete surgical resection of OSCCs. Therefore, the data currently published, even if they are important to evaluate the prognosis of OSCC, are not useful in the correct planning of surgical management of the patient. Specifically, in OSCCs diagnosed at an early stage, it would be important to find prognostic parameters to correctly evaluate the metastatic potential on incisional biopsies performed preoperatively in order to avoid unnecessary neck dissection.</p>
<p>For this reason, we performed a preliminary evaluation of several immunohistochemical markers and a review of the literature. Among the various immunohistochemical markers that demonstrated a prognostic impact on OSCCs, E-cadherin and podoplanin were selected.</p>
<p>E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cell-to-cell adhesion, together with β-catenin. Indeed, loss of E-cadherin expression is a frequent event in various types of cancers and has been associated with tumor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912471851">5</xref></sup> Moreover, in OSCC, reduction of E-cadherin expression proportionally correlates with invasion and favors the appearance of metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912471851">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912471851"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912471851"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912471851">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, podoplanin is specifically expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells but not in blood endothelial cells and has been used as a specific marker for recognizing lymphatic vessels. Podoplanin expression in neoplastic cells seems to appear in tumor lesions with higher invasive and metastatic potential. It has been reported that podoplanin is frequently expressed in OSCCs, and a high expression of such protein is significantly associated with LN metastasis and poor prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912471851">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912471851">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate immunohistochemical expressions of both E-cadherin and podoplanin in preoperative incisional biopsies of OSCCs to determine if they can be useful to preoperatively assess the risk of presenting or developing cervical LN metastases and to estimate disease-free survival.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1066896912471851">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Cases were retrieved from the files of the Departments of Pathology of the Universities of Parma and Bologna, at Bellaria Hospital. All patients had undergone complete surgical resection of OSCC by 3 teams of maxillo-facial surgeons with specific experience in oral oncology, applying the same surgical protocols, and working at the Universities of Parma and Bologna at S Orsola Hospital and at the Bellaria General Hospital of Bologna. Cases were selected in the period 1998-2010.</p>
<p>Criteria of inclusion were the following: in all the cases, a preoperative incisional biopsy had been performed; all cases were primary lesions staged as T1 or T2 (according to the criteria proposed by the American Joint Cancer Committee in 2010)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912471851">12</xref></sup> and not previously treated with adjuvant therapy; in all the cases, cervical LN level 1 had been removed at the time of surgery; cases had been followed up for not less than 9 months after surgery. In all cases, complete surgical removal of the tumor was performed within 30 days from the preoperative biopsy. No radiotherapy or chemotherapy was performed in the cases under study. Cases staged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912471851">12</xref></sup> as T3 or T4 were excluded because in these latter cases, the risk of LN metastasis is high as a result of the dimensions of the tumor.</p>
<p>Tissue sampling, histological diagnoses, and staging were carried out according to previously published guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912471851">11</xref></sup> All cases were reviewed, and grading was performed on preoperative biopsies according to the criteria defined by Kademani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912471851">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and routinely processed. Immunostaining was performed on 2-µm-thick sections, from paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue blocks of preoperative incisional biopsies, mounted on positively charged glass slides. Briefly, dewaxing and antigen retrieval were obtained using W-CAP TEC BUFFER pH 8 (Bio-Optica, Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc, Fremont, CA) at 98°C for 25 minutes. Inhibition of endogenous peroxidases was performed in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution, and the slides were subsequently rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline solution 1X with 0.01% of detergent Tween-20 (PBS 1X-Tween). All the following incubation steps were performed in a humid chamber at room temperature. Sections were incubated for 5 minutes with Ultra V Block solution (Ultravision LP, LabVision Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Fremont, CA) and then washed in PBS 1X-Tween. They were subsequently incubated for 1 hour with specific primary antibody and rinsed in PBS 1X-Tween. Sections were further incubated with primary antibody enhancer solution (Ultravision LP, LabVision Corporation) for 20 minutes. After several washes in PBS 1X-Tween, sections were incubated for 30 minutes with horse radish peroxide–polymer solution (Ultravision LP, LabVision Corporation). The reaction was revealed with diaminobenzidine solution for 3 minutes and counterstained with hematoxylin. The following antibodies were used: antihuman podoplanin monoclonal antibody (dilution 1:50; UCS Diagnostic S.r.l., 00067 Morlupo, Rome, Italy), which recognizes podoplanin, and monoclonal anti E-cadherin (clone NCH-38, diluted 1:50; Dako, Carpintera, CA). Podoplanin expression in lymphatic endothelial cells in the stroma and E-cadherin expression in squamous or glandular epithelium served as positive internal controls.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical Evaluation</title>
<p>Podoplanin and E-cadherin immunostaining were considered positive when the cytoplasmic membrane was stained. The number of carcinomatous cells per field varied, depending on the cellular density of the tumor, degree of keratin formation, and presence of desmoplastic stroma. In general, the number of neoplastic cells ranged from 200 to 400 cells per high-power field (400× magnification). Evaluation was performed by counting the percentage of positive neoplastic cells in 5 to 10 different fields at 400× magnification. Care was taken to count a mean of 2000 tumor cells per case (range = 1000-3000). In addition, counting was performed in areas presenting nests of neoplastic cells that were podoplanin positive and/or E-cadherin negative, according to Kreppel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912471851">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>All cases were independently reviewed by 2 investigators (MPF, GM) who were blinded to the follow-up. Immunohistochemical evaluation discrepancies were resolved by discussing the cases.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066896912471851">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify indicators for positive LN at the time of surgery; independent variables included gender, age (≤63 vs &gt;63 years old), T score, grade, primary localization, recurrence presence, podoplanin (≤20% vs &gt;20%), E-cadherin (≤70% vs &gt;70%), and the podoplanin/E-cadherin association. High podoplanin and low E-cadherin association was defined to indicate a poor prognosis profile, whereas low podoplanin and high E-cadherin association indicated a good prognosis profile.</p>
<p>The patient’s age, gender, T score, grade, primary localization, presence of recurrence, podoplanin staining (&lt;20% vs &gt;20%), E-cadherin staining (&lt;70% vs &gt;70%), and the association between high podoplanin/low E-cadherin were further analyzed for their relationship with the patient’s outcome during the follow-up. Survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was evaluated using the log-rank test. Time was defined as the period between treatment and the target event (LN metastasis) or last follow-up. <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered to be statistically significant in all analyses.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-1066896912471851" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 102 patients were enrolled in the study; 42 patients were women aged 25 to 93 years (mean = 67.5 years) and 60 were men aged 25 to 83 years (mean = 59.6 years). Follow-up varied from 9 to 120 months (mean = 29.1 months).</p>
<p>At the time of surgery, LN metastases were present in 32 patients. Moreover, 9 patients developed LN metastases within 25 months from surgery (mean = 8.8 months).</p>
<p>Recurrence or second primary tumors were observed in 13 cases, 7 of which developed distant metastases. The remaining patients were alive and well 9 to 120 months postsurgery (mean = 30.8 months) at the last follow-up.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemical positivity for E-cadherin ranged from 5% to 90% in the neoplastic cells of different cases. Although a relationship between positive LN at the time of surgery and E-cadherin did not reach statistical significance by univariate logistic regression, the risk of LN metastases at presentation increased from 22.9% in cases with E-cadherin expression in &gt;70% of the neoplastic cells to 35.8% in cases showing a lower E-cadherin expression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study indicates that the values of prognostic parameters in preoperative incisional biopsies can be indicative of the metastatic potential of OSCC.</p>
<p>Low E-cadherin expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry on preoperative incisional biopsies is related to the frequency of LN metastases at presentation and appearance of lymph node metastases during follow-up. Our results, together with the data published in the literature, provide strong evidence for the prognostic impact of E-cadherin expression, suggesting that E-cadherin immunohistochemical evaluation may be used in routine diagnoses to better predict the possibility of OSCCs to develop LN metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912471851">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is known that downregulation of E-cadherin expression is often caused by methylation of CpG sites at the promoter region of E-cadherin. Indeed, altered methylation patterns have been found in primary OSCCs as well as in their corresponding metastatic LNs and recurrent tumors, and E-cadherin downregulation caused by hypermethylation has a significant negative effect on the survival of surgically treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912471851">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, several studies have shown how a low expression of E-cadherin is strongly related both to metastases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912471851">7</xref></sup> as well as to local recurrences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912471851">15</xref></sup> if compared with tumors with high expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912471851">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912471851">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, most studies evaluated E-cadherin expression on samples obtained from the primary OSCCs only after surgical excision of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912471851">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912471851"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912471851"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912471851">18</xref></sup> In the present series, the immunostaining of E-cadherin was assessed on preoperative incisional biopsies in order to correlate the immunohistochemical expression with the presence of LN metastases and early recurrence and to evaluate the predictive value of such an early diagnostic procedure.</p>
<p>In the present study, E-cadherin expression was found to be low (as ≤70%) in 24 of 32 cases with LN metastases at the time of surgery and in 8/9 cases with LN metastases developed within 25 months of follow-up, showing a negative predictive value (NPV) of 77.1% and 97.1%, respectively. This means that when a high E-cadherin expression is found in a preoperative sample, the probability that the patient has or will develop metastases is very low.</p>
<p>Podoplanin is abnormally expressed in the early oral tumorigenesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912471851">19</xref></sup> and the level of podoplanin expression in tumor cells has been shown to be a reliable parameter to predict the appearance of LN metastases, exhibiting a significant prognostic impact on both disease-specific survival and overall survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912471851">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Podoplanin seems to play an important role in lymphatic spread by promoting tumor cell motility and increasing tumor progression and metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912471851">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yuan and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912471851">10</xref></sup> evaluated podoplanin immunostaining in 35 head and neck and in 60 oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas and found high expression in 20 and 36 cases, respectively. Moreover, high levels of podoplanin were statistically significantly related to a higher rate of LN metastasis and to a shorter disease-specific survival. Similarly, Kreppel and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912471851">11</xref></sup> examined the immunohistochemical levels of podoplanin in 80 patients with OSCCs and correlated them with several clinicopathological parameters; the authors concluded that high podoplanin expression was statistically associated with cervical LN metastases and lower overall survival.</p>
<p>Previously, similar to E-cadherin, podoplanin staining was assessed on OSCCs only after surgical excision of the tumors. However, we evaluated podoplanin expression on preoperative incisional biopsies and propose this as another reliable parameter for predicting the appearance of metastases or early recurrence. In addition, the present study has focused on T1 and T2 cases, excluding T3 and T4 cases, because in the latter cases, the dimensions of the tumor are directly related to the risk of LN metastases.</p>
<p>Our results showed high podoplanin expression (as present in &gt;20% of the neoplastic cells) in 18 of 32 cases with LN metastases at the time of surgery and in 7/9 cases with LN metastases that developed within 25 months of follow-up, showing a NPV of 76.7% and 96.3%, respectively. This means that when a low podoplanin expression is found in a preoperative sample, the probability that the patient has or will develop metastases is very low. Furthermore, among 26 T1 cases with low podoplanin expression, none developed LN metastases.</p>
<p>Grouping the 2 parameters (high expression of podoplanin and E-cadherin loss), an elevated predictive prognostic parameter of lymph node metastases is obtained. In the population study, the poor prognosis profile expression was observed in 33 patients, 15 of whom showed LN metastases at the time of surgery. The positive predictive value was 45.5%, and the NPV was 80.8% for this combination of the 2 parameters. Furthermore, 6/31 (19.4%) cases with poor prognosis profile developed LN metastases during follow-up. In contrast, no LN metastases appeared during follow-up in the cases with good prognosis profiles, making the predictive value of a good prognosis profile almost 100%.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present data give further evidence of the strong association between low E-cadherin/high podoplanin expression values and the presence of lymph node metastases. Such an association can also be assessed on preoperative incisional biopsies, making it a useful tool for evaluating the probability of early or late LN metastases of OSCCs. Moreover, such an early diagnostic procedure may be clinically useful in therapeutic planning and to identify cases that should undergo elective neck dissection.</p>
