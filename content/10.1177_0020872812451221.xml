<title>IASSW and Social Work Development in Indonesia, Vietnam and China</title>
<p>Social work is undergoing phenomenal development in Indonesia, Vietnam and China and the International Association of Schools of Social Work (IASSW) are pleased to have the opportunity to involve in the process and to provide capacity building programmes in these countries.</p>
<p>In line with the mission of IASSW “to develop and promote excellence in social work education, research and scholarship globally in order to enhance human well being” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iassw-aiets.org">www.iassw-aiets.org</ext-link>), we have taken active steps to respond to the dynamic development of social work education in these countries and to provide capacity building activities, programme consultations and reviews, and exchange opportunities for local stakeholders. We endeavour to be culturally sensitive in our approach, and we work in close partnership with local and regional associations, while offering the uniquely international perspectives that can be drawn from the global standards and international membership of the IASSW.</p>

<title>Social Work Development in Indonesia</title>
<p>Social work in Indonesia took a great leap forward in 2009 with the passing of Law 11 which established a Social Work Certification Body and an Accreditation Body for Social Welfare Institutions. The Indonesian Social Work Consortium, which consists of three spheres of membership – social work education (IPPSI), practice (IPSPI), and social welfare (DNIKS), was formed thereafter to spearhead the professional development of social work in the country. The Indonesian Association of Social Work Education has 35 school members and it has taken an active role in organizing curriculum development programmes and training workshops on the national core curriculum for social work educators from all over Indonesia.</p>
<p>In response to the rapid development of social work education in Indonesia and the need for international support for social workers in the country, the IASSW held its recent board meeting in Jakarta in January 2012 and jointly organized a three-day capacity building workshop together with the Asian and Pacific Association for Social Work Education (APASWE) for Indonesian social work educators on the theme “Social Work Education in Indonesia: Indigenous and International Perspectives, Dilemmas and Challenges”. The programme was supported by the Ministry of Social Affairs and hosted by the Department of Social Welfare of the University of Indonesia. Around seventy participants from 22 schools and universities from all over Indonesia plus 20 IASSW Board members participated in the workshop and the response was extremely positive. The workshop is only the beginning of a series of capacity building events to be organized in the country and plans are being made to continue the effort.</p>

<title>Social Work Development in Vietnam</title>
<p>Social work in Vietnam has evolved as a response to the need for community support resulted from wars, natural disasters, poverty, disability, illness, and many other social hardships. Added to this list are contemporary issues such as the need to help people affected by Agent Dioxin and HIV/AIDS. After the end of the war, Vietnam has undergone rapid industrialization, modernization and the introduction of socialist-oriented market economy. Alongside with the rapid economic development, many social problems have been resulted and the gap between rich and poor has been great intensified. As such, the Vietnamese Government has set the aim that economic development must be coupled with social development. In March 2010, the Prime Minister issued the Decision No: 32/2010/Q-TTg dated 25/3/2010 to approve “The Project on Developing the Social Work Profession”, and the Circular No: 08/2010/TT-BNV dated 25/8/2010 of the Ministry of Home Affairs providing titles and code numbers for social work officers. These decisions mean that social work is being considered as an important profession in Vietnam to meet social needs, and to reduce social inequality in the country.</p>
<p>One year after the Decision No.32 of the Government was announced, the Vietnam Association of Social Work (VASW) was established in June 2011, with the goal to spearhead the development of social services, social work education, social work research and social policies in the country. So far, the VASW has over 500 members, including organizations and individuals, coming from all parts of the country. The VASW is strongly supported by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLOSA), UNICEF and Atlantic Philanthropy, and has organized many national and international conferences and training workshops for social workers and social work educators with the aim to build local capacity and to develop international partnerships. The President of IASSW has been invited by VASW and MOLISA to provide consultation on the national core curriculum, and on the development of national strategies for social work education. Advice and support has also been rendered to MOLISA on the development of study cum visit programmes in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland for high level social work officials from Vietnam.</p>

<title>Social Work Development in China</title>
<p>Social work education first developed in the Chinese mainland in the 1920s, but was removed from all universities in the early 1950s since social work was regarded as unnecessary in a socialist country which endeavoured to provide welfare benefits for its citizens from cradle to grave. Social work education was re-introduced to the universities in the late 1980s after the introduction of the open-door economic policy. In view of the urgent need to develop quality social work services to address the increasing social problems and widening gap between the rich and poor in contemporary China, and the pledge of the Chinese Government to enhance social harmony, numerous measures have been adopted to promote the professionalization of social work in China on a national level.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Sixth Plenary Session of the 15<sup>th</sup> Chinese Communist Party Central Committee resolved on “constructing a large strong team of social work professionals” to help in the development of a harmonious society in China. In October 2011, eighteen Ministries and Commissions of the Chinese Central Government jointly signed a document named “Opinions on Strengthening the Construction of a Social Work Professional Team” with the aim to push forward the construction of a professionally-oriented social work workforce. The document outlined the strategies in building the social work professional workforce in China, which include formal and informal training at different levels; formulation of a system of policies and regulations to guide the training and examination for social workers; development of career advancement opportunities for social workers; development of professional social services in different parts of China and at different levels of the Government; developing research and practice theories to guide the development of social work curriculum, local practice models, and teaching materials etc.</p>
<p>The above developments have generated much excitement among members of the social work community in China and have resulted in unprecedented growth in social services all over the country. But since a high percentage of the teachers of the newly introduced MSW programmes have not received full-fledged professional social work education themselves, there is an urgent need for capacity building programmes for social work educators in the country. In response to the invitation of the China Association of Social Work Education (CASWE), the IASSW has launched a series of capacity building programmes in collaboration CASWE and the Ministry of Education of China in 2010 and 2011. The aim of these workshops was to provide Chinese social work educators with an overview of the Global Standards in social work education and to enlighten them with different curriculum development models and practices that are being used in different parts of the world so that they could develop their own social work curriculum that are in line with international standards, while reflecting local needs and concerns. Experience social work educators from around the globe have been invited to give lectures and workshops on topics relating to curriculum development and design; fieldwork teaching and placement arrangements; teaching and learning methods; curriculum evaluation strategies; and teaching and learning in relation to specific topics and subjects. All the workshops were participated enthusiastically by hundreds of social work educators from all over China and the participants found these sessions to be most fruitful and inspiring. Further capacity building programmes are being planned, including national and regional workshops; consultation and support for individual schools; and partnership and attachment programmes.</p>
