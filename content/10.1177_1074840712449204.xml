<p>Instruments that are able to capture changes related to an intervention are of great value to the scientific as well as to the clinical community. The Iceland-Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ) measures expressive emotions, collaboration, problem solving, communication, and behavior in families experiencing a chronic or an acute illness. The conceptual framework of the Calgary Family Assessment Model (Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009) was used to construct the original questionnaire of 45 items and 10 subcategories. A total of 557 family members with a recent illness experience of a close relative answered the ICE-EFFQ in three different studies. Principal component factor analysis reduced the original questionnaire to 22 items with five factors emerging and a total Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of α = 0.912 accounting for 60.3% of the total variability. Confirmatory factor analysis from two studies produced the final version of the questionnaire consisting of 17 items and four factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to measure the effect of a family nursing intervention within health care settings is greatly needed. Nurses working with families in health care who are experiencing acute or chronic illnesses need to know the effectiveness of their family nursing interventions on family outcomes variables, including expressive family functioning. The Iceland Expressive Family Functioning Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ) was developed and psychometrically tested in three different studies in connection with the <italic>Landspitali University Hospital Family Implementation Project</italic> in Iceland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir, 2008</xref>). The conceptual background of the ICE-EFFQ instrument is based on the Calgary Family Assessment Model (CFAM), which is clearly reflected in all of its constructed items and factors measuring expressive family functioning in families dealing with acute and chronic illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The in-depth qualitative conceptual background of the CFAM presented in the ICE-EFFQ discriminates it from other family functioning measurements. Even though other instruments measuring family functioning, using different conceptual background, have been developed and used within the nursing profession, these instruments have mainly focused on family functioning among healthy families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449204">Åstedt-Kurki, Tarkka, Paavilainen, &amp; Lehti, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449204">Åstedt-Kurki, Tarkka, Rikala, Lehti, &amp; Paavilainen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449204">Hohashi, Honda, &amp; Kong, 2008</xref>). However, the uniqueness of the ICE-EFFQ instrument is that it is grounded in a family nursing conceptual framework built on years of clinical experience and qualitative narratives reflecting families’ response to an acute and chronic illness of a close family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Bell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The psychometric properties of the instrument were tested with three different samples of family members with experiences of various somatic and psychiatric illnesses of a close family member occurring within a year from answering the ICE-EFFQ instrument.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The definition of the concept “family functioning” in clinical research normally defines two main aspects of family functioning, that is, practical and emotional. Both aspects are considered important parts of describing families’ well-being and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449204">Epstein, Bishop, &amp; Levin, 1978</xref>). The CFAM defines two basic aspects of family functioning, that is, instrumental and expressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The instrumental aspect refers to routine activities of the family daily living and how individual family members actually behave in relation to one another. The expressive aspect refers to nine categories: emotional communication, verbal communication, nonverbal communication, circular communication, problem solving, roles, influence and power, beliefs, and alliances and coalition in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright and Leahey (2009)</xref> emphasize the importance of the expressive family functioning aspect in their CFAM based on their extensive clinical experience with families. In the new psychometrically tested ICE-EFFQ instrument the expressive family functioning is defined as a multidimensional concept of expressive emotions, collaboration and problem solving, and communication and behavior in families where one family member has a chronic or an acute illness. The instrument is not psychometrically tested for the purpose of being a determinant of whether a family is emotionally healthy or not. However, balanced emotional expression, effective communications, collaboration of family members, and appropriate parenting are dimensions that are often considered essential dimensions of healthy family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712449204">Leahey &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712449204">McCreary &amp; Dancy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1074840712449204">Rolland, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several family functioning instruments have been developed within sociology and health care sciences and have been psychometrically tested. What distinguishes ICE-EFFQ from these instruments is that the other instruments focus on normal family functioning but ICE-EFFQ focuses on expressive family functioning where families are experiencing an acute or chronic illness situation of a family member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1074840712449204">Barroilhet, Cano-Prous, Cervera-Enguix, Forjaz, &amp; Guillén-Grima, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449204">Hohashi et al., 2008</xref>). Examples of family functioning instruments that have been frequently used in research are the Family Assessment Device (FAD) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449204">Epstein et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712449204">Miller, Ryan, Keitner, Bishop, &amp; Epstein, 2000</xref>); the Feetham Family Functioning Scale (FFFS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1074840712449204">Hohashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1074840712449204">Roberts &amp; Feetham, 1982</xref>); and the Family Functioning, Health and Social Support (FAFHES) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1074840712449204">Astedt-Kurki et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449204">2009</xref>). Conceptualization of family functioning in the CFAM is partially built on similar categories of the FAD instrument such as problem solving, communication, roles, affective responsiveness, affective involvement, and behavior control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449204">Epstein et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712449204">Miller et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1074840712449204">2000</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright, &amp; Leahey’s (2009)</xref> concept of family functioning is even more multidimensional in nature than other authors, that is, it also includes nonverbal and circular communication, beliefs, and power in the family. When a family is faced with and experiencing an acute or chronic illness, changes may occur in the family functioning of the family such that family members may have to manage difficult emotional situations, use different communication, collaborate more than usual, and accept outside help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1074840712449204">Rolland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is important to have an instrument that measures expressive family functioning with patients and family members experiencing illness, which can also be used to measure therapeutic change and the effect of family nursing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712449204">Chesla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712449204">Mattila et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There are contextual variables that influence family functioning such as socioeconomic status, culture, family structure, and the developmental stages of the family, for example, families with young children or families in retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712449204">Aarons, McDonald, Connelly, &amp; Newton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1074840712449204">McCreary &amp; Dancy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). The CFAM includes structural, developmental, and functional dimensions for making a thorough family assessment. All of these three dimensions are important when intervening and conducting research with families experiencing illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1074840712449204">
<title>Aim of the Study</title>
<p>The aim of this study, composed of three series of studies, was to develop and psychometrically test the ICE-EFFQ instrument, which measures the concept of expressive family functioning when a family is dealing with an acute or chronic illness of a family member. The development and psychometric testing included item development, content validity assessment, factor analysis to determine dimensionality, and reliability assessment.</p>

<title>Item Development</title>
<p>An English version of the original questionnaire of the ICE-EFFQ was developed by one of the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>). A 45-item questionnaire was generated from the conceptual foundation of the CFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2005</xref>). Items were chosen and created from the conceptual foundation of the CFAM where each item represents a family function taken from the instrumental and expressive aspects of CFAM. There is one subcategory in the instrumental family functioning category and nine subcategories in the expressive family functioning category (see below). The ICE-EFFQ instrument itself did not include the structural and developmental categories of the CFAM but these categories are evaluated separately (e.g., through the family genogram and ecomap). The numbers in the following brackets represent how many items were created in each subcategory generated from the CFAM and the following statements are sample items from the original ICE-EFFQ.</p>
<sec id="section6-1074840712449204">
<title>Instrumental family functioning category</title>
<p>In the CFAM the instrumental category is seen as separate from the expressive family functioning category. It is defined as the category focused on family activities of daily living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-1074840712449204">
<title>Expressive family functioning category</title>
<p>In the CFAM the emphasis is on the expressive family functioning category. It is defined as the category around family communication, expression of feelings and behavior, and problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<list id="list2-1074840712449204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Emotional communication: “I know how other family members will respond when one of us is feeling sad” (six items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Verbal communication: “Family members express themselves clearly and honestly when they talk to each other” (four items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Nonverbal communication: “I know what each and every family member does under difficult circumstances” (four items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Circular communication: “I trust my partner and feel safe in revealing my needs and fears to him/her” (two items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Problem-solving: “I know how relationships within the family change and develop when problems have been solved” (six items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Roles: “I know who would be the first to notice if family members worked as a team instead of competing with each other” (four items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Influence and power: “I know what effect it has on a family member when another family member is dominating the conversation” (four items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Beliefs: “I believe that I know how much control my family has over the health situation” (eight items).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alliances/coalition: “When two family members argue I know who is most likely to be in the middle of the fight” (five items).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The original questionnaire was developed in English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>) and validated by Dr. Lorraine Wright who codeveloped CFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">2009</xref>). The questionnaire was then translated into Icelandic. The clarity of the Icelandic version was improved by using the method of cognitive interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1074840712449204">Drennan, 2003</xref>) in relation to understanding the meaning and language of the items. Adult family members of the authors, expert nurses belonging to the steering and implementation groups of implementing Family Systems Nursing (FSN) at Landspitali University Hospital (LUH), and doctoral students at the Faculty of Nursing at the University of Iceland participated in the cognitive interviewing process of the instrument development. Their input was important to establish the relevance and clarity of each item. Minor changes in the wording and expression of the items in Icelandic changed following these interviews. Family members and nurses expressed the same understanding and meaning of the items as the authors. The peer reviewed Icelandic instrument was cross-translated again into English with professional assistance of a certified translator and compared with the original English instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1074840712449204">Orlygsdottir &amp; Svavarsdottir, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1074840712449204">Wild et al., 2005</xref>). The meaning of the concepts and items did not change at all through the translation process when the two English versions of the questionnaires were compared.</p>
<p>The original ICE-EFFQ instrument was composed of 45 items with 10 subcategories reflecting the CFAM. A 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>almost never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>all of the time</italic>) was used. The instrument included demographic questions such as gender, age, and relationship to the patient, which provided structural information about the family members.</p>

<sec id="section8-1074840712449204">
<title>Content Validity Assessment</title>
<p>Expert nurses from the LUH and the Faculty of Nursing at the University of Iceland who were knowledgeable about the Calgary Family Nursing Models reviewed, disputed, and critiqued the instrument items as a way of assessing the content validity and insuring the items reflected the concepts of the CFAM. They refined the language and the meaning of each item. In addition, masters’ and doctoral students who were using the Calgary nursing models in their studies discussed and validated the items of the instrument. Both nurses from the clinical and academic setting confirmed that the 45 items in the original questionnaire reflected their conceptualization of the CFAM. In this content validation process, new items were neither added nor were any removed. Dr. Lorraine Wright made a valuable contribution by confirming the content validity of the items of the original questionnaire. After the content validity process was completed, the original ICE-EFFQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir, 2007</xref>) became a preliminary questionnaire that was psychometrically tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Dimensionality Assessment/Factor Analysis</title>
<p>In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used for both reduction and confirmation of theoretical structure of the ICE-EFFQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712449204">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712449204">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712449204">Pett, Lackey, &amp; Sullivan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz, Strickland, &amp; Lenz, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Study 1</title>
<p>Data were collected for the first psychometric test of the ICE-EFFQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) between December 2007 and April 2008. Nurses and Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS) asked family members who were visiting patients admitted to different units and divisions at LUH (medical, surgical, pediatric, geriatric, and psychiatric) to answer the ICE-EFFQ instrument. Nurses provided information about the study and asked for informed consent from patients and family members before they completed the ICE-EFFQ instrument. Inclusion criteria in the data collection addressed the need to recruit family members who had experienced illness of an immediate family member within a year and were willing to share their experience by answering the questionnaire. In addition family members (respondents) were 18 years of age or older and were able to read and write Icelandic.</p>
<p>PCA, the data-driven factor analysis, was used to explore the number of factors of eigenvalues greater than 1 in the 45 items preliminary questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712449204">Pett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz et al., 2005</xref>).

A nurse asked family members participating in different health Nongovernmental Organizations (NGO) because of an illness experience in their family to answer the ICE-EFFQ instrument. In addition university students with an illness experience in their family answered the ICE-EFFQ instrument in studies one and two. They comprised about 15% of the total sample in Study 1 and 20% of the total sample in Study 2. The aim was to get enough respondents to answer the ICE-EFFQ to stay within the recommended 3 to 5 respondents per item (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz et al., 2005</xref>).

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18 statistical software was used for statistical analysis for the factor analysis and descriptive statistics (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). To describe the demographic characteristics of the respondents frequencies, means, median, range, and standard deviations were used.</p>
<p>Testing of sampling adequacy and assessment of factorability was assessed before conducting PCA. PCA with varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization was conducted on the responses to the original 45 items ICE-EFFQ. It was examined how the items loaded to each subcategory reflected from CFAM. Acceptable factors were extracted according to the following criteria, that is, factor loading cutoff of 0.40, eigenvalues greater than 1 and having the total variance explained by the factors and by the total instrument. The mean (<italic>M</italic>) and standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) of each item, and communalities were assessed. The communalities present the proportion of each item’s variance that can be explained by the PCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1074840712449204">Pett et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The factors identified with the PCA were then evaluated through CFA with different data sets. CFA is a statistical method to verify a factor structure or a model already established. Factors should be independent in the CFA, but the model shows if they are not, and then the researcher decides if he or she wants to modify the questionnaire. The statistical program Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) was used for the statistical analysis conducting the confirmatory factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1074840712449204">Daniel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1074840712449204">Joreskog &amp; Sorbom, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Goodness of Fit (GOF) of the CFA-based model was assessed with several indices. The following indices were assessed for studies two and three:</p>
<list id="list3-1074840712449204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>χ<sup>2</sup>/df ratio was looked at in this study; however, it is suggested to be less than 3 to be considered a good model fit (relative likelihood ratio; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz et al., 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) is suggested to be 0.05 or less and a model with RMSEA 0.1 or more is considered not to have acceptable fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1074840712449204">Netemeyer et al., 2003</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The following additional GOF indices were assessed for Study 3:</p>
<list id="list4-1074840712449204" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Comparative fit index (CFI) ranges from 0 for a poor fit to 1 for a good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449204">Albright &amp; Park, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMSR) less than 0.08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449204">Albright &amp; Park, 2008</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Researchers are advised to report more than one fit example of their hypothesized model that is building up the questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1074840712449204">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz et al., 2005</xref>) because there is not an agreement on consistent standards that exist for an acceptable model. It is suggested to be acceptable when three indices make up the model fit, that is, RMSEA between 0.06 and 0.01, CFI between 0.95 and 0.99, and SRMR less than 0.08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449204">Albright &amp; Park, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Internal consistency was assessed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for each factor and of the overall instrument of the ICE-EFFQ. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is considered to be good when measuring internal consistency and it is measured more than 0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1074840712449204">Waltz et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

Family members participated on a voluntary basis with an approval from the patient when data were collected within the hospital environment, responses were anonymous, and the informed consent of the participants was given by filling out the ICE-EFFQ instrument and background questions on gender, age, and relation to the patient. Participants were provided with information explaining the testing from the nurse and they could refuse to participate at any time. Study 3 was conducted with an approval from the Scientific Ethical Board at LUH (28/2008) and with approvals from the Chief Executive of Nursing and Medicine at LUH. Study 3 was reported to the Data Protection Authority in Iceland (S3861/2008).</p>

<p>In Study 1, a total of 231 family members answered the preliminary 45 items ICE-EFFQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2008</xref>) for the PCA. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712449204">Table 1</xref>, gender, age, and family relation to the patient are presented. More than 70% of the sample was parents, spouses or sons/daughters of the patient. In the PCA there were 5.1 respondents per item. Assessment for factor analysis suitability, the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.828, which was considered appropriate. Factorability of the correlation matrices, Bartletts tests of sphericity χ<sup>2</sup> (1512.365) = 435.000, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.000 was appropriate as well. After these two tests for suitability for factor analysis, the PCA was conducted on the data with varimax rotation with Kaiser Normalization to extract the statistical factors of the instrument (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1074840712449204">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The expressing emotions factor consisted of five items, collaboration and problem solving of five items, communication of four items, behavior of four items and the awareness of the situation factor consisted of four items. Twenty three items were eliminated from the 45 items ICE-EFFQ. Of these 23 items, 17 items did not get enough distribution or the distribution of answers was really skewed and the Z-score &gt; 6 (standard error of skewness). These items belonged to the following theoretical subcategories: Influence and power (four items), beliefs (eight items), and alliance and coalitions (five items). Two items belonging to the theoretical subcategory circular communication turned out to be very problematic and were eliminated, that is, they had to do with questions regarding partner relationship, which did not apply to everybody in the sample: “I feel safe in revealing my needs and fears to my partner”; “My partner is concerned about my well-being and supports me”.</p>

<title>Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)</title>
<p>In Study 2, a total of 189 family members answered the 22 items ICE-EFFQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009a</xref>) for the CFA. In this sample 82% of the sample was parents, spouses or sons/daughters of the patients. Furthermore information on demographics of family members is in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1074840712449204">Table 1</xref>. Almost 8.6 respondents per item answered the instrument. When confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the 22 items ICE-EFFQ, the best fit of the model resulted in 17 items with four factors emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sveinbjarnardottir, 2009b</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://uni.hi.is/eks/en/instruments/ice-effq/">https://uni.hi.is/eks/en/instruments/ice-effq/</ext-link>), expressing emotions (four items), collaboration and problem solving (five items), communication (four items) and behavior (four items). The model proposing five factors instrument did not get acceptable statistical fit as the four factor model did (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1074840712449204">Table 3</xref>). Four of the factors of the principal component analysis got confirmed with one item eliminated from factor I because of correlation between two items and violating the independency of each item. The item eliminated was “I know what my family finds most helpful when coping with difficult life situations.” The factor awareness of the situation with four items did not get confirmed in the CFA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1074840712449204">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1074840712449204">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The concept of “Expressive family functioning” has its origin in conceptual framework that is mainly based on family functioning from individual family members perspective that are <italic>not necessarily</italic> dealing with a recent illness experience in their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1074840712449204">Epstein et al., 1978</xref>). The family functioning concept has been used as an outcome measurement in family research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712449204">Chen &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712449204">Du Rocher Schudlich, Youngstrom, Calabrese, &amp; Findling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712449204">Herzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840712449204">Thompson, 2009</xref>). However, there is a need to develop and study further the concept of family functioning in relation to interventions research when a family member is experiencing a chronic or an acute illness. Nurses and other health care workers intervening with families need measurements constructed from illness experiences that are capable of capturing change in family functioning because of the intervention offered. The ICE-EFFQ instrument is purposely psychometrically tested on data from family members receiving services in various clinical settings with family members where each one of them had a recent illness experience in their family. Furthermore, the ICE-EFFQ instrument has been found to be clinically valid within different health care settings indicating that the measure can be used to measure family members response to different illnesses in the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The items of ICE-EFFQ in the original questionnaire were developed from the functional part of the CFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Each item addressed one element within the CFAM and was structured to obtain a valid response from patients and family members. This proposed theory-driven family functioning instrument went through in-depth expert content review to determine content validity and pretesting of meaning and language. The professionals who were experts in the Calgary Family Models confirmed the content validity of the ICE-EFFQ instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712449204">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>). The content validity of the ICE-EFFQ is therefore well established. Furthermore, the construct validity of the ICE-EFFQ is also well grounded. Three different factor analyses were conducted; one principal component and two confirmatory analyses, to establish construct validity of the ICE-EFFQ instrument. The preliminary questionnaire of 45 items with the 10 subcategories, changed into a 22 items with five factors questionnaire in the PCA. In the CFA, the best fit between the CFAM conceptual framework and the statistical model was a four factor model of expressing emotions, collaboration and problem solving, communication and behaviour, and measuring only expressive family functioning because the two instrumental items on daily living got eliminated in the statistical factor analysis process. The second confirmatory analysis was built on strong evidence because all the indices were within suggested statistical limits to confirm the proposed four factor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1074840712449204">Albright &amp; Park, 2008</xref>). It was disappointing that the subcategories of circular communication, beliefs or power did not get into the questionnaire based on statistical analyses conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). May be a different approach to measuring these categories needs to be explored.</p>
<p>The ICE-EFFQ instrument demonstrated internal consistency with adequate scores on the Cronbach’s coefficient alpha for the entire instruments as well as for each of the four factors. The ICE-EFFQ instrument could be reliability tested and compared with the family functioning factors in The Family Functioning, Health, and Social Support (FAFHES) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1074840712449204">Astedt-Kurki et al., 2009</xref>) and in the Family Assessment Device (FAD) instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1074840712449204">Miller et al., 1994</xref>). Congruent and convergent validity of the ICE-EFFQ could be established because one can hypothesize and expect a positive correlation of the family functioning concept, built on the CFAM, with both these instruments mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1074840712449204">Friedenberg, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The ICE-EFFQ will be useful within hospital and health care institutions as a theory-driven instrument to evaluate family functioning before and after a family intervention. The ICE-EFFQ is easy to administer and to use within clinical settings; it is a self-report questionnaire and takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to answer. It is available in English and Icelandic.</p>

<sec id="section24-1074840712449204">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study could be that Icelandic family members responded significantly different to illness than family members from other cultures. The role of culture seems to be important in different functioning of families as some research has confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1074840712449204">Aaronson et. al., 2007</xref>). External validity requires additional testing of the ICE-EFFQ among family members coming from different health care settings and with diverse cultural background.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of strength in the conceptual development and psychometrically testing of the ICE-EFFQ instrument. It is based on the in-depth conceptual framework found in the CFAM. The sample in all of the three studies was drawn from family members who truly had an illness experience. The results of the PCA factor structure of the ICE-EFFQ instrument was tested twice with two different samples using several robust statistical tests and the sample size was large enough in all studies. In Study 3 where the sample was drawn from family members in psychiatry the CFA confirmed the proposed model in Study 2 where the sample of family members were from heterogenic illness population of family members. Internal consistency for the total instrument and for the factors of the ICE-EFFQ was well within satisfactory limits.</p>
<p>Measurement invariance (MI) was tested with gender and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1074840712449204">Vandenberg &amp; Lance, 2000</xref>). There was not a significant difference in the answers of males and females in any of the factors or the total instrument of the ICE-EFFQ. In addition there was not a significant difference in the answers, when splitting the age group in two groups, older and younger than 50 years of age.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Family functioning is one of the concepts that has been widely studied in research in social, health care, and nursing sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1074840712449204">Chen &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1074840712449204">Du Rocher Schudlich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1074840712449204">Herzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1074840712449204">Thompson, 2009</xref>) However, it is important to develop various valid and reliable measurements to measure therapeutic change within clinical settings, when the family is experiencing illness in a family, particularly in the light of the emerging evidence that adding family intervention to the treatment of acute and chronic illnesses seems to improve health and well-being of patients and family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1074840712449204">Chesla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1074840712449204">Leahey &amp; Svavarsdotttir, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1074840712449204">Mattila, Leino, Paavilainen, &amp; Astedt-Kurki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir &amp; Sigurdardottir, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the intervention aspect of the Calgary Family Intervention Model there are three domains of family functioning identified; (a) behavioral, (b) cognitive and (c) affective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1074840712449204">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1074840712449204">Svavarsdottir and Sveinbjarnardottir (2009c)</xref> have developed and psychometrically tested another instrument; Iceland-Family Members’ Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ) built on the domains of family functioning presented in the Calgary Family Intervention Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1074840712449204">Sveinbjarnardottir, Svavarsdottir, &amp; Hrafnkelsson, 2012</xref>). The ICE-FPSQ and ICE-EFFQ are both instruments that can be used to measure the effectiveness of interventions offered to families by nurses and or other health care professionals when offering family centered health care services.</p>
