<abstract>
<p>Mixed-method evaluation of two iterations of month-long summer enrichment programs for English-learning secondary students investigated impacts on participants’ beliefs about school and academic achievement, and on actual course choices, test outcomes, and graduation rates. Students (<italic>N</italic> = 85) from one ethnically diverse, high-poverty high school in a large school district in Georgia took part in science and academic English-themed summer enrichment programs in 2006 and 2008. Questionnaires, interviews, and transcript analysis demonstrated that after taking part, students aspired to attend college, were aware of the steps necessary, and took steps such as tracking themselves into more advanced courses. Participants also were able to create and sustain peer support groups in their school, fostering a culture of academic achievement. Findings suggest that even such short-term programs can positively influence students’ attitudes, aspirations, and actual behaviors supporting academic achievement, graduation, and postsecondary education, lending promise to goals of ameliorating the academic achievement gap.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Educational outcomes such as high school graduation and college attendance are critically important factors in promoting economic and social equality for immigrant, Latino, and other groups with gaps in educational and economic attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1932202X12439197">Carnevale, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12439197">Greene, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1932202X12439197">Hispanic Scholarship Fund, n.d.</xref>), yet rates for such students remain low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1932202X12439197">Swail, Cabrera, &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>). This can be attributed in large part to a persistent achievement gap between children from nondominant communities and their middle-class White peers; on average, the former lag behind by 4 years in grade-level performance in K-12 public schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1932202X12439197">National Center for Education Statistics, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1932202X12439197">National Taskforce on Early Childhood Education for Hispanics, 2007</xref>). Although this educational achievement gap has been recognized for decades in parts of the country with long-standing Latino populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1932202X12439197">Garcia, 2001</xref>), the last decades have seen a replication and extension of this gap in parts of the country—including Southeastern states such as North Carolina and Georgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1932202X12439197">Greene, 2002</xref>)—experiencing rapid new growth in immigrant populations, primarily from Latin America and Asia. For instance, only 63% of Georgia’s English-learning students graduated from high school in 2010 compared with the 80.8% overall rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12439197">Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1932202X12439197">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Explanations for this achievement gap suggest a complex web of contextual and individual elements. Longitudinal studies of second-generation immigrants, for instance, found that factors ranging from country of origin to socioeconomic status, family status, and self-esteem and educational aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1932202X12439197">A. Portes &amp; Hao, 2004</xref>) affected eventual educational attainment and social success. Peer groups and social networks of students also wield substantial influence over student access to educational capital, their attitudes, and aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12439197">Flores-Gonzalez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1932202X12439197">Jewell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1932202X12439197">A. Portes &amp; Zhou, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1932202X12439197">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural factors that relate to the context of these groups’ educational experiences are also salient. For instance, in the “new Latino South” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12439197">Wainer, 2004</xref>), teacher training programs have not traditionally prepared educators for working with English learners, though these represent a rapidly growing share of the student population. In Georgia, for instance, almost 179,000 students (about 11% of the total K-12 population) were identified as Hispanic statewide in 2009-2010, compared with fewer than 24,000 in 1994-1995. In addition, 6% of the K-12 population was identified as Limited English Proficient (LEP) in 2009-2010 versus only 4% so identified in 2004-2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12439197">Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, 2010</xref>). At the same time, only about one in five Georgia teachers reported any professional development on teaching English learners in the past 3 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1932202X12439197">Wei, Darling-Hammond, &amp; Adamson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>For a “pipeline” to higher education to function, students must accomplish a series of steps, including taking appropriate, rigorous coursework in high school. Educator biases and lack of cultural or language awareness have been implicated in inappropriate program or course placement and advice for English learning students, including those with high ability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1932202X12439197">Peterson &amp; Margolin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1932202X12439197">U.S. Department of Education, 1998</xref>). In addition, “Hispanic and Asian students—and especially LEP students within these groups—are far more likely to go to schools where LEP students are concentrated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1932202X12439197">Ruiz de Velasco &amp; Fix, 2000</xref>, p. 14); such demographic clustering has been shown to contribute to achievement gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1932202X12439197">Fry, 2008</xref>), and these schools may not offer the same level of options, especially for high-ability students. In fact, data from North Carolina suggested that only about a third of English-learning adolescents selected college-bound academic tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1932202X12439197">Akos, Lambie, Milsom, &amp; Gilbert, 2007</xref>). Other contributing structural factors relating to the achievement and excellence gaps may include language barriers and lack of immigrant families’ knowledge about educational norms and requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1932202X12439197">Bohon, Macpherson, &amp; Atiles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1932202X12439197">Ruiz de Velasco &amp; Fix, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1932202X12439197">Wainer, 2004</xref>). Finally, the success or underachievement of immigrant high school students can be partially attributed to the “complex system of courses and requirements” for graduation and for university eligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1932202X12439197">Walqui, 2000a</xref>, p. 60), as well as the actual legal and policy barriers or pathways for higher education implemented by states and university systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1932202X12439197">Morales, Herrera, &amp; Murry, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Ensuring support to reduce this group-based inequality in educational outcomes, including high school graduation and college attendance, is thus a public policy, economic, and civil rights issue of the highest order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1932202X12439197">Lee, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12439197">P. R. Portes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1932202X12439197">P. R. Portes &amp; Salas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1932202X12439197">Rothstein, 2008</xref>). Educational researchers have provided a range of ideas for ameliorating the achievement gap. Recommendations responding to the above-mentioned concerns include to “provide early college awareness programs and broad support services to accelerate student learning” alongside “college planning and financial aid information” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1932202X12439197">Pathways to College Network, 2004</xref>) and to promote high aspirations throughout middle and high school, provide stronger academic preparation, and provide secure financial support for higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12439197">National Governors Association Center for Best Practices, n.d.</xref>). Considerations for practice for schools and individual teachers interested in making such improvements for English learners have also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12439197">Freeman &amp; Freeman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1932202X12439197">Gándara, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1932202X12439197">Martinez &amp; Klopott, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1932202X12439197">P. R. Portes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1932202X12439197">Rance-Roney, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1932202X12439197">Reyes, Scribner, &amp; Scribner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1932202X12439197">Romo &amp; Falbo, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1932202X12439197">Slavin &amp; Calderón, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1932202X12439197">Valverde, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1932202X12439197">Walqui, 2000b</xref>).</p>
<p>Of vital importance are programs that can “make intelligible those policies that parents and children must follow” to be on track educationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1932202X12439197">Lockwood, 2000</xref>, p. 3) and that can motivate and inspire students to prepare for higher education in realistic and appropriate ways. To start with, “In order to close the achievement gap, more students must desire to attend college” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1932202X12439197">National Governors Association, n.d.</xref>). Many nonmajority students do not think of college as an option for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1932202X12439197">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2011</xref>); thus, learning what programs are successful in leading to this shift in expectations and aspirations, and why, is a crucial element to achieving educational equity.</p>
<p>University engagement initiatives with students placed at risk, ranging from tutoring to mentoring to summer programs, often focus on the “pipeline” to high school graduation and college. However, specific investigations into the enactment of such initiatives in complex real-world settings are needed, especially in the context of the “new Latino south.” Policy makers, funders, school administrators, parents, and students may legitimately question whether such practices can be implemented successfully and at what level of resource commitment. Can a month-long summer outreach program, for instance, have a meaningful impact on reducing this achievement gap for immigrant, English-learning students? The present study investigates short- and long-term impacts of participation in two instances of a summer enrichment program on students’ postsecondary aspirations and academics.</p>

<title>Program Elements</title>
<p>This study uses data from two seasons (2006, 2008) of a 4-week summer enrichment program for English-learning high school students in Georgia. These programs were sponsored and organized by the University of Georgia’s Center for Latino Achievement and Success in Education in collaboration with school district personnel, and held on the campus of Georgia Gwinnett College. After initial positive outcomes of the 2006 program were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12439197">Musetti, Mellom, &amp; Lopez, 2007</xref>), the 2008 program was designed in part to see whether similar outcomes were sustainable and replicable, or merely idiosyncratic.</p>
<sec id="section3-1932202X12439197">
<title>Program Goals and Organization</title>
<p>The stated program goals included to (a) improve students’ academic English language skills; (b) assist their overall academic achievement, with a focus on science; (c) provide opportunities for students to become familiar with college campus life; and (d) promote a pipeline of higher education aspirations and eventual enrollment. Program activities included targeted lectures, science labs, field excursions with applied science goals, college and university visits, and interaction with college student mentors. The 4-week, “Water is Life”-themed program included 4 days of activities per week: 2 instructional days on the college campus, 1 day of theme-related field excursions, and 1 day of college visits. One of the authors directed the program, which was staffed by university and high school teachers with college student aides.</p>
<p>The curriculum was created collaboratively by the teachers, using their district-based curricula. The program director encouraged them to develop collaborative, project-based lessons integrated with the field experiences. This allowed the teachers to move away from standardized testing for summative and formative assessments, and emphasized team-based work. To address the needs of mixed-age and -ability groups and to differentiate for the different language abilities, all of the teachers selected to teach in the summer program had been trained in English to Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) pedagogy and modified their instruction based on recommendations for scaffolding for English language learners (ELLs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1932202X12439197">Walqui, 2000b</xref>). Specific strategies included <italic>Think/Pair/Share</italic>, to encourage students to use English in small group interactions, rather than in more stressful large-group ones; <italic>Know/Want to Know/Learned (KWLs)</italic>, to access background knowledge and to engage students in active participation in the learning process; hands-on <italic>kinesthetic activities; cloze readings</italic>, used weekly to develop reading comprehension; and <italic>root word charts</italic> and “Words of the Day” activities, to develop language and make explicit the connection between common Spanish vocabulary and science vocabulary in English. These activities were intentionally and regularly integrated as routines into the program’s daily activities so that the students could become more self-directed in their learning. Student work focused on the development of academic vocabulary and writing through group research projects. A typical class day in the program began with a “word of the day” linking language and writing activities to the focus of the day’s lesson; for example, if the word of the day were <italic>aquaculture</italic>, the instructors might begin with an activity discussing the Latin roots of the word <italic>aquaculture</italic> and extending this to other words the students knew. This language activity was followed by a focused science lesson on the day’s topic (e.g., aquaculture), then an outdoor activity (testing water temperature and taking samples of a pond where fish were cultivated), and then an applied lab exercise (testing the water samples for ammonia and nitrate contents). The field excursions included trips to a local water treatment plant as well as a trip to the lake that supplies water for much of the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. College visits were designed to show the range of possibilities available and so included a large public research university; a 2-year “community college;” a small, private, liberal arts college; and the smaller, public, 4-year college at whose campus the program was held. In spring 2009, 18 of the 2008 participants and 1 of the 2006 participant also took part in an optional 4-day follow-up at a coastal marine education facility. This incorporated additional activities with marine science laboratories, excursions, vocabulary development, and an explicit practice on how to write college application essays.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>For ease of recruitment and program logistics considerations, and to develop a community of teachers and learners who could continue to work together during the following school year, participants were drawn from one large (more than 2,000 students), ethnically diverse and high-poverty high school situated in a large school district in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. (Because the program provided transportation and the enrollment zone of the participating high school was extensive, including additional schools was untenable.) Participating students were primarily rising sophomores, from immigrant families from Latin American (almost 90%) and Asian backgrounds, and either currently or previously designated as LEP. Participants represented a range of academic experiences and time in the United States, and were majority female (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1932202X12439197">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To recruit students, the program director notified the high school administrators and ESOL and science teachers and requested that they distribute informational flyers to their students to take home. Because commitment to participating in the full program (6-8 hr per day including travel time, 4 days a week) was critical, the parents also needed to be fully supportive of their children’s involvement, so culturally appropriate communications with the families to establish rapport and trust were intentionally built into the recruitment. As the majority of these students’ home language was Spanish, flyers were also translated into Spanish. After sending out the initial flyer, program staff visited classes and held two evening informational meetings (using English and Spanish) with students and their families at the school and a local library. In addition, reassuring parents that the program provided lunch and transportation to and from the students’ homes was pivotal in securing the support and commitment of the students and families.</p>
<p>Another intentional consideration was that participating students were not selected specifically from a preexisting population already academically focused, successful, and highly achieving; in fact, many of the students had lower than 2.0 grade point averages. Instead, participants were chosen based on having been enrolled in ESOL programs during their middle or high school tenure, and their own and their parents’ commitment to students participating fully in the summer program. Furthermore, the program was framed not as remedial “summer school” or punishment but as enrichment and a privilege, which may have influenced the students’ attitudes about themselves and school as reflected in the data. In 2006, 52 students participated in the program, attending every day. In 2008, due to reduced funding availability, only 33 students participated. The majority of students in both cohorts were Latinos whose home language was Spanish (45 in 2006 and 32 in 2008), although both cohorts had non-Latino participants, in 2006, 7 participants were from Asia and South Asia and in 2008 1 participant was from Asia. Because one goal of the program was to encourage high school retention and graduation, and the highest drop-out rates (particularly among Latino males) occur in 9th and 10th grades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12439197">Glennie &amp; Stearns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X12439197">National Center for Education Statistics, 2010</xref>), the program targeted rising freshmen and sophomores, and the majority of participants in both cohorts fell within those groups.</p>

<title>Data Sources</title>
<p>Data for this study included questionnaires, interviews, and student records, as well as unsolicited feedback from participants and their school administrators. The inclusion of pre- and post- attitude measures, participant retrospectives in short- and long-term time frames, as well as actual student behaviors (grades, test scores, and graduation outcomes) provided a fairly robust set of data to triangulate.</p>
<sec id="section6-1932202X12439197">
<title>Participant Self-Report Data</title>
<p>Questionnaires (<italic>n</italic> = 79; 50 in 2006, 29 in 2008) assessed aspirations, demographics, general academic knowledge, college admission requirements, interest in science, study habits, and program satisfaction. The questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1932202X12439197">Musetti et al., 2007</xref>), implemented pre- and post participation in 2006 and post participation only in 2008, was designed by the outside evaluator for the 2006 program. An additional online questionnaire evaluating the long-term impact of participation was emailed to 2006 and 2008 participants in June 2009; however, only 5 students completed this survey, so these data are not included in the current analysis.</p>
<p>Interviews in focus groups or in writing evaluated the program and its objectives, both at the end of the program (summer 2006, summer 2008) and in spring 2009. End-of-program interviews consisted of 11 scripted open-ended questions about the program, participation, and impact. Program staff used the interview questions, as well as probes and follow-ups to student responses, with participants in three groups; participants were also provided questions in writing and were able to respond in writing if desired. Small-group discussions were recorded and transcribed by a graduate student assistant. As part of the Spring 2009 follow-up trip, one of the authors conducted follow-up interviews with all attendees (18 from the 2008 cohort and 1 from the 2006 cohort) in groups of 2 to 3 students at a time, which were also videotaped and transcribed. All interviews were conducted in English, as were program activities, although interviewers were bilingual. For the current study, interview data were used as a secondary data source to triangulate and support findings from the questionnaires.</p>

<sec id="section7-1932202X12439197">
<title>Participant Transcript Evaluation</title>
<p>Transcripts and test scores from the 2008-2009 academic year for 2006 and for 2008 participants were analyzed to determine participants’ academic outcomes, including graduation rate for 2006 participants, course choice (Advanced Placement [AP] and honors enrollments), and results on end-of-course tests and Georgia High School Graduation Test subtests. These outcomes were compared with those of the peers who did not participate in the program. Participating 2006 students’ numeric course grades from their school transcripts were also investigated as a possible pre- to post participation indicator of program impact. Although grades do not reflect course difficulty or idiosyncrasies of individual instructors or courses, they were hypothesized to provide a rough estimate of student achievement. The data set was somewhat complicated, because participating students took part in the program as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors, and because of inconsistencies within student records and across the cohort (i.e., some students repeated grades, others were in ESOL courses and then tracked up to “general” or advanced/honors sections, and so on).</p>
<p>For purposes of this analysis, the “term average/Numeric Grade Average (NGA)” (the average of only the core-content classes, English, math, science, and social studies) for each student reported for each high school term in the participating school district was averaged individually across their high school terms (1-8 terms) prior to participation in the program, then terms with NGAs reported for postprogram participation (1-4 terms) were also averaged. For 2008 participants, the “term average/NGA” (the average of the core-content classes, English, math, science, and social studies) for each student reported for each high school term in the district was averaged individually across their high school terms (0-6 terms) prior to participation in the program, then compared with the NGAs reported for postprogram participation (1 term, at the time of analysis).</p>
<p>Although administrator feedback was not part of the current study, a comment from the high school principal provided an important insight:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The most telling evidence [of program impact] has been a change in attitude regarding school and academics. Students are much more positive about school and academics. The impact is not necessarily seen in their grades but if they can move out of the “safety” of ESOL and do as well in the college prep courses that is a big improvement. (2008 principal, interview, January 28, 2009)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This suggested that further investigation of student coursework and grades was important for understanding the program impact. Thus, a raw count was made of how many of participants’ in-district high school courses prior to and after participation were listed in the transcript as “AP,” “Honors,” “Advanced,” or “Gifted.” Next, we calculated the percentage of total courses that were in these top tracks, to determine whether students tended to track themselves into higher track classes after participation. Both the group average pre- and post participation, as well as the average percentage change for each individual student, were investigated. Participant scores on the state-mandated Georgia High School Writing Test and the Georgia High School Graduation Tests in the content fields of language arts, mathematics, social studies, and science were tallied and compared with demographically similar students not in the program. Finally, graduation results reported by the high school were investigated.</p>

<title>Self-Report Outcomes</title>
<p>The first set of results from the data sources demonstrates participants’ self-reported perspectives of short-term and long-term program impacts: greater <italic>awareness</italic> of postsecondary educational options, increased <italic>aspirations</italic>, improved <italic>academic</italic> skills, and concrete <italic>actions</italic> taken by participants to help support and share their educational capital.</p>
<sec id="section10-1932202X12439197">
<title>Awareness</title>
<p>Participants reported learning what it takes to attend a university and that they had the capacity to accomplish this. In all, 96% (2006) and 90% (2008) of participants agreed that “after being in the program, [they] feel better informed to attend a university like [the sponsoring four-year university].” Program-final comments included the following: “My eyes were opened to see that it is possible for me to go to college” (2006 Participant A, final written evaluation, July 26, 2006); the program “really helped me a lot and informed me about all the different scholarships loans and grants” (2006 Participant B, final written evaluation, July 26, 2006); “I had a great time here and got better informed on what to prepare for when looking for a college” (2008 Participant I, final online evaluation, July 9, 2008); and “I now know what I have to do to go to college” (2008 Participant P, final online evaluation, July 9, 2008). Participants also indicated that the program helped them to be “be more realistic on what it takes to be admitted to a university” (74% in 2006, 68% in 2008) and “helped me realize that there is more than one way to get into the university” (76% in 2006, 71% in 2008). Another commented (2008 Participant R, small group interview, April 7, 2009), “I was always interested in going to college but now I’m more informed about how to get there.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1932202X12439197">
<title>Aspirations</title>
<p>Participants reported increased college aspirations. At the beginning of the program, 23% of students planned to attend a community college and 58% expressed plans to attend a 4-year university (2006); by the end of the program, only 2% planned to attend a community college and 92% planned to attend a 4-year university. In 2008, by the end of the program, 66% expressed plans for a 4-year university and 28% a community college. The majority agreed that the program “inspired me to attend a university” (80% in 2006, 57% in 2008). In addition, students were asked to reflect on “how sure” of being able to attend the state’s flagship, 4-year university they had felt prior to as well as at the end of the program; each year, only 32% initially rated themselves as more than “50% sure” of being able to attend the 4-year public institution, rising to 90% (2006) and 82% (2008) by program end.</p>
<p>Student interview responses also confirmed how participation improved aspirations for college: “I think more positive now. I mean even if you don’t have money, you can go to college” (2008 Participant R, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “After the program, I got to thinking what I should really do after high school” (2008 Participant A, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “Before I wasn’t really sure if I was going to go to college, . . . and now I’m trying to get A’s and B’s in all my classes so I can get a scholarship for college” (2008 Participant L, small group interview, April 7, 2009). Another student wrote to the program director, “I would like to thank you because I have suddenly realized how much all of your work has done in such little time. You have inspired me and many of my peers to continue with full force the pursuit of our education” (2008 Participant Y, unsolicited email, September 14, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1932202X12439197">
<title>Academics</title>
<p>Participants self-identified academic gains in language, science, and study skills through program participation as well as increased persistence. Although only 16% to 17% (8/50, 2006; 5/29, 2008) agreed that they were “more intelligent” than their high school friends, nearly half (22/50, 2006; 12/29, 2008) agreed at the end of the program that they “work harder” than their friends. Similarly, at the end of the program, 50% (25/50) of 2006 participants and 36% (10/19) of 2008 participants agreed that the program made them “realize that I need to spend more time on my homework.” Their comments (spring 2009) reinforced these academic gains: “I started doing really well and better. I guess it taught me how to take notes and how to study for science exams and stuff” (2008 Participant X, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “I learned to pay attention more. And lots of new things to write on like for college essays. And that’s helped me a lot so far” (2008 Participant B, small group interview, April 7, 2009). Another commented, “First of all, I was not planning on taking hard science classes, but when I got AP Physics I stayed with it because they [program staff had] told me try to challenge myself instead of just like go for the easy way” (2008 Participant Y, small group interview, April 7, 2009). One 2008 student noted a follow-up email:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>Through the program . . . my life has changed significantly. Not only did I learn that I had to take harder classes but I also learned that I could take them and succeed in them. [ . . . ] School wise I am pleased to inform you that I am at a very great position and am taking some pretty hard classes like Calculus. (2008 Participant Y, unsolicited email, September 14, 2009)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1932202X12439197">
<title>Action</title>
<p>Indeed, participating students not only related changes in their attitudes and knowledge but also reported taking specific actions to improve their academics, including tracking themselves into more rigorous classes. In 2006, prior to statewide changes resulting in only college preparatory programs of study, many English-learning students were routinely placed into the “technology/career preparatory” track, which did not provide sufficient mathematics or foreign language credits for university admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12439197">Georgia Career Information Center, 2008</xref>). At the end of the program, 52% (26/50) agreed that the program made them “realize that I need to be on the College Preparatory Track and that I need to petition a change at the High School.” In fact, a month after the program, the assistant principal reported,</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>I have been very busy these past two days answering scheduling questions and moving those kids up to the honors and AP levels! They are very motivated and have a new found confidence that wasn’t evident during the initial registration process in the spring. Before they thought they couldn’t make it in the upper level courses, now they expect more from themselves and are willing to try. (Unsolicited email, July 25, 2006)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The 2008 participants’ Spring 2009 interviews also suggested that participant attitudes toward school and their capabilities changed notably, resulting in changed behavior: “Before I wasn’t really sure if I was going to go to college, ‘cause I wasn’t worried about it, and now I’m trying to get As and Bs in all my classes so I can get a scholarship for college” (2008 Participant L, small group interview, April 7, 2009). Other students commented, “So next year, my senior year, I’m taking psychology and AP biology, AP psychology” (2008 Participant X, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “I’ve been [doing] better than last year . . . better grades because of the GPA [requirements for college admissions]” (2008 Participant C, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “[This year] I took honors and AP classes” (2008 Participant R, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “Next year, I’m signed up for like four AP classes” (2008 Participant B, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “After doing [the program] I started taking more AP classes, and . . . being more involved in school activities” (2008 Participant B, small group interview, April 7, 2009).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1932202X12439197">
<title>Peer support</title>
<p>An emergent outcome was the extent to which participants created ongoing networks of peer support. Most participants did not know each other prior to program participation, but from it they created a high-achieving peer group that actively worked to support each other and to pass along their educational and social capital. Participant comments demonstrate this group formation: “We are learning about how to cooperate with each other and that helped” (2008 Participant B, small group interview, April 7, 2009); “[Now] I know most of the juniors, like [name] and she taught me how 11th grade is and all of the requirements to go into 12th grade and like the whole testing and the teachers and like the classes. . . . I have an idea of what to expect for the 11th grade” (2008 Participant M, small group interview, April 7, 2009). Participants actively found ways to share their learned capital:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>[A speaker recommended improving one’s résumé by] joining a school organization. . . . So, I thought about that and the next day a group of friends… and I started thinking to create a club for the school. And that was the summer after my freshman year. At my sophomore year, at the opening half, we sat at a table and at the beginning about a hundred or something signed up, but only 20 actually went to the meetings. The first idea or name was Latino Club but it changed to FLOW, Future Leaders of the World. (2006 Participant C, small group interview, April 7, 2009)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>School administrators confirmed that this club has continued to exist and to provide leadership to students at the school. In addition, 2006 and 2008 participants reported actively working to advocate more difficult coursework both to their friends and to incoming freshmen during the school’s orientation sessions: “I told some friends that they have to take AP classes, they have to change and get more responsible so they can get some scholarships or into good colleges” (2008 Participant S, small group interview, April 7, 2009).</p>

<sec id="section15-1932202X12439197">
<title>Transcript Analysis Results</title>
<p>The high school provided transcripts for 2006 and 2008 participants, showing their courses taken, grades, test scores, and graduation or other status. Although mediated through many other factors than program participation, this third-party information can provide a helpful balance for the self-reported perceptions of program impact.</p>
<sec id="section16-1932202X12439197">
<title>Grades</title>
<p>Participating students’ numeric course grades from their school transcripts were investigated as a possible pre- to post participation indicator of program impact for the 2008 and 2006 participants, as described earlier. The “term average/NGA” scores across high school terms are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1932202X12439197">Table 2</xref>. There was not a strong impact on grades pre- to post participation. (It is possible that participation lent a protective factor such that students’ grades through time may have declined more otherwise, or that effects in semesters beyond the first following participation would show different effects; however, this goes beyond the present analysis.) In addition, many of the students tracked themselves up into honors and advanced classes after the program and this could have had an impact on their NGAs.</p>

<title>Course track</title>
<p>As described earlier, qualitative data suggested that students’ action steps included changing the difficulty level of their coursework. To substantiate these claims, we counted how many of these participants’ high school courses prior to and after participation were listed in the transcript as “AP,” “Honors,” “Advanced,” or “Gifted” and calculated the percentage of total courses that were in these top tracks, to determine whether students tended to track themselves into higher track classes after participation. Although there was substantial variation (2006 participants ranged from 0% to 100% higher tracked classes pre- and 0% to 87.5% post participation; 2008 participants ranged from 0% to 100% higher tracked classes both pre- and post participation), the mean percentage of their classes in these upper tracks increased from pre participation to post participation, as did mean individual pre- to post participation change scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1932202X12439197">Table 3</xref>). This suggests that students did in fact “track up” to more challenging courses after taking part in the program.</p>

<p>This apparent “tracking up” seems to have a clear causal relationship to the program and may be attributed to the participants’ increased understanding of “what it takes” to get into college.

<title>Graduation rates</title>
<p>Actual participant graduation rates and college attendance are another indicator of program impact. Of the 52 initial participants in 2006, as of 2009 the school reported that 38 (73%) had graduated from high school. Another six had officially withdrawn from school; the remaining eight students were either still enrolled or had no data available from the school. According to the state’s Office of Student Achievement, in 2008, the participating high school’s overall graduation rate was 57.7% for all students, 46.0% for Hispanic students, and 32.8% for ELL students. For 2009, equivalent rates were 69.0%, 57.1%, and 41.6%, respectively. In addition, the school reported that at least 25 (48% of participating students and 66% of those who had graduated) were enrolled in colleges or universities. The majority of 2008 participants had not yet reached graduation age at the time the data were collected.</p>

<sec id="section20-1932202X12439197">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has a number of limitations which may impact the generalizability of these findings. For instance, although participants were not selected for the program based on academics, they were also not a random sample of students from this school; they self-selected to participate, which may indicate increased motivation toward academics than nonvolunteering peers. While triangulation with other data sources is helpful, self-reported student data are susceptible to biases. Small sample sizes and lack of a control group preclude a meaningful inferential statistical analysis, so data presented are primarily descriptive. Although there was no evidence that participants’ language proficiency influenced their responses, some data sources, such as the state high school graduation tests, were not intentionally designed for validity with English-learning populations. Finally, many other factors than program participation may shape students’ academic outcomes, so causality cannot be assigned definitively to the program’s influence.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>As a whole, the qualitative and quantitative data evaluated for this project paint a promising picture of the potential positive impact that a carefully crafted program can have, even when implemented as a short-term university outreach. Across two iterations, with fewer than 20 days of contact, these academic pipeline programs appear to have positively influenced participants’ understanding of what it takes to attend college and their willingness to strive to accomplish these goals.</p>
<p>This program’s participants represented a population (ELL and predominantly Hispanic/Latino) normally considered at risk for low academic achievement, dropping out, and low educational aspirations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1932202X12439197">Glennie &amp; Stearns, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1932202X12439197">National Center for Education Statistics, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1932202X12439197">Staples &amp; Dodd, 2009</xref>). Indeed, demographically similar peer groups in the same school and school district demonstrated the expected “achievement gap” in academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1932202X12439197">Georgia Career Information Center, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1932202X12439197">Governor’s Office of Student Achievement, 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, those students who took part in these enrichment programs showed strong academic promise and academic success.</p>
<p>What accounts for this success in reducing the achievement and aspiration gaps? In each iteration, the overall program matched recommendations for appropriate instructional design for immigrant secondary students. These included, for instance, an explicit focus on conceptual and language development; learning contextualized and grounded in students’ prior knowledge; explicit teaching of academic strategies, expectations, and norms; and engaging in collaborative and authentic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1932202X12439197">Walqui, 2000b</xref>). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1932202X12439197">Freeman and Freeman (2002)</xref> have recommended that high school English learners are best reached through engagement with “challenging, theme-based curriculum” and programs that include “collaborative activities . . . to build students’ academic English proficiency” and work to “create confident students who value school and value themselves as learners” (pp. 52-57); these summer programs thus seemed to provide exemplary instruction for the participating ELLs. However, beyond instructional design and delivery, other factors also seem salient in the data.</p>
<p>Recommendations for success for secondary English learners also highlight the importance of student identity, identity groups, and the creation of a community of learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1932202X12439197">Faltis &amp; Coulter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12439197">Flores-Gonzalez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1932202X12439197">Walqui, 2000b</xref>); in fact, the first principle identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1932202X12439197">Walqui (2000b)</xref> entails “the culture of the classroom foster[ing] the development of a community of learners, and all students are part of that community” (p. 1). Latino students in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12439197">Flores-Gonzalez’s (2002)</xref> case study who stayed in school and succeeded academically while their peers dropped out were “part of several tightly-knit, school-based peer groups that transcend[ed] school boundaries . . . Such relationships foster commitment to school, since students develop intricate and intensive relationships with their peers” (pp. 100-101).</p>
<p>Although not an original goal of the 2006 program, it seems likely that the peer support that participants provided to each other and even to others at their school who did not take part in the program helped to sustain the gains from the program and to create a microculture of academic high aspirations. For instance, 2006 program participants proactively contacted the high school’s assistant principal in charge of class assignments to ask to be “tracked up” into AP and honors classes. In addition, a core of the program students banded together to form study groups to support each other in these more challenging classes, and 2006 participants helped recruit and encourage 2008 participants to take part. Such actions reflect what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1932202X12439197">Flores-Gonzalez (2002)</xref> describes as a process in which academically successful Latino students used a “combination of factors that build, maintain, and consolidate the high status of their student identities . . . [bringing about] positive evaluations by others, prestige, and rewards, and fosters commitment through intense interaction with an extensive network of supportive people” (p. 96). The actions of the participants in the 2006 and 2008 programs also seem likely to have influenced how the administrators and teachers viewed these students and may have modified their expectations for them, further improving student outcomes through the Pygmalion Effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1932202X12439197">Rosenthal &amp; Jacobson, 1992</xref>). Although the current study was not set up to investigate the extent to which these variables were set in place by program participation versus other school-based factors, the comparison data do suggest that participating students outperformed their nonparticipant counterparts.</p>
<p>Longer term follow-up with program participants as their actual educational choices become clear, coupled with additional investigation into similar programs, their structures and their impact, can help determine the key success factors necessary for replication. With projected continued growth of underserved student populations in the “new Latino South” and beyond, such research can help ensure that future university outreach geared toward improving the educational pipeline not only bolsters students’ postsecondary aspirations and understanding but also actually leads to actions that successfully and reliably reduce the achievement gap.</p>

<p>Although the achievement gap is often viewed primarily in the context of minimum competency/being on grade level, by no means are all English learners underperforming. However, the achievement gap also persists with regards to high achievement, with static or growing “excellence gaps” evident between English learners and English-only students in National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data across grade levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1932202X12439197">Plucker, Burroughs, &amp; Song, 2010</xref>). Nationally, White students are about 8 times more likely to take Advanced Placement tests as Latino students, and “49 percent of all Latino AP test takers scored a 2 or lower” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1932202X12439197">Swail, Cabrera, Lee, &amp; Williams, 2005</xref>, p. 12). Georgia high school students classified as Limited English Proficient scored “pass plus” (the highest designation) on the 2010 Georgia High School Graduation Tests at rates ranging from 12% (social studies) to 27% (mathematics), compared with the “all students” rates of 36% to 48% on those same tests (Governor’s Office of School Achievement).</p>
