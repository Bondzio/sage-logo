<p><bold>Killer at 70,000 Feet: The Occupational Hazards of Flying the U-2.</bold> By Mark Betancourt, <italic>Air &amp; Space</italic>, May 2012, pp. 42–49. This article documents the decompression sickness (DCS) incident (the bends) that almost cost Col. Kevin Henry his life while supporting Operation Enduring Freedom in the Middle East. While flying a mission, he vomited into his pressure-sealed helmet and had to remove it, which exposed him to lower cabin pressure and accelerated DCS symptoms. Essentially, he lost his short-term memory, couldn’t recognize the purpose of displays and alarms, and had to rely on overlearned flying skills to maintain controlled flight. After multiple unsuccessful landing attempts, he landed successfully and had to be physically removed from the cockpit. The article documents efforts by the U.S. Air Force to eliminate or reduce DCS incidents, including pilot and crew resource management training.</p>
<p><bold>When the Car Is the Driver.</bold> By Steve Henn, NPR, February 17, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/17/147006012/when-the-car-is-the-driver">http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/02/17/147006012/when-the-car-is-the-driver</ext-link>. The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles passed a law that became effective on March 1, 2012, essentially licensing robotic self-driving cars. These vehicles will be equipped with a unique red license plate. Google’s robotic cars have driven more than 200,000 miles on both highways and city streets in California and Nevada. Part of the video, available at the link above, is shot from the robot’s eye view.</p>
<p><bold>Feds Seek to Disable Distracted Driving.</bold> By Chris Woodyard and Fred Meyer, <italic>USA Today</italic>, February 17, 2012, p. 1A. The Department of Transportation reported that “distracted driving claimed 3000 lives in 2010 alone and was a factor in 17% of police reported accidents.” It has proposed voluntary guidelines for in-vehicle devices that would disable “text messaging, Internet browsing, social media browsing, navigational destination entry, and phone dialing unless the vehicle is stopped and the driver puts it in park.” Also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/ntsb-recommends-banning-texting-cell-phone-calls-driving/story?id=15147547#.T3epWdmqG8B">http://abcnews.go.com/US/ntsb-recommends-banning-texting-cell-phone-calls-driving/story?id=15147547#.T3epWdmqG8B</ext-link>.</p>
<p><bold>Attentive Driving: Countermeasures for Distraction Forum.</bold> NTSB Forum of March 27, 2012, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2012/attentive_driving/index.html">http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2012/attentive_driving/index.html</ext-link>. The National Transportation Safety Board hosted a forum to discuss strategies for increasing attentive driving and decreasing distraction. Several members of HFES, including John Lee and Linda Angell (coeditors of the October 2011 <italic>Ergonomics in Design</italic> special issue on distracted driving), made presentations. The entire forum can be viewed at the link provided above. Topics included attention to nondriving tasks, distracted driving laws and enforcement, changing attitudes and behaviors, and technology and design countermeasures.</p>
<p><bold>Are Car Voice Controls as Distracting as Cell Phone Use?</bold> By Jayne O’Donnell, <italic>USA TODAY</italic>, April 3, 2012, p. B1. HFES member David Strayer describes his experiment involving voice-interactive systems. The results indicate that “when people in a simulator were using a system that let them receive e-mails and choose whether to have them read to them, . . . it took ‘significantly longer’ to react to brake lights ahead than when they were listening to the radio or talking on a cell phone.” Technology advocates argue that voice-interactive systems allow drivers to keep hands on the wheel and eyes on the road. Strayer counters, “Hands on the wheel and eyes on the road isn’t safe if the mind is not on the drive.”</p>
<p><bold>Shadow of the Titanic.</bold> By Andrew Wilson, <italic>Smithsonian</italic>, March 2012, pp. 32–40. <italic>Titanic</italic> mania has returned with the 100th anniversary of the luxury liner’s loss. This article, excerpted from Wilson’s new book on the topic, contains an interesting section that posits that an optical illusion may have contributed to the disaster (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Did-the-Titanic-Sink-Because-of-an-Optical-Illusion.html?c=y&amp;page=1&amp;navigation=thumb#IMAGES">http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Did-the-Titanic-Sink-Because-of-an-Optical-Illusion.html?c=y&amp;page=1&amp;navigation=thumb#IMAGES</ext-link>).</p>
<p><bold>Technology May Be Eroding Pilot Skills.</bold> By Jon Hilkevitch, <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>, March 19, 2012. This article describes recent aircraft accidents in which pilot reliance on automation was a major factor. Today, many pilots have minimal flight experience in aircraft with manual controls and are becoming the backup to the automation. As stated in the article, “It’s amazing how common it is to have a dimension where the pilot is out of sync with what the automation is doing.” Mode confusion errors need to be reduced and manual flying skills need to be upgraded.</p>

<p><bold>Top Driving Gripes.</bold> <italic>Consumer Reports</italic>, April 2012, p. 13. Texting was the most annoying driving behavior. On a 10-point scale, drivers rated texting on a cell phone while driving as 8.9, whereas talking on a cell phone while driving rated 7.6.</p>

<p><bold>Safer Passage.</bold> <italic>Time</italic>, March 12, 2012. This well-designed infographic (unfortunately available only to <italic>Time</italic> subscribers or from a library) portrays the reduction in fatalities from 7.2 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 1950 to 1.2 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2010.</p>
