<p><bold>The Problem.</bold></p>
<p>Women continue to be underrepresented in senior academic and general staff positions in universities internationally, and New Zealand universities are no different. In addition, there is limited empirical research on leadership development programs for women.</p>
<p><bold>The Solution.</bold></p>
<p>This article adds to knowledge in the area by describing and discussing the outcomes of the national New Zealand Women in Leadership (NZWIL) program, which is now in its 5th year of operation. A longitudinal case study approach has been adopted including surveys, phone interviews, and an independent evaluation. The findings suggest that the program has been successful on both an individual and organizational level. Individually, participants have increased their self-confidence and networking skills, enabling them, for example, to apply for promotion and gain it.</p>
<p><bold>The Stakeholders.</bold></p>
<p>Postsecondary leaders, human resource development (HRD), and leadership development professionals can learn from the findings of this program and adapt them to their context.</p>

<p>Universities are facing increasingly complex challenges in attracting and retaining human capital. Academic salaries, an ageing academic workforce, the impact of the performance based research funding, and a mobile and global academic labor market are just some of the pressing human resource influences. Yet despite the pressures on universities to maximize their talent pool, women continue to be systemically underrepresented in senior academic and general staff positions in universities internationally. This is despite the fact that women’s participation in tertiary enrollments is higher than men’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422311428747">Callister, Newell, Perry, &amp; Scott, 2006</xref>). Research indicates that women can assist with overall organizational climate and culture, aiding in the quality of outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311428747">Eagly, &amp; Johannesen-Schmidt, 2007</xref>) and that there is a need to increase diversity and with this the quality of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1523422311428747">Singh, Vinnicombe, &amp; Terjesen, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, women excel as leaders in universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1523422311428747">Thanacoody, Bartram, Barker, &amp; Jacobs, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>New Zealand universities are no different, despite the country holding on to fifth position in the 2009 global gender gap ratings scorecard published by the World Economic Forum. The New Zealand Census of Women’s Participation 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1523422311428747">McGregor, 2010</xref>) provides stark evidence of women underrepresentation in New Zealand’s universities, as is the case in most other countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422311428747">Benschop &amp; Brouns, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422311428747">Falkenburg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422311428747">Kloot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422311428747">Knights &amp; Richards, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422311428747">Krais, 2002</xref>). Women hold only 22.45% of senior academic positions in New Zealand’s eight universities and represent only 17.22% of professors and 28.02% of associate professors.</p>
<p>This article discusses the findings from a longitudinal case study of how New Zealand universities have embraced leadership development for senior women and, in particular, the main learning participants gained from the program. First, the link between human resource development (HRD) and leadership development is established, followed by a review of the literature pertinent to this research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1523422311428747">
<title>Human Resource Development and Leadership Development</title>
<p>HRD is the process of determining the optimum methods of developing and improving the human resources of an organization through training, education and development, and leadership for the mutual attainment of organizational and personal goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1523422311428747">Smith, 1990</xref>). A more macro view is offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311428747">Hamlin and Stewart (2011)</xref> who suggest that HRD is “any process or activity that helps or enables individuals, groups, organizations or host systems to learn, develop and change behavior for the purpose of improving or enhancing their competence, effectiveness, performance and growth” (p. 213). Although HRD comprises the skillful planning and facilitation of a variety of formal and informal learning and knowledge processes and experiences, these do not need to occur exclusively in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422311428747">Harrison &amp; Kessels, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the importance of leadership in organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311428747">Ardichvili and Manderscheid (2008)</xref> elucidate that it is not surprising that leadership development attracts the largest percentage allocation from training and development budgets of most organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1523422311428747">Rivera &amp; Paradise, 2006</xref>) and is among the most popular areas of HRD practice and academic research. Management and leadership are clearly a major strategic HRD concern, as building the capacity of strategic management of an organization depends heavily on the development of future managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1523422311428747">Ripley, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Central to the phenomenon of leadership is that it is a process; it involves influence, occurs within a group context, and involves goal attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1523422311428747">Northouse, 2007</xref>). Leader development programs are structured, often off-the-job events that bring individuals together for shared learning and development experiences, although they do vary widely in their content, pedagogical techniques, purposes, and targeted outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422311428747">McCauley, 2008</xref>). Despite the popularity of the topic, there is a dearth of information on leadership development programs that focus on the needs of women leaders and virtually no information on emerging women leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422311428747">Jennings, 2009</xref>). This is despite research which suggests that leadership development for women benefits both the individual and the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422311428747">Hopkins, O’Neill, Passarelli, &amp; Bilimoria, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The HRD literature provides avenues for women and their employers to consider, to foster diversity in academic leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1523422311428747">Thomas, Bierema, &amp; Landau, 2004</xref>). Women are in the majority as both students and staff in many universities worldwide but are still underrepresented at the senior and management levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422311428747">Browning, 2008</xref>). “The advancement of women in university leadership roles is strategically important to the tertiary education sector, to each of its stakeholders (from students through to staff, and those who use and benefit from university services), and indeed to the future of our societies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422311428747">Airini et al., 2011</xref>, p. 59). However, the progression of women into leadership positions in higher education is a complex and diverse process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422311428747">Flood, Johnson, Ross, &amp; Wilder, 2010</xref>). Although women have made advances in the academy, they have not climbed career ladders with the same speed or ease as their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1523422311428747">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, leadership development offers opportunities for organizational transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1523422311428747">Leonard &amp; Goff, 2003</xref>). This has been recognized by many Australasian universities that have implemented leadership development programs for women staff progressively since 1992, although articles are only available on a few evaluations: Women Research 21, University of New South Wales, 2003; Academic Women in Leadership Program, University of Melbourne, 2004; Leadership Development for Women Program, University of Western Australia, 2005; Flinders University Mentoring Scheme for Early Career Women Researchers, Flinders University 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422311428747">Browning, 2008</xref>). In New Zealand, a number of universities have their own women in leadership programs, such as the University of Auckland program which started in 2000. This program has specific objectives—increasing the numbers of women in senior positions, enhancing recruitment and retention of women in nontraditional areas and fostering training, mentoring and career development for academic and general staff women.</p>
<p>As women face unique challenges in leadership which are not always appreciated by others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422311428747">Hopkins, O’Neill, Passarelli, and Bilimoria (2008)</xref> stress that it is imperative that leadership development strategies are advanced to meet their specific needs. Women-only leadership training, along with other leadership development initiatives, is essential for women to develop a stronger sense of self and stronger relationships to other women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1523422311428747">Vinnicombe &amp; Singh, 2003</xref>). On the basis of their research on organizational transformation to advance women in academia in the United States of America, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422311428747">Bilimoria, Joy, and Liang (2008)</xref> call for empirical research that aims to identify the specific circumstances and structures needed for effective gender equity solutions within a comprehensive change project. This article provides empirical evidence to inform future leadership development programs for women within academia.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The New Zealand Women in Leadership (NZWIL) program is a leader development program, denoting that the focus of the program is developing individual leaders for universities in the New Zealand tertiary system. The term leader development is used to reflect “the expansion of a person’s capacity to be effective in leadership roles and processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1523422311428747">Van Velsor &amp; McCauley, 2004</xref>, p. 2). As developing and training aspiring leaders is complex, programs have to be appropriately sponsored, designed, and executed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422311428747">Dubrin, Dalglish, &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>). The NZWIL program is an example of a strategic HRD approach operationalized at a national level. This is well suited for as a small nation such as New Zealand, with a population of 4.4 million people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1523422311428747">Statistics New Zealand, 2011</xref>) and eight universities.</p>
<p>The NZWIL program was designed by women, for women consisting of 20 participants per cohort from the eight universities. In 2006 three partner groups: the EEO commissioner at the Human Rights Commission; the pro vice-chancellor of equity at Auckland University, and the New Zealand Centre for Women and Leadership agreed on a strategy to fund, develop, and deliver a specialized leadership program. The program was designed to build on the existing programs in two universities and break the circle of underrepresentation in senior positions as well as address the need for more female leaders in New Zealand universities. A commitment to fund the program for 5 years was gained from Universities New Zealand (then the New Zealand vice chancellor’s committee). This meant that each university agreed to centrally fund at least two participants on each program to the value of NZ$5000 per participant. Two residential programs are run in Wellington (the capital of New Zealand) each year—one for academic women (faculty) and one for general staff. In the first year, 2007, both programs were for female faculty, as the perceived need was seen to be greatest in this area. The focus of the program is similar for both groups with the only difference being the research day for faculty being substituted with a day on communication and building resilience (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1523422311428747">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The program was designed for women at upper-middle levels in universities in academic and general staff positions and catered for women who are in, or aspire to be in, leadership positions such as managers of sections or work units, senior academics (professor or associate professor), heads of schools/departments, associate deans, chairs of major university committees, or principal investigators on major research projects. The program aims to recognize and enhance women’s leadership capacities and influence within universities. It provides opportunities for participants to examine leadership attributes and reflect on strategies; increase knowledge of a range of management competencies relevant to higher education, the tertiary education sector, and of the research funding environment to develop strategies for securing grant monies; and build personal and national networks.</p>
<p>NZWIL is an example of a collective learning approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422311428747">Garavan and McCarthy (2008)</xref> explain that collective learning includes learning between dyads, teams, organizations, communities, and societies, highlighting characteristics such as relationships, shared vision and meanings, and cognitive and behavioral learning. More specifically, NZWIL takes the collective process of collaborative learning as a situation where a group of individuals learn from each other by engaging in discussion, reflecting on their experiences, and even exploring reasons for differences in judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422311428747">Jones, Connolly, Gear, &amp; Read, 2006</xref>), with the explicit objectives of benefiting the individual, the universities, and academics in New Zealand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1523422311428747">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The benefits of leadership development programs are numerous, including achievement of both individual and organizational objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422311428747">McCauley, 2008</xref>). As highlighted, however, research specifically on women’s leadership development programs is limited. The focus of this literature review is on the key benefits identified by NZWIL participants—developing self-confidence and networks.</p>
<sec id="section4-1523422311428747">
<title>Self-Confidence</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1523422311428747">Lee (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1523422311428747">2001</xref>), when individuals talk about their own development, they normally think of it as a voyage of learning and discovery. An integral element of this is the development of greater self-confidence or assurance in one’s judgments, decisions, strengths, and ideas. Research has indicated that increased self-confidence can result in performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311428747">Dickerson &amp; Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422311428747">Hollenbeck &amp; Hall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422311428747">Kolb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311428747">McCormick, 2001</xref>). Similarly, self-confidence has been identified as a key element of effective leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311428747">McCormick, 2001</xref>) and leadership development. Although there has been much debate about whether leaders are made or born, we contend that both self-confidence and leaders are made and can therefore be developed—which means there is a place for leadership development that results in increased self-confidence. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422311428747">Hollenbeck and Hall (2004)</xref>, we regard self-confidence as a “judgment” which is “based on perception,” that “can be changed” and “develops in self-reinforcing positive cycles” (pp. 257-258). They suggest that self-confidence has a direct relationship with performance and indirectly affects an individual’s motivation, perception, and thought processes. From their interviews with business executives, four factors can assist in the development of self-confidence—personal experience, others’ experiences, social comparison and persuasion, and emotional arousal.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422311428747">Kolb’s (1999)</xref> quantitative research examined predictors of leader emergence including attitude toward leadership, leadership experience, and self-confidence. Based on undergraduate student responses, her findings suggest that self-reported leadership attitude and leadership experience are strong predictors of leaders, with further research needed with regard to self-confidence as a predictor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311428747">McCormick (2001)</xref> draws on the work of Bandura to link social cognitive theory to leadership development, by arguing that self-confidence is very closely aligned with self-efficacy, a construct central to Bandura’s model. Following this approach, the importance of leader cognitions (including self-efficacy), leader behaviors, and the leadership environment are discussed. The notion of personal agency is a critical aspect of social cognitive theory asserting that individuals have the ability to influence their thoughts and behaviors. He concluded that no published research had considered whether a leadership development program had affected participants’ self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311428747">Dickerson and Taylor (2000)</xref> also refer to Bandura’s work on self-efficacy. Their quantitative findings based on female student responses suggested that “building self-efficacy may prevent self-selection out of leadership roles” (p. 203). Opportunities to hear from and talk with women in leadership roles may assist in “showing” women that they do have the ability to take on leadership roles. Similarly, having the opportunity to interact in a positive environment may enhance self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Leadership can be a difficult and at times lonely job, hence self-confidence is important. Another benefit of self-confidence according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422311428747">Kirkpatrick and Locke (1995)</xref> is increased emotional stability or the ability to keep one’s composure, which can be very important when resolving interpersonal conflicts or when representing an organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1523422311428747">
<title>Importance of Networks</title>
<p>The predominant view of leader development in the literature has been organizationally based. However, some scholars have directed attention to the broader concept of multiple developmental relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422311428747">Higgins &amp; Kram, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422311428747">Higgins &amp; Thomas, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311428747">Gibson (2008)</xref> explains that because access to developmental relationships within organizations is limited for women leaders due, in part, to the small number of suitable potential mentors and their exclusion from informal male dominated networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422311428747">Ibarra, 1993</xref>), the impact of extraorganizational developmental relationships for women leaders may be even more important for their advancement into leadership senior roles.</p>
<p>A key benefit of networks is that through their ability to connect women, they “disrupt the patterns of social connectivity at work that have for so long privileged men, and in so doing provide a new way to alter the balance of power between the sexes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1523422311428747">McCarthy, 2004</xref>, p. 11). Many of the networks supporting women at work are emergent, meaning that they were set up by an individual or a group of individuals, in response to an identified need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422311428747">Coleman, 2010</xref>). Coleman explains that most networks offer some combination of the two functions of <italic>support</italic>—that is the “expressive” function, involving friendship and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1523422311428747">Perriton, 2006</xref>) and <italic>instrumentality</italic>, promoting business contacts that will benefit the working practices of members of the network. Scholars researching successful women agree on the critical nature of informal networks for career progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1523422311428747">Linehan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1523422311428747">Simpson &amp; Altman, 2000</xref>). Networks enable women to develop alliances, acquire knowledge, gain visibility, and build a community of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422311428747">Cross &amp; Armstrong, 2008</xref>). Given the limited empirical research on the benefits of leadership development on women, this research sought to identify the key learning NZWIL participants derived from the program.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>A longitudinal case study approach was adopted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422311428747">Cresswell, 2003</xref>), focusing on the experiences of NZWIL participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422311428747">Seng (1998)</xref> suggested that qualitative researchers “do not really discover ‘truth’ . . . rather we glean facts . . . that contribute to socially situated, tentative, temporary understandings” (p. 45). Therefore, the aim is to understand the participants’ experience through analyzing their articulation of that experience via surveys and phone interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1523422311428747">Van Manen, 1990</xref>). This follows a social constructivist approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1523422311428747">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2000</xref>) where meanings are constructed by the participants as they engage day to day in their workplaces. This research provides a unique interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1523422311428747">Seng, 1998</xref>) of these women’s experiences. Rather than producing generalizations, this research will help us understand more about the value of national leadership programs for women in academia.</p>
<p>There is a dearth in the literature on the evaluation of leadership development programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422311428747">Riggio (2008)</xref> surmises that leadership development efforts are often evaluated by what is called in the evaluation literature, <italic>reaction criteria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422311428747">Kirkpatrick &amp; Locke, 1995</xref>), which involves the participants’ perceptions of whether they learned anything and/or believe that the leadership development program was successful, generally immediately postprogram. He explains that measure of <italic>learning criteria</italic> involving retention of training material and <italic>behavioral criteria</italic> referring to whether the leadership development efforts are indeed retained and put into action are advances on measuring just reaction criteria. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1523422311428747">Riggio (2008)</xref> argues that the “bottom-line” is <italic>results criteria</italic>, which address whether the leadership development program responsible for better performance, that is, did the investment in the leadership development program actually pay dividends to the organization? The NZWIL program was designed to increase the pool of women in senior academic and managerial positions in the tertiary education sector through their identification and encouragement to fulfill their potential, increase visibility and their desire to “come to notice.” The program was also designed to assist the New Zealand vice-chancellors’ committee to address in a cost-effective manner gender imbalance in senior academic and managerial positions and progress equitable employment outcomes at a time of public interest and of tertiary sector reform. Our own longitudinal research together with that of an independent evaluation indicates that there have been tangible positive outcomes for both the individual participants and their universities. Furthermore, the significant numbers of women promoted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1523422311428747">Table 2</xref>) illustrates that the NZWIL program has delivered the desired results.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>We constructed our case study containing evaluation of the NZWIL program using three approaches over the longitudinal time frame, contacting all program participants at least twice up to 3 years postcompletion. First, we conducted a postal survey consisting of 28 open and closed questions including participants’ demographics, leadership roles within and outside the University, career development, and the NZWIL program. The survey was administered 12 months postcompletion of the program, ranging from 2008 to 2010. Ninety-six had been surveyed at the time of writing this article. This resulted in a response rate of 54% (<italic>n</italic> = 52, including 36 faculty and 16 general staff). A content analysis of the responses was conducted resulting in 24 different categories with networking and increased confidence being mentioned the most often. As a tangible measure of these two program benefits, success in promotions, an area where women often are less successful, is included.</p>
<p>Second, all 155 NZWIL alumni were contacted by phone and email in January 2011 requesting feedback on similar areas as the postal survey, with the addition of a question on program development for NZWIL. Seventy-six women responded (49% response rate). For the purpose of this article, the focus will be on the responses to the question on key learning the women gained from the program: networks and confidence.</p>
<p>To advocate for a further 5 years funding and commitment by Universities New Zealand for NZWIL, an independent evaluation was also conducted on behalf of the NZWIL steering group by the lumin group. We draw on some of their qualitative findings gained from interviewing key NZWIL program stakeholders such as senior university sponsors, participants, presenters, and university leadership development champions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1523422311428747">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>The independent evaluation concluded that the program enhanced leadership capacities and influence, with participants highlighting the following learning from the program:</p>
<list id="list1-1523422311428747" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Unlocking participant’s potential and strengthening their commitment to being leaders</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being sought for leadership roles both within and beyond current role across the university, not necessarily as part of an appointment or promotion process</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being more confident in their own ability and contribution</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Being clearer and more focused on their own career aspirations and the steps to achieve this</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The existence of NZWIL alumni within each university and across the eight universities provides a network of support and encouragement that is valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1523422311428747">Lumin, 2011</xref>, p. 2).</p></list-item></list>
<p>The findings from the survey and follow-up phone calls in January 2011 highlighted the importance of networking with other women across the tertiary sector and increased self-confidence.</p>
<sec id="section8-1523422311428747">
<title>Increased Self-Confidence</title>
<p>Although not an explicit objective of the program, NZWIL clearly led to an increase in self-confidence, as reported by 80% of participants, exemplified by selected responses below. This increase in confidence has then been translated into action by among other things applying for promotion, taking on new leadership roles within the university, speaking out at university meetings and providing clarity in terms of career direction. These actions suggest that participants’ self-efficacy also improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311428747">McCormick, 2001</xref>).The following are examples of participant responses:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Confidence to apply for an A/Prof position despite being told I was not experienced enough. Confidence to argue my position when I believe I have a point to make which I think means others take me more seriously as a career person.</p>
<p>WIL was absolutely critical for me in terms of having the vision and courage to apply for such a big promotion, securing the support of my manager, and writing the application. I think, most of all, the course gave me a vision and strategy for thinking about and working toward success. It encouraged me to think bigger, to be audacious, to believe in capability—and not to fear asking for recognition. It really changed my thinking.</p>
<p>The program assisted me with being more confident about contributing to debates and issues. In the past I was more likely to expect that no one would be interested to hear what I had to say and that it was a mistake that I had risen to the position I had.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As evidenced in the phone follow-up in January 2011, more than 75% of alumni have taken on leadership roles since participating in NZWIL. These roles are varied in nature including, but not limited to, journal editorships, chairing committees, HODs, and running research centers.</p>
<p>The findings would suggest that similar to the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422311428747">Hollenbeck and Hall (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311428747">Dickerson and Taylor (2000)</xref>, these women benefited from not only hearing from other women leaders as presenters on the program but also having the ability to network with their peers and learn from them. As one woman commented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>From a personal level I am much more confident and resilient than I was prior to the WIL program. I am also more open and truly value the way in which my fellow participants shared their experiences and wisdom. This has stayed with me since I was on the course.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, these findings provide empirical evidence for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1523422311428747">McCormick’s (2001)</xref> assertion that there has been no published research to suggest that leadership development programs can lead to an increase in self-confidence and self-efficacy. Other areas where increased self-confidence has been of benefit to participants are for example, more clarity about their career, operating in a male dominated environment and job satisfaction, as evidenced by the following observations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Increased confidence in my ability to succeed. Increased feeling of control over my career direction. Confidence to take opportunities.</p>
<p>It has given me more confidence and the ability to trust my own judgment and ability, especially when working in a male-dominated environment.</p>
<p>Primarily confidence and increased self-belief, which is contributing to better job satisfaction in my current position since that is where I am likely to be for a while!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1523422311428747">Table 2</xref> illustrates, just more than half of the faculty respondents have applied for and gained promotion since completing the program, with a further three gaining promotion through a new appointment. Five general staff respondents applied for promotion, with all but one being successful. In addition, seven general staff respondents gained promotion through applying for a new appointment, which is not surprising given that the “promotion process” is clearly established for progression through faculty career structures, but career paths are neither well established for general staff roles nor typically supported by a “promotion process”, hence promotion for general staff is often gained by acquiring higher level appointments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422311428747">
<title>Networking</title>
<p>The findings would support the notion of broader multiple developmental relationships as advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422311428747">Higgins and Kram (2001)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422311428747">Higgins and Thomas (2001)</xref>. In many ways, it could be argued that the NZWIL network is an excellent example of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422311428747">Coleman’s (2010)</xref> notion that networks offer both support and are instrumental in achieving outcomes pertinent to its members. This is exemplified in the following participant responses:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The networking among participants and presenters. The caliber of the women on the course provides a measure for me to see how I am performing as a senior manager. It is very humbling to be able to email the presenters with a problem and get an instant response.</p>
<p>Importance of relationships emphasized which has transferred into me taking my staff away on a 2 day retreat.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the networking with other women, being able to see them as role models, swapping stories and being able to receive and give advice was really valuable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The value of the NZWIL network is not just that it is nationwide, but that it reaches beyond the academic environment. It has also encouraged participants to foster networks within their own universities. This was expressed by participants as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I now have a wonderful national (and international) support network to draw on . . .</p>
<p>Development of networks both on campus and across the NZ university sector. New research interests and subsequent projects.</p>
<p>Motivation to connect with and encourage other women in university positions to advance in their leadership development.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Our findings indicate that the networks were also particularly helpful in assisting with promotions as the following comment exemplifies:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Just heard I have made it to Associate Professor! I have to say the networks established through NZWIL were instrumental in this. Earlier in the year when I discussed my possible application with my DVC, after only counting up the publications he thought it was a bit marginal. Very demoralized I sought a second opinion from some colleagues on the NZWIL course who were very supportive and encouraging and helped me revamp the application. Thus, the support I got from them resulted in me submitting an application and has yielded a great result.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other benefits of networking have been the development of the alumni conference which has been held biannually and is organized by the alumni.</p>

<sec id="section10-1523422311428747" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>NZWIL has been successful in part because it has followed the five guiding principles for leadership development advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422311428747">Fulmer and Bleak (2008)</xref>: start with the top, link leadership development directly to the business, build an integrated leadership strategy, drive consistency in the executive of leadership programs, and hold leaders and the organization accountable. First, there has been an ongoing strong joint organizing and steering committee which garnered the support and political interest of the New Zealand vice-chancellor’s committee, now Universities New Zealand—it started at the top. Second, its nationwide approach removed any institutional competition and as such has contributed to the nation’s talent pool of female leaders within academia. Third, the program design linked directly to the business of the university with a good balance of context and personal, together with high caliber international and national speakers. Fourth, the strength of alumnae voice and networks has meant that those universities which did not have an integrated leadership strategy for women have either now developed one or are in the process of doing so. Fifth, by continuously seeking feedback on the program internally and independently, we have been able to hold the leaders and organizations accountable. Perhaps one of the strongest endorsements came from one of the vice-chancellors as part of the independent review who said “the NZWIL program is the best thing that the university has done for university leadership development ever.”</p>
<p>Our study raises interesting implications for HRD and leadership development professionals. Although leadership development and the advancement of women are clearly an important issue for the New Zealand university sector, the multiorganizational sector response to the problem of women’s progression is one that other industries can adopt. The benefits of leadership development conducted in sectorwide peer groups were clear from our findings, showing that learning may be enhanced when beyond the individual workplace as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422311428747">Harrison and Kessels (2004)</xref> posit. Although leadership development programs vary widely in their content, pedagogical techniques, purposes, and targeted outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1523422311428747">McCauley, 2008</xref>), we stress the critical importance of a visible presence by senior organizational leaders during the program as well as appropriate levels of resourcing to develop and sustain strong program offerings. In addition, robust and ongoing longitudinal evaluation of programs to determine the key benefits for participants enable continuous improvements to be made to content and delivery as well as understanding how the program added value to the participants’ leadership development journeys. As is the case in other industries, the progression of women into leadership positions in higher education is a complex and diverse process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422311428747">Flood et al., 2010</xref>). It is therefore imperative to collect empirical evidence to highlight the importance of programs specifically designed to meet the needs of women leaders, as discussed in this article based on the NZWIL program, in order to increase women’s visibly in leadership positions worldwide.</p>
<p>As we enter our 5th year of operation, we are looking to the future. For 2011, we have instituted a scholarship for Maori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and Pacifica women to attend in an endeavor to increase the number of women from these minority backgrounds to attend. A further 5 years commitment from Universities New Zealand has also been secured. In addition to the biannual alumni conference we are exploring the options of road shows around the country so as to reach as many women as possible within the university sector.</p>
