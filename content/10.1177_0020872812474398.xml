<p>The articles in this issue reflect the wide diversity of methods, approaches and issues covered in social work research. Each study poses interesting questions for educators, practitioners and policymakers in today’s world. We hope that reading these articles will inspire you to think critically about the many taken-for-granted assumptions that pepper the profession.</p>
<p>Amartya Sen’s work is familiar to many of <italic>ISW’s</italic> readers. Dheeshana S. Jayasundara considers the relevance of Sen’s human development and capability perspectives in the field of reproductive health and social work in ‘developing countries’. The author does this in the hopes of redressing the absence of meaningful theoretical frameworks applied to this area of practice. Jayasundara attributes this state of affairs to the marginalised place that reproductive health occupies in the terrain of social work theory and practice. While Jayasundara concludes that Sen’s human development and capability approach can assist practitioners in enabling women to make choices about their reproductive rights, this aspect of human affairs remains full of controversies and Sen fails to provide guidelines that will assist practitioners in dealing with these.</p>
<p>The article by Sara Ashencaen Crabtree and Richard Williams focuses on the ethical issues raised for researchers doing cross-cultural research and the significance of their position as ‘outsiders’ in limiting both response rates to an on-line survey on inclusive education and the conclusions that could be derived from their data even though local interpreters/translators were used in follow-up attempts aimed at increasing the response rate. The subject matter of their research – inclusivity across social divisions in education in various Arab societies with specific historical cultures despite their common bond of Islam, particularly those linked to disability – is important in its own right. The authors call for further research into both topics.</p>
<p>Generational inequity has become frontline news as the age of austerity ushers in cuts in public expenditures that impact on everyone, but are applied differentially so that older people and children and young people have very different experiences of the decisions politicians make in reducing budget deficits. Job opportunities and the ability to purchase a house are seen as particularly important in many Western societies and young people’s limited access to these have turned them into sites for the further exclusion of children and young people from resources to which they have a claim. Martha Ozawa and Yung Soo Lee examine generational inequity in social spending in their article. They utilise household-level and country-level aggregate survey data to see how social spending impacts upon older people and children in 13 OECD countries by referring to the <italic>OECD Social Expenditure Database</italic> (SOCX). Additionally, they explore the age-profile of social transfers for these countries by drawing upon data from the <italic>Luxembourg Income Study</italic> (LIS). They found that in the US, social spending tended to favour older people more than in the other countries, although all 13 did so to some extent. However, Nordic countries spent more on children than the others. The authors conclude that US policymakers should increase social spending on children rather than reduce it for older people and suggest that these could be defined as an investment in the country’s future.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism, cultural competency and anti-racism are hotly contested terms with considerable implications for practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872812474398">Bhatti-Sinclair, 2011</xref>). Moreover, these concepts are ‘locality specific and culturally relevant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872812474398">Dominelli, 1997</xref>). Jun Sung Hong, Charu Stokes, Soo-Jung Byoun, Sharlene B.C.L. Furuto and Young Sook Kim unpack the term multiculturalism as it is utilised in contemporary South Korea as social workers in that country seek to include cultural competency in social work education and practice. Drawing heavily on American understandings of cultural competence, they locate their exploration of the subject within the diverse demographics of South Korea, and ask whether and to what degree cultural competency training can become an integral part of social work education in South Korea. Focusing primarily on refugees from a number of countries, their analysis does not consider the relevance of cultural competence as it applies to those of South Korean descent, although this is clearly an issue for future research.</p>
<p>The issue of whether welfare services should be centralised or devolved to the lowest level where delivery actually occurs is a vexed one. Nilan G. Yu’s article examines the devolution of social welfare services in the Philippines as articulated through the Local Government Code of 1991. He explore the its ideological underpinnings of moves to devolve services and considers its implications for social welfare by conducting a survey, interviewing 10 Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officers and then holding a focus group amongst 11 participants at a conference organised by the Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officers Association. As in other countries, Yu argues that devolution should result in greater local control over welfare resources. However, Yu’s findings suggest that devolution produces disparities in social welfare support services across municipalities and cities. This, he believes, has dismantled the Filipino national welfare system and in turn has undermined Filipino citizenship because entitlement to services varies according to one’s place of residence.</p>
<p>The issue of suicide is a fraught one, not only for those affected by an untimely death, but also for the practitioners who have to deal with the aftermath and also the researchers who attempt to shed more light on practice in the hopes of improving it. In their article, C.F. Cheung, W.M. Wang, and Zeno C.S. Leung appraise the suicide risk assessment tools utilised in the Hong Kong context, particularly in light of the capacity of information to be systematically stored, retrieved and utilised by practitioners working in this area. Their research considers a ‘knowledge management system in which both “rule-based reasoning” (RBR) and “case-based reasoning” (CBR) are used. The research assesses the strengths and limitations of this approach, and the authors suggest that a case library system can assist and support decision-making, but there is a need for further research to refine these systems further.</p>
<p>The responsibility to care for social workers is a responsibility that is shared between workers themselves and their employers. Failing to take care of social workers’ mental health and capacity to carry on with the job is an ever-present danger in a profession that is constantly dealing with crises and trying to resolve some of society’s most intractable problems. Isabel Hombrados-Mendieta and Francisco Cosano-Rivas consider this issue by analysing the effects of burnout in a sample of social workers from Malaga in Spain, using a structural equations model. Their findings indicate that burnout has a negative impact on workplace support, job satisfaction and life satisfaction. This outcome can be altered through workplace support because this factor has a positive influence on job satisfaction. In such situations, workplace support becomes a variable that mediates between burnout and job satisfaction, and enhances the latter by lowering stress levels. Consequently, the negative effects of burnout are reduced and those of job satisfaction and life satisfaction are increased. The authors also suggest further research to capture the wide range of factors that result in burnout amongst social workers.</p>
