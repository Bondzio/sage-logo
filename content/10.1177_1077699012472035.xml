<p>This readable volume takes readers back to the zany (and deadly, as it turns out—this book begins with a murder) days of offshore British pirate radio stations that briefly thrived by beaming American and British pop music to eager listeners. The pirates rapidly overcame any appeal offered by a stuffy BBC, which couldn’t be bothered with popular culture. And in so doing, the pirates’ growing threat to establishment media soon led to their own destruction as Parliament moved to change necessary laws to put them out of business.</p>
<p>Johns, a professor of history at the University of Chicago and a specialist on intellectual property and piracy, has written a solid study of how the pirate broadcasters came to be—and what happened to them (they laid the ground work for the inception in 1974 of legal commercial British radio stations). There are numerous books on pirate radio stations, but this one is more serious than most of them, relating how they fit into and yet fought with the then monopoly of the BBC in British radio.</p>
<p>Along the way, the reader meets a variety of establishment (and decidedly not-so-establishment) characters, but this is really a story about a shift in the British broadcast landscape from radio that was good <italic>for</italic> you to radio you <italic>wanted</italic> to hear.</p>
