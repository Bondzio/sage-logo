<abstract>
<p>The social environments of people with dementia are complex and still not fully understood. Investigating how residents in a dementia care setting navigate and participate within social groups is critical as the therapeutic benefits of social engagement are unequivocal. An ethnographic study of social environments within a dementia care residence revealed that there is active socialization and even strong and lasting friendships formed between people with dementia. Many of these relationships were observed to be a part of groups, ‘nested’ within the larger social environment. These ‘nested social groups’ had unique dynamics and their structuring was often influenced by outside factors (e.g. physical environment and staff preferences). The existence of these groups has implications for the experiences and quality of life of the residents in long-term care. Nested social groups will be defined and their function within the social environment will be discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421188" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>People who enter long-term care (LTC) settings experience a radical transition from their past to the new experiences that now constitute their lives. The ‘person’ is now a ‘resident’; their home is now a LTC setting (at least in the view of others); and their family and friends, some of which are new, now exist mainly within the context of this new environment. The residents of many assisted living (AL) settings and nursing homes (NHs) often have little exposure to the outside world. All of the <italic>necessary</italic> elements of life are provided within the confines of the LTC complex, thus making trips outside one’s ‘home’ no longer a required part of the older adult’s life. In essence, entering a LTC setting is like entering a new world – with an amalgamation of the norms, rules, practices, and other social and cultural elements brought in by the different people living and working in the setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421188">Morgan et al., 2011</xref>). The new culture that forms within the LTC setting is often different from that which defined the previous life of the resident. The transition to a LTC facility from one’s home is recognized as a major life transition by older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421188">Aminzadeh, Dalziel, Molnar &amp; Garcia, 2009</xref>). Being uprooted from one’s home can be jarring. The adjustment to the new setting can be difficult. In fact, moving to a LTC setting has been associated with negative outcomes such as depression, isolation, and poorer psychological, social and health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421188">Aneshensel, Pearlin, Levy-Storms &amp; Schuler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421188">Gaugler, Zarit &amp; Pearlin, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>It can be inferred that this transition into a LTC setting is most difficult for people with dementia. The person with dementia enters the new and unfamiliar environment, usually not by choice, that is filled with other people, few of whom the resident thinks he/she recognizes, acting in ways that are difficult to understand. All of the exit doors that can potentially allow the person out of this unfamiliar place are locked or lead to another area that the person does not recognize. The person with dementia now lives in a place that he/she struggles to understand. These factors can further complicate adjustment to the setting. Understandably, residents often express feelings of confusion concerning the place and people who surround them. Over time, such feelings of being out-of-place may dissipate and many residents may become comfortable and resolved to being in the setting.</p>
<p>Our main focus in this paper is on how people with dementia integrate into the social environment and the social structures that form as a result of this integration. The dynamics of social life are extraordinarily complex and this is only compounded when examining the interactions and relationships among people living in a dementia-specific LTC facility. By applying and building on previous theoretical and empirical research on socialization and social networks, we will describe the concept of ‘nested social groups’ and demonstrate the various ways in which the composition of the social environment is influenced by individual residents’ characteristics and the physical and organizational environments that exist in the LTC residence. Understanding patterns of interactions and how they are influenced is important because of the strong benefits that social engagement can have on the quality of life for people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421188">de Rooij, Luijkx, Declercq &amp; Schols, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421188">Miranda-Castillo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421188">Steeman, Godderis, Grypdonck, De Bal &amp; De Casterlé, 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421188"><title>Benefits of social engagement</title>
<p>The value of social relationships throughout the life course, regardless of a person’s abilities or limitations, is well established. Friendships have been linked to psychological and emotional well-being and better physical functioning for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421188">Avlund, Lund, Holstein &amp; Due, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421188">Krause, 2010</xref>). Conversely, there are negative consequences (e.g. poor perceived health, depression) associated with losing friendships and having one’s social networks decrease (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421188">Krause, 2006</xref> for an overview of this body of literature). Two of the many life events that have been linked to significant changes in social networks and friendships are (1) a transition into LTC from the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421188">Dupuis-Blanchard, Neufeld &amp; Strang, 2009</xref>) and (2) a decline in cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421188">Kiely, Simon, Jones &amp; Morris, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a vast literature in multiple disciplines about friendships in old age (as reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421188">Adams, 1989</xref>) and more specifically within the broad context of LTC environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421188">Eckert, Zimmerman &amp; Morgan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421188">Powers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421188">Retsinas &amp; Garrity, 1985</xref>). This literature has established that cognitive abilities are critical to the formation and maintenance of friendships. Memory (both shared long-term memory and short-term memory), recognition (of people and objects), greetings, and conversing are among the relevant abilities often affected by dementia. Although these factors can interfere with the ability of the person with dementia to establish friendships, research on how friendships are established and maintained throughout the course of dementia has been described as lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421188">Hubbard, Tester &amp; Downs, 2003</xref>) and, unfortunately, this description is still correct.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421188">Diaz Moore’s 1999</xref> study remains one of the few published works which focused on the social environment of people with dementia in LTC. Diaz Moore identified a range of social relationships that were observed between residents with dementia (e.g. congenial friendships, cliques, and confidant relationship) and demonstrated that these social relationships are affected by factors such as an organizational drive to maintain task efficiency, a concept relevant here and which will be further discussed in this paper. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421188">Diaz Moore (1999)</xref> and some of the other research focused on the social environments of people with dementia (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421188">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Marx, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421188">McAllister &amp; Silverman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421188">Phinney, Chaudhury &amp; O'Connor, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421188">Teitelman, Raber &amp; Watts, 2010</xref>) have begun to elucidate the great complexity in these environments, but additional work is needed to understand fully the extant dynamics of social relations. What is clear from this previous research is that people with dementia remain fully capable of participating in and forming social relationships, communities, and groups.</p>
<p>One of the relevant research questions that remains unanswered in this area is, ‘Can persons with dementia overcome some of the dysfunction in cognitive and physical ability that could potentially impede social functioning within a LTC unit?’ The present study sought to examine the social and physical environment in one LTC setting, and to learn if and how people with dementia form social groups within the setting. This paper will focus on how the social environment was structured, the groups of residents that formed, and how socialization occurred among the residents. Before discussing the social structure of this setting, however, a few conceptual clarifications are necessary to understand better the meaning of <italic>nested social groups</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421188"><title>Social structure</title>
<p>It is important to distinguish between a social group and a social network so as not to confuse them and the corresponding literature discussed in this paper. In its most basic sense, a social network refers to a ‘specific type of relation linking a defined set of people, organizations, or communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421188">Trotter, 1999</xref>). Social networks are composed of multiple, intertwined social relationships that have specific meanings, purposes, and configurations within and beyond the immediate network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421188">White, Boorman &amp; Breiger, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>However, although sociological theory and research have continuously refined and expanded the concept of social networks as distinct from ‘groups,’ many theorists have pointed to the closeness of the two concepts in regard to the analysis of their meaning and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421188">Fine &amp; Kleinman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421188">Fuhse, 2009</xref>). The concept of ‘social group’ was used in early <italic>interactionist</italic> perspectives on society and was developed as a unit of measurement to look at the culture of small social groups, membership therein, and the interactions that occur within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421188">Blumer, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421188">Fine, 1979</xref>). The major distinction between these two concepts, network and group, is the boundedness or degree to which the individuals within a particular cluster of people are isolated from others outside the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421188">Fuhse, 2006</xref>). The term ‘network’ describes a loose binding or interlinking among individuals as sets of people that can extend beyond the immediate social environment to connect multiple clusters. For example, a person may belong to many social networks and therefore connect many sets of people through network membership. Unlike networks, a social ‘group’ is more tightly bound or restricted. Members of a group are understood to have more direct and immediate connectedness within a primary context than networks. The concept of ‘groups’, bound within one context, is more descriptive of the social structure of the residential dementia care environment we observed because this type of setting limits the residents’ abilities to extend beyond their immediate surroundings, and, thus, restricts their interactions to the people living, working, and visiting in the residence. However, even within this one environment residents are often bound within distinct clusters of people.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1471301211421188" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>Data for this paper were collected as a part of a larger ethnographic research project examining the social environment of one dementia-specific LTC setting, Cedar Hill. Cedar Hill provides assisted living and skilled nursing levels of care to a total of 126 residents. Assisted living describes a level of care in which residents are usually able to ambulate with little assistance and complete many tasks of daily living with minimal help from staff. Residents needing skilled nursing care generally are unable to ambulate without a wheelchair or require other direct assistance (e.g. eating). Cedar Hill’s explicit organizational commitment to providing person-centered dementia care to all residents was reflected in its operating mission statement and marketing materials. Residents were split among three AL houses with 20 residents in each and two skilled nursing care houses for 66 residents. Data collection focused on Magnolia House, one of the three AL houses. Over the course of 12 months (2009–2010), observational and interview data were collected from both resident and staff participants in Magnolia House. This study was reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s Institutional Review Board.</p>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421188" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-one residents living in Magnolia House participated in this study. All of the residents were staying long term in Cedar Hill and each had a legally authorized representative who gave consent for the person to be approached to participate in research. When the residents gave assent, a battery of measures was administered to evaluate each resident’s cognitive and physical functioning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421188">de Medeiros, Saunders &amp; Doyle, 2011</xref> in this issue, for a detailed description). Although these scores will not be used systematically in this paper to evaluate the effect of functioning on social participation, some of these data will be used to make inferences about the potential role that an individual resident’s characteristics can have on group formation and social interactions. Some of the residents (<italic>n</italic> = 12) were also interviewed regarding their perspective on friendship and the relationships that they had with other residents (if they said they had any). At the beginning of the study, staff participated in formal interviews that focused on the social environment and their perspectives of the residents’ relationships and how much each resident got along with other residents. Audio taping was done as a part of the interviews with residents and staff members. In addition to the interviews, informal, off-the-cuff, conversations with the participants were used as a part of the observations to clarify further the elements of the social environment or residents’ relationships.</p>
<p>Observations of the social environment were completed during the morning, afternoon, and evening, and focused on the resident-to-resident interactions that occurred and how other factors within the environment influenced the social relationships. A research team member also participated in the day-to-day activities in the setting by casually talking with and/or helping the residents or staff (e.g. telling a resident where they can find something, helping to pass meals in the dining room, etc.). Observations were documented in multiple ways: (1) detailed ethnographic field notes; (2) digital audio recording of resident participants’ conversations with each other; (3) video recording of specific residents’ social groups; and (4) social mapping (recording the location of residents sitting in a specific location at different periods of time).</p>
<p>On average, 5 hours of field observations were completed by the research team each week. While in the field, the researchers wrote short notes that were later used to trigger memory when writing full field notes after leaving the house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421188">Bailey, 1996</xref>). The majority of the data were in the form of field notes, but there were also approximately 20 hours of video and audio recordings of the residents in their social groups. The observations were concentrated in the common areas of the Magnolia House (dining room, parlor area, television enclaves, and hallways). Private domains, such as residents’ rooms, were entered only if the researcher was invited by the resident.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421188"><title>Analytical approach</title>
<p>To assess how the residents’ social environment was nested within the physical environment of Cedar Hill, the field notes and social maps (52 maps of resident rooms; 113 maps of the common areas) collected over 12 months were analyzed. These data were used to place the residents spatially within the physical environment, to determine the locations in which residents were intermingling, and to identify residents who interacted with each other.</p>
<p>It is important to note that for the purposes of this paper, these data were not used to perform a systematic evaluation of the social interactions within this environment, but rather to provide some insight as to the unique structure in which people with dementia socialize and interact within this small environment. The goals of this analysis were to: (1) examine critically the structure of the social environment of a dementia care facility as observed through ethnographic fieldwork; and (2) use these observations to contribute to the extensive theoretical work in sociology, psychology, and gerontology in regard to social networks and groups.</p>
<p>To analyze the patterns of the data, the data were first reviewed by research assistants to identify the sections where interactions between residents occurred. These interactions were then coded by the research team through the use of a detailed codebook containing criteria for each code. First, the interactions were coded as positive, negative, or neutral and then were thematically analyzed through the use of inductive coding in which a selection of transcripts were reviewed to establish a list of common themes (e.g. joking, information seeking, helping, mutual interest, social norm/custom, and environment). Analysis was done using a mix of individual and team coding where at least two research team members each coded a transcript, compared their codes, and reconciled any discrepancies (58% of observational data were team coded). As is typical with analysis of ethnographic data, the research team formally and informally reviewed and discussed the data as collected during the fieldwork. The ongoing analyses examined the observational and interview data for patterns, which were then used to guide additional data collection to clarify elements of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421188">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Presented in this article is one of the central patterns of the social environment of Magnolia House: <italic>nested social groups.</italic></p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec7-1471301211421188" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we will describe the specific meaning of nested social groups, the factors that influence their formation (e.g. physical design barriers and organizational preferences), and use specific residents to illustrate the complexities of the Magnolia House social environment.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421188"><title>Nested social groups</title>
<p>The concept of nested social groups refers to the clusters of residents who were frequently observed in close proximity to each other and interacting with one another. These groups were ‘nested’ within the larger physical environment of Magnolia House. The concept of nesting was borrowed from the social ecology model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421188">Bronfenbrenner, 1977</xref>). Bronfenbrenner proposed that environments should be understood and examined as multiple-level structures nested within each other. These levels are referred to as being nested because although they are thought of as having distinct elements, each level influences the other. For example, according to this theory, the microlevel of an environment includes interactions between individuals, but these interactions are directly influenced by macrolevel patterns of the culture in the environment (e.g. institutional rules). Thus, relationships among people are nested within the local cultures of the setting and both levels interact and influence each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421188">Bronfenbrenner, 1979</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar structure of the residents’ social environment was observed, thus making the nesting concept applicable. Distinct social groups among residents were formed and these individuals had patterns of interactions that were specific to the others in the group. Groups varied in size as did the frequency, quality (e.g. positive or negative), and types of interactions among the residents within them. The social interactions of many residents were limited to the other residents who were part of their immediate group. Outside each group of residents was a larger social environment containing other residents, direct-care workers, family members, scheduled activities, and sections of the building with additional social groups. The environment’s physical design, the setting’s organizational factors, and the characteristics of residents influenced the plasticity (or degree to which group composition changed over time) of the nested social groups. These elements of the larger social environment directly affected the experiences of the small groups of residents (as we will describe below) even though the direct interactions between them were limited. As such, the small groups of residents that formed were nested within the larger social environment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211421188">Figure 1</xref> for a diagrammatical representation of the social group ‘nesting’). Interestingly, the degree to which a group and/or a resident engaged with the surrounding social environment varied both within and between these clusters of residents. This variation will be described further when examining the factors that influence the formation of these nested groups.

<p>Although most residents restricted the majority of their social engagement to the other members of their group, some residents were observed interacting with residents and staff members outside the primary cluster of people with whom they associated most often. These residents will be called <italic>bridging residents.</italic> The bridging residents were able to overcome the organizational, physical design, and individual characteristics that were identified as <italic>barriers</italic> to social relations with other residents from other groups. The <italic>barriers</italic> described in this paper are factors that affect a resident’s social opportunity structure. The social opportunity structure consists of those elements of the social and physical environment that impede or facilitate residents’ socialization with others as individuals and with certain compositions of the nested social groups within Cedar Hill. In discussing the barriers observed in this setting, we will integrate how some of the bridging residents were able to overcome obstacles and also show how LTC organizations, researchers, and direct-care workers can minimize the effect of barriers in the social environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421188"><title>Factors influencing nested social group formation: physical and organizational environments</title>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421188"><title>Physical environment</title>
<p>Many of the factors influencing residents’ opportunities to interact with other residents were related to the physical environment. It has long been established that there is a dynamic interplay between a person and his or her environment and that the nature of this relationship is largely dependent on the ‘fit’ between the individual’s competence (as variously defined) and the structure of their environment. Especially relevant to the present study is the assertion that one’s physical environment becomes more salient and often more restricting as the competency to navigate one’s surroundings declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421188">Lawton &amp; Nahemow, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421188">Lawton &amp; Simon, 1968</xref>). Much of the recent work in this area has focused on the interplay between the environment, the person, and the structure of his or her social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421188">Calkins, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421188">Wahl &amp; Lang, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, in this section we focus on two elements of the physical environment of Cedar Hill to demonstrate their direct impact on the structure of the social environment and the interactions that do and do not occur between the residents, specifically: (1) the demarcation of houses by locked doors; and (2) the physical layout of Magnolia House.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421188"><title>Demarcation of houses by locked doors</title>
<p>Although all the residents and staff members of Cedar Hill were contained within one building owned and operated by a single company, the setting was physically divided between the AL and skilled nursing levels of care, which were separated by locked doors. The three AL houses were located on the left side of the building; skilled nursing on the right and on a basement level. Administrative offices were located between AL and skilled nursing care sections. The only time that residents from the AL section interacted with skilled nursing residents was during optional weekly religious services or other rare, formal activities.</p>
<p>Within the AL section, a walking loop connected the three AL houses, a suite of staff offices, and a public gathering room that included a fireplace, chairs, and couches. Although doors between the three houses were often locked, preventing residents from walking more than a few hundred feet on the walking loop, the doors were occasionally opened, depending on the staff on duty. When access to the walking loop was available, the fireplace room could be considered a sort of <italic>social ecotone:</italic> a tension and transition area between two or more adjacent social environments. Many residents, staff, and family members who walked around the loop passed through the fireplace room and occasionally would interact with each other. Such an ecotone between distinct social environments (e.g. two different AL houses) could be a possible way to create a bridge between nested social groups and expand the social connectedness in the dementia care setting.</p>
<p>The doors, which when locked impeded the residents’ movement between houses and spaces, held a great deal of power over the possibility of socialization. We note that getting to the other houses while the doors were locked was possible for a few residents. These residents’ abilities (such as, walking unassisted and conversing with others) helped them overcome the barrier of the locked doors to interact with other AL social groups (bridging groups). One bridging resident, Madeline, would seek out a staff member when the doors were locked and ask that they be opened, which they often were. There were many reasons why Madeline was able and permitted to bridge her environment whereas others could not. The first was her ability to walk freely without assistance, remember her way around the building, and verbally communicate her wishes to others. In addition, Madeline had a well-known interest in the facility’s cat, which lived in a staff member’s office, and would express her desire to visit the cat, which most staff members would facilitate. When asked why they would almost exclusively grant Madeline access to the other houses when the doors were locked, staff said they knew that Madeline would always come back shortly and that they would not have to spend time looking for her if they needed her. Based on this and other cases, it eventually became clear that the staff’s motivations regarding the doors had a great deal to do with organizational factors such as the need to maintain task efficiency, such as passing out medicines, and reduce burdensome work, such as looking for residents.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1471301211421188"><title>The physical layout of Magnolia House</title>
<p>Magnolia House was ‘U’-shaped, with 10 residents’ rooms comprising each side of the ‘U’ and the kitchen, common dining area, and main door at the bottom of the ‘U’. The large, enclosed kitchen, located at the center of the dining room, constituted approximately one-quarter of the entire dining area, and, because of its size, split the dining room into two distinct halves. There was a large parlor room to the left of the dining room with multiple armchairs, recliners, and couches. This parlor area was often the site of smaller staff-initiated organized group activities in the afternoon and early evening within Magnolia House. This concentration of formal activities brought increased flow of Magnolia House residents to this common area in the time between meals. Although it was highly variable based on the time of day, most residents did not stay in their rooms, but rather spent most of their time in the dining room and the parlor room and it was in these areas where we observed the nested social groups. Aligning with previous research in dementia care settings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421188">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>), the majority of social interactions happened during mealtimes and although sitting at the same dining room table did not automatically lead to conversations, it increased their likelihood. The frequency of interactions in this environment may have been due to the close proximity of residents, the inherent social nature of eating with others, the availability of conversational topics, or a number of other factors.</p>
<p>We did observe what seemed to be an imaginary division between the left and the right side of the house. For example, the majority of the residents who lived on the right hallway sat on the right side of the dining room whereas those who lived in the left hallway sat on the left side of the dining room. This division seemed to be largely a consequence of organizational practices, which will be discussed later, but there was also a perception among some of the residents that the dining room was concretely divided by the kitchen. When we asked residents about this separation in seating and social interactions, some described the other side of the dining room as if it were a world away. When asked if shetalked to any of the residents who sit on the other side of the dining room, one resident, Patricia, said ‘Yeah because I knew them before that [the kitchen] was put up’. Patricia went on to indicate, however, that she no longer went to the other side of the dining room since the kitchen was remodeled, creating a more distinct division between the two sides. Patricia saw her social environment as the area limited to her side of the dining room and pointed to the large kitchen in the middle of the room as a barrier to getting to the other side.</p>
<p>The differences in peoples’ ambulatory ability influenced the impact of such physical structures as the kitchen. Those residents who could not easily walk, like Patricia, who needed assistance with her walker, were often restricted to the side of the dining room closest to their room. Although residents could, in theory, choose their own seats, staff members were observed guiding them to seats that they (the staff) had selected. Patricia was essentially limited to a nested social group of two. She was helped each day to a two-person table. Bessie, her tablemate, had great difficulty with hearing, making communication between the two unsuccessful and leading to misunderstandings and negative interactions between the two women (e.g. arguing and yelling). The reasons that this seating arrangement was continued were observed to be strongly linked to organizational factors (e.g. focus on task efficiency). These will be discussed in greater detail in the next section.</p>
<p>Unlike Patricia’s situation, there were many residents who walked without difficulty and often made their own choice regarding where they sat. Interestingly, residents who sat on the side of the dining room that was opposite to where their room was located, or who bucked the left/right trend of dining room seating, were the residents who were more physically and socially active, again pointing to additional influences that individual factors (such as physical and cognitive) have on the composition of nested social groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421188"><title>Organizational environment</title>
<p>The organizational environment, specifically choices made by staff, had a great deal of influence on some nested social groups. To continue with the previous example of tablemates, Patricia and Bessie, staff members we interviewed said that the two were not a good match and that Patricia, who enjoyed talking with other residents, was not able to be socially engaged while sitting next to Bessie. When asked why the two continued to be seated at the same table, some said it was the easiest place to put the two and that, because of Patricia’s tolerance of Bessie’s loud coughing, Patricia was the least likely to cause problems <italic>for the staff</italic> with this arrangement. Despite the negative personal aspects of this nested social group, staff found the seating locations to be easy to manage. The table was near the hallway to the residents’ rooms and it took only minimal effort to guide the two women to their seats. In this and other cases, ease of task completion rather than optimal resident engagement guided staff decisions regarding residents’ seating and therefore influenced the composition and quality of some nested social groups such as Patricia and Bessie’s. At times, when there was an empty seat at a nearby table, Patricia would attempt to sit elsewhere, but her seat near Bessie was considered by staff to be Patricia’s seat. The case of Patricia and Bessie hints at the underlying organizational factors that also influence the residents’ groups.</p>
<p>Two nursing assistants were assigned to Magnolia House for each shift and they were responsible for the care of the residents on one side of the house. One of the nursing assistants in the building stated that seating residents together on one side of the dining room allows one to ‘keep an eye on your residents’. Also, with residents close to their rooms, it makes it easier for staff members to take the residents back to their rooms quickly if they need to use the toilet after lunch. This did not apply to residents who could walk well or residents who were continent because in these cases the staff member was not affected by the residents’ location in the dining room. This reinforces the crucial role that a resident’s ability to act independently of the staff members has on the composition and size of the residents’ social world.</p>
<p>Another example of the primacy of task efficacy shaping group composition was between Abigail and Doris who had a nested social group based on their perceived abilities to help and to receive assistance. Abigail, who sat at Doris’ table, helped Doris eat and take medications. This behavior was not perceived as ‘helping’ by the nursing aides working in the dining room, but was instead perceived as hindering the aides’ ability to feed and give medications to Doris. One of the nursing assistants said that Abigail’s ‘mothering’ needed to stop and the next day the two residents were separated at lunch. Abigail remained in her normal dining room seat but Doris was moved to a different section of the dining room. It is of note that Doris, who was unable to move without assistance, was the person who staff decided to move. Although moving Doris decreased the number of interactions between these two residents, it did not sever the relationship. After the move, Abigail continued to help Doris by walking to her new table and again trying to convince her to eat her food. The interactions decreased over time as Abigail’s ability to walk well decreased. This act of staff overriding residents’ preference to sit next to each other is an example of what Kitwood called imposition – ‘forcing a person to do something, overriding desire or denying the possibility of choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421188">Kitwood, 1997</xref>). This type of interaction between staff and residents, as well as 16 others, has been identified as ‘malignant’ to a person with dementia as it can negatively affect the person’s self-esteem, well-being, and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421188">Kitwood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421188">Sabat, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421188">Sabat, 2001</xref>). There were many additional examples of staff preferences dictating seating arrangements, interactions, and, in turn, the composition of the nested social groups. As such, the powerful role of staff decisions on a resident’s immediate social environment is certainly something that needs to be considered. This relates back to the concept of nesting as it demonstrated the interlinking between groups and the surrounding environment. The staff were not members of these social groups but their decisions and actions regarding the completion of tasks influenced the socialization and the agency of these residents.</p>
<p>Completion of tasks was not the only organizational factor that influenced group composition. The biases of nursing assistants regarding who should sit together also came into play. One specific example was the ‘men’s table’. The staff members in Magnolia House frequently talked about how all the men should sit together because they often interacted and were all friends. This perspective, however, did not align with the actualities of the interactions in this nested social group. Interactions between the residents at the men’s table were infrequent and these men actually held more meaningful and regular conversations with people outside their dining group. The men did not often socialize with each other. In spite of this fact, however, and because they were men, staff members believed that the best social environment for these residents would result from their sitting together during meals. Even though the male residents did not frequently talk to each other, this perception of the strong friendships between the men continued and this group composition was never reassessed by the staff members in Magnolia House.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211421188"><title>Continuity of nested social groups</title>
<p>Our final observation regarding nested social groups is the continuity of these groups in different environmental contexts. As was demonstrated in the previous sections of this paper, nested social groups were often formed within the dining room and influencing their ordering principles were a number of organizational and physical design factors. Although formed and maintained by the interactions occurring in the dining room of Magnolia House, these nested social groups extended beyond the dining room. Residents who sat and interacted with each other during meals would often congregate outside of the dining room during both formal and informal activities. Even when residents were brought outside of Magnolia House to the garden room for an activity, the people within the nested social groups most often sat next to each other. This was a consequence of both the personal choice of the residents and staff influence.</p>
<p>Those people who could walk to the activities independently would often seek out the other residents whom they recognized in the group of people and sit next to them during the activity. Also, many times the residents of a given nested social group would walk to the activity together because they were already near each other when they were asked by the activities person if they would like to attend the event. In essence, there was a ripple effect of dining room seating, except in the case of those at the men’s table. Because activities were often held after meals, the residents sitting together were frequently brought to the activity together and sat together. By remaining proximate, the residents of a nested social group were encouraged to continue moving through the environment together. As for the individuals who could not get to the activity independently, it was at the discretion of the staff member to seat them where he or she thought best. Observations demonstrated that this was often near the people with whom they sat in the dining room.</p>
<p>Notably, this trend of continuity between the dining room and social groups that formed during activities was not as strong for the male residents who sat at the men’s table. For example, Bob sat at the men’s table every day and was often observed greeting the other men when they arrived for meals. However, when he attended the activities, he often sat next to Madeline (the bridging resident who was a part of the women’s group). Bob and Madeline formed a strong and lasting nested social group that existed only <italic>outside</italic> the Magnolia House dining room. There were also two other men (John and Ed) who frequently went back to their rooms after meals in lieu of attending the activity. It was unclear why this dining room nested social group broke down in other parts of the building. It is possible that the pressure from staff on certain male residents to sit together during meals did not extend outside these times leading to the residents to choose to interact with people outside the men’s table group. Clearly, it was a choice on the part of the men not to be with one another when they had the opportunity to make the choice – something that they did not have in the dining room where they seem to have been ordered, or at the very least strongly encouraged, to sit together.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1471301211421188" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The existence of nested social groups is integral to the social life of people with dementia living in LTC homes and social interactions are important factors affecting their quality of life. This paper addressed some of the factors that influenced the formation and composition of these groups, including those in the physical environment and those involving the actions of staff members.</p>
<p>In regard to the physical environment, the placement of locked doors restricted the movement of residents within the larger social environment and for some residents the kitchen in the middle of the dining room was even seen as a barrier to mobility between nested social groups. To many residents the physical environment restricted their opportunity to interact with other people in the social environment. The spectrum of the environmental influences on social engagement supports the environmental docility hypothesis, which states that people with lower competence (e.g. people with significant cognitive impairment and/or limited mobility) are more prone to the effects of environmental press (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421188">Lawton &amp; Simon, 1968</xref>). In other words, people with lower ability to navigate their environment will exhibit less agency than they would if they had increased ability or facilitative help by staff. In essence, residents within this setting with lower competence had less choice and responsibility when it came to determining their group membership. This lack of choice not only affects the quality of residents’ social interactions (as in the situation with Patricia and Bessie), but could also lower the resident’s perceived well-being and participation in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421188">Langer &amp; Rodin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421188">Martin &amp; Younger, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In Magnolia House, there were both intended and accidental barriers created in the physical environment. The kitchen redesign was done by the organization to improve the aesthetics of the house (even though this was largely unsuccessful) and had only accidental consequences on some of the residents’ ability to interact with each other. On the other hand, the locked doors were intentionally used by certain staff members to restrict the residents’ movement to the inside of the house. The negative effects that intentional barriers have on the residents’ social experiences should be assessed by LTC organizations and caregivers when making decisions regarding the social environment. The residents’ wishes to move safely throughout the environment should be considered as being of equal importance to the sometimes conflicting needs of the staff members to achieve task efficiency. This focus on task efficiency and the staff members’ incorrect beliefs regarding residents’ relationships were also barriers to some of the residents in this setting. Regardless, decisions about activities and setting lay-out made by staff were made without awareness or recognition that residents develop social relationships with other residents on their own and that these relationships use and preserve their remaining cognitive and social capacities. Lack of such awareness is therefore tragic and unproductive.</p>
<p>The findings presented in this paper also illustrate the central role that staff members have on the formation of nested social groups and the residents’ ability or inability to interact with other people in the environment. Staff members can directly force some residents to sit with other residents (e.g. moving Doris to a new table) and they can indirectly restrict certain interactions by implementing some barriers between people (e.g. locking the doors). Nested social groups that are compelled and do not have positive social dynamics can result in ongoing negative or non-stimulating social interactions between residents (e.g. men’s table). Negative social interactions, such as these types of pairings, have been shown also to have negative consequences for the residents’ well-being and the types of behaviors they manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421188">Kitwood, 1997</xref>). However, purposeful seating based on perceived compatibility could be beneficial for the residents and may be an easy path to facilitating friendships between residents. Encouragement to meet other people and join other dining room tables could open the door to the development of friendships between people who otherwise would not have crossed paths. Although purposeful seating <italic>could</italic> be beneficial <italic>in principle</italic>, it would have to be borne out by the staff members’ observation of a positive interactions between the residents and not based on the convenience of other people in the environment.</p>
<p>Bridging residents, like Madeline, who was a part of the women’s group, were able to break down the physical and organizational barriers and essentially fell outside the model of nested social groups interacting with residents throughout the entire AL section of Cedar Hill. However, Patricia was restricted by the barriers and, in turn, was isolated from many of the other residents, even those in different sections of Magnolia House. The majority of residents had very limited social networks and were limited almost exclusively to their nested social groups, thus making the group dynamics all that more important to them. It is in these cases where attending to the quality of interactions and changing the nested social groups if necessary can improve the social engagement of residents and could produce a better social experience for a person with dementia living in a LTC setting.</p>
<sec id="sec16-1471301211421188"><title>Limitations of the present study</title>
<p>The concept of nested social groups and the barriers that influence their formation were identified within one dementia care facility and, as such, no attempt at generalization is being made in this study. Regardless of the lack of generalization, this study identified a specific social structure (nested social groups) and described the social context in which these people with dementia lived. Future research will determine the degree to which the present findings apply to other LTC homes.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this research was that it was not able to assess and incorporate the meaning that the residents attributed to the relationships and interactions that they had with the people in their nested social group. Social network research has moved beyond focusing primarily on the structure of the relationships in networks to describe the cultural and interpersonal complexities (such as shared meanings) of these relationships and groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421188">Fuhse, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421188">Yeung, 2005</xref>). Examining the meanings that residents, staff, and family assign to nested social groups is a topic that should be addressed in future research. However, this type of research in a dementia care facility may present many difficulties.</p>
<p>The decision not to examine fully the meaning structure (shared meanings and expectations between people) of these social groups was made for multiple reasons. First, the type of data available for analysis would not have been sufficient to assess fully this element of social groups because the resident-to-resident conversational data (available through audio or video recording) was limited in number of hours and the documented field notes were not used to collect these data systematically. Also, even if the qualitative data were collected to examine the meaning structure of the nested social groups, there would have been, for a number of reasons, a great deal of difficulty in determining the meanings of the relationships between people with dementia.</p>
<p>One reason is that many residents experience some difficulty verbally communicating with others and as such it could be difficult for the researcher to determine the nature of some relationships or interactions. Also, even if communicative ability remains intact for the people in the observed groups, the meanings they assign to their relationships may differ from others in the group (lack of shared meaning and reciprocity) or they may change drastically over time. These meanings may shift with a resident’s perception of who the others in the group are and the environment around him or her. A person’s perception of the surroundings can change daily or even in a matter of an hour. The ephemeral nature of perceptions of an environment, including the social environment, presents a challenge to examining the creation and reproduction of meaning in a relationship between two people with dementia in a LTC home. More audio, video, and written data focusing on the meanings assigned to nested social groups would help to examine more deeply the complexities of these groups. Future research should build on this study and use the nested social group as a unit of measurement to examine the meaning structures in these groups and also how altering their composition could influence the residents’ social engagement and quality of life.</p>

<bio>
<p><bold>Patrick J. Doyle</bold>, MA, is a doctoral candidate in Gerontology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. His research has focused on how caregiving practices, physical environments, and social interactions influence the lived experience of people with dementia residing in long-term care settings. In his dissertation research, he is examining how a person-centered model of care is interpreted and applied by various stakeholders within a dementia-specific long-term care setting.</p>
<p><bold>Kate de Medeiros</bold>, PhD, is Assistant Professor of Gerontology in the Department of Sociology and Gerontology, Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. Her research focuses broadly on the construction of selfhood in old age and includes work on friendships and self-expression/performance through autobiographical writing for a variety of older populations. She has published work on the complementary self in old age, narrative explorations of selfhood, neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, and the meaning of suffering.</p>
<p><bold>Pamela A. Saunders,</bold> PhD, is an Associate Professor in Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry at Georgetown University School of Medicine. Her research focuses on the preserved, communicative abilities of persons with dementia. In addition, she teaches medical students how to communicate in clinical settings.
