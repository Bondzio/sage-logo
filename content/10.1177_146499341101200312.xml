<p>Employing a critical theoretical perspective, Hannam and Knox have written a well-grounded introductory textbook for tourism studies that succeeds in exposing students to the various areas of post-structuralist research in the field. The authors use social construction as a jumping-off point for exploring issues related to tourism, including mobility, the environment, embodiment and performativity, among others. The text is written with engaging yet challenging language and is organized into 11 chapters, each followed by student activities and a glossary of important key terms. A consideration of some of the text’s more notable features follows, as well as a word regarding its potential incorporation into course reading lists.</p>
<p>At a time when textbooks are increasingly designed as entertaining, vapid tomes with negligible scholarly value, this text is refreshingly Spartan. Hannam and Knox clearly emphasize concise, engaging and challenging writing that asks students to consider the complex realities of tourism, especially from a critical perspective, while setting aside intricate graphic design that invariably belies educational text. The authors successfully negotiate the difficult and fuzzy line between accessibility and scholarly writing. They are aware of the audience’s nascent grasp of tourism studies and critical theory, and they approach new and potentially complex ideas of both with a manageable familiarity that students will respond well to. One of many examples can be found in introducing their social constructionist approach in the opening pages of the text, where the authors write:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…we accept that there are objective facts about extant things in the world, but that meanings we place upon these things are socially constructed: a beer may be a beer, but it has a whole host of social meanings according to the social context in which it is produced, poured and consumed. (p. 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Such writing does much to break down the wall between the scholar and the student, thereby placing a spotlight on the relevance of the material and ultimately enhancing students’ appreciation for the field. Additionally, the text is well cited, which allows readers an all too rare chance to further investigate individual concepts on their own.</p>
<p>The text achieves what all good textbooks must; namely, to provide a thorough overview of the material in an informative yet generalized way, thereby functioning as a jumping-off point for further inquiry. The choice of subjects that make up the 11 chapters adequately introduce readers to the variety of avenues critical tourism research may take. Areas as seemingly disparate as examples of the ironic negative environmental impact of ecotourism to female sex tourism in the Caribbean are discussed with equal authority, and the reader is always aware of the critical perspective that unifies the topics. That being said, the authors do at times struggle to achieve balance between theoretical examinations and their real-world manifestations. For example, the discussion of Orientalism and the Other lacks the tangibility of that about the tendency for history to be rewritten by those who control it, in which evidence is provided in the form of the Viking heritage festivals in Scandinavia and the Archeological Survey of India’s management of The Residency at Lucknow. Likewise, Las Vegas and Dubai are discussed as fitting examples of hyper-real, commodified spaces, yet the discussion of transportation and nodes of mobility as they relate to tourism is without such illustrative examples. This minor grievance is easily overlooked, however, and should hardly be considered a deficiency. Admittedly, some theoretical constructions have been heavily researched while others have not.</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary nature of tourism studies is a recurrent underlying theme in the text, and Hannam and Knox effectively introduce readers to key developments in related fields that inform critical inquiry into tourism. Examples include the exploration of elaborations on sociologist Erving Goffman’s division of front and back stage areas in the chapter on performing tourism, the role of archaeology in interpreting the past and the important contributions of social theorists including Jean Baudrillard, Guy Debord and Cynthia Enloe regarding hyper-reality, spectacle and gender, respectively. The consideration of the interrelated nature of social research serves as a gentle reminder of the relevance and benefit of the perspectives different fields provide.</p>
<p>The text is highly recommended for consideration by instructors of tourism studies courses whose aim is to familiarize students with a critical and/or post-structural gaze, while a secondary audience would be those seeking greater familiarity with the emerging field of tourism studies. The material may be too complicated for lower-level undergraduate students to be effective, but the text is certainly suitable for upper-level undergraduate and even introductory graduate courses. Likewise, the student activities that follow each chapter are more suitable for students that have had more exposure to scholarly research. Given the introductory nature of the text as well as the breadth of the field, however, incorporation of the text in reading lists would perhaps best be supplemented with additional materials that delve deeper into critical inquiries of tourism.</p>
