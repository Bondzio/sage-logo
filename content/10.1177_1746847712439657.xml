<p>Pure, non-digital animation is created using a multitude of techniques, from painting, sculpture, drawing and etching to puppets, sand on glass and even knitting (<italic>The Last Circus</italic>, Vera Neubauer, 2007). Besides craft and arts-based creative techniques, some filmmakers use photographs and film as a basis for their work, incorporating these images into other techniques (<italic>Picnic</italic>, Paul Vester, 1987) or almost exclusively using photographs and fragments for collage and assemblage, such as Stan VanDerBeek’s <italic>A La Mode</italic> (1957) and <italic>Science Friction</italic> (1959). Some of the first ‘trick’ films were live-action films that used a simple technique to create animation – stop-frame – to change the profilmic setting, actors and/or objects of live-action film. Edison’s <italic>The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots</italic> (1895) replaced an actor’s body with a puppet that was then beheaded; this substitution became known as ‘stop trick’ and was widely used and further refined by Georges Méliès and others to transform live action into animation film. These are some of the first manifestations of Norman McLaren’s oft-cited maxim: ‘What happens between each frame is more important than what exists on each frame’, applicable to both drawn (McLaren’s subject) and photography-based animation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1746847712439657">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Photography and celluloid-based film offer animators a medium to work with that has a wide range of potential uses. One of the most innovative discoveries to exploit live-action film for animation was the Fleischer Brothers’ rotoscope technique patented in 1917 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847712439657">Langer, 1993</xref>, for the debate around its invention that is followed by informative illustrations for the 1917 patent). This method was widely used internationally, from Disney’s <italic>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</italic> (1937) and <italic>Princess Iron Fan</italic> (1941), to George Dunning’s <italic>Yellow Submarine</italic> (1968) and many experimental and animated shorts (Robert Breer’s <italic>Fuji</italic>, 1974), music videos including A Ha’s <italic>Take on Me</italic> (1985) and Nina Paley’s 2008 feature, <italic>Sita Sings the Blues</italic>, that used Flash to rotoscope a videotaped dancer. Rotoscoping is used in documentary animation and this journal has published a number of articles that explore this technique (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847712439657">Fore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847712439657">Goodwin and Dicker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847712439657">Telotte, 2010</xref>), including the recent Special Issue <italic>Making It Un(Real): Contemporary Theories and Practices in Documentary Animation</italic>, guest edited by Jeffrey Skoller (<italic>animation: an interdisciplinary journal</italic> 6(3), November 2011).</p>
<p>As the shift to digital animation techniques advances and tangible materials are replaced by pixels, the still or moving photographic image has functioned as a bridge between photochemical, material-based image making and digital techniques. In a discussion of Walter Benjamin’s theory of film, Lutz Koepnick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847712439657">2009</xref>: 127) suggests rotoscope and digital rotoscoping are techniques that raise</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>fundamental oppositions between what happens in front of the camera and what we may see on screen … that tend to place viewers in a position of ongoing incredulity and uncertainty, constantly probing and suspicious of the ontological reliability of what they see on screen.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A pivotal artist whose work invigorated principles of rotoscope into film studies debates of perception and spectatorship was Bob Sabiston, creator of the Rotoshop technique and attendant software. Contributions for the themed section of this issue of <italic>animation: an interdisciplinary journal</italic> concentrate on his works. Guest Editor Paul Ward’s Introduction maps out the engagement of the authors of this issue with Sabiston’s interpolated rotoscoping technique used in short and feature-length films. We thank Paul, a champion of Sabiston’s work, for his initiative for this themed issue – it was a pleasure working with him.</p>
<p>The themed section is followed by an essay from Thomas Walsh (coincidentally a colleague of Ward’s at the Arts University College at Bournemouth) that explores an adaptation of James Joyce’s <italic>Ulysses</italic>; the animated short <italic>Ulys</italic> (Tim Booth, 1997). ‘Animating Joyce: Tim Booth’s <italic>Ulys</italic>’ uses close textual analysis of the film and literary texts to investigate social and political notions of ‘Irishness’, both in Joyce’s times and in a framework of Modernism. As Editor of this journal, and having written on Joyce’s polysemic and animated ‘cineantics’, I am especially pleased to publish this interdisciplinary article as it contributes to a growing area of Joyce Studies that centres on film.</p>
<p>In this issue’s <italic>Reviews</italic> section, instead of books our authors provide details of events that can generate ideas for new writing on animation. Bella Honess Roe’s review of the exhibition <italic>Watch Me Move: The Animation Show</italic> at the London Barbican Art Galley in 2011 is both enthusiastic and constructively critical, describing the richness of exhibits on display and posing questions about curatorial aims. Nicola Dobson’s review of the Edinburgh 2011 Animated Realities conference summarizes the main themes and a number of paper presentations, and she provides the filmmaker discussions. The conference took place as we were finalizing the Special Issue on Documentary Animation; like Dobson, we also look forward to seeing more scholarship, in this journal and elsewhere, on this sub-genre of animation.</p>
