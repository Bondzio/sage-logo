<p>The book is important reading on communalism for scholars and researchers in South Asia; especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh who have had to bear the brunt of partition. But what set this book apart is its focus on majority-minority binary that emerged out of partition and subsequent depletion of secularism in two Bengals. Most researches so far have focused on communalism in Northern India and Pakistan. Thus, it also acts as an addition to the knowledge of the state and its relationship with minorities and communities in South Asia.</p>
<p>The book has two sections which are further divided into nine chapters spread over 214 pages. Chapters have been very well-sequenced. In section I, first three chapters deal with Muslims in West Bengal and the fourth deals with Hindu refugees who in-migrated to India. Section II focuses on Hindu minority in Bangladesh since partition. The book has covered the time span of almost sixty three years that is, since partition until now.</p>
<p>The very first chapter by Sekhar Bandyopadhyay jolts the ‘imaginary’ social calmness in West Bengal. It recreates the moments in history that conditioned the formation of the Muslim ‘ghetto’. In 1950, the society in Bengal was communally polarised. This chapter is a reflection these deep divisions that caused heavy losses to life and property of Muslims who had decided to reside in India and permanently subjected them to the bias.</p>
<p>The second chapter captures communal biases which linger on society as well as the state. Authors give example of exclusion of backward and Dalit Muslims from the purview of reservation policy while it included socially and economically upwardly-mobile Hindu castes like <italic>Telis</italic> and <italic>Jogis</italic>. The explanation for this anomaly is that there is no reliable information about these categories due to the Partition and subsequent creation of Bangladesh. But that does not entirely explain the biases against Muslims and their lack of representation in government jobs. This actually concurs and strengthens the findings of Sachar Committee Report.</p>
<p>The woes of Bengali Muslims don’t end here as they are also victim of India’s effort to ‘push back’ and ‘cleanse’ from foreigners. Chapter three actually captures the essence of India’s policy of ‘push back’ and links it with the issue of communalism. Authors look at New Delhi’s approach towards the question of migration, both Hindus and Muslims, from Bangladesh and its ever-changing response through a large span of time.</p>
<p>Authors categorise three phase approaches that is, civilisational, territorialisation and securitisation. In civilisational moment, Indian state defines the nation broadly as a civilisation with the minorities residing in the neighbouring countries as its potential building blocks. This defines the initial approach during the Nehruvian period. The nation, according to this vision, is never closed and helps minorities in neighbor countries with ‘open arms’.</p>
<p>However, wars with neighbours mark the shift in approach to ‘territorialisation’, which means capturing the essence of India nation by erecting geographical boundaries. Finally, securitisation moment changed everything and forced India to aggressively pursue the case against migration.</p>
<p>The looser in this process have been the Muslims migrants, who leave their homeland due to economic hardship instigated by globalisation. The recent instance is of India’s cold-hearted handling of <italic>Rohingya</italic> Muslims from Myanmar who migrated to avoid hardship and persecution at the hands of the majority.</p>
<p>In the process of looking at the communal migration, this book does not omit other aspects. Chapter four by Tetsuya Nakatani attempts to look at the inner world of migrants and relationships among them. He finds that there is no homogeneity of experiences and differences persist among migrants on the line of castes. This difference is the bottleneck in assimilation of refugees and creates ‘otherness’.</p>
<p>Section II is more intensive and engages the reader. It deals with issues like Enemy Property Act, role of civil society, causes of marginalisation and its depiction in literature. A clear picture of discrimination and systemic biases, similar to what Muslim of West Bengal faces, come forth against Hindu minority in Bangladesh. Rangalal Sen see it as the process of ‘de-secularisation’ which started first by East Pakistan and continued in Bangladesh afterwards.</p>
<p>In independent Bangladesh, Fifth and Eighth Amendments in the Constitution by two military rulers caused much harm to the secular foundation. They continued with the discriminatory Enemy Property Act (EPA) which never allowed Hindus to economically flourish. Its major impact has been dealt by Abul Barkat in Chapter six. This chapter is very rich in data on population and land.</p>
<p>According to one estimate by Abul Barkat, the total area of land lost by the Hindu households due to EPA/VPA— estimated based on official records—would be 2.01 million acres, which is equivalent to 45 per cent of the total land owned by the Hindu community. He pointed out to a phenomenon called ‘missing Hindus’ from all sphere of public life. This brings Rangalal Sen to conclude that civil society has much larger role to play in the modern politics by mobilising progressive opinion against the crass ‘de-humanisation’ of minorities.</p>
<p>Sadeka Halim, through the issue of Hindu women discrimination in Bangladesh, makes a comment on women discrimination in general in a patriarchal society. Women face discrimination within the communities as well. According to Halim, Hindu women are broadly subjected to three kinds of unequal treatment; as members of a patriarchal family, society and nationality. Rights provided to them by constitution are illusive and provide no relief from injustice done to them in day-to-day life, both from within and outside.</p>
<p>The atrocities on Hindus and especially Hindu women do not catch media attention as well. But Bengali literature is full of such the agony and defines what it like being a minority. The book ends with an appeal ‘to eliminate all common incongruity so that all devout sets in Bangladesh can enjoy the rights of a citizen. This is the essence of modern Bangladesh on the grounds we fought for in 1971’.</p>
<p>The appeal made at last is valid to whole of South Asian region and to the world as most of countries are facing these challenge. The other common ideas thrown by this book are: cross-boundary impact of any small or big communal events in a South Asian countries; states in South Asia are biased against their minorities and at the critical moments failed to protect their life, property and dignity; resultantly, socio-economic and political status of minorities across the borders are miserable.</p>
<p>In the end, this book has exposed the myth of many of our national leaders that ‘with the establishment of India and Pakistan and merely declaring itself “secular” in the Constitution, communal harmony would prevail’. The book shows that it takes much more than that to be democratic and secular.</p>
