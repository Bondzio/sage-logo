<abstract>
<p>There are few cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), particularly of atypical variants, occurring in association with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE). Reports addressing a specific therapy thus remain almost anecdotal. It is therefore challenging to determine the treatment that is best suited for this subset of patients, especially if initial conventional therapy for GBS fails. We present two cases of GBS-like acute axonal neuropathies, one with acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and another with acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), presenting early in the course of SLE. The first case failed to respond to therapy with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and plasmapheresis, but achieved a favorable outcome when high-dose glucocorticoids along with low-dose intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide pulses were given. The second case responded favorably to high-dose glucocorticoids, IVIG, and low-dose IV cyclophosphamide pulses. Both patients have remained in clinical remission and without neurologic sequelae after 10 and three years of follow-up, respectively.</p>

<p>A wide range of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms occur in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313476358">1</xref></sup> Various forms of lupus-related polyneuropathy have been reported in 10–20% of patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313476358">2</xref></sup> However, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a demyelinating polyneuropathy, is a rare complication in lupus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313476358">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476358">4</xref></sup> The neurologic deficits and associated disability that occur in GBS are mainly related to processes affecting nerve fibers, namely segmental demyelination and axonal degeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476358">5</xref></sup> There are anecdotal reports of GBS presenting as the initial manifestation of SLE; however, the variant forms of GBS have been described mainly as late complications. Furthermore, the experience on the therapeutic approach for this complication in lupus is scarce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476358">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313476358">7</xref></sup> Herein, we report two patients presenting with GBS-like acute axonal neuropathies early in the course of SLE who responded well to corticosteroids and low-dose intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0961203313476358"><title>Case #1</title>
<p>A 20-year-old woman presented fever, malaise, and headache. Two weeks later she developed progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, muscular weakness, and finally respiratory failure. Physical examination revealed muscle weakness of the neck flexors and extensors, as well as weakness in all four extremities. Initial laboratory tests revealed a normal complete blood cell count except for lymphopenia (1400/µL). Serum electrolytes, renal function tests, creatine phosphokinase, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and urinalysis were all within normal limits. Chest films, computed tomography of the head, electrocardiogram, and urine toxicology were also negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal and negative for infection. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed a pattern consistent with extensive denervation but with normal amplitudes and decreased recruitment, which was particularly severe in the proximal muscles. Nerve conduction studies revealed normal latencies and amplitudes in sensorial nerves and decreased amplitudes in multiple motor nerves but with normal velocities. Repetitive stimulation did not reveal neuromuscular junction disorders. F-wave latencies were normal. The electrodiagnostic tests along with the clinical picture were consistent with an acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN).</p>
<p>Plasmapheresis with exchange rates of 35 ml/kg/session was performed on days 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12. However, the patient did not improve and also developed diplopia, eyelid weakness, and ophthalmoplegia. IV immunoglobulins (IVIG) at 0.4 g/kg/day were then given for five days, but she persisted with neurologic deficits. During the hospitalization she had persistent lymphopenia and developed proteinuria (1020 mg/24 h). Further work-up revealed a positive anti-nuclear antibody test (ANA) at a titer of 1:320, speckled pattern, and elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies. C3 and C4 levels were normal. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. As there was no response to plasmapheresis and IVIG treatment, and because a diagnosis of SLE was established, she was treated with cyclophosphamide 500 mg IV and glucocorticoids, starting with methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily for four weeks followed by prednisone 40 mg daily. She had a remarkable response to this therapy; ventilatory support was no longer necessary, lymphopenia resolved, and proteinuria decreased to 310 mg/24 hours over the next two weeks. Cyclophosphamide pulses of 500 mg IV every month were continued for five additional cycles and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily was started. Full resolution of neurologic symptoms was attained by the fourth month of therapy. Prednisone was gradually tapered down and finally discontinued one year later. Currently, ten years later, she is in full clinical remission and receiving only hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily as maintenance therapy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0961203313476358"><title>Case #2</title>
<p>A 34-year-old woman with SLE presented to the emergency department complaining of burning pain and swelling in her ankles. Seven weeks earlier she developed burning pain in her ankles, associated with numbness and paresthesias of both legs, which progressed over the next weeks to weakness that limited her ambulation. One month earlier she was diagnosed with SLE after presenting constitutional symptoms, arthritis, lymphopenia, positive ANA, and elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies. She only received a short-term therapy with prednisone 20 mg daily.</p>
<p>On physical examination she had swelling and warmth of the ankles, with limited active range of motion on all planes. She also had synovitis of the fifth proximal interphalangeal joint of the right hand. The neurologic examination revealed intact cranial nerves. Motor strength was symmetrical but decreased in the lower extremities. Pinprick sensation was present on upper extremities; however, it was diminished on lower extremities, more markedly on the right side. Patchy sensory loss was present on the back up to T6 level.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies revealed normal thyroid-stimulating hormone, folate and vitamin B12 levels. Urine analysis was normal. She had positive ANA (1:640, speckled pattern), anti-cardiolipin IgG (27 U/ml), lupus anticoagulant, and anti-dsDNA antibodies (1:160). C3 and C4 levels were normal. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Gram stain and cultures were negative. Oligoclonal bands were not detected. The brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Electrophysiological studies revealed spontaneous activity and increased number of polyphasic units in the left extensor hallucis longus. Decreased recruitment in the left tibialis anterior and right and left extensor hallucis longus were also noted. The findings were consistent with an acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN).</p>
<p>The patient was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids, beginning with methylprednisolone pulse (1 g IV daily for three days), followed by prednisone 40 mg daily. In addition, IVIG treatment was given, at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/day for five days, followed by low-dose IV cyclophosphamide (500 mg) and hydroxychloroquine. She completed six cycles of monthly IV cyclophosphamide. After completion of cyclophosphamide therapy she underwent complete resolution of her neurologic and lupus symptoms. Azathioprine was started as maintenance therapy and prednisone was gradually tapered down until discontinued within a year. Thereon, she has remained in remission for over three years. Currently she is receiving therapy with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily and azathioprine 50 mg daily.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0961203313476358" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report GBS-like acute axonal neuropathies in two young women with SLE occurring early in the course of lupus. Plasmapheresis and IVIG in one case failed in reversing the acute neuropathic process. In contrast, the use of high-dose glucocorticoids and low-dose IV cyclophosphamide resulted in rapid improvement of both SLE and GBS manifestations. Similarly, glucocorticoids, IVIG and low-dose pulses of IV cyclophosphamide resulted in a favorable outcome in the second case.</p>
<p>The prevalence of SLE in patients with GBS has been reported in about 0.6–1.7% and has been mainly described during the course of systemic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313476358">8</xref></sup> The incidence of GBS worldwide is 0.6–4 cases per 100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476358">9</xref></sup> AMAN and AMSAN represent axonal forms of GBS. In general, a higher prevalence of these variants has been reported in Asia, South America, and Central America. However, the majority of these cases have been associated to a preceding infection with <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> and their association to active SLE is exceedingly rare. These axonal forms of GBS usually present with acute quadriparesis and variable sensory and cranial nerve deficits. They have been linked to a poorer prognosis and lower chances of complete recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313476358">9</xref></sup> The atypical variant of AMAN reported in our first case is usually present in only 5% of all GBS cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313476358">10</xref></sup> AMAN occurs frequently in Japan and China, and has been reported particularly in young people. This GBS variant usually presents a rapid disease course leading to paralysis and often requiring ventilatory support, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of our patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313476358">11</xref></sup> This variant has been previously described in a patient with Sjögren’s syndrome where therapy with plasma exchange failed to improve the patient symptoms; however, a favorable response was obtained with a five-day course of IVIG therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313476358">12</xref></sup> Moreover, Yildiz and colleagues reported a case of a 47-year-old woman with discoid lupus presenting an acute axonal lumbosacral polyneuropathy that preceded the transformation to systemic involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313476358">13</xref></sup> Clinical recovery in their case was attained with intravenous methylprednisolone and monthly pulses of high-dose cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>Our second case presented with AMSAN. This variant of GBS has been noted to represent a more severe form of disease and its pathogenesis has been related to an immune reaction directed toward epitopes on the axon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313476358">14</xref></sup> AMSAN has been previously described in a patient with active SLE and anti-cardiolipin antibodies who responded rapidly to a combination of IV methylprednisolone, high-dose cyclophosphamide (a single dose of 1000 mg) and IVIGs (0.4g/kg/day for five days).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476358">15</xref></sup> It has been hypothesized that anti-cardiolipin antibodies may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of this disease by binding to glycolipid epitopes on peripheral myelin and thus inducing an immune response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313476358">16</xref></sup> Ubogu and colleagues proposed that a reversible conduction failure could be induced by the binding of these antibodies to nodal axonal epitopes, which may explain their recovery after therapy is instituted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313476358">15</xref></sup> Of note, our patient also presented positive anti-cardiolipin antibodies.</p>
<p>The main treatment modalities for the management of GBS include plasma exchange and IVIG, as both forms of therapy have been shown to improve patient outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313476358">17</xref></sup> Previous reports presenting GBS as a complication of SLE have shown adequate clinical response to IVIG, plasmapheresis and glucocorticoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313476358">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313476358">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313476358">19</xref></sup> However, the optimal treatment modality for a polyneuroradiculopathy in the setting of SLE has not been clearly established. In agreement with our findings, van Laarhoven et al. presented a case of GBS in a patient with SLE complicated by lupus nephritis that failed to respond to IVIG treatment but responded favorably to a combination of glucocorticoids and IV cyclophosphamide pulses (750 mg) for a total period of 18 months;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476358">6</xref></sup> however, we used a low-dose cyclophosphamide regime for our patients.</p>
<p>Previous reports have shown that clinicians elect to use currently accepted therapies for the management of non-SLE-associated polyneuroradiculopathies, including plasmapheresis and IVIG therapy, when treating atypical variants of GBS in patients with lupus. However, although for adults with GBS glucocorticoids are not recommended, steroid therapy is still recognized as a standard therapeutic modality in patients with SLE who present neuropsychiatric manifestations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203313476358">20</xref></sup> Noteworthy, in three cases (one reported by van Laarhoven and the two cases described here) no improvement was seen with plasmapheresis and IVIGs, but a remarkable clinical response, without neurologic sequelae, was obtained with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476358">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the pathogenesis of GBS as a manifestation of active SLE is not clearly understood, a role for both cell-mediated and humoral processes has been recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313476358">4</xref></sup> Another important association for the development of an inflammatory polyneuropathy in SLE patients has been its co-occurrence with infections, which is particularly meaningful in this population of patients who are immunosuppressed due to both activity of their disease and immunosuppressive therapy. Furthermore, it has been proposed that autoantibodies which react with specific neural tissues, such as myelin components, may be produced as part of the wide spectrum of autoantibodies that may be found in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313476358">6</xref></sup> Thus, it seems reasonable to consider immunosuppression as an important treatment option in such cases of GBS complicating active lupus. In our cases this was achieved by adding low-dose IV cyclophosphamide pulses. Houssiau and colleagues have previously demonstrated in the Euro Lupus Nephritis Trial the efficacy of low-dose IV cyclophosphamide therapy in the management of lupus nephritis, particularly among a population of Caucasians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313476358">21</xref></sup> In this low-dose regimen, patients would be ultimately exposed to a lower cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide. Therefore, late adverse events such as malignancy may occur less frequently.</p>
<p>Owing to the fact that GBS-like acute axonal neuropathies are rare in SLE patients, controlled clinical trials are lacking. However, the association of these two entities has been strongly evidenced by published data, which translates into significant implications for their management and long-term outcomes. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of attaining a prompt diagnosis and establishing early therapy in this group of patients including a combination of glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis and IVIG therapy. Also, our findings underline the impact of early immunosuppression therapy with cyclophosphamide, particularly at a low dose, early in the course of illness in order to achieve a sustained clinical response.</p>
