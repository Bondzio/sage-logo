<abstract>
<p>This bibliography focuses on the dynamic relationships between housing affordability for the low- and moderate-income (LMI) population and smart growth management and planning practices. Smart growth advocates generally seek to promote greater housing affordability and diversity. However, compact development, a goal of smart growth, curbs land development and poses significant challenges to promoting affordability. Housing markets can be affected by smart growth-related planning practices, ranging from growth management policies to various urban design tools such as transit-oriented development and urban infill. The review concludes by emphasizing several important social, administrative, and economic issues facing a successful integration of smart growth and affordable housing goals, and discusses possible solutions for maintaining affordability.</p>

<title>I. Introduction</title>
<p>As the dual agendas of curbing suburban sprawl and preserving a viable, yet affordable, housing market have become high-priority issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471563">Downs 2005</xref>), it is increasingly important to understand how they interact. The intent of this literature review is to provide a synthesis of the scholarship pertaining to the effects of growth management on housing, with a particular emphasis on affordability for low- and moderate-income (LMI) households. This body of research comes from different academic disciplines (such as economics, planning, geography, and sociology), covering issues such as land prices, home values, affordability, construction trends, and racial and ethnic exclusion. This article reviews recent publications specifically relevant to the impacts of growth management on housing affordability, providing a framework for evaluating the dynamics between modern planning practices and the complexities of the US housing market, and emphasizing the government’s role in maintaining affordability and promoting social equity.</p>
<p>The article is organized into four sections. Section I introduces the concept of smart growth, discusses common smart growth practices in urban planning and public policy, and analyzes the potential impacts of these practices on housing affordability. Many of these practices may decrease housing affordability, especially for LMI populations, and lead to social equity issues such as gentrification, displacement, and segregation. Therefore, it is critical to reevaluate these commonly adopted smart growth techniques in a more comprehensive framework, with simultaneous consideration of market conditions, innovative planning practices, and existing administrative and legal constraints. Section II provides reviews of 118 journal articles, five book chapters, and three PhD dissertations, with a focus on smart growth and housing affordability. Three criteria were used to select these works: (1) they are recent publications in academic journals, or recently published books or finished dissertations, (2) their topics are relevant to housing affordability and smart growth, and (3) they focus on or are relevant to practice in the United States, with most works based on US experiences and a few from other countries (Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom). Sections III and IV are author and keyword indices, making it convenient for readers to search for articles, book chapters, or dissertations.</p>
<sec id="section3-0885412212471563">
<title>1. The Evolution of Smart Growth</title>
<p>Sprawl has been extensively studied. In the planning field, it has been agreed that sprawl is costly and creates various problems related to resource use, the environment, and personal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885412212471563">Berke et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885412212471563">Johnson 2001</xref>). In response to sprawl, planners have begun to use innovative techniques (e.g., transit oriented developments [TODs] and urban growth boundaries) to create more balanced and compact forms of development that are often referred to as “smart growth.” Smart growth promotes mixed-use, compact urban structure, walkability, more housing choices other than single family, and diversified transportation modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471563">Downs 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412212471563">Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While these goals provide a basic framework for understanding smart growth, the concept can be difficult to define at both a practical and theoretical level. As efforts to mitigate the negative consequences of sprawl have grown in recent decades, the interpretation of the term smart growth can be both vague and easily manipulated by different growth agendas and interests (Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer 2005). Concurrently, the concept of sustainability has gained attention, and helps provide smart growth with some theoretical foundation. Different professions define sustainability differently, as it has many roots involving ecological, resource, economic development, and equity considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0885412212471563">Kidd 1992</xref>). In the planning profession, the sustainability prism model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885412212471563">Berke et al. 2006</xref>) has gained acceptance, and provides a framework for understanding the multiple dimensions of sustainability. This model considers the trade-offs between the environment, the economy, and equity, and promotes development that is balanced across these three components. The concepts of smart growth and sustainability intertwine with each other in that the philosophy of smart growth is based on accommodating each of these factors. Smart growth practices have the common goal of achieving sustainable development, and smart growth can be interpreted as a development pattern balanced between environmental, economic, and equity considerations. With social equity being an important issue, promoting housing affordability for LMI populations is a common objective for smart growth practices. For instance, Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer (2005) study policies from various agencies, and find that nine of the ten documents listed housing among their primary goals, and seven specifically mentioned the implementation of affordable housing and greater housing variety.</p>
<p>The relationship between housing affordability and smart growth is complex. Many smart growth strategies are designed to promote affordability by increasing density, providing diversified housing options other than single-family units, and promoting better design with balanced distribution of work and residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471563">Downs 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412212471563">Ye, Mandpe, and Meyer 2005</xref>). At the same time, in order to maintain environmental quality, many smart growth practices limit growth and reduce the supply of developable land (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471563">Downs 2005</xref>). These practices have the potential to increase housing prices and reduce housing affordability for LMI households. As the complexities of the relationship between smart growth and housing affordability have become increasingly visible, the academic literature has expanded to account for a wider spectrum of housing issues associated with various smart growth practices, including statewide growth management, urban growth boundaries, New Urbanism, urban revitalization, TOD, and open space preservation. This article reviews this broad range of literature to better understand how each of these smart growth elements affects housing affordability.</p>

<title>2. Common Smart Growth Management Practices</title>
<p>Statewide growth management, urban growth boundaries, and impact fees represent common regulatory tools used by various levels of governments, exerting direct or indirect impacts on the housing market in a city or region. New Urbanism, TOD, and urban infill/revitalization are often piecemeal planning practices taking place at the neighborhood level. Impacts of these practices on housing affordability and social equity have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885412212471563">Pendall 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412212471563">Ihlanfeldt 2004</xref>). In addition, there is a significant amount of literature that highlights the impacts of open space preservation on housing prices and affordability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471563">Acharya and Bennett 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412212471563">Irwin 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Statewide growth management</italic> efforts cover large geographic territories and represent a state-sponsored control of development over a region. Some states, such as Florida, Maryland, Oregon, and Washington, have implemented various degrees of statewide growth management policies. These management systems vary across states, but with the same key focus of achieving a balance between socioeconomic, political, and environmental considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471563">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212471563">Anthony 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412212471563">2006</xref>). Such practices likely hinder the availability of alternative growth locations and can have state-wide implications on housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471563">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212471563">Anthony 2003</xref>). These policies are generally criticized for lacking an explicit emphasis on housing, regulatory consistency,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0885412212471563">1</xref>
</sup> local and regional collaboration, and effective policy tools to meet housing needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212471563">Anthony, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412212471563">Boyle and Mohamed, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, there is virtually unanimous agreement on the need for states to better integrate explicit housing affordability goals into their growth management plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471563">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412212471563">Boyle and Mohamed 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412212471563">Anthony 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>An urban growth boundary</italic> (UGB) contains an officially designated area for development, and restricts development outside the boundary. It is one of the most extensively studied policy tools of growth management, and can take place at the state or at the local level. State-enforced UGBs (as in Oregon) reduce competitions between cities and provide stricter regulation on activities than a locally adopted UGB (as in Lexington, Kentucky; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412212471563">Woo and Guldmann 2011</xref>). An UGB itself often does not have a housing component. However, such a boundary directly restrains urban development within specific geographic borders, and therefore may restrict the supply of developable land, with indirect impacts on housing markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885412212471563">Phillips and Goodstein 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Impact fees</italic>, unlike UGBs, allow for development at any location, but require developers to make upfront payments to cover environmental and infrastructural costs. Such costs have the potential to be passed to housing consumers, therefore decreasing affordability. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471563">Burge and Ihlanfeldt (2006</xref>) claim that, if designed properly, impact fees can potentially enhance housing opportunity by including fee waivers and incentives for affordable and multifamily housing.</p>
<p>
<italic>New Urbanism</italic> involves innovative principles, with a strong emphasis on compact development and mixed land uses, and has been considered an urban design tool capable of achieving smart growth goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412212471563">Bohl 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412212471563">Larsen 2005</xref>). Planners hope that, by mixing housing types and minimizing transit costs, New Urbanism has the potential to better integrate affordable housing throughout communities. For example, it has been used to guide the implementation of public housing programs, such as HOPE VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0885412212471563">Talen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412212471563">Larsen 2005</xref>). However, producers of private housing have largely been unable or unwilling to include affordable housing within market rate developments, due to its limited marketability and profitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412212471563">Bohl 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Transit oriented development</italic> (TOD) promotes compact urban development by improving the connection between homes and workplaces and by allocating residential and work places near public transit systems. Such practices improve site amenities by shortening commutes and reducing automobile reliance.</p>
<p>
<italic>Urban revitalization and infill development</italic> encourage development and redevelopment activities within existing neighborhoods. It is a strategy with great potential to achieve more compact development and to improve housing opportunities within impoverished urban communities. Nevertheless, infill development often involves piecemeal practices. Because of other barriers (e.g., environmental contamination regulations, high costs, and consumer preferences), infill practices may be inappropriate for large-scale development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885412212471563">Farris 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412212471563">Greenberg et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>
<italic>Open space preservation</italic> in urbanized regions has multiple purposes, preserving agricultural land, protecting ecosystems, and providing recreational amenities. This preservation involves a wide range of implementation challenges, including administrative tools, planning activities, and cooperation among governments. A very large amount of literature is available on this topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412212471563">Bolitzer and Netusil 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471563">Acharya and Bennett 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885412212471563">Geoghegan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471563">Kaufman and Cloutier 2006</xref>). This article narrows the focus to works emphasizing the impacts of green space on housing prices and affordability.</p>

<title>3. Smart Growth and Housing Affordability</title>
<p>The implementation of various smart growth tools can directly impact the supply–demand dynamics of the housing market, as theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885412212471563">Cooley and Lacivita (1982</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885412212471563">Engle, Navarro, and Carson (1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885412212471563">Table 1</xref> summarizes these impacts. On the supply side, urban growth boundaries and state-wide growth management may reduce the amount of developable land. As a result, housing supply may be reduced accordingly, and this will generate a negative impact on housing affordability. By excluding environmentally sensitive or rural areas from development, open space preservation will generate similar impacts on housing affordability.</p>

<p>When impact fees are introduced, housing production costs increase and developers may transfer these extra costs (including additional administrative cost and the impact fee itself) to home buyers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412212471563">Evans-Cowley, Forgey, and Rutherford 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471563">Burge and Ihlanfeldt 2006</xref>). Some empirical studies have shown that developers may build more expensive houses, because it is easier for them to transfer these costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471563">Burge and Ihlanfeldt 2006</xref>). Urban infill/revitalization practices often occur in existing neighborhoods, where it is costly to acquire land, remove existing structures, and possibly clean up contaminated sites. All of these factors increase housing construction costs.</p>
<p>Many growth control practices may have additional administrative costs. State growth management, urban growth boundaries, and open space preservation are often government-led growth management. Necessary administrative costs in the process of policy adoption and enforcement have been internalized into government budgets. New Urbanism, TOD, and urban infill/revitalization may take place in neighborhoods which are often regulated by traditional large-lot zoning practices. Administrative costs may occur during the rezoning process when converting a parcel from single-family to mixed-use development, which could be denied by a zoning commission because of the exclusionary nature of a traditional zoning ordinance. These costs may be transferred to homebuyers in the form of higher housing price.</p>
<p>On the demand side, state growth management and urban growth boundaries may indirectly control population levels by limiting developable land, and therefore may lead to a decreasing housing demand. But a declining housing demand does not necessarily mean improving housing affordability for the LMI population. Without an active fair share housing component in such a regional growth policy that restrict land provision and therefore housing supply, the market will naturally respond by providing more expensive houses to maintain profits. Thus, housing can be less affordable to the LMI population.</p>
<p>Both UGB policies and TODs promote compact urban form, often with convenient access to public transit systems. New Urbanism promotes mixed activities, and infill development often takes place in old neighborhoods with good accessibility. These practices tend to reduce transportation costs and increase residential amenities and, as a result, housing demand for these locations may increase. Housing prices may increase accordingly. Nevertheless, the impacts on affordability are dynamic. Increasing housing prices may lead to lower affordability. On the other hand, the lower transportation costs may exert a counteracting effect, because they may compensate for the added costs of housing, thus, improving overall affordability.</p>
<p>Growth management at the municipal or state level often promotes compactness and has the potential to achieve a more efficient allocation of activities across the city or region. This implies better accessibility to service activities (e.g., police and fire protection, education, retail and personal services). These improved amenities may increase housing prices. Similarly, the preservation of natural spaces in urbanized areas can add environmental and recreational amenities to neighboring locations, and increase house prices. </p>
<p>In summary, growth management practices tend to reduce land and housing supply, thereby increasing housing costs, and lowering affordability. On the demand side, growth management practices generate desirable amenities which improve the quality of life, but for which home buyers incur the costs.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885412212471563">Table 2</xref> summarizes empirical results of various studies analyzing the impacts of growth management practices on land values, housing prices, and housing affordability. Overall, these studies support the hypothesis that growth management practices have strong ramifications for the price and, consequently, the affordability of housing, as expected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885412212471563">Table 1</xref>. Empirical studies suggest that state growth management and UGBs tend to increase housing prices and lower affordability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412212471563">Nelson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412212471563">Carruthers 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885412212471563">Downs 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212471563">Anthony 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412212471563">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412212471563">Woo and Guldmann 2011</xref>). However, another group of scholars have suggested that other factors, such as regional trends, economic growth, and amenities, may be more influential in driving the escalation of housing costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0885412212471563">Phillips and Goodstein 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412212471563">Jun 2006</xref>). Further, many other factors may escalate housing prices as well, such as in-migration, inflation, and supply–demand imbalance. UGBs do not necessarily inflict housing shortages and increase prices if boundary designations and expansion plans can keep pace with population growth and market trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885412212471563">Knaap and Hopkins 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885412212471563">Carlson and Dierwechter 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885412212471563">Aurand (2010</xref>) notes that such regional level growth management often adopts multiple strategies to promote density, mixed land-use, and a variety of housing types, and concludes that there is a positive relationship between polices that promote density and housing variety and affordability.</p>

<p>Impact fees could have varying impacts on housing prices and affordability, depending on the nature and stringency of the policy, as well as the elasticity of the market. Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0885412212471563">Skidmore and Peddle 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885412212471563">Heim 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471563">Burge and Ihlanfeldt 2006</xref>) have suggested that impact fees introduce additional administrative requirements and may be effective in slowing growth. For instance, requirements for expanded water and sewer capacity for multifamily housing will hinder such development because of lengthy application processes. Further, by requiring upfront compensation for potential pressures on existing infrastructure, impact fees could mitigate the high cost of infrastructure expansion, which otherwise will be endured by local governments. Impact fees can also perpetuate housing price increases, which often place the most severe burdens on LMI populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412212471563">Evans-Cowley, Forgey, and Rutherford 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885412212471563">Burge and Ihlanfeldt (2006</xref>) also suggest that non-water/sewer related (e.g., school and road) impact fees increase the development of multifamily housing, and may promote affordability for LMI households. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412212471563">Evans-Cowley, Forgey, and Rutherford (2005</xref>) conclude that impact fees could have opposite effects on land value, depending on whether the land has been developed and whether substitutable land is available.</p>
<p>New Urbanism principles have been implemented in housing developments in the United States, particularly developments that have received government subsidies or involved public–private collaborations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412212471563">Bohl 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885412212471563">Larsen 2005</xref>). Studies of these projects focus on beneficiary groups, administration, and displacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885412212471563">Tu and Eppli 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0885412212471563">Song and Knaap 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885412212471563">Matthews and Turnbull 2007</xref>). In the private sector, developments inspired by New Urbanism, such as Kentlands, Maryland, have generally been shown to command higher prices than more traditionally designed neighborhoods. A survey conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885412212471563">Johnson and Talen (2008</xref>) shows that the private sector has been less motivated to pay any attention to the affordability issue and, without regulatory enforcement or financial incentives, private developers do not consider affordability, primarily for profitability reasons.</p>
<p>TOD promotes better linkages among daily activities by locating them near the public transit system. Proximity to transit lines and transit enhancements (both anticipated and completed) have been shown to generally raise land values and housing prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885412212471563">Bowes and Ihlanfeldt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885412212471563">Knaap, Ding, and Hopkins 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412212471563">Cervero and Duncan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885412212471563">McMillen and McDonald 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885412212471563">Debrezion, Pels, and Rietveld 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471563">Kahn 2007</xref>). Increases in housing prices may motivate municipalities to promote TOD to obtain greater property tax revenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885412212471563">Knaap, Ding, and Hopkins 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412212471563">Cervero and Duncan 2002</xref>). Increasing property values suggest that TODs may present affordability barriers and gentrification threats for LMI groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412212471563">Kahn 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Infill strategies have been noted to decrease housing value disparities and restore vitality to urban communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412212471563">Greenberg et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885412212471563">Schill et al. 2002</xref>). However, they also spur gentrification and rent inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0885412212471563">Schill et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885412212471563">Steinacker 2003</xref>). Costs are the major barrier between this type of development and affordability. As indicated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885412212471563">Farris (2001</xref>) and based on his seventeen-year experience as a developer in St. Louis, the price of redevelopment of a square foot of land is estimated to be $15, as compared to $0.25 to $5 for previously undeveloped land. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0885412212471563">Ryan and Weber (2007</xref>) also conclude that redevelopment activities are more expensive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885412212471563">Steinacker (2003</xref>) based her study on the fifty largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, and finds that infill development leads to higher rents, and therefore, lower affordability.</p>
<p>Open spaces provide desirable environmental amenities. Available studies have consistently demonstrated the potential to increase housing prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412212471563">Bolitzer and Netusil 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212471563">Acharya and Bennett 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471563">Kaufman and Cloutier 2006</xref>). Price appreciation is generally predicted to be contingent on the permanency of preservation efforts, with properties closer to permanent open space commanding higher premiums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412212471563">Bolitzer and Netusil 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885412212471563">Geoghegan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412212471563">Irwin 2002</xref>). Redevelopment of open space has even been suggested as a potential community development tool for declining urban neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412212471563">Kaufman and Cloutier 2006</xref>). However, while such amenity enhancements may be beneficial for homeowners, they present negative implications for affordability issues facing other groups, such as LMI renters and homeowners.</p>

<title>4. Policy Implications</title>
<p>In summary, many smart growth management techniques decrease housing affordability for LMI populations. Regulatory policies, including both new growth management techniques and traditional zoning practices, have been demonstrated to significantly contribute to the inflation of housing costs, and more heavily regulated areas offer less affordable housing for renters and LMI households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885412212471563">Carlson and Mathur 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412212471563">Schill 2005</xref>). In addition to affecting housing affordability, growth management regulations generate several concerns relevant to displacement, gentrification, and other social equity issues. With affordability for LMI populations looming as a serious concern in US cities, it is necessary to reevaluate and redesign growth management practices, and to encourage comprehensive practices that simultaneously consider market issues, planning tools, and the role of government.</p>
<sec id="section7-0885412212471563">
<title>Market profitability</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412212471563">Thompson (2011</xref>) views the city as a “distorted” price system. At a certain level, this system protects the existing social relations and the corresponding political order. For instance, housing markets operate on a profit-driven price basis that reflects the preferences of high- and middle-income groups, while overlooking the basic needs of low-income populations. The market values profit much higher than improving social quality. As a result, developers do not voluntarily consider housing affordability. Available empirical studies confirm this conclusion (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885412212471563">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, public interventions must continue to be taken to promote affordability in the market.</p>
<p>The Federal government plays a critical role in promoting public housing and affordability, using strategies such as (1) tax credits or subsidies to promote housing supply for eligible LMI households, (2) providing publicly owned or operated housing, and, (3) improving the competitiveness of LMI households in a housing market by providing vouchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885412212471563">Schwartz 2010</xref>). Schwartz’s book reveals that the amount of public housing has been decreasing since the late 1990s and that most housing funded by tax-credit or voucher holders still remained in central, distressed, or minority neighborhoods, where LMI households are usually located. Beneficiaries’ income is often the primary concern when allocating tax credits, vouchers, and subsidies/grants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0885412212471563">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Considerations of localities in housing-related policies may improve the efficiency for promoting affordability for LMI households in the market. Location-efficient mortgages, community housing incentives, housing trust funds, and community land trusts are good examples of ways to increase the ability of disadvantaged groups to compete in the housing market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885412212471563">Greenberg et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412212471563">Nelson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0885412212471563">Schwartz 2010</xref>). All these practices call for a further involvement of state and local governments in policy initiations and program designations to promote housing affordability for the LMI population. Some local policies, such as impact fees, congestion tolls, purchasable development rights, and the redesignation of property tax structures, reflect other avenues in increasing housing costs for dominant social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885412212471563">Gihring 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885412212471563">Brueckner 2000</xref>). In summary, government interventions are necessary, with a focus on improving the competitiveness of low-income groups. Localized management, instead of standardized regulation, considers local social and political norms, and therefore, may be more effective in promoting housing affordability.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0885412212471563">
<title>Planning practices</title>
<p>How to promote affordability in planning practices has been extensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885412212471563">Pendall 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885412212471563">Glaeser and Gyourko 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412212471563">Jun 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0885412212471563">Talen 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885412212471563">Aurand 2010</xref>). First, planners should gradually shift the focus from traditional low-density zoning to innovative zoning. The traditional large lot zoning has been commonly accused as one reason for increasing housing prices. Many innovative practices have been recommended, such as inclusionary zoning, incentive zoning, high-density zoning, and smartcode. Second, many planning mechanisms have been implemented experimentally, such as brownfield redevelopment, urban infill, new urbanism, environmental zoning, and high-density zoning. Planners need to learn from these experiences. For instance, according to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412212471563">Jun 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885412212471563">Aurand 2010</xref>), high-density development and variety in housing consistently promote affordability for LMI populations and, therefore, such strategies should be promoted. However, the public may oppose such density-enhancing strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885412212471563">Danielsen, Lang, and Fulton 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412212471563">Downs 2005</xref>). This possibility leads to the third action to promote better integration between education and practice from the planning profession. Planners need to be well educated and utilize innovative design strategies to make higher-density developments more attractive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0885412212471563">
<title>Legal and administrative supports</title>
<p>Zoning reform, redesigning the taxation structure, and fair-share housing policy adoption need support from local, state, and federal administrative structures. Some government-initiated programs have shown effectiveness in maintaining affordability. For instance, Montgomery County, Maryland, is one of the very few counties with increasing levels of rental affordability. This is because of Montgomery County’s implementation of the Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit Program, which combines density bonuses with preservation measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885412212471563">Carlson and Mathur 2004</xref>). In addition, political fragmentation is another important issue to be dealt with by planners and policy makers. As noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885412212471563">Boyle and Mohamed (2007</xref>), the absence of consistent and strong cooperation between governments has prevented affordability goals from being achieved. Legislative efforts at the state or federal level might be an answer. For instance, in England, the Town and Country Planning Act enforces a negotiation about affordable housing between developers and planners across the country. This can successfully eliminate different interpretations about affordability in different cities, and guarantees a share of affordable housing in every development.</p>
<p>The success of an integration of affordability in smart growth policy will require diligent application of data to study market trends, innovative practices from the planning area, and cooperation across governments, as well as between private and public sectors. With successful implementation of these concepts and formulation of new strategies, the goals of balanced growth and housing equity may be effectively recognized.</p>

</list> This article provides a literature review about the compatibility of sustainability and affordable housing in Australia. The authors analyzed conceptual and pragmatic challenges of sustainability. Conceptual challenges focus on the reasons for pursuing sustainability. Six reasons are listed, including separating needs from wants, sustainable consumption, environmental justice, the care for future generations, opportunity costs, and possible eternal poverty. Pragmatic challenges focus on how to achieve sustainability, as laid out by the authors, including too many interests, global inequity, a competitive market, and limited knowledge. The authors pointed out that sustainability is happening when people are debating about it. They also evaluated whether these challenges made sustainable housing attainable. They concluded that many of these challenges do not pose immediate threats to applying sustainable development to affordable housing. However, affordable housing in Australia has historically sought to address social and economic issues, not environmental issues. In Australia, sustainable housing practice has focused on the wealthy and is often designed by prestigious architects. The authors saw this paradigm of sustainability for the rich as the main obstacle for attaining sustainable affordable housing.

</list-item>
</list> This article uses survey data to examine how attitudes about growth management changed among Florida residents between the state’s 1985 inception of statewide growth management and 2001. Data were obtained as part of the 1985 and 2001 Florida Annual Policy Survey which yielded approximately 1,000 respondents for each of these years. Chi-square analysis is used to determine attitude differences across various demographic and economic groups as well as geographic regions. Between 1985 and 2001, the perceived need for growth management among respondents remained strong, but fell from 71.8 to 67.7 percent. Furthermore, supportiveness for governmental intervention in managing growth also fell by nearly 12 percentage points during this period. While attitudes toward growth management were distributed relatively evenly among demographic groups in 1985, the authors find that by 2001, perceived needs for growth control declined substantially in groups including blacks, Hispanics, males, and low- and moderate-income households. Meanwhile high-income and white households demonstrated an increase in perceived needs for growth control. The authors attribute these changes to factors including observed imperfections in the state’s policies, shifts in economic concerns, and changes in the political context. Enhancing public familiarity with growth management is recommended as an important step in maintaining support for growth management legislation.

</list> In this brief article, Danielsen et al. address the question of how smart growth and growth management can be successful without hampering housing affordability. As housing essentially dominates the built environment and growth management policies essentially restrict development, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding the impacts of growth management on affordable housing. Strategies for providing more affordable housing include higher density housing, the mixing of rental and owner occupied housing, and urban infill. Increasing flexibility of zoning, urban growth boundaries, and encouraging accessory dwelling units are suggested as viable planning mechanisms to meet these housing concerns. However, Danielsen et al. note that density enhancing strategies are likely to be met with opposition from the public, particularly in suburban areas. To overcome such challenges, the authors recommend a housing development pattern that blends urban style and suburban amenities to attract more affluent households. It is also noted that lending institutions are often hesitant about investing in areas with untested development strategies advocated by smart growth agendas. Solutions to this challenge include alternative financing strategies and sources as well as the development of secondary mortgage market tools.</p>

<p>In this concluding chapter to Down’s collection of discussions on the relationship between smart growth and affordable housing, he states the goals of creating “a politically realistic prospective on the relationship between growth management, smart growth, and affordable housing” and he advocates for “a greater emphasis on affordable housing in future growth management and smart growth efforts.” Downs outlines the affordability problems of both impoverished and moderate income households. Many smart growth strategies have the potential of enhancing affordability, such as manufactured housing, multifamily housing, and accessory dwelling units. However, smaller houses have been prohibited by traditional land use tactics, such as zoning. Furthermore, the obstacles of homeowner interests to protect property values, public unwillingness to fund low-income housing, and municipal desires to maximize the monetary benefits of land uses have also hampered the provision of affordable housing. Therefore, although smart growth policies can include affordable housing goals, they usually do not because doing so has the likelihood of evoking public resistance. Downs concludes that the promotion of regional goals by coalitions of smart growth and affordable housing advocates, as well as state-supported policy, may serve as potential means for beginning to overcome such obstacles and making smart growth socially just.</p>

<p>In this article, Downs provides an in-depth analysis about why smart growth has been well accepted, but is not effectively implemented. He identifies eight obstacles, which can be categorized into economic concerns, legal constraints, and administrative inability. Smart growth promotes compact development, which completely changes the current spatial distribution of benefits and costs associated with single-family low-density development. People are unwilling to take the economic risk. Homeowners may like the idea of increasing residential density, but actually oppose to introduce additional apartment homes to their own neighborhood to protect their property values. In addition, as smart growth restricts development outside developed areas, potential profits shift from new growth outside of cities to infill development inside cities. Further, with limited supply of land, housing prices will increase. All these hurt the economic benefits of outlying land owners, renters, and potential homeowners. Legislatively, most states follow the home rule, with local communities holding the power to regulate land use activities. With disjointed incrementalism being the dominant decision-making model, administrative costs increase quickly with more issues (e.g., economic and environment) considered. Further, in such a decentralized system, smart growth policy often fails in achieving expected outcomes. For instance, for the failure to reduce traffic congestion, it is actually related to a lack of regional view of traffic issue and a lack of cooperation between communities. At last, Downs analyzed the likelihood of implementation of different smart growth policy. He listed affordable housing as the only object that is unlikely to achieve. He pointed out that state governments should play more critical role in land-use management.</p>

<p>There are three goals of this article: to define smart growth, to summarize US smart growth efforts over 1998–2001, and to explain why certain states embrace smart growth policies. The author made clear distinction between growth management (a mainly state mandated comprehensive planning process) and smart growth (encompassing a much broader set of policies that until now have not seen widespread adoption-especially at the state level). Major smart growth instruments include urban revitalization, growth control, land preservation, housing, planning, and transportation. The author examined what states adopted these policies and to what extent, why these states adopted such policies, and possible relationships between different policy areas. A series of regression analyses (including logistic and Poisson models) were conducted. Results indicate that fast population growth is the most consistent predictor for a state adopting smart growth policies. States that practice urban-revitalization are more likely to enforce land preservation policies (and vice versa). Growth control and housing affordability policies are also positively associated.</p>

<p>In order to test the hypothesis of whether education and environmental activism are the key factors promoting smart growth, O’Connell surveyed 340 cities across twenty-six states, with 59 percent response rate. Thirteen states have local planning requirement, and another thirteen are randomly selected as a control group. A smart growth involvement indicator was created based on number of policies adopted to control growth. Percentage of population with at least bachelor’s degree was used to represent education level. Another simple categorical variable with value 2, 1, or 0 represented the existence of smart growth and environmental activities groups, having one of those, or having none. The regression results confirmed the hypothesis. The survey data itself revealed some interesting reality about growth management. Infilled development, rehabilitation, and mixed-development zoning are the most common tools to regulate growth in all states, with or without planning requirement. In states with local planning requirement, more cities adopted policy to encourage transit-oriented development, green space preservation, urban growth boundary, transfer of development rights, and zoning for smaller lot size.</p>

<p>O’Toole’s challenge to the smart growth agenda is based upon a case study of Portland which depicts a number of potentially undesirable effects. Traffic congestion, air pollution, increasing consumer costs and taxes, as well as the inflexibility of urban growth boundaries, are cited as negative externalities resulting from Oregon’s growth management policies. O’Toole notes that between the years of 1989 and 1996, Portland housing market transitioned from being one of the nation’s most affordable one to one of the least affordable. Higher density building requirements have helped create a mismatch in the housing market, evidenced by high apartment vacancies and sharp increases in single-family housing prices. To manage growth in ways that are more suitable to market preferences, O’Toole suggests free market solutions as an alternative to smart growth policies. These proposed alternatives include highway toll systems, pollution fees, and local level land use decisions which allow citizens to decide upon and fully pay for lifestyle choices.</p>

<p>Sustainability is often interpreted as diversity, accessibility, and walkability, which are attractive amenities of a neighborhood. In this sense, promoting sustainability will increase housing cost and reduce affordability. On another hand, affordability and sustainability could also be mutually supportive by reducing house size to achieve high-density development and by thoughtful design to maintain accessibility. The authors used Chicago as a case study, and investigated the relationship between sustainability and affordability. Eighteen variables (measuring locational amenities, pedestrian orientation, street design, density, and diversity) were used to quantify sustainability. Information about subsidized housing units (from five different projects, Land Trusts, CHA family, CHA Senior, LIHTC, Multi-family Subsidy, and Housing Choice Vouchers) was gathered to test whether areas with subsidized houses had the same level of sustainability as areas without such houses. Analyses were conducted at both the census tract and the block group level. Results indicate that, in general, neighborhoods with subsidized units tended to be more sustainable, more accessible, more pedestrian-oriented, denser, and with more diversified activities than neighborhoods without such projects. However, if focusing on housing choice vouchers, neighborhoods with such units tend to be less sustainable.</p>

<p>This discussion considers the impacts of smart growth on housing affordability. Because smart growth essentially reduces the supply of developable land, it is likely to lead to a decreasing stock of affordable housing. This is especially true if development is inclusive of only more land intensive types of development, such as single-family homes, but is not necessarily true for other housing types. Voith and Crawford argue that smart growth polices allow for an increase in the supply of less-intensive residential land uses, such as townhomes, thus making such housing more affordable. The authors also state that smart growth can benefit low and moderate-income groups, by lowering the costs of infrastructure, utilities, and commuting, as well as altering the distribution of employment opportunities. The authors convey that enacting smart growth polices will inevitably create winners (persons without preference for intensive housing) and losers (persons with strong attachment for large lot housing). Furthermore, effects on landowner and developers vary according to the type of policy and their preparedness to adapt to smart growth. Voith and Crawford state that appropriate smart growth policies will offer more gains than loses, and some gains may be redistributed through measures, such as purchasing development rights, to achieve more equitable outcomes for everyone.</p>

<p>According to Ye et al., smart growth is an ambiguous concept and can be defined in various ways that are beneficial to different agendas and interests. Using policy documents from ten federal agencies, national organizations, and coalitions, the authors attempt to develop a comprehensive definition for smart growth. They further use this definition to analyze smart growth policies in the states of Kentucky and Georgia. Of the reviewed definitions, nine of the ten documents list housing in their primary goals, and seven specifically mention the implementation of affordable housing and/or greater housing variety. Housing is one of the six broad components (together with planning, transportation, economic development, community development, and natural resource preservation) of smart growth. In their analysis of state documents, the authors found that seven of the twenty-one state and local documents from Georgia and eighteen of the twenty-three from Kentucky included housing in their smart growth agendas.</p>

</list> Anthony’s study may be one of the first to discuss the effects of statewide growth management policy on housing affordability. Using two measures, a simple affordability index and a composite affordability index, his research extends beyond merely analyzing housing price. The time-series analyses suggest the affordability of single-family owner occupied homes in Florida was significantly reduced over 1980–1995 due to the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and the 1985 Land Development Regulation Act. While the Act required discussion of affordable housing in each local comprehensive plan, this goal was rarely actualized. Furthermore, because this policy is implemented at the statewide level, the dynamics of displacement are different in areas that only utilize local growth management policies, reducing the number of alternatives for displaced individuals. This article concludes with a discussion of potential ways to rectify this problematic aspect of growth management by requiring greater specificity and promoting greater levels of density in local comprehensive plans.</p>

<p>This updated interpretation on Florida’s Growth Management Act (GMA) suggests significant impacts from GMA practices on single-family housing prices. The GMA seeks to maximize infrastructure and to curb the perpetuation of urban sprawl, through strong state implementation and administration. Because of anticipation of subsequent housing price inflation related to this act, affordable housing production efforts were also developed. To determine the effects of the GMA, Anthony conducted a time-series analysis based on 1980–1995 housing and policy data obtained from the Florida Statistical Abstract and Florida Office of Community Affairs. He demonstrates the statistical significance of the proposed price increases due to the GMA’s adoption. Initial price increases due to the GMA’s adoption was $1,219 per home, and $1,002 for each year thereafter. Thus, Anthony states that Florida’s affordable housing programs have failed to counteract the effects of the GMA. To insure affordability and continued support of the program, Anthony proposes that efforts should be made to reduce the scarcity of affordable housing by minimizing production cost effects, keeping markets competitive, and increasing affordable housing production.</p>

<p>This study analyzes the effects of statewide growth management programs in 238 US metropolitan counties between 1982 and 1997. Effects are defined in terms of density, extent of urbanized land areas, public infrastructure expenditures, population change, and property value. Noting the importance of property value on subsequent housing prices and affordability, Carruthers explores the relationships between growth management and land value. The link between property value and density is shown to be positive. Carruthers also makes a unique contribution to the literature by considering the effects of property values on population change. If land values escalate, certain (low- and moderate-income) groups will be consequently priced out of the market and forced to live in another area. Evidence of differences between state polices suggest that the promotion of horizontal and vertical consistency among state growth management programs as well as proper inclusion for new development can minimize such negative effects.</p>

<p>This article reviews an international sampling of research on urban containment policies and housing from the United Kingdom, South Korea, and the United States. In the United Kingdom where greenbelts have been nationally mandated since 1947, studies have suggested that the land supply has been affected with the consequence of disproportionately high housing prices. In the South Korean city of Seoul, which has had a greenbelt since 1971, social costs are noted to exceed benefits in the long run if periodic revisions to the green belt boundary are not made. In the United States, statewide policies in Oregon and California are considered, as well as local containment programs, such as Boulder, Colorado’s greenbelt. In these cases, the design and implementation of policies as well as the dynamics of the economy and housing market are all noted as relevant factors in determining changes in housing prices. Dawkins and Nelson also provide a critique of existing research, stating that an overreliance on the hedonic model has not adequately captured supply side effects. It is noted that an abundance of case studies on this topic make meta-comparisons, such as this study, possible but place limits on the research’s ability to make broad generalizations.</p>

They use rates of new residential constructions in central city to determine revitalization development for 293 metropolitan statistical areas across the nation with or without state mandated growth management. The authors conclude that metropolitan areas in states with growth management programs have demonstrated marginally enhanced opportunities for central city residential development.</p>

Two strategies of growth management could effectively promote public transit use: (1) regulating city core abandonment and (2) directing new development into areas where transit systems already exist. Using additional data from the Public Use Microdata Samples and the US Census Bureau decennial census of 2000, the authors studied the change in the percentage of commuters that use transit over 2000–2005, occupancy rates, and new development. Results indicate that state growth management policies do promote transit use.</p>

<p>This review focuses on the smart growth legislation in Maryland and depicts a number of both positive and negative outcomes of the state’s Priority Funding Areas (PFA) program and Rural Legacy Act (RLA), which were designed to promote contiguous development in developed landscapes and to discourage development in undeveloped areas. Some positive attributes of the program include the program’s ability to work within political realities, to provide incentives for compliant development, to unite urban and rural interests, and to provide education to pave the way for cultural change. However, Freece also notes shortfalls, such as a lack of specific goals, insufficient public input and visioning, and inadequate financial incentives to alter development patterns. Furthermore, the program did not raise enough housing concerns, especially shortages of moderate-income housing in the increasingly expensive Baltimore–Washington region. New urbanist redevelopment strategies also present threats of gentrification, out-pricing, and consequent displacement of the low-income residents of revitalized urban areas. While Freece commends the Maryland initiatives as being a positive step in effectively controlling growth, he states that stronger incentives and more integrated planning efforts are essential for the goals of smart growth to be met.</p>

<p>This study serves as an evaluation of policies that have been enacted through Maryland’s 1997 statewide smart growth legislation, which includes two key initiatives, priority funding areas (PFAs) and rural legacy areas (RLAs). PFAs target certain areas for higher density development through incentives and RLAs are intended to protect certain areas from development. Noting that these policies carry no regulatory power, Qing and Zhang raise the research question of how effective they have been in meeting their goals. To answer this question, a longitudinal analysis of land conversion and a cross-sectional comparison of land conversion among eight counties are conducted. The 1992 National Land Cover Data of US Geographical Survey was used, along with 1997 and 2002 land cover data from the Maryland Property View database, to determine the extent of development within the RLAs and PFAs, before and after adopting the smart growth legislation. Findings suggest that land in PFAs is more likely to be developed after the passage of smart growth legislation, while RLAs are less likely to be developed. While stating that these results confirm a general success of the program, the authors also note differences among counties that are attributed to differing physical, socioeconomic, and political environments. State and local collaborations are proposed as important components of future success.</p>

</list> In this article, Aurand provided good theoretical discussions about how density, mixed housing types, and mixed land use would impact house price and affordability. He simplified housing markets into two submarkets, affordable and nonaffordable market. Density is expected to increase house prices in both markets. Variety of housing types will increase nonaffordable housing prices, while it has very limited impact on the price of the affordable housing. Mixed land use may have greater impacts on an affordability housing market by increasing price. In order to test these hypotheses, Portland and Seattle were used over 1990–2000 as the case studies. Portland had an urban growth boundary over the period, while Seattle did not have one until the mid-1990s. Therefore, Aurand claimed that this created a quasi-experimental design. An index of housing type diversity (that is similar to Shannon diversity index) was calculated. Residential density was directly represented as housing units per square mile. The mixture level of land use activities was measured by the balance between amount of residents and amount of service jobs. These variables, together with a set of control variables, were used as independent variables to explain the variations in percentage of affordable units, number of affordable units, and number of nonaffordable units. Results indicate that residential density and variety of housing types did increase affordability. Mixed land use had very limited impact. Urban contain policy did not affect affordability.</p>

The authors utilize the 1991–2002 residential building permit data and analyzed the spatial patterns of residential development both within and outside of the UGB before and after its implementation. This analysis suggests that the distribution of residential buildings did indeed become more contiguous after the UGB was established. Furthermore, a sharp decline in development outside of the UGB and a steady increase within it were found for the time period studied. This study not only provides a demonstration of a successful UGB management of residential development but also an easy replicable model for future UGB evaluations.</p>

According to the authors, the optimal UGB would be set at the current population level. UGBs are capable of increasing social welfare by constraining infrastructure consumption within a given period of time. The authors recommend that infrastructural enhancements should be coordinated with UGB expansions to insure the most efficient development patterns.</p>

<p>Much debate has arisen over the effects of Portland Oregon’s urban growth boundary (UGB) on housing prices. To better understand these controversial dynamics, Downs poses the research questions of how fast housing prices have increased in Portland and how these increases have compared with other US metropolitan regions. Using sale price data on existing single-family homes from the National Association of Realtors and Freddie Mac, Downs performs multiple statistical analyses to assess Portland housing price increases, how they compared to housing price increases in other US cities, and the possible influence of the UGB. Findings show that prices escalated more quickly in the 1990s compared to the 1980s, the decade that immediately followed the UGB’s implementation. Housing prices in Portland have increased faster than comparable areas over 1990–1994, a period also characterized by strong job growth in Portland. An UGB dummy variable is used to test for potential growth boundary influence and is deemed statistically significant for the 1990 to 1994 time period. Downs concludes that while UGBs do not necessarily increase housing prices, they may exert their strongest influence on prices when combined with other determinants of housing demand, such as job growth.</p>

<p>This brief article is intended to extend on the empirical body of literature on the effects of urban growth boundaries (UGB) on housing prices in Portland, Oregon. Jun states that his study differs from others in that it uses data at a small geographical level (block group instead of metropolitan area) and compares Portland with all other US metropolitan areas with populations of over a million persons for the years of 1990 and 2000. Jun’s analysis involves the regression of average home values on a UGB dummy variable as well as other relevant variables. Results demonstrate that the UGB dummy is insignificant and housing density is negatively related to housing prices. According to Jun’s concluding remarks, the price of housing is thus more likely to be affected by structural, accessibility and amenity factors, rather than by the boundary itself.</p>

<p>This article presents urban growth boundaries (UGBs) as a double-edged sword that can actually perpetuate sprawl if not drawn stringently enough, yet cause undue housing price inflation if they are too stringent. Furthermore, Knaap and Hopkins point out that commonly used twenty-year timetables for periodic UGB expansion do not effectively address the inconstant nature of development trends and can consequently drive up land and housing prices. Thus, they argue that an inventory interpretation can provide better understanding of UGBs. This approach considers undeveloped land as a commodity that is unutilized until it comes into demand. An event-driven system of inventory allocation is advocated by the authors as opposed to the common time-driven system. Under the event-driven system, development needs would be closely monitored to determine the appropriate time for UGB expansion. The UGB then may be expanded when the supply of land reaches a designated critical level rather than simply when a certain interval of time has passed.</p>

National data on 144 US central studies are obtained from a prior study (Burby 2000) on central city revitalization, and urban containment policy information acquired through telephone surveys. Using the number of residential and nonresidential structures constructed between 1985 and 1995 as the dependent variable, Nelson et al. analyze these data through ordinary least squares regression, using urban containment policies established before 1985 as a key independent variable. Findings indicate forty more residential units per 1,000 persons were constructed in cities with urban containment policies than in cities without such policies. While nonresidential construction is also found to be higher in contained cities, effects of containment were found to be highest on residential development.</p>

<p>To answer the question of how the effects of land use policies differ between suburban and rural residential communities, Newburn and Berck utilize a spatially explicit model to examine residential development patterns in Sonoma County, California, which contains eight cities with urban growth boundaries (UGB). Using the Sonoma County General Plan and 1994–2001 land parcel data, this research focuses on the impacts of the provision of municipal water services and land use regulations on development density changes of land parcels that were undeveloped as of 1993. These land use changes were then compared with land use regulation policies through random-parameter logit estimation. Designation and provision of water and sewer services are found to be the most significant determinants of suburban development density. Zoning regulations are also found to diminish development densities, and large lot rural residential requirements appear to be perpetuators of low density sprawl. Therefore, the authors state that while UGBs may serve to monitor suburban sprawl, they may also fuel rural residential development and consequently perpetuate the depletion of green spaces.</p>

<p>While planners in Portland, Oregon, have touted smart growth goals, such as affordable housing, open space preservation, and cleaner air, O’Toole challenges these claims and presents an argument that Portland’s planning policies have actually been a detriment to such aims. The article largely serves to examine the effects of land use planning policies within the Portland metropolitan area through an analysis of planning documents, reports, and opinion surveys. O’Toole sees smart growth planning as a source of diminishing homeownership opportunities, a reduction in open space, and growing congestion. In terms of housing, he states that the Portland housing market moved from being one of the nations’ most affordable to one of the least affordable during the 1990s. According to O’Toole, while two of the three Portland households could afford a median priced home prior to 1990, this number had decreased to less than a third by the time of this article’s publication. While some scholars and planners have attributed this trend to high rates of population growth, O’Toole states that other housing markets, such as Atlanta and Las Vegas, have maintained higher rates of affordable housing while experiencing similar if not greater rates of growth. Furthermore, efforts to increase housing densities are deemed as responsible for creating a disproportionate balance between multifamily and single-family housing that is not appropriately meeting the demands of the market. </p>

<p>While Portland, Oregon’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB), has received praise for its accomplishments in restricting urban sprawl, it has also been charged with being responsible for creating an affordable housing crisis in the city. This study seeks to determine whether housing cost increases in Portland are more attributable to the UGB or to other trends that have resulted in escalating housing cost throughout the western region. Using the National Home Builder Association’s estimates of median housing prices for the years 1991 and 1996, the authors conduct a multiple regression analysis controlling for supply and demand effects to investigate how Portland housing prices fared compared to those in thirty-seven other major US cities. The results provide weak evidence that Portland’s UGB significantly increased hosing prices and state any increases attributable to the UGB are likely to be less than $10,000. In conclusion, the authors state that Portland’s UGB is an unlikely perpetuator of an affordability crisis in the city.</p>

<p>With the purpose of discussing and evaluating the implications of urban growth boundary (UGB) policies in the state of Oregon, Weitz and Moore consider the findings of research conducted by Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), review relevant literature on urban sprawl patterns, and discuss standards for evaluating growth patterns. The DLCD research consisted of three 1995 case studies which were developed to quantify the amount of land and the number of housing units of subareas with varying development patterns in Oregon communities with UGBs. Findings demonstrate that UGBs alone may not necessarily provide an adequate means for achieving the desired level of contiguous development. Considering these results as well as the reviewed literature, Weitz and Moore offer a framework of standards for further evaluation of development in Oregon. These standards encourage urban core development as well as urban infill redevelopment, deem other forms of development, such as urban strips as acceptable if contiguous or nearly contiguous to the urban core, and discourage urban cluster and other forms of dispersed development within UGBs.</p>

<p>State-mandated urban growth boundary (UGB), local UGB, and urban service areas (USA) are examples for urban containment policies (UCPs). In terms of regulating land-use activities, state UGBs are the tightest policy and the USAs are the weakest. The article examines how these UCPs impact urban structure. One hundred and thirty-five metropolitan areas were selected as the focus, which the authors claimed to be representative of all the metropolitan areas in the US Descriptive statistics recommended that areas with UCPs tended to have higher level of housing price and more concentrated urban development. This is consistent of many other studies. In this research, urban structure is measured by the urban density gradient, which was derived using regression analysis based on 1990–2000 Traffic-Analysis-Zone level employment and population data. The authors innovatively incorporated these gradients in a structure equation model and used the existence of different UCPs to explain the change of urban structures. The authors concluded that state-mandated UGBs imposed a regional level control and were effective in containing both population and employment activities within central areas. Local UGBs only had impact on population activities, and USAs only had weak impacts on economic activities.</p>

</list> This extensive review of literature provides a framework for understanding how impact fees affect housing markets, especially in terms of affordability and racial exclusion. The review presents an overview of impact fees, an analysis of their costs and benefits, and a detailed discussion of their effects on housing price and affordability. While impact fees are noted to internalize development costs, stabilize property taxes, and enable otherwise infeasible growth, some critics have charged that they drive up housing cost and may be intentionally used to exclude both low-income populations and minorities. While this review conveys a consensus that housing prices are generally increased by impact fees, Been states that such increases do not necessarily equate to decreases in affordability. This statement is justified with the argument that impact fees have the potential to lower property taxes, can include both incentives and mandates for affordable housing, and may enhance supply by allowing for greater growth to occur. For example, impact fees may promote more efficient land uses, such as multifamily housing, which can in turn create greater opportunities for affordable housing. According to Been, the findings of this body of literature should be carefully considered by decision makers to develop impact fee policies that neither exploit nor exclude consumers of housing.</p>

<p>According to Burge and Ihandfeldt, the implementation of impact fees can potentially help communities in overcoming the costs associated with multifamily housing development and allow for rezoning to higher density land uses. Their study examines data from thirty-three Florida metropolitan counties with multifamily development impact fee requirements over 1996–2003. Impact fees are broken down into two categories: water/sewer and non-water/sewer related. Results suggest that non-water/sewer impact fees increase the development of multifamily housing development in inner suburban areas, and water/sewer related fees result in less multifamily development throughout a metropolitan area. The authors state that impact fees will increase the development of multifamily housing only if the benefits of receiving approval for higher density projects outweigh the cost of the impact fee. Therefore, only non-water/sewer related fees provide such a benefit.</p>

<p>This article explores the effect of impact fees on single-family housing construction in Florida through the estimation of separate construction and price models for small-, medium-, and large-sized homes in inner cities, inner and outer suburbs, and rural areas from 1993 to 2003. Impact fee implementation data for this panel were collected through contacting county planning and building offices, and impact fees are classified into two categories: those used to fund water/sewer infrastructure and those used to pay for non-water/sewer services (e.g., schools and roads). Interestingly, water/sewer fees are found to have statistically insignificant effects, and non-water/sewer impact fees are found to increase housing construction for all sizes of homes in inner suburban areas and medium-sized and large homes in outer suburbs. According to the price models, a $1.00 increase in impact fees is expected to increase the price of small, medium, and large housing by $.39, $.82, and $1.27, respectively, suggesting that developers are at least partially compensated for non-water/sewer impact fees in the form of higher housing demand due to the amenities funded by impact fees.</p>

<p>In this literature review, Evans and Lawhon consider a number of prominent studies that theoretically and empirically address the issue of how the costs of impact fees are distributed to landowners, developers, and consumers of housing. This distribution of costs appears to be largely contingent on the elasticity of the market. In other words, if the market is competitive and offers an ample number of substitutes, impact fees are most likely to diminish the price of land. Thus, landowners will be the most likely to bear the costs of the fee. Conversely, if substitutable land for development is not available, the costs of impact fees are more likely to be capitalized into inflated housing prices. The authors also review empirical studies which chiefly utilize hedonic regression as their method of analysis. While a number of such studies have revealed that impact fees increase the price of both new and existing housing, they are critiqued for often failing to address the issues of how the quality of a community can change when impact fees are implemented. The authors also note that impact fees can be considered as regressive because their costs are felt more heavily by low and moderate income consumers of housing. However, affordable housing impact fee waivers as well as opportunities provided by infrastructural expansion are identified as potential mechanisms for addressing affordable housing needs.</p>

<p>This brief study examined the effect of impact fees on land value, using forty-three Texas cities as a case study. The authors constructed a random effects model which estimated that for every $1,000 in impact fees, developed vacant lot values increased by 1.3 percent. However, for undeveloped lots, land values were estimated to decrease by .042 percent with every $1,000 increase in impact fees because the fee essentially made the land more expensive to develop. The authors interpreted this finding as that the cost of impact fees partially accrued to property owners. However, they stated that it was unclear whether developers paid for the remaining impact fee or whether they passed it onto homebuyers, making it difficult to discern the effect of impact fees on low- and moderate-income households. </p>

<p>This case study of Phoenix, Arizona, provides a context for understanding the development of sprawl throughout the city in the last half of the twentieth century and the negative impacts, such as scattered tracts of undeveloped urban land (leapfrogging). The two main mechanisms for sprawl control are the implementation of impact fees in 1987 and the infill housing program of 1995. Designed to assist in paying for infrastructure and discouraging leapfrogging, impact fees, ranging from $2,112 to $9,471, have been charged for residential developments in parts of the metropolitan area with strong infrastructural demands. Heim notes that this program has been successful in alleviating the fiscal strains of infrastructure development, but housing affordability challenges may be present if construction of multifamily housing is delayed or if cost burdens are shifted toward homeowners. With the goals of promoting quality housing and homeownership in the city, the infill housing program offers the incentives of waived development fees and expedited development review processes. While this program has assisted in initiating almost 17,000 projects permits by 2000, Heim states that the housing program did not strongly encourage high density development.</p>

<p>In this article, Ihlandfldt and Shaughnessy estimate the effect of impact fees on single-family home and undeveloped land in Dade County, Florida. Monthly indices of price are constructed with Dade County appraisal data for the years of 1985–2000 and then a model is estimated to explain changes in metropolitan prices over time. Results show that a $1.00 increase in impact fees raises the average existing home price by $1.67. Regression estimates also suggest that property tax savings are roughly in line with housing price increases. Conversely, land values are demonstrated to fall by approximately the value of the impact fee. Thus, while housing developers may be fully compensated for the cost of impact fees, regulatory delays and other uncertainties appear to lower their willingness to pay for vacant land.</p>

<p>Using a hedonic analysis framework, Mathur measured the effect of impact fees on the price of existing single-family housing in King County, Washington. He hypothesized that impact fees would increase housing price, and such impacts would vary according to housing quality. Using tax assessment records for housing sales occurring between 1991 and 2000, Mathur constructed three separate hedonic models to all housing sales, low-quality homes, and high-quality homes, respectively. Housing quality was determined based on the classification by the county assessor. For all housing sales, Mathur found a statistically significant increase of $0.53 to $1.12 for every $1.00 increase in impact fees depending on the quality of homes. For high-quality homes, the price of a home increased by $0.59–$1.47 for every dollar increase in impact fees. However, in the model for low-quality homes, impact fees were found to have an insignificant effect. Mathur concluded that while impact fees increased housing costs, and worsened affordability for moderate- to high-income households. Nevertheless, it did not thwart affordability for low- and moderate-income households.</p>

<p>Mathur et al. examined the effects of impact fees on the 1991–2000 sale prices of newly constructed single-family homes in King County, Washington. Data from county tax assessment records for all new housing sales were used in a hedonic model. The results indicated that every $1.00 increase in impact fees resulted in a $1.66 increase in the price of the home. Two additional models were also constructed to test whether impact fees had differentiated effects on housing units of different levels of quality. For low-quality housing model, positive, but insignificant results were found. The authors stated that this submarket may be characterized by greater price elasticity in which consumers and developers may shift to the multifamily housing market. High-quality housing bore stronger price increases with a $1.00 increase in impact fees resulting in a $3.58 increase in the sale price of the home, demonstrating that consumers actually pay more than the cost of the impact fee. The authors suggested that extended processing time and other out of pocket costs associated with impact fees may have contributed to this strong increase or that the benefits provided by the impact fees were actually higher than the amount of fees.</p>

<p>According to Mayer and Somerville, previous work on land use regulation and housing has focused almost exclusively on housing price effects. This study, however, investigates how regulations affect housing supply (i.e., residential construction) and uses quarterly data on the number of new single-family housing permits issued over 1985–1996 in forty-four metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), along with land use regulation information obtained from a 1991 survey of local planners. Regulations are considered in terms of two classes, those that charge developers with an explicit monetary fee (such as an impact fee) and regulations that impose long delays to development. Land use regulations are also found to reduce the ability of developers to respond to supply shocks. New residential construction as measured by the mean number of construction starts for housing units are shown to be up to 45 percent lower in the MSAs that demonstrated the most stringent growth regulation than in MSAs without stringent regulation. Conversely, impact fees are shown to have minimally significant effects on housing starts.</p>

<p>In this study, impact fees are considered for their effects on residential development patterns. Impact fees imply not only increased development costs but also potential reductions in property tax. Taking both factors into consideration, Skidmore and Peddle state that impact fee effects are theoretically ambiguous and thus propose an investigation of how impact fees affect residential markets. DuPage County, Illinois, is selected as a case study because of the variation in impact fee policies throughout its municipalities and its fast population growth in the state over 1977–1992. The authors demonstrate that impact fees lead to a 25 percent reduction in development rates, when taking into consideration a 4 percent increase due to property tax reductions. Skidmore and Peddle conclude that impact fees represent a means not only to redistributing infrastructural costs but also to slowing residential growth to more efficient levels.</p>

Examples from the Housing and Urban Development (HUD), such as Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE VI), are used to exemplify the influence of New Urbanism in housing policy. While some new urbanist projects, such as Seaside, Florida, cast New Urbanism as an unaffordable strategy, HOPE VI projects have shown how new urbanist design principles can be used to develop low-income housing that is both appealing and well integrated into traditional urban communities. While the private sector has been largely unwilling and/or unable to produce low-income housing units, the authors provide examples of projects from various US cities that demonstrate a diversity of arrangements between the public and private sectors. To further enhance affordable housing communities, through the principles of New Urbanism, the authors recommend such government actions as inclusionary zoning, fair-share housing policies, density bonuses, and construction subsidies.</p>

<p>Irvine, Columbia, and the Woodlands were new towns of the 1960s and 1970s that have often been considered as models for sprawl reduction and smart growth planning. To evaluate this claim, Forsyth offers case studies of each of these communities with explicit emphasis on their successes in meeting smart growth goals including the provision of diverse and affordable housing stocks. Data for these case studies are obtained from a number of sources, including interviews, census data, community archives, and GIS mapping, and so on. Because each of these communities grew to be full-scale cities of 100,000 to over 400,000 persons, Forsyth states they have been forced to tackle affordable housing issues avoided by other residential developments of their time. These towns are said to represent innovative approaches to housing with Irvine pioneering efforts to develop housing for diversified household types and Columbia being a leader in the racial integration. Each new town includes government-sponsored affordable housing which accounts for 5–6 percent of their housing stocks. According to Forsyth, the design quality of this affordable housing is great and virtually indistinguishable from more expensive housing within these communities. However, these towns have experienced difficulty in developing a private affordable housing market. While Forsyth concludes that Columbia, Irvine, and the Woodlands appear to be in line with many goals of smart growth and New Urbanism, she remains uncertain about their success in enhancing social equity.</p>

These two types of development have different underlying philosophies. However, Grant found them to be very similar in terms of design, site location, safety concern, community governance, and demographics. Both types of communities were found to be principally marketed to upscale households and were socially homogenous. While New Urbanism embraced diversity in theory, Grant claimed that in practice these developments exhibit less diversity than conventional suburbs. Instead, New Urbanist developments primarily provided housing for the privileged classes, demonstrating New Urbanism’s limited viability in promoting affordable housing opportunities.</p>

In this case study of Park DuValle, Hanlon used media reports, sites studies and assessments, housing authority documents, and census data to understand the financing of the development and assessed its socioeconomic impact. While Park DuValle has been considered a highly successful example of HOPE VI revitalization in terms of public–private partnership formation, falling poverty rates, and attracting higher-income residents, Hanlon pointed out a number of more troubling trends. In terms of finance, with private sector funding only account for 36.6 percent, federal, state, and local dollars were still the main financial sources. Further, the project essentially replaced 1,116 public housing units with 363 onsite units and 140 offsite units, creating substantial concerns about displacement of very low-income households. Many of these displaced residents were found to have been moved to other public housing units in neighborhoods with high rates of poverty and unemployment, suggesting that these residents were merely relocated from one highly distressed neighborhood to another. Housing improvements for former Cotter-Lang residents were also found to be limited, in terms of rent and safety in their new neighborhoods.</p>

<p>This article is quite descriptive, presenting how and to what extent affordability is considered in New Urbanism based on a valuable survey of new urbanist developers across the nation. A majority of the respondents (about 55.6 percent) indicated that affordable housing was concluded in their projects for various reasons, for instance, meeting community demand, receiving financial assistance, and local government requirement. Federal, state, and local governments all played important roles, by adopting various programs to provide financial incentives to developers, subsidies to home buyers or renters, and infrastructure support for a community. However, 62.7 percent of the respondents stated that their development was located at an exurban (42.2 percent) or a suburban (20.5 percent) site. Obviously, these projects were not targeted at low-income population. The other 44.4 percent of respondents did not consider affordability, most often because of profit reason. They thought low-income population was an “inappropriate mix” and their properties were too expensive for this population. It is worthwhile to point out that the authors admit that with the survey cover letter stating affordability as the purpose of their study, the respondents (with response rate 38 percent) could be self-selective. Developers who did not consider affordability tend not respond. This implies that affordable housing may be less considered in practice than as described in the article.</p>

<p>Noting that other studies have identified positive relationships between New Urbanism and property values, Matthews and Turnbull pose the question of what elements of New Urbanism are most influential and pay particular attention to the influence from street layout and design. The study focuses on two communities within King County, Washington, one with a more traditional urban gridiron street layout and another exemplifying conventional curvilinear suburban street design. The study utilizes a hedonic model with housing and neighborhood data from county tax assessment records. GIS techniques are used to develop variables for land use mixes, population densities, and street distances. Space syntax and an alternative ratio method are used to measure neighborhood layout and street connectivity. Results suggest that proximity to retail tends to have a positive and significant impact on property values in pedestrian-oriented communities, but an insignificant relationship in more automobile reliant communities. Neighborhood layout and design are also shown to have an effect that is both sensitive to measurement and covaries with other relevant variables. The authors conclude that while the appeal of New Urbanism design may not be universal, it does satisfy the needs of significant subsets of the population.</p>

<p>Song and Knaap conduct this study to determine whether the design features of New Urbanism have an effect on property values. The study operationalizes the new urbanist design features of street design, density, land use mix, transportation accessibility, and walkability as key independent variables. Focused on the Washington County portion of Portland Oregon, data are derived from tax assessment records, the US Census, and the Portland Metro’s regional land use system to capture the 48,070 transactions conducted between 1990 and 2000. A hedonic price model is utilized to identify both the isolated and combined housing value effects of the variables. Findings indicate that while some components, such as access to light rail, have positive effects on home values, others, including high residential density and proximity to commercial land uses can lessen property value. To understand the combined effect of these results, Song and Knaap use the model to compute the predicted value of a standardized house in a new urbanist neighborhood, and compare it to that of a more traditionally designed neighborhood. The home in the new urbanist neighborhood is found to command a 15.5 percent price premium, indicating that the virtues of New Urbanism are deemed to outweigh its detractions.</p>

<p>Considering mixed land uses as an emphasized component of smart growth, Song and Knaap utilize GIS to determine the effects of mixed land uses on residential property values in Washington County, Oregon. The study uses factors, such as accessibility, neighborhood land use proportions, and balance of housing to jobs, to assess whether mixed land uses led to lower or higher property values. According to their findings, prices tended to increase with better proximity to commercial centers and public parks, decrease with proximity to multifamily housing, and keep stable with proximity to industrial and other institutional land uses. Song and Knaap also report that prices increase in neighborhoods with similar land use activities. In conclusion, the authors state that simply mixing land uses is not sufficient for achieving real smart growth.</p>

<p>Talen defines the social goals as community engagement, social equity, and the common good, and develops a methodology for evaluating the social significance of New Urbanism. While high-income new urbanist communities, such as Celebration, Florida, and Kentlands, Maryland, have not been deemed as being socially equitable, Talen moves beyond these examples and considers the social potential of the New Urbanism movement as a whole. To do this, Talen evaluates the twenty-seven principles of the Chapter of New Urbanism. While none of these principles are found to be explicitly linked to community goals, eight were found to be related to goals of social equity, and nineteen were found to be related to achieving a common good. Two goals pertaining to housing fell within the social equity category: promoting affordable housing through urban infill development and population diversity through integrating multiple housing types within neighborhoods. According to Talen, mixing housing types serves as one of the only ways that planners can address the issues of concentrated poverty and enhance the opportunity for resources to be distributed in a geographically equitable manner.</p>

<p>The rebuilding plans in the Mississippi Gulf Coast after the Hurricane Katrina followed the New Urbanism model. These activities have generated a new round of discussions about how to promote social equity. In this article, Talen interpreted social equality as good community engagement, appropriate socioeconomic diversity, and equal access to activities at the neighborhood level. She assessed whether the rebuilding activities have promoted social equality. Two innovative practices, Katrina cottage and Smartcode, were viewed as successful tools in promoting affordability. A Katrina cottage is a small and easily constructed housing unit. A smartcode allows for mixed activities and house types in a zone and is a replacement of a traditional zoning. Talen, nevertheless, also pointed out that many urban urbanism practices in the public realm were against the goal of promoting social equity. For instance, major transportation projects and plans paid little attention to walkability. Municipalities failed to adopt an appropriate neighborhood organization structure, which Talen thought is critical for maintain social equality. A section is specifically devoted in discussing how to promote affordability. It is argued that both policy and design are critical. The focus on architecture and design is often observed in practices. However, very little attention is put on policy side. In Mississippi, local governments did not advocate such political tools as linkage fees, profit sharing, and inclusionary zoning. Talen called for efforts to fill the gap between policy and design.</p>

<p>Social mixing is one important principle in urban urbanism development to promote diversity and to fight urban poverty. At the same time, new urbanists attempt to maintain housing affordability by reducing the size and therefore directly lowering property cost. Further, it is claimed that walkability reduces living costs (related to transportation) and makes houses more affordable. In this article, Talen evaluated whether new urbanism is affordable in a market economy. She conducted a survey of housing prices in 234 New Urbanism neighborhoods (excluding governmental projects), with a response rate of 65.0 percent. The lowest unit price for each neighborhood was compared with the corresponding local salary level. Results indicate that only 15 percent of the neighborhoods have at least one house that is affordable for a moderate income person, 10 percent have such a unit for teacher with median salary, and 1 percent for a cook. Talen further examined levels of affordability based on home sales information by region. New Urbanism neighborhoods in the Midwest region tended to have higher level of affordability. Talen pointed out that strategies need to consider local market factors and regulatory background. In areas with low land value and low affordability requirement in local policy, the focus should be on design. In areas with high land value and low affordability regulation, planners need to consider both design elements and cost-effective ways. Planners may also play the role as coordinators to promote walkability between neighborhoods. For areas with high land value and high level of regulation, government policy will be an effective tool.</p>

<p>In this empirical study of the new urbanist community of Kentlands, Maryland, Tu and Eppli consider the desirability of New Urbanism and the willingness of housing consumers to pay for its benefits. The authors use multiple hedonic models to determine whether Kentlands housing prices are different in comparison to similar housing units located in more traditionally planned communities within the same county. Housing data from the Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation were acquired for 2,061 transactions occurring between 1994 and 1996, 13 percent of which were for housing units located in Kentlands. Location within Kentlands was used to operationalize New Urbanism as the key independent variable with twenty-eight other independent variables also used to control for housing characteristics. Analysis of the model indicates that housing in the Kentlands commanded premiums of approximately 12 percent or $25,000 more than homes in other nearby communities. An analysis of interaction effects demonstrates that higher prices in the Kentlands are likely attributable to New Urbanism. While the authors state that this study demonstrates increased housing values may be associated with New Urbanism, they also warn that results are not necessarily generalizable because the study only focuses on a single community.</p>

Relevant factors (e.g., retail development, crime rates, accessibility, noise, and pollution) are incorporated into three statistical models to provide a better understanding of their relationship and collective effect upon residential property values. Home sale prices are gathered using 1991–1994 county tax assessment records, and information on retail activity and crime rates are obtained from marketing research of the Atlanta Regional Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Results convey that while properties located within a quarter mile of a station are found to sell for 19 percent less than those located further away, properties located between 1 and 3 miles of a station are found to have higher values than those further away from transit stations. Cumulative results suggest variations related to income levels, and distance from both stations and downtown. The largest positive effects are found in high income neighborhoods located between a quarter mile and 3 miles of a station, and negative effects beyond the quarter mile mark were generally restricted to low income communities. Negative crime effects are seen to be contained mostly in downtown areas. </p>

<p>Santa Clara County, California, an area confronted with traffic congestion and housing affordability problems, has made extensive efforts to promote transit-oriented development (TOD) as a strategy for coping with these issues. This analysis of the real-estate capitalization effects of light rail and commuter rail proximity is intended to demonstrate the economic benefits of these efforts. The study utilizes a hedonic price model with the per square foot value of land designated as the dependent variable. Sale prices for the year 1999 are attainted through the real-estate transaction database. Metroscan and GIS are utilized to determine proximity to transit systems, including light and commuter rail systems as well as freeways. While benefits are associated with proximity to all forms of transit, the greatest are found in rail transit, especially commuter rail. Furthermore, while a disamenity effect is associated with being located too close to freeways, no such effect found is found for rail transit. The study also finds that neighborhood characteristics of TODs, such as mixed land uses and job-resident balance, added value to residential parcels. In conclusion, Cervero and Duncan note that municipalities can take advantage of these economic benefits through property taxes and the joint development of properties within close proximity to transit.</p>

<p>Recognizing the diversity of methodologies, foci, and results of research pertaining to the connection between property value and proximity to railway stations, Debrezion et al. utilize meta-analytic methods to explain the variation in existing studies and further explore this relationship. After reviewing previous studies, the authors propose a hedonic pricing method, known as the meta-regression model, to synthesize fifty-seven preexisting studies. The dependent variable of the effect size of railway stations on property values is standardized into the percentage change of property value or rent for every 250 meters of distance between a property and a railway station as well as the general effect of being located within a quarter mile of a station. Independent variables include whether a property is residential or commercial, accessibility to other transportation modes, and type of railway transit. Findings indicate a price increase of approximately 4.2 percent for the average residence within a quarter mile of a train station, and prices also increase by 2.4 percent for every 250 meters they are closer to a station. Commuter rail is also shown to have a stronger impact than other railway types. The authors also find accessibility to other modes of transit, such as highways, to lower impacts of studies and warn that isolating studies to only the effects of rail may lead to omitted variable bias.</p>

<p>This article explores the effects of a twenty-year-old light rail system on residential property values in Buffalo, New York. The study is unique in that it looks at the effects of rail transit in the context of a declining Rustbelt city, opposed to previous studies which tend to focus on growing Sunbelt cities, such as Dallas or Portland. In order to capture the value of all residential properties, the authors paired the 2002 Buffalo property tax assessment database with GIS maps to identify properties located within a half mile of transit stations. Utilizing a hedonic regression model, the authors find that the expected value of properties located within a half of a mile of transit stations increases $.99 to $2.31 per foot of distance to the station, indicating property value increases of $990 to $2,310 for properties located within 1,000 feet of light rail transit stations. While findings suggest that proximity to light rail does increase property value in Buffalo, these increases are not as great as those that have been found in growing urban areas. The authors perceive this finding as a potential opportunity for the city of Buffalo to promote transit friendly and affordable housing.</p>

<p>Kahn’s analysis of the effects of transit enhancements is inclusive of fourteen major US cities that either built or expanded railway transit systems between the years of 1970 and 2000. This study is said to be unique from others because it includes such a large area and also identifies the occurrence of gentrification as the dependent variable. Analysis is performed through a linear probability model with data obtained from a number of sources including the Urban Institute and the National Transportation Atlas. Gentrification is defined and operationalized by both changes in home prices and the demographic share of college graduates. Kahn also distinguishes between the effects of “park and ride” stations and “walk and ride” stations. The authors find that results fluctuate among the various cities studied. However, the analysis indicates a pattern of communities that received “walk and ride” stations experiencing increases in both housing prices and shares of college graduates, while those with “park and ride” stations experienced decreases in these factors. Thus, results indicate that pedestrian oriented stations may serve as magnets for gentrification, while automobile-oriented stations may actually serve to attract poverty.</p>

<p>In this study, Knaap et al. explore the effects of planned light rail transit on both property values and development patterns in Washington County, Oregon. The light rail system, connecting downtown Portland to other cities within the metropolitan area, was formally announced in 1993 and opened in 1998. To understand the effects of this transit advancement and the planning process which framed its implementation, Knaap et al. consider how land values changed between the announcement of the transit line’s construction and its completion. A hedonic regression model is constructed, using data pertaining to the transactions of all vacant land parcels within a mile of future rail stations from January 1992 to August 1996. Results indicate that while land values along the corridor were not statistically higher than outside parcels in 1992 or 1993, parcels within a half mile of the proposed stations were 71 percent higher in 1994 and 21 percent higher in 1995. Parcels within a mile of the proposed stations were 10 percent higher in 1994 and 9 percent higher in 1995. According to Knaap et al., these findings suggest that information about light rail plans are observed by developers and capitalized into land values, and the model supports planning’s ability to alter land development patterns.</p>

<p>Lund’s study uses survey data of Californians living in transit oriented developments (TODs) to better understand who moves to TODs as well as their motivations. Data are obtained from surveys of 605 recent residents of TODs within California’s largest metropolitan areas (Los Angles, San Diego, and San Francisco Bay) during 2003 and 2004. Results indicate that residents in these communities were less likely to be Hispanic and low-income and more likely to be employed as professionals or office workers in comparison to the residents of their surrounding cities. In addition to demographic questions, the survey asked respondents to indicate their top three reasons for moving into a TOD. The three most highly ranked motivations include quality/type of housing, housing costs, and quality of neighborhoods. Binary logistic regression is employed to determine the probability of a respondent indicating certain preferences. Cost of housing was deemed to be most important to lower-income households and also ranked of higher significance of those living in the Los Angles and Bay areas. Lund suggests that these preferences indicate that TODs can assist in meeting a wide range of needs extending beyond transit.</p>

<p>McMillen and McDonald’s study focuses on the price effects of transit enhancements in Chicago, Illinois. In order to determine both anticipated and realized benefits of the railway opening, the authors utilize data from tax records that are inclusive of 17,034 single-family transactions occurring within 1.5 miles of the rail line from the years of 1983 to 1999. Utilizing GIS to identify proximity to the line, hedonic regression and sales estimation methods are used to determine the price effects of distance to stations in twelve different communities along the rail line. While price changes varied among different station areas, the authors find that the overall rate of increase in the study areas were 6.89 percent higher than other nearby homes for the years of 1986 and 1999. Furthermore, the rate of increase was 4.02 percent higher for the 1986 to 1990 time period, indicating that anticipated benefits have been capitalized into housing prices several years prior to the railway’s opening. These differences amount to an estimated premium of approximately $6,000 per home, suggesting a heightened willingness to pay for proximity to light rail transit systems.</p>

<p>Renne’s dissertation research takes a nationwide approach in exploring the effects of TODs on commuting trends and demographic patterns, as well as how private land market and public policy influence housing affordability in TODs. To answer these research questions, both quantitative and qualitative methods are employed. Time-series analysis of 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 US Census Data is used to compare and contrast travel trends, automobile ownership, and demographic distributions of 103 TODs compared to their respective metropolitan areas. Overall, nonwhite and foreign born populations within the TODs are found to be similar to that of the surrounding metropolitan areas. However, some variations are demonstrated, such as significantly higher numbers of nonwhites living in California TODs and less living in Miami TODs. TODs are also found to have higher rates of poverty and higher percentages of renters than other areas of their respective metropolitan areas. While Renne finds no conclusive evidence of displacement, he warns that development trends and consumer demands may lead to future trends of gentrification. To further explore these issues, case studies of smart growth and transit oriented development policies in the states of California, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida, and Oregon are presented. While these states exemplify substantial achievement in addressing smart growth goals, Renne notes that California has been the only state to strongly address affordable housing, and governmental policies are identified as a necessary component for achieving goals of affordable housing and compact development.</p>

<p>State governments play critical role in TOD development, because they often define the overall political tone and provide financial support. In California, with strong grass-root support for smart growth, the state has initiated several programs to provide grant and technical support to encourage mixed-use and TOD. Further, the state replaced the old tax credit distribution system (a random lottery system) with a new point-based one that considers various amenities, including distance to a public transit system. This increased accessibility of affordable homes. New Jersey has a comprehensive agenda for promoting TOD, covering most important elements in planning, such as affordable housing, open space preservation, brownfield development, zoning, and transportation. The State government is directly involved in TOD projects through the designation of nineteen transit villages that are directly supervised by the state government. In Australian political system, the state government has more power. Western Australia adopted the Network City Action Plan, which links local TODs to regional growth to promote a city network with interconnected TODs. The TOD committee was formed in 2004 as a cross-agency group involving various state and local offices, and directly worked with developers to expedite TOD programs. Based on the experience of these three states, Renne recommended ten strategies to promote TOD, covering such issues as intrastate and intergovernmental cooperation, participation from the transportation and public housing sectors, well-prepared short- and long-term plans, independent committee to provide supervision.</p>

</list> The HOPE VI program has sought to reform public housing by revitalizing urban public housing sites through new urbanist design including the implementation of mixed-income housing. In this study of Atlanta, Boston explores the effects of these revitalization efforts on the recipients of public housing. The study employs a quasi-experimental design which compares residents of three public housing communities that underwent revitalization projects in the late 1990s and early 2000s to three that were not. The Atlanta Housing Authority’s administrative data are used to provide data from 1995 to 2001 on 1,235 households in revitalized public housing projects and 1,483 households living in nonrevitalized public housing. While previous studies have claimed that mixed-income revitalization will lead to higher levels of displacement from public housing, Boston finds that attrition rates were actually 4 percent lower for households in the revitalized communities compared to those that were not revitalized. Further logistic regression analysis found no significant differences in housing assistance attrition through revitalized and unrevitalized areas. Boston finds that recipients using housing vouchers as well as those living in revitalized projects have gained greater housing choice, and demonstrated substantially higher rates of employment (45 percent and 50.3 percent, respectively), compared to those who relocated to conventional public housing (19.8 percent). Boston concludes that properly administered revitalization and relocation programs, such as HOPE VI projects, have the potential to create better housing outcomes for public housing recipients.</p>

<p>In this article, Farris outlines those barriers believed to prevent a greater volume of urban infill redevelopment. The price of developing a square foot of land on a previously undeveloped suburban site is estimated to be approximately $.25 to $4.00, based on his seventeen-year experience as a developer in St. Louis. Conversely, the redevelopment of a square foot of urban land is estimated to cost $15.00 per square foot if all relevant fees and requirements are considered. Farris’s extensive list of barriers also includes the challenges of marketing urban lifestyles, negative externalities, eminent domain issues, a complex system of red tape, infrastructure replacement, historic preservation interests, the requirements of incoming businesses, and the threat of gentrification and displacement. Because of these extensive costs, Farris feels public subsidies are likely to be required to encourage urban infill redevelopment projects. Farris recommends that proponents of smart growth direct the focus of their energies to a more realistic task of creating more efficient and denser developments on the urban periphery rather than large scale redevelopment of existing urban locations.</p>

<p>This article explores the challenges and opportunities presented to smart growth by inner ring suburbs, which have experienced population and income declines in recent decades. According to Lee and Leigh, because inner ring suburbs have the advantage of proximity to both the metropolitan center and the urban fringes, they offer a prime opportunity for achieving smart growth goals, such as promoting spatial balance between jobs and housing. Furthermore, inner ring suburban housing is recognized for its ability to accommodate affordable and mixed-income housing development and revitalization. However, few policies exist to target the issues confronting inner ring suburbs. To prevent further deterioration and take advantage of housing opportunities offered by inner ring suburbs, the authors recommend considerations for infrastructure improvements, public private partnerships, fair-share housing policies, location efficient mortgages, and regional tax sharing. An “Urbanizing Tier System” that accounts for differentiated development patterns throughout urban areas is also considered as an alternative to urban growth boundaries.</p>

<p>Focusing on poor urban neighborhoods, Ryan and Weber analyze the influence of design on property values within the context of urban revitalization through new housing construction. The authors identify three distinct development types for analysis: traditional neighborhood design which includes conventional gridiron streets, enclaves that tend to be more isolated from existing development, and infill development that is designed to fit in with the existing built environment. The study focuses on Chicago census tracts which are at least 2 miles from the central business district, with poverty rate exceeding 20 percent. Construction permit data are used to identify the location of 823 parcels where new housing was built. Cook County tax assessment records were then used to determine the assessed value of these parcels. Cluster analysis establishes the key independent variable of neighborhood design with specific design characteristics assigned to each category, thus also allowing the authors to explore what elements of each design scheme were most influential. Data are analyzed in a standard hedonic model which reveals infill housing to be the most highly valued. Values for enclave development are shown to be 22–29 percent less than those of infill developments, and traditional neighborhood development had values of 22–27 percent less than those of infill developments. The authors interpret these findings as evidence that consumers desire and are willing to pay a premium for new housing that is integrated into existing development patterns.</p>

<p>This article looks at the impacts on housing prices from the neighborhood revitalization effort of New York City’s Ten-Year Plan. This program was initiated in the 1980s to address issues of homelessness, housing affordability, and vacant properties. Extended years beyond its original time frame, the program has constructed or rehabilitated more than 180,000 housing units in distressed neighborhoods. Considering these successes, the authors pose the questions of what have been the effects on the prices of nearby properties (spillover effects), how the size of developments affects these prices, and how the effects vary between owner occupied and rental projects. To do this, 1987–2000 data are obtained from the city department of finance, and a sample of over 293,000 housing sales for 1980–1999 is obtained from the Real Property Assessment database. GIS overlay is used to estimate proximity of these properties to the project sites. Because these projects generally occurred in distressed neighborhoods, large price gaps exist between these neighborhoods and the city average. Results suggest that revitalization projects helped shrink the gap by 1.8 percent for projects of 1–50 units, 3.3 percent for those with 50–100 units, and 7.4 percent for those with more than 100 units. While homeowners, landlords, and vacant land holders benefited from this, some renters have experienced increased rent burdens.</p>

<p>This edited transcript from the 1998 Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning captures the discussion of a group of planning scholars on the future of downtown housing as well as its advantages and disadvantages. Consensus has been reached that housing is an important component of urban revitalization, and downtown living has the potential to cater to the housing needs of the growing demographic groups of empty-nesters and young professionals. Downtown housing often utilizes a building stock that is ripe for conversion, and promotes high-density uses. However, challenges are also acknowledged, such as zoning regulations, tenure mismatches, lack of downtown development experiences, displacement issues, and garnering public support for downtown housing. The common concerns of potential downtown housing consumers include amenities, parking, and safety. Growth management strategies, such as urban growth boundaries, are discussed for their potential impacts on both downtown residential development and leapfrog developments. The success of downtown housing is seen to largely depend on marketing and the availability of subsidies.</p>

<p>Urban infill is often seen as a means for economic redevelopment. However, it is also considered a source of gentrification and subsequent housing affordability problems. Noting the relevance of urban infill as part of the smart growth agenda, Steinacker addresses infill in terms of residential redevelopment and housing affordability. Through statistical analysis of the fifty largest US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) over 1996–2000, this study discovers that infill development is positively associated with market rents, but negatively related to median income and housing affordability. Infill development is shown to occur on a greater scale in cities with expensive rental housing markets and low affordability rates. Therefore, while urban infill may serve as a viable mechanism for economic development, it may also be potentially detrimental to affordable housing opportunities.</p>

</list> Using New Haven County, Connecticut’s watershed as a case study, the authors focus on the impacts of open space and other land use amenities on property values. Although many previous studies have addressed this question using urban and rural designation variables, this particular analysis is intended to offer new insights by considering open space proximity. To do this, a hedonic price model is chosen that relates housing prices (in logarithm form) to environmental attributes. Data used in this research include home sales transaction information for 4,000 New Haven County homes for the years of 1995 and 1997, demographic data from the 1990 Census, and 1990 US Geographical Survey land use data. The analysis demonstrates a significant and positive correlation between proximity to open space and residential property values, and a negative correlation between heterogeneous landscapes to property values. By utilizing distance variables, the authors state that more implicit values of land uses which account for proximity to amenities, such as open space, may be revealed.</p>

<p>Bolitzer and Netusil utilize three hedonic pricing models to determine the relationship between home values and existing open space in Portland, Oregon. The first investigates value effects for properties within 1,500 feet of an open space. The second model differentiates open space by type (public park, golf course, private park, or cemetery). The third model considers the magnitude effects of distance between the open space and a residential property, within the 1,500-feet buffer area. Using a log specification for the first model, a home within 1,500 feet of a 20-acre open space is expected to have a selling price of $1,247 more than a home that is not in proximity to an open space. When open space types are differentiated, public parks and golf courses are shown to have positive and significant effects, while private parks and cemeteries are not. The third model demonstrates the greatest, but insignificant, price effects from an open space within a half of a block. According to Bolitzer and Netusil, other benefits, such as improved water quality, are likely to result from the presence of open space, but such benefits are not likely to be reflected in housing values. The results indicate that increases in property tax values may be achieved through the protection of open space and offer the potential to offset the costs of open space preservation.</p>

<p>With the utilization of a hedonic regression model, Geoghegan examines the effects of proximity to open space on residential land values in Howard County, Maryland. Furthermore, effects are also differentiated on the basis of whether open space is classified as “permanent” or “developable.” The data set comes from the Maryland Office of Planning and provides transaction information for 5,599 home purchases occurring in Howard County between September 1993 and June 1996. It is predicted that the benefits of this proximity will be capitalized into a higher selling price for the home and that permanent open space will have larger effects than developable open space. The estimated coefficients for the hedonic model indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between proximity to open space and residential property value. Furthermore, permanent open space is shown to command a higher premium than land that is open for future development. This suggests that open space preservation can potentially generate higher land tax revenues that could in turn be utilized to fund further conservation efforts.</p>

<p>This analysis considers the effects of open space on the values of residential property in central Maryland. According to Irwin, the spillover effects of open space on nearby residential property values vary depending on the use of the land and whether it is susceptible to future development or permanently protected. Utilizing 55,799 housing transaction records from the late 1990s, Irwin constructs a hedonic pricing model to test whether different types of open space generate different spillover effects. Privately owned conservation land and public open space are found to have a positive and significant effect on the value of neighboring properties in comparison to proximity to developable open space. For example, the conversion of 1 acre of developable pasture land to privately owned conservation land is expected to increase the mean value of neighboring residential property by 1.87 percent. Conversely, higher density and nonresidential land uses are found to have a significantly negative spillover effect with conversion to commercial space, resulting in an anticipated decline in value of 2.56 percent. These findings suggest that open space demand is motivated by the promise of no future development rather than open space amenities, such as biodiversity or scenic views.</p>

<p>Kaufman and Cloutier’s study on the property effects of greenspaces and brownfields is unique from other research for two reasons. First, the authors use a hedonic model and simultaneously identify the price effects of both greenspaces and brownfields. Second, they use their findings to predict potential changes in property values if the brownfields were converted to greenspace. Kenosha’s Lincoln neighborhood in Wisconsin is used as a case study. This is a primarily working-class community that has suffered from both economic disinvestment and environmental degradation as a result of a declining manufacturing industry. At the time of the study, the neighborhood contained two abandoned industrial sites covering a combined area of 33.25 acres as well as a 44-acre city park. Real property values for 890 residential properties are obtained through city property tax assessment data. After demonstrating a negative relationship between brownfields and property values and a positive relationship between greenspace and property values, Kaufman and Cloutier proceed to determine the effects of remediation of brownfields into greenspace using an inverse distance model and a log distance model. Results of these two analyses suggest an average property value increase of $2,694 to $7,873. Therefore, collective property values of the Lincoln neighborhood have the potential to rise 2.4 to 7.01 million dollars if existing brownfields were to be converted to greenspace.</p>

<p>The cross-sectional hedonic model is a commonly used tool for evaluating the effects of policy and amenities on housing prices. However, Riddel challenges that these studies may be ill equipped for addressing environmental amenities which change over time, in contrast with the problematic assumption about a static equilibrium of housing market. Therefore, her study of the effects of Boulder, Colorado’s greenbelt program incorporates a model error correction approach that allows for endogenous environmental quality. The model evaluates time-series trends of environmental quality on the housing and labor markets. Locally collected data for the years of 1981 to 1995 are used to assess the effects of the municipally owned greenbelt. The model conveys that the program causes shifts in both the supply and demand curves which have resulted in housing prices rising by an estimated 3.75 percent. Furthermore, enhanced amenities offered by the greenbelt are deemed as responsible for a drop in average wages. However, it is also noted that the program actually encouraged residential development and leapfrogging, and thus the program did not meet its initial goal of hindering residential growth. Riddel concludes in recommending the advantages of a time-series approach and suggesting that the model may be useful in estimating the effects of other environmental policies.</p>

<p>Identifying open space conversion as a strong growth management concern of the late 1990s, Wu et al. consider the effects of growth management on housing development and price in Multnomah County, Oregon, part of the Portland metropolitan area. The authors chose an urban equilibrium model to determine the effects of open space and other amenities on density and property value. Data for Multnomah County are obtained from a number of sources including the MetroScan real estate database, Portland’s Metro Regional Services agency, and the metro area’s geographic information system. The model suggests that households are willing to pay more for newer houses located closer to less developed areas. Higher values are associated with better views, further distance from industry, and less traffic congestion. Essentially, open space is demonstrated as a valued amenity and is often associated with lower housing densities. This leads to a dilemma for developers who are inclined to provide more housing on more valued lands which in turn increases density and consequently lowers housing prices.</p>

</list> The purposes of this study are to analyze how growth management policies affect affordability. By considering a housing expense and income ratio, the authors explicitly look at housing affordability rather than housing price or value for low-to-moderate-income households. A household consuming more than 30 percent of their income is defined as unaffordable for a house. King County in Washington, Montgomery County in Maryland, and the New Jersey counties of Somerset and Middlesex have well-developed growth management policies, and are chosen for the study. Fairfax County, Virginia, adopts more traditional development policies, and is used as a comparison. Census data for the years 1990 and 2000 are used to determine percentages of income spent on housing in these counties. Results indicate that affordability of owner occupied housing units decreased for all growth management counties. Rental affordability decreased in the New Jersey counties, remained the same in King County, and increased in Montgomery County. The authors attribute Montgomery County’s success to its implementation of the Moderately Priced Dwelling Unit Program from 1974, which combines density bonuses with preservation measures. Results show that Farifax County had the largest improvement in affordability levels, but still had the highest affordable housing gaps.</p>

<p>Glaeser and Gyourko state that the majority of US housing is priced relatively close to its cost of construction, suggesting that housing affordability problems may very well stem from poverty rather than housing costs. However, they also identify a number of markets with housing prices that greatly exceed construction costs, prompting the question of what drives prices so high in these places. The authors suggest that zoning plays a significant role in hindering the production of housing and consequently driving up its cost through a “zoning tax” which can force homeowners to consume larger than desired quantities of land. To validate this theory, statistical testing of data from the 1999 American Housing Survey is conducted to determine how housing prices correspond with regulation, population density, and lot sizes. The intensive value of land is determined by linear and logarithmic regressions of housing prices as a function of lot size and a number of other housing characteristics, while the extensive value is determined by differences between structural prices and housing costs. According to Glaeser and Gyourko, both methodologies should produce similar values in a free market. However, results reveal significant difference, suggesting a strong influence of regulation. Further analysis indicates expensive markets are not generally associated with higher densities, and regulation is responsible for housing price increases rather than high demand. Using these findings as support, the authors recommend zoning reform as an important component to lowering the costs of housing.</p>

<p>According to Glaeser and Gyourko, American perceptions of a housing affordability crisis are distorted by other poverty-related issues. Instead, housing costs are generally in line with construction costs in most parts of the country, with the exception of some extremely expensive markets, such as New York City. This article explores the correlation between these high-priced housing markets and land use regulations to determine their role in inflicting higher housing prices. Data from the 1999 American Housing Survey, 2000 US Census, and R. S. Means construction cost data are used to determine how construction costs differ from total housing costs across US regions. Results indicate that housing prices tend to highly exceed their respective construction costs in the West. To explain why housing prices are higher in certain regions, the relationship to zoning is considered, particularly in the context of density, regulatory barriers, and time constraints. The stringency of zoning regulations is found to be highly correlated to increasing housing prices. For example, an increase in the amount of time required to obtain a zoning permit are shown to bring 15 percent of a city’s housing stock into a more expensive price range. Glaeser and Gyourko conclude that reducing the costs associated with zoning would have a much higher impact on housing prices than subsidized housing programs. However, they also acknowledge that this study is focused on regulation costs, rather than benefits, and that existing homeowners are likely to experience the negative effect of decreased housing values as a result of new zoning policies that would allow for more affordable housing in their communities. Thus, compensatory measures would likely be needed to subsidize this loss.</p>

<p>In this study of growth management in California, Landis evaluates the growth management techniques of annual housing caps, residential adequate public facilities ordinances (APFO), urban growth boundaries, annexation limits, and voter-enacted supermajority approval requirements. With a strong emphasis on housing, this evaluation explores the areas of housing supply and demand, production, pricing, and displacement. Using GIS and regression analysis, Landis makes comparisons between California cities and finds that cities with local growth management controls demonstrate more success in meeting housing production demands than those without such measures. Findings also indicate that growth management policies both directly and indirectly raise housing prices. While displacement due to growth management is positive and statistically significant, it is not considered substantially large. Landis concludes that when growth management policies are designed to allow for the required level of housing production, such measures will not be the primary source of increased housing prices and rents.</p>

<p>The intent of Green’s study is to describe how land use restrictions affect housing costs, including its distributional impacts, as well as the magnitude. Green notes that previous research has largely indicated that zoning increases the cost of housing. This study examines impacts of land use restrictions in Waukesha County, Wisconsin on both price and affordability. Affordability is defined as the availability of homes costing less than $75,000. Data are obtained from a 1992 study of zoning codes and summary files collected in the 1990 Population and Housing Census, and a least squares regression model is used for analysis. There are six policies designated as regulatory variables: subdivision lot width requirements, frontage setbacks, minimum street widths, sidewalk requirements, curb and gutter requirements, and the prohibition of mobile homes. Both mobile home provisions and minimal width requirements have significant effects. Regulations forbidding mobile homes increased the price of homes from 7.1 to 8.5 percent and decreased the stock of affordable housing by 6 to 8 percent. For every additional 10 feet of required lot length, prices are found to increase by 6.1 to 7.8 percent and reduce the share of affordable housing by 3 to 4 percent. Noting that the impacts of such regulations fall most heavily on low-income groups, Green states that any further tightening of land use restrictions will likely result in increased burdens for Waukesha County’s growing population of entry-level workers.</p>

<p>In this article, Green et al. estimate supply elasticities for individual metropolitan areas and explain differences that exist between these areas, particularly in terms of the stringency of environmental and land use regulations. Data on forty-five metropolitan areas for 1979–1996 are used to determine elasticity estimates through first-stage regression. These elasticities are then used as a dependent variable in a cross-sectional analysis that integrates a number of relevant land market influences including land use regulation. The most elastic markets are found to be in sprawling cities, such as Dallas and Charlotte. The lowest elasticities are found in areas with slower growth, geographic constraints, or compact development patterns, for instance, Providence, San Francisco, Miami, and Chicago. While all stringently regulated cities are found to have less elastic markets, more elastic cities demonstrate more relaxed regulations. However, some cities without stringent regulations demonstrated low price elasticity which was generally explained by slow growth. Higher densities are also deemed to significantly influence price elasticity regardless of whether it was a result of land use regulation or other factors, such as geographic constraints.</p>

<p>In this study, Ihlanfeldt estimates the effects of the restrictiveness of land use regulations on the price of single-family housing and vacant residential land in the state of Florida over 2000–2002. Data are obtained from local property tax roles for twenty-five Florida counties, along with 2000 census data and a 2001 survey of local planners regarding the stringency of local land use restrictions. These land use policies are then gauged through a “restrictiveness index” which subjectively measures the stringency of the restrictions. Analysis is conducted through a reduced form price equation which is also inclusive of a number of other housing characteristics. Results suggest that newly constructed homes will be larger in jurisdictions with more regulations, because regulatory costs are easier to be shifted to homebuyers. In addition, competition between jurisdictions reduces affordability, and restrictive regulations can strongly affect developer’s costs in ways that extend beyond increasing housing costs.</p>

<p>This article considers the influences of high-tech economic activities (the new economy) and land use regulations on housing prices. Seeking to unveil the characteristics of “high-tech localities,” including their association to land use regulations and housing prices, Malpezzi designates “high tech” areas using a previously established index (DeVol, 1999) which accounts for the location quotient of high-tech industries, such as biotechnology and electronics. “Regulated” areas are designated by an index designed by Malpezzi (1996) to account for factors, such as the zoning process and infrastructural adequacy. A number of discursive and descriptive methods are used to test and validate the hypothesis that concentrations of high-tech activities and land use regulations are correlated to higher housing prices. Regression analysis is conducted to test the hypothesis that regulation may be a luxury good demanded by high income groups in localities influenced by the high-tech economy. However, results fail to confirm this hypothesis ceteris paribus. </p>

<p>This study examines the effects of environmental zoning on property values in Portland, Oregon. Netusil states that his study differs from many of its predecessors in the fact that it separately identifies and estimates the development and amenity effects of zoning. A hedonic price model is used to study how environmental zoning and proximity to environmental amenities affect single-family home prices in Multnomah County, Oregon over 1999–2001. Multnomah comprises an area of 92,150 acres, 9,395 of which are designated as an environmental conservation overlay zone (C-zone) and 9,776 as an environmental protection overlay zone (P-zone). P-zones are regulated with the most stringent development regulations, only allowing for new construction under circumstances of “demonstrated public need and benefit.” Approximately 3.42 percent of properties in this study are located within a C- or P-zone. In addition to environmental zoning, amenities such as trees, wetlands, rivers, streams, golf courses, and park access are included in the study. Results varied with locations and access to amenities. Some locations demonstrate statistically insignificant effects of zoning on prices and some are associated with decreased values in environmentally protected zones. Locations in protected zones with good proximity to environmental amenities demonstrate higher values.</p>

<p>This article examines the effects of land use regulation on housing prices in California. Using the 1990 and 2000 Census Public Use Microdata Samples and a survey of land use officials for 407 California cities, the authors explore the relationships between the stringency of land use policy and housing price, housing stock growth, and housing supply elasticity. From the survey, fifteen growth-control measures are identified, and the number of such measures enforced by each city is used to determine regulation stringency. Bivariate regression of these data finds that the addition of each regulatory measure increased the price of owner-occupied housing by 3 percent and increased the cost of rental housing by 1 percent in 1990. In 2000, owner-occupied housing was shown to increase in price by 4.5 for each additional regulation and 2.3 percent in rental housing. Further exploration of the data indicates negative effects from growth restrictions on housing stock growth as well as housing supply elasticity for strongly regulated cities.</p>

<p>Quigley and Rosenthal comprehensively review the history of restrictive land use policy and discuss the methodologies and findings of empirical studies focusing on the relationship of these policies to housing price. The existing body of research is first categorized and critiqued by type. Monopoly zoning studies, which focus on governmental fragmentation, are described as being beneficial in explaining how government concentration can raise housing prices, but are said not to be inclusive of a much needed analysis of regulatory mechanisms. Surveys and place-specific studies dating back to the 1970s are considered for their contributions in explaining the more specific roles that land use policies have played in altering housing prices. While the authors state that this wealth of literature provides insight on a number of considerations, they explicitly state that no firm conclusions about this relationship can be made due to methodological factors such as difficulty in establishing definitive measurements of regulation. Taking this into consideration, the authors conclude that resources should be invested in developing research tools, such as surveys, that can better conceptualize regulation which will in turn enhance the general understanding of the effects of regulation on housing price.</p>

<p>To explore how government regulation has affected escalating housing prices, Schill discusses the concept of regulatory development barriers and presents potential alternatives. While regulations, such as zoning, impact fees, environmental regulations, and other building or infrastructural requirements, may often represent a concern of the common good, Schill states that negative externalities are produced in the form of housing prices, and in many instances these policies often create scarcity and enhance concentrated wealth. A review of existing literature further illustrates that housing costs are increasing due to substantial expenses of money and time which result from complex systems of regulation. Schill states that a strong interest toward maintaining current policies, as well as a lack of knowledge on the subject, is likely to limit the expansion of opportunities for affordable housing. Although smart growth presents a means for defeating some barriers to affordable housing, it also has the potential to create new ones through the reduction of developable land. </p>

<p>This article sets out to discover whether local land use regulations have limited production and raised the cost of rental housing in Massachusetts. Massachusetts makes an interesting venue for studying regulatory impacts on rental housing because rents there are well above the national average, new construction of rental housing is sparse, and Massachusetts has a long history of strict land use regulations. In order to deal with the endogeneity issue of zoning when identifying the effects of land use regulations, the author used an instrumental variable to estimate the effects of local land use regulations on the rental market. She first regressed current regulations on historical municipal characteristics. Then through regression analysis she estimated the effects of the instrument variable on multifamily permits and rents. Data were pulled from local zoning measures in 187 cities in eastern and central Massachusetts. The author found that regulations limited the development of new rental housing. But the effect of zoning on the cost of rent was unclear. These conclusions suggest that neither demand-side nor supply-side subsidies would aid lower income families in relocating to more prosperous neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Noting that policies benefiting suburban homeowners may have unintended negative externalities for low-income renters, Somerville and Mayer consider the effects of government regulation upon housing affordability. Their analysis offers a unique perspective in that it determines housing affordability by looking at a housing stock that filters to low-income renters as new housing becomes available to the affluent. Rental information is derived from the 1984–1994 American Housing Surveys, and regulation variables are established from a prior (1991) survey of sixty cities. Using a measure of 30 percent of income for households earning less than 35 percent of median income to determine the affordability of housing, affordable units within the survey are analyzed to determine if they remained affordable, became unaffordable, became owner-occupied, or were demolished. Multinomial logit analysis was performed to determine if regulations had any effect on such changes. The results suggest that affordable units had a greater chance of filtering up when regulation was present. This means that when new construction was constrained, affordable rental units were more susceptible to being converted to unaffordable rentals and owner-occupied units or being demolished so that land could be utilized for new units. The authors conclude that the effects of land use decisions are not limited to raising housing costs to homeowners and that low-income families also bear the costs of regulation.</p>

<p>This article attempts to clarify the ambiguousness on the topic of whether urban areas with more centralized populations have higher housing costs. The authors believe that the results have important implications for smart growth’s goal of increased population densities. Utilizing a hedonic regression model, the authors determine the relationship between centralization and housing price for 452 cities. The presence of houses costing over $300,000 (based on 2000 housing prices) are also considered to determine the effect on upper priced homes. The results report an expected 2–3 percent decrease in housing prices for every 10 percent increase in population centralization. Increases in centralization also decreased the presences of upper priced homes. The authors theorize this to be attributable to households occupying smaller houses on smaller lots in more centralized areas.</p>

</list> This study serves as a case study which evaluates urban revitalization efforts in Orlando, Florida’s Parramore and Eola neighborhoods, two low-income communities that have been plagued with disinvestment and urban decay. Beginning in the mid-1980s, both communities underwent revitalization initiatives that were heavily influenced by New Urbanism. While Parramore’s redevelopment plan has extended public and commercial facilities, it also resulted in the net displacement of 239 homes and 940 residents during the 1990s. Although housing values and homeownership rates in Parramore both remained low throughout this period, Larsen states that community conditions are ripe for gentrification to occur. Conversely, in Eola, where hundreds of luxury homes have been developed, rents and homeownership rates have increased along with demographic changes that strongly imply gentrification. While strategies, such as mixed-income/tenure housing and HOPE VI redevelopment projects have been implemented in Eola and Parramore, Larsen states revitalization efforts in these communities have failed to address social equity in terms of affordable housing and gentrification. To remedy these issues, Larsen advocates for redevelopment plans and planning policies that are pro-active, comprehensive, and based upon resident participation.</p>

<p>This study uses 1989 and 1992 surveys of 490 California cities and counties to examine the effects of local growth control measures on net housing production from the years of 1980 to 1990. It is intended to test whether displacement occurred and whether local growth restrictions redistributed development to less regulated areas. Levine’s results support that growth control measures enacted between the years of 1979 and 1980 have resulted in a net housing reduction of 884 units, and 33 percent of new housing in California has been redistributed to less regulated areas. These results are also consistent with demographic and housing data from the 1980 and 1990 US Census. The growth control measures are found to be associated with a number of indicators of displacement including reductions in the availability of rental housing, increases in rents and home ownership values, increasing shares of higher-income households, and decreases in minority population. According to Levine, these trends demonstrate a need for greater housing considerations in local growth management plans.</p>

<p>Gentrification, segregation, and affordability are the primary focus of chapters 5, 6, and 7 of Nelson et al.’s <italic>The Social Impacts of Urban Containment</italic>. To explore claims of gentrification, the authors pose the question of whether land use practices in Portland, Oregon, have resulted in gentrification which is operationalized as the percent of units converting to owner-occupied status from 1990 to 2000. Using data from the US Census Bureau, tax assessment records, and GIS, binary logit regression is performed to predict the likelihood that a single-family residential unit will convert from rental to owner-occupied. Fourteen percent of Portland’s single-family rental housing converted to owner-occupied housing from 1990 to 2000 with such conversions most commonly occurring in neighborhoods with large houses, low incomes, and large minority populations. Nelson et al. further consider the impacts of urban containment and mandatory housing elements in shaping spatial patterns of racial segregation through an analysis of dissimilarity indexes. During the 1990s, the Portland metropolitan area exhibited an exceptionally high decrease in dissimilarity of 24.5 percent. Using 1985–2000 American Housing Survey, multiple regression models are also performed to analyze how urban containment relates to owner-occupied housing. Results demonstrate greater willingness of homeowners to pay for housing as the amount of time that growth management in their community has been enforced increases. In terms of rental housing, 1999 and 2003 National Housing Survey data are used to analyze the availability of affordable units for 1999. To explain whether these units, remained affordable, became unaffordable, became owner occupied, or were demolished between 1999 and 2003, multinomial logistic regression is performed. Findings suggest an association between urban containment and a lower probability of conversions of affordable rental units to other housing types, suggesting that urban containment may also enhance affordability through the preservation of rental housing.</p>

The authors state that clean and healthy environments should not be reserved for only selected members of a society and investigate ways that such a balance can be achieved. Through a review of literature, the authors list location efficient mortgages and community housing incentives as the examples that are somewhat inclusive of both sustainability and justice. The authors further point out that the majority of sustainability goals are absent of a true environmental justice component. However, there are examples successfully melding together these critical concepts, such as advocacy groups that promote energy efficiency and transit-oriented housing development. With a current absence of government policy in either of these realms, activism, cooperation, and community organizations may hold the potential steps of bringing the notions of sustainability and environmental justice to a more prominent status in US policy.</p>

<p>This article chronicles the history of inclusionary housing policies in the state of California, where localities have been required to adopt affordable housing elements in their general plans since the early 1970s. Early inclusionary housing policies were implemented alongside growth management polices, such as housing caps, to countervail negative impacts on affordability levels. However, the authors note that inclusionary housing policies have been interpreted differently by varying political administrations throughout the years. This study utilizes data from the early to mid 1990s, including a telephone survey, a mail survey, and personal interviews of San Diego city officials, to describe how inclusionary housing elements have been implemented. Inclusionary housing policies are primarily clustered around the state’s largest costal cities. The majority of these policies require 10–15 percent of housing units in a new development to be affordable for low or moderate income families, although some localities required as much as 50 percent of new units to be reserved for affordable housing. While many of the requirements mandate affordable units to be evenly dispersed and similar in appearance to market rate units, reductions in square footage and amenities have been permitted in these affordable units. In-lieu fees have also been offered to developers in many communities as an alternative to providing affordable housing and ranged from $600 to $36,000 per unit. While the authors commend these policies for helping to produce approximately 24,000 new affordable units over the two decades studied, they also note that the needs of the very low income have been overlooked in favor of moderate-income homebuyers and that greater quantities of affordable housing will have to be provided to keep up with California’s growing housing demands.</p>

<p>In this extensive literature review, Ihlanfelt studies the effects of land use regulation on housing costs, the nature of such costs, whether such policies discriminate against minorities, and whether they incur a spatial mismatch between jobs and housing. Through this review, Ihlanfeldt deduces that land use policies are found to increase the cost of housing. A review of spillover externality and construction studies demonstrates that these reductions are a result of supply restrictions rather than increased demand due to increased amenities. In terms of racial and socioeconomic exclusion, Ihlanfeldt’s review finds that white and more affluent neighborhoods tend to adopt more stringent exclusionary policies. However, urban growth boundaries are cited as a potential tool for reducing racial and economic barriers because they promote the infill of traditionally segregated neighborhoods. Ihlanfelt also investigates whether such regulations are motivated by a desire for exclusion and finds a consensus in the existing literature that instead fiscal considerations most frequently motivate land use regulations. While the significance of spatial mismatch factors is indeterminable, Ihlanfelt does find that restrictive land uses may diminish economic opportunity for low-income populations.</p>

<p>While zoning and other traditional land use restrictions have played a role in both racial and socioeconomic exclusion, Nelson et al. hypothesize that urban containment and affordable housing policies have aided in racial residential desegregation during the 1990s. This article explores the nationwide effects of these policies on racial segregation patterns from 1990 to 2000. To achieve this goal, segregation change is calculated using the index of dissimilarity, which measures what percentage of a racial group would have to move to a different census tract to achieve an even distribution across all census tracts. Data from a 2000 to 2002 mail and telephone survey of metropolitan housing organizations and statewide housing policy mandates are utilized to determine if an urban containment policy was present and if it was accompanied by housing elements. Data are analyzed through ordinary least squares regression, with socioeconomic, demographic, regional, and policy factors being controlled for. The effects of mandatory housing elements are not found statistically significant. However, the African American desegregation rates were 1.4 percent higher in municipalities with strong urban containment policy than those without such polices. When omitting for regional effects, this difference increased to 2.3 percent. The authors conclude that urban containment accelerates racial desegregation between Caucasians and African Americans.</p>

<p>In this California study, Nguyen probes the effectiveness of local, voter-determined, growth controls in slowing housing growth and whether such measures have exclusionary implications. California ballot measure data for the years 1986–1999, along with city-level housing and demographic data are used to construct eight multiple regression models that compare sociodemographic and housing changes in 84 cities that voted in local growth controls to 337 cities that did not enact such measures. The authors hypothesize that cities with ballot box growth controls will have slower rates of housing growth as well as slower rates of growth for multifamily housing, rental housing, and minority populations, but higher rates of median income growth. Results indicate that ballot box growth controls do significantly slow housing growth and are more likely to be adopted in cities with higher rates of wealth, homeownership, residential stability, and Caucasian populations. However, growth control measures were not demonstrated to significantly change the growth of multifamily units and to actually increase the number of rental units. In terms of demographics, ballot box measures are shown to have no effect on African American growth rates, but coincided with an increase in the Caucasian population and a reduction in Hispanic populations.</p>

Using data collected from a mail survey of 1,510 US local governments and census data for the years of 1980 and 1990, Pendall examines the exclusionary effects of low-density zoning, building permit caps, building permit moratoria, adequate infrastructure ordinances, urban growth boundaries, and the prohibition of annexation. Using independent samples <italic>T</italic>-tests and least squares regression, Pendall finds a strong connection between low-density zoning and the exclusion of African Americans and Hispanics. Residential building caps are also significantly correlated to lower levels of Hispanic residents. Furthermore, growth boundaries and moratoria are shown to be associated with low percentages of minority populations. According to Pendall, low-density zoning has exemplified the strongest and most historic connections to racially based housing exclusion.</p>

<p>Chapter seven of Porter’s comprehensive volume on American growth management focuses on the issues housing affordability and environmental equity. Housing affordability disparities are perpetuated by a number of economic and social trends, including the development of expensive bedroom communities as well as the job-population spatial mismatch. While sustainable development and smart growth advocates have expressed interest in addressing these imbalances and inequalities, Porter states that social and economic concerns have been largely underscored. Nongovernmental institutions have had to take a more important role in affordable housing provision, with the declines in units provided by the US department of Housing and Urban Development and the inability of the Community Development Block Grant program to provide long-term housing strategies. Furthermore, fair-share housing programs and other affordable housing requirements have not proven successful in a number of communities due to opposition from homeowners. To challenge these obstacles and to better accommodate both growth management and affordable housing, Porter recommends a number of strategies including inclusionary housing, housing trust funds, community land trusts, and the streamlining of local housing development regulations.</p>

<p>Ruddiman’s dissertation explores the relationship between racial exclusion and urban growth boundaries (UGB). Using forty-three matched pairs of municipalities with and without urban growth boundaries, Ruddiman draws comparisons of housing trends though consideration of changes in African American and Hispanic populations as well as changes in indexes of dissimilarity. Multivariate regression is also used to reveal the effect of growth boundaries on racial housing patterns. Data for the dissertation focus on the 1990–2000 time period and come from a number of sources including the US census, the Lewis Mumford Center, and prior research including Pendall’s 2002 study on racial exclusion. Ruddiman’s findings indicate that municipalities with UGBs have higher indexes of black–white racial dissimilarity than those without UGBs. Furthermore, UGBs are shown to increase these levels of dissimilarity between 1990 and 2000. However, differences in mean changes of dissimilarity between areas with and without UGBs between 1990 and 2000 are not found to differ significantly and levels of black-white racial dissimilarity appear to be converging. The presence of UGBs is demonstrated to have no effect on segregation between whites and Hispanics. Furthermore, UGBs are not shown to have any effect on the in-migration or out-migration of minorities in the municipalities included in this study. Therefore, Ruddiman presents her largely mixed findings as a challenge to both studies which advocate UGBs as a means of alleviating segregation as well as those which warn they may perpetuate it.</p>

</list> This article discusses the potential viability of the Fannie Mae Foundation’s location-efficient mortgage (LEM) pilot program of the late 1990s. This 100-million dollar program offered households in Chicago, Los Angeles, Portland, San Francisco, and Seattle the opportunity to borrow higher than normally permitted amounts of money and make lower than normally required down payments for the purchase of homes in communities offering free automobile access to jobs and other amenities. This easement in lending guidelines is justified by the notion that reductions in commuting costs will free up larger portions of household income to be spent on housing expenses. Blackman and Krupnick note that this policy is appealing because it offers incentives for those who chose to pursue more sustainable living standards. However, they question the implications of this lending strategy for mortgage default and use regression analysis to determine potential effects on the default rate. This test is based on data from 8,000 federally insured home loans that were issued in Chicago between 1988 and 1992 and matched with census household data on location efficiency as defined by proximity to job concentrations and other urban activities. Results indicated that no statistically significant relationship existed between the probability of mortgage default and location efficiency. These findings suggest that LEMs may increase mortgage default rates and therefore incur costs to the lender, making the LEM less appealing to mainstream secondary mortgage providers. However, Blackman and Krupnick conclude that these costs may be outweighed by the potential benefits of more sustainable development patterns.</p>

<p>Brueckner’s analysis of urban sprawl focuses on how the implementation of growth management tools, such as urban growth boundaries (UGBs) and impact fees, can affect development patterns and the housing market. Brueckner states that the true costs of sprawl are often not accurately accounted for by the land market, but also demonstrates that regulation can swing the pendulum too far in the opposite direction and cause land prices to exceed their true value. For example, UGBs can cause needless development restrictions and unnecessarily high housing price escalation as exemplified by claims of excessive housing prices in Portland, Oregon. Therefore, according to Brueckner, UGBs should be set with great caution and proper consideration of land market dynamics. Properly determined development taxes, congestion tolls, and impact fess are recommended as solutions that can place the most accurate and fair price on sprawl to its consumers.</p>

<p>Defunct location-efficient mortgage (LEM) and smart commute mortgage (SCM) programs allow home buyers to borrow larger than normal amounts for housing in areas with close proximity to public transit or with other “location efficient” characteristics. The programs contain the goals of increasing the share of households with access to public transportation, increasing housing supply in areas near transit systems and walkable neighborhoods, and increasing homeownership among low- and moderate- income households. Fannie Mae has ended these programs in 2006. The authors revaluated the program and discussed whether or not the program should be renewed. They pointed out that one problem of the program is that it overestimated potential costs of the program by not including certain neighborhood characteristics. Further, the authors noted that buyers receiving these mortgages were more susceptible to default than traditional homebuyers. Based on interview information with lenders and officials, the authors identified several reasons for the low number of originated loans under these programs, including (1) limited participation by large national lenders, (2) low demand for LEMs and SCMs, (3) availability of more competitive loan products, (4) real estate prices that exceeded Fannie Mae loan limits, (5) fear of unpredicted changes in employment patterns, and (6) passive transit agency involvement. The authors also examined 118 Fannie Mae loans and found that the actual amount of loans borrowers received were normally $27,717 less than they would have qualified for under conventional home loan terms. Borrowers with lower credit scores were found to have received an average interest rate that was 3 percent lower than what they would have qualified for. The transit-friendly communities in which LEM and SCM consumers purchased homes were also noted as having deficiencies in meeting their social goals of reducing sprawl and increasing low-income homeownership because buyers still preferred use automobile transit. Furthermore, increasing mortgage limits might drive up housing prices in areas with high demand. The authors suggested a more effective program by offering lower interest rate in lieu of higher loan approvals and revamping the program to provide information on the benefits of proximity to transit.</p>

<p>In this article, Gihring proposes land value taxation as a potentially viable alternative for achieving growth management goals. Such a system would essentially apply two property tax rates; one for structural value and another for land value. Thus, two-rate taxation would more accurately capture the development potential of land, rather than its underdeveloped value. According to Gihring, anticipated benefits include discouraging land banking, promoting urban infill, and discouraging sprawl, while at the same time restraining rising residential land prices and shifting property tax burdens away from homeowners. To test the viability of this proposed solution, Gihring considers the hypothetical fiscal effects of implementing two-rate taxation in Clark County, Washington, a quickly growing segment of the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. The results of this simulation reveal that a two-rate system would have the overall effect of lowering residential property taxes for all groups except for large lot properties with multifamily housing receiving the largest tax breaks. While tax burdens would be shifted to nonresidential properties, especially those with underutilized land uses, Gihring states that development patterns would likely experience little short-term change due to the relatively similar land values of urban and exurban properties in Clark County as well as the area’s strong land value appreciation trends. Future effectiveness is suggested to be contingent on the effective integration of land value taxation with effective regulatory mechanisms.</p>

According to the survey, 36 percent of its respondents plan to move, 22 percent are willing to move if offered an incentive, and the remaining will not move. Persons who are relatively young, economically disadvantaged, and interested in becoming homeowners are more willing to relocate. Other willing-to-move groups include affluent young, childless, or middle class Latino and Asian American households. Conversely, persons identified to be “empty-nesters” exemplified very low levels of willingness to relocate to redeveloped brownfield sites. Confidence in former brownfields to be clean, safe, and capable of maintaining property values is identified as an important factor in motivating people to relocate to former brownfield sites sites. Incentives for development of affordable housing in such sites are also identified as a strong policy concern.</p>

<p>Urban containment policies can assist in meeting smart growth goals, but also limit land supplies and raise housing prices. To investigate the dynamics of this phenomenon and to guide future research, a comparison between Portland, a city with urban containment, and Atlanta, a city without urban containment, is considered. In the early 1990s, while Atlanta experienced a 20 percent increase in housing prices, prices in Portland rose by 60 percent. However, the portion of household income contributed to housing remained the same for both cities. Homeownership and perceived quality of housing increased in Portland, but not in Atlanta. Remarking that affordability is a serious concern in practically all US cities regardless of growth management, smart growth, or urban containment policies, Nelson states that urban containment presents a new regime in planning that raises concerns about land speculation and housing affordability. Strategies for mitigating these affordability issues include location efficient mortgages and a property tax structure that penalizes owners for holding land for speculation.</p>

</list> Through reviewing the origins, costs, and benefits of smart growth, Burchell et al. provide an extensive discussion of smart growth within the context of past urban policy and new planning frontiers. In terms of housing, they state that increasing populations of empty-nesters, young professionals, and immigrants provide a strong demand for the types of housing patterns promoted through smart growth principles. Furthermore, current housing policies that encourage the mobility of low-income minority populations may also provide an outlet for central city housing stocks to be freed up for revitalization. Therefore, planning mechanisms such as urban infill and redevelopment, as well as the development of more environmentally efficient suburbs, provide a prime opportunity to offer all socioeconomic groups greater housing choices. Burchell et al. also consider the potential fiscal savings of smart growth development patterns and discuss the findings of smart growth studies conducted by Rutgers University in the 1990s. According to this review, the United States could potentially save up to 250 billion dollars in twenty-five years if smart growth principles were applied to mainstream development practices. Therefore, not only would a more diverse housing stock be achieved, but a projected savings of $5,790 per unit of housing may also be realized.</p>

<p>In the article, the authors focus on the relation between zoning constraint and multi-family house constructions in six metropolitan areas over 1990–2000. These six metropolitan areas are Portland (OR), Boston (MA), Miami-Dade County (FL), Minneapolis-St Paul (MN), Sacramento (CA), and Washington, DC. In order to eliminate the endogeneity due to the interaction between zoning and housing constructions, a two-stage least square method was used. Level of zoning constraint in jurisdictions across the six metropolitans was first evaluated based on 1960 demographic and economic information, and an instrumental variable for zoning was created. This zoning instrument was then utilized as an explanatory variable for change of multifamily housing units in each jurisdiction. The research has some interesting observations. High-density development is less likely to occur in a zoning for white neighborhoods that are father away for the central business area. Areas zoned as high-density uses tend to have greater increase of multifamily units.</p>

<p>This article provides an analytic review of connections between housing and smart growth. The authors ascertain that successful smart growth policies should not only limit and restrict certain growth but also include opportunities for new development. This article particularly focuses on the way American consumers of housing view density. Changing demographics, especially increases in single and childless households, suggest impending need for more diverse housing types that can be achieved through higher density residential landscapes. Market research studies from the late 1990s show that preconceived negative notions about high-density development are an obstacle for higher density developments. To overcome such challenges, the authors propose measures to make higher density housing more attractive, such as considerations for parking, security, and privacy, as well as constructing high density homes with the same levels of amenities and qualities as traditional suburban homes. Smart growth friendly financing alternatives for both developers and consumers are also identified as ways to make higher density development more attractive.</p>

<p>In their assessment of smart growth implementation within Wisconsin’s local comprehensive plans, Edwards and Haines concentrate on six overarching goals of smart growth planning including community development, natural resource preservation, transportation choice, economic development, planning, and housing. Housing issues are thus considerably evaluated in this study. In their analysis, the authors find that 73 percent of Wisconsin comprehensive plans comprehensively addressed housing and 23 percent narrowly addressed housing, primarily focusing on enhancing variety, proximity to work and shopping, accommodation for the elderly, and affordability. However, findings also suggested that comprehensive plans did not address variety with wide enough of a scope, and few considered inclusionary zoning as a means of reaching its housing goals. </p>

<p>While sustainability, as well as its concerns for economy, environment, and equity, has been a popular concept in recent planning literature, a void is often found between it and actual planning practices. Jepson addresses this void and considers how the traditional “expansionist” view has prevailed over sustainability as the dominant ideology in land use and then offers insights to assist planners interested in promoting more sustainable planning solutions. While the expansionist view is accommodating to the human tendency to manipulate and exploit nature, Jepson states that this neoclassical economic view does not always accurately account for the true costs and benefits of certain land use decisions. Through modifying this ideology and through revising the notion of discounting and other economic views, environmental sustainability can be integrated into mainstream paradigms. To advance to this goal, Jepson provides recommendations including encouraging planners to reflect on their own values and preferences in order to become better facilitators of sustainability and make a long-term dedication to educating other on the benefits of sustainability. </p>

<p>Stating that housing market constraints are highly related to changing land use regulation patterns, Glaeser et al. consider the welfare impacts of such regulations as they pertain to housing costs. Through an economic location model, the authors state that a certain optimal level of development for a town’s current residents may not be the optimal in the future. These existing homeowners have a strong incentive to increase their housing values, but such increases have an adverse effect for those not owning homes. Residential preferences are also considered in terms of how they interact with the decisions of zoning authorities and developers. Demonstrated through another economic model which represents how the zoning authority is influenced by development interests, with developers tending to lobby with the resource of cash, and homeowners with the resource of time. This model is further used to explain how the changing preferences of decision makers may be attributable to the increasing influence of a growing number of homeowners and how this influence may have contributed to greater levels of regulation and subsequently higher housing prices.</p>

<p>Exploring linkages between land-use planning and affordable housing in England, Whitehead poses the questions of how planning policy is aligned with affordable housing goals, what have been the successes of this system, and how the English system may serve as a lesson to other nations. While Whitehead acknowledges that virtually all types of land use regulation will increase housing prices, she justifies a relationship between planning and affordability through arguments that government should serve as an equitable distributor of resources and increased property values resulting from regulation can be translated into opportunities to fund affordable housing. Throughout the twentieth century, England’s system has evolved from one that largely involved localized control of social housing that was separate from national land-use goals to a more integrated system that has grown to include requirements for the proportional development of affordable housing (housing elements). Whitehead acknowledges that the program has successfully increased the number of affordable housing units, directing efforts to the locations where they are most needed, with a shift to more diverse patterns of affordable housing tenure. However, affordable housing issues such as decreases in publicly provided housing are noted as problematic areas. Whitehead points out that land-use planning alone is not likely to be an adequate provider of affordable housing. According to him, this system vests the central government with strong powers over land-use decisions in comparison with other countries which have granted greater property rights to the private market. However, growing desires to shift affordable housing provision to the private sector demonstrate strong links between planning in England and other countries, such as the United States.</p>

<p>This article focuses on the Melbourne 2030 strategic plan that intends to make Melbourne a more compact city with a growth boundary. Within the city there will be twenty-five Principal Activity Centers (PAC) that will act as multi-use, transit-oriented hubs. There is great concern in the government that low-income individuals and families will not be able to live in or around these centers and this will lead to a lack good community mix. In order to evaluate whether this is going to happen, Wood et al. studied spatial trends of affordable housing in the Melbourne region over 1990–2003. They suggested that affordability policies of the 2030 strategic plan may only have limited impacts on a few people to live in or around PACs. Market reliance is not helping low-income people find affordable housing. More government involvement in the form of stronger planning measures may be required to keep a healthy community mix around PACs.</p>

</list> Aurand’s dissertation considers neighborhood density, housing variety, mixed land use, and public open space as four primary principles of smart growth and considers their implications on affordable housing supplies. He studies various growth management policies of Portland, Baltimore, Seattle, and Philadelphia. Using US Census and a range of other national data, separate regression analyses for the years of 1990 and 2000 are integrated into Aurand’s quasi-experimental research design. Weak evidence suggests that urban containment policies may reduce the availability of open space for low-income multifamily housing structures. Density is found to be moderately associated with more affordable housing for low-income populations, and the supply of multifamily housing is found to have a strong positive relationship with affordable housing. Aurnand concludes that this evidence supports a call for smart growth policies to address multifamily housing supply issues because higher densities alone will not foster affordable housing options. He also recommends that state, regional, and local policies should be implemented to address affordability through tools, such as density bonuses, inclusionary zoning, housing trust funds, and zoning code easements.</p>

<p>Noting the potential of smart growth to increase land and housing prices, Bogdon presents this chapter as an argument for localities to monitor the affects of such policies on affordability and provides an analysis of the methodological issues involved with making such evaluations. According to Bogdon, the primary reason for monitoring affordability is to ensure that that the benefits of smart growth may outweigh its costs, and that such costs are equitably distributed in a way that does not unfairly burden low-income households. Housing affordability is commonly established by a 30 percent of income threshold for consuming housing services. However, this measure is critiqued on the grounds that different income groups will be able to devote varying percentages of income to housing. The issue is further complicated by the issue of homeownership due to the fact that homeownership costs represent both the consumption of housing and an investment in real estate. Classification of income groups, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) fair market rents, and shelter poverty standards, which measure the amount of income available for housing minus the costs of all other goods and services necessary to sustain an adequate standard of living, are suggested as alternatives as well as measures that may be combined with housing percentage measures. Bogdon also suggests a number of data sources for conducting affordability evaluations, including decennial census data, the American Community Survey, and American housing surveys as well as locally collected primary and administrative data.</p>

<p>Recognizing that much growth management, smart growth, and urban containment research focuses on states with such policies, Boyle and Mohamed present this case study of Michigan to exemplify how growth management has failed in a state which has not enacted statewide mandates. The authors find that while county and local efforts have been made, an absence of strong and consistent measures has prevented smart growth goals, such as urban containment and affordable housing, to be achieved. Statewide incentive programs, such as the Cool Cities and Brownfields Redevelopment initiatives, have been used to promote smart growth goals in Michigan. However, these programs are fragmented and have had questionable impacts on neighborhoods and regions. According to Boyle and Mohamed, these shortcomings are likely to be present in other states and will not likely be overcome without comprehensive state mandates that focus on regional planning initiatives.</p>

The authors conducted a study involving email and phone interviews, and case studies of five local planning authorities. The authors found that the amount of affordable housing being delivered through S106 has been increasing. It is difficult to discern how they come to this conclusion because they offer no real empirical data to back up this claim. The evidence they presented seems to be heavily anecdotal.

<p>Robert and Popowitz interpreted sustainability as an umbrella term covering four areas: smart growth, new urbanism, renewable energy, and green development. They thought that the growth management in California has all the four elements. What makes the article valuable is the review about the legal efforts for promoting smart growth. After the 1972 Golden v. Planning Board of the Town of Ramapo case, growth management gained its constitutionality, and began to gain it popularity. In California, management efforts can be traced back to the 1970s, primarily focusing on management of environmental impacts. After 2000, a series of legislative activities are observed to provide legal supports for smart growth. In 2002, in addition to the State Planning Law, the Assembly Bill 857 was adopted to create development priority areas to guide state infrastructure investment and other expenditures, and therefore, to improve land-use efficiency. The Global Warming Solutions of 2006 provided stricter regulation on gas emissions. Finally, the Senate Bill 375 (i.e., the Sustainable Communities Strategy Act) was adopted in 2008, which gave the state government direct authority over local and regional land-use decisions.</p>

According to Kiel, although few of these laws are directed at the housing market, they have the potential to both directly and indirectly increase the costs of housing. While the author states that regulation has been demonstrated to increase the cost of housing, she also makes a number of methodological and theoretical critiques. Kiel notes that the regression methods commonly used to identify such impacts are often deficient in their consideration of labor market effects as well as the constantly changing dynamics of the housing market. Furthermore, Kiel states that little has been done to identify whether the nature of price increases are supply or demand based. To better weigh the consequences of environmental policy, Kiel calls for a cost–benefit analysis approach to determine appropriate balances between environmental regulation and affordable housing.</p>

<p>This article describes the Washington State Growth Management Act (GMA) and its subsequent implications. While the GMA includes a provision of “fair share” affordable housing, its housing goals are ill-defined. Although the GMA places undeniable importance on affordable housing, it is inefficient and ineffective because of structural problems, including parochialism and governmental fragmentation that does not allow housing to be addressed on a regional basis. McGee also notes that legislative efforts to cope with this issue have been met with opposition by both economic interests and local governmental concerns for maintaining autonomy. Stating that smart growth legislation in many regards is ill-suited to address affordability issues, McGee advocates for more comprehensive policies that integrate the issues of housing stock conditions, employment, education security, and social services, as well as regional polices with stronger provisions for inclusionary zoning, incentive zoning, density bonuses, and regional emphasis of local zoning decisions.</p>

<p>This article is based on a survey of fifty-four developers (who promote walkable neighborhood) across the United States (with 63 percent response rate) and reports developers’ view about affordability. The survey reveals that smaller residential units and better floor design are the two most practical approaches to promote affordability, and tax credits and density bonuses are the financial tools. Most of these developers point out that the existing land-use regulatory system and the financial regulations pose barriers to promoting affordability. Local land-use regulations “discriminate in housing form,” and it is difficult to get mixed-use and mixed-income development financed. Based on all these, Talen concludes that it is necessary to reform the existing financing and land-use control systems. Agencies and institutions in the public and private sectors should all be involved to create better communications, and possibly to create partnership and to issue a “model affordability code.”</p>
