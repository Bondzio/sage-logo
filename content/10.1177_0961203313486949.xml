<sec id="sec23-0961203313486949"><title>Background</title>
<p>Plasma mycophenolic acid (MPA) concentrations may predict therapeutic response in active lupus nephritis (LN). We determined the efficacy and safety of a concentration-controlled MPA regime in the treatment of severely active LN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0961203313486949"><title>Methods</title>
<p>In this prospective study, 19 biopsy-proven class III/IV LN patients were treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for 48 weeks. The MMF dosage was based on maximal plasma MPA concentration at 1-hour post dose (MPA-C1). All patients had plasma MPA-C1 levels monitored weekly until achieving the targeted level of &gt;13 mg/L. A low-dose steroid protocol was started at 0.5 mg/kg/day and rapidly tapered to 5 mg/day. Therapeutic response was evaluated at week 24 and week 48. MPA area-under-the curve (MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub>) was measured at week 12 to verify the optimum dosage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec25-0961203313486949"><title>Results</title>
<p>No death or end-stage kidney disease occurred in this study. Seventeen patients (89%) responded to therapy at week 24 with four (21%) patients having complete response. There was no renal relapse at week 48 and four more patients had converted from partial response to complete response. Seventy eight percent of patients achieved the recommended MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> level. No association between plasma MPA concentrations and adverse reactions or infections was found.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec26-0961203313486949"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>MPA-C1 may be a practical monitoring of MPA levels in patients with LN. It is convenient to monitor and may facilitate an optimum estimate of MPA exposure.</p>

<p>Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has become a mainstay for induction therapy of severe lupus nephritis (LN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313486949">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486949">3</xref></sup> with a recommended dosage of 1–3 g/day. However, a large multi-center trial has shown inconsistent therapeutic responses among different ethnic groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486949">3</xref></sup> This suggests that there may be no single set dose recommendation for the treatment of patients with LN.</p>
<p>Therapeutic drug monitoring of MMF has been extensively studied in kidney transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313486949">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313486949">5</xref></sup> It has been shown in randomized-controlled trials that adequate exposure to mycophenolic acid (MPA), an active metabolite of MMF, significantly reduces graft rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313486949">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313486949">7</xref></sup> Subsequent studies involving pharmacokinetics of MMF in patients with autoimmune disease have highlighted the inter-individual variability of MPA levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313486949">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486949"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486949"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486949">12</xref></sup> MPA exposure also correlated with disease activity of SLE and immunologic parameters such as complement component 3 (C3).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313486949">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313486949"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313486949"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313486949">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to our previous study, the area under the curve of MPA from 0–12 hours (MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub>) &gt;45 mg.h/L was associated with good therapeutic response in patients with active LN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949">11</xref></sup> MPA plasma concentration at 1 hour after taking MMF (MPA-C1) was found to be the best predictor of MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949">11</xref></sup> with the MPA-C1 of &gt;13 mg/L highly correlated with the targeted MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> of &gt;45 mg.h/L. Hence, we decided to further explore the efficacy and safety of MPA concentration-controlled therapy based on MPA-C1 level &gt;13 mg/L in the treatment of patients with severely active LN.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313486949"><title>Study design</title>
<p>This was a prospective, open-labeled study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01042457). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Human Research, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203313486949" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>We recruited Thai patients, aged 16–60 years, diagnosed with SLE whose renal biopsies classified as proliferative LN class III or IV (A or A/C), with or without co-existing class V, and who had a 24-hour urine protein of &gt;1 g/day. We excluded patients with severe renal impairment (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease – Glomerular Filtration Rate (MDRD-GFR) equation of &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), severe extra-renal involvement of SLE, active infection, uncontrolled concomitant disease, pregnancy and breast feeding. Patients who were treated with prednisolone of &gt;0.5 mg/kg/day for more than 4 weeks prior to screening and those who were treated with cyclophosphamide of &gt;1 g or mycophenolate of any dose within the last 12 weeks prior to screening were excluded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203313486949"><title>Treatment regimen</title>
<p>Patients were started with a treatment of 1.5 g/day of MMF, equally divided into twice daily doses. However, the starting dose of MMF were reduced to 1 g/day (0.5 g every 12 hours) in those with MDRD-GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Following the first administration of MMF, MPA-C1 after the morning dose was monitored weekly and the dose of MMF was increased by 500 mg/day until MPA-C1 levels were &gt;13 mg/L. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949">11</xref></sup> After that, MPA-C1 levels were monitored every 4 weeks to the completion of a 24-week induction period. We noted that after achieving the targeted MPA-C1 level of &gt;13 mg/L, the MMF dose adjustment was allowed only if the MPA-C1 levels were lower than 13 mg/L for two consecutive monitoring visits. Patients were given with the same dose of MMF from week 24 to week 48. MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> was measured at week 12 of treatment. The participants’ adherence with MMF therapy was confirmed by pill-count on every clinic visits.</p>
<p>Oral prednisolone was initiated at 0.5 mg/kg/day and reduced by 5 mg/day every 2 weeks for two times then every 4 weeks until the dosage of 5 mg/day was reached. A short course of moderate steroid was allowed for participants with moderate to severe extrarenal manifestations of SLE. Any medications that interfere with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were maintained at the same dose throughout the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313486949"><title>Laboratory monitoring</title>
<p>All participants had complete blood count, serum creatinine, serum albumin, serum complement levels (C3), urinalysis, urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) and 24 hour urine protein monitored at screening and every 4 weeks from the beginning of MMF to week 24. Then they had these laboratory studies monitored every 12 weeks from week 24 to week 48.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203313486949"><title>Early withdrawal</title>
<p>Participants were withdrawn from the study if they meet any of the following conditions: (1) had &gt;50% reduction of MDRD-GFR from baseline or doubling of urinary protein levels from baseline, (2) had severe gastrointestinal side effects, (3) had bone marrow suppression from MPA evidenced by WBC &lt;2,000 cells/µL, or platelets &lt;50,000 cells/µL, or hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL, or (4) had developed a life-threatening infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203313486949"><title>MPA concentration measurement</title>
<p>The participants were witnessed taking MMF and a blood sample was collected at 1 hour post-dose. For the measurement of MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> on week 12, blood samples were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 hours post-dose. MPA-AUC<sub>0-12h</sub> was then calculated using the trapezoidal rule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949">11</xref></sup> MPA plasma concentration was measured using an enzymatic method (Roche Total MPA Assay, Hoffmann–La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), which has been shown to give a reliable plasma MPA concentration when compared to the standard assay with LC-MS/MS but is less time-consuming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313486949">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203313486949"><title>Outcome measurements</title>
<p>The primary outcome of this study was the therapeutic response at week 24 (end of the induction phase). A complete response was defined as normal or ≤25% decline of MDRD-GFR from baseline and a Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio (UPCR) of &lt;0.2 and inactive urinary sediment (urine white blood cells and red blood cells ≤5 cells per high-power-field). A partial response was defined as normal or ≤25% decline of MDRD-GFR from baseline and at least 50% reduction of proteinuria, with a level ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 g/day. The participants who did not meet the above criteria were reported as non-responders.</p>
<p>The secondary outcomes were the therapeutic response at week 48, a percentage of targeted MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> achievement and MPA level-related side effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961203313486949"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All data were collected in case record forms and electronic database. Statistical analysis was carried out with GraphPad Prism version 5 (Graphpad Software Inc, CA, USA). Continuous data was shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD).</p>

<p>Between May 2009 to July 2011, 24 patients with SLE suspected for active LN were screened. Five of them were excluded due to unwillingness to undergo kidney biopsy, pure ISN/RPS class V, MDRD-GFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and mild proteinuria, yielding a total of 19 patients who were entered into the MMF treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313486949">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec13-0961203313486949"><title>Outcomes of treatment</title>
<p>At week 24, seventeen patients (89%) responded to the treatment. Of the responders, four (21%) and 13 (68%) patients had complete and partial response, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313486949">Figure 1</xref>). The time to reach complete response was 15 ± 7.6 weeks and for partial response it was 10.8 ± 7.6 weeks.
<fig id="fig1-0961203313486949" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Therapeutic response of MMF at weeks 24 and 48.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0961203313486949-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>For the two cases of treatment failure during the 24-week induction phase, one patient had doubling of serum creatinine from baseline and was withdrawn from the study at week 2 before reaching the optimum level of MPA-C1 (MPA-C1 = 10.23 mg/L). The other patient failed to meet response criteria (urine protein &gt;2 g/day). The repeat kidney biopsy found the pathological conversion of this patient from ISN/RPS class IV to pure membranous LN.</p>
<p>At week 48 with the total remaining 17 patients (responders from week 24), all of them had accomplished a 48-week treatment period without any relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203313486949">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, the number of patients with complete response increased from four patients in week 24 to eight patients in week 48 (47% of 17 responders).</p>
<p>We had included three cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and biopsy-proven crescentic glomeruli. After receiving 1.5–2 g of intravenous methyl-prednisolone, they had stabilized renal function upon entering the study. All of them had been successfully treated with an improvement in average GFR (from 39.4 to 57.7 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0961203313486949"><title>Targeted MPA-C1 concentrations and MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> achievements</title>
<p>Targeted MPA-C1 was achieved within the second month of treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0961203313486949">Table 2</xref>). The average MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> level was 66.4 (25.3) mg.h/L. Fourteen of 18 (78%) patients (not including one patient who prematurely discontinued MMF) achieved the targeted MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> level of 45 mg.h/L. Among the patients whose MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> did not reach the targeted level, three of them had consistently achieved on adequate MPA-C1 level and their MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> levels were closed to 45 mg.h/L (37.47, 41.15, and 43.15 mg.h/L). One patient had a reduction of MMF dose due to herpes infection. Hence, this patient intentionally had low levels of both average MPA-C1 (10.48 mg/L) and MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> (21.48 mg.h/L).

<p>There was no death or end-stage kidney failure observed during the study. One patient had discontinued MMF due to doubling of serum creatinine at the second week of study. Infection developed in four patients (herpes zoster (MPA-C1 = 18.07 mg/L), urinary tract infection (MPA-C1 = 11.84 mg/L), acute bronchitis (MPA-C1 = 16.27 mg/L), generalized tinea versicolor (MPA-C1 = 14.83 mg/L) and oral candidiasis (MPA-C1 = 9.53 mg/L). The patient who developed herpes zoster had their MMF dosage reduced from 1.5 g/day to 1 g/day and remained at 1 g/day throughout the study. The maximum level of MPA-C1 was 34.14 mg/L and the maximum level of MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> was 109.37 mg.h/L. No association between MPA-C1 and infection was observed. Two patients experienced a short period of diarrhea after increasing the dose of MMF to 2.5 g/day (MPA-C1 = 21.01 and 17.39 mg/L) and this was resolved spontaneously without any dose adjustment. No hematologic side effect was observed.</p>

<p>It has been reported that the response rate of LN treatment ranges between 56 and 95%, influenced by genetic variations, severity of disease, dosing regimen, response criteria and possibly MPA exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313486949">15</xref></sup> By monitoring MPA-C1 level, 89% of our subjects reached response criteria and more patients converted to complete response after continuing MMF at the same dosage for a further 6 months.</p>
<p>For the two non-responders, one converted to non-proliferative LN that had a more favorable prognosis. The other one had severe baseline renal histopathology (Activity index of 15, with crescent formation and proteinuria of 7.28 g/day) and had rapid decline of renal function before reaching the targeted MPA-C1 level. Treatment failure was probably caused by resistance to MMF therapy, or a higher starting dose of MMF for earlier achievement of targeted MPA-C1 is needed in some patients with very severe renal histopathology.</p>
<p>In this study, a quarter of the patients did not reach targeted MPA-C1 with 2 g/day of MMF; therefore a fixed-dose of 2 g per day may not apply to every patient. However, it seems that 3 g per day of MMF increased death in the Asian population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486949">3</xref></sup> This study suggested that measurement of MPA exposure may be important for enhancing efficacy with least toxicity. Although patients with severe impairment of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) had not been included in this study, they may benefit from this treatment approach, given that they tend to have a higher average MPA AUC compared to the normal population.</p>
<p>Compared to our previous study of 12 patients with LN with fixed-dose of MMF, the percentage of MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> achievement in the current study was higher (58% versus 78%, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313486949">11</xref></sup> Moreover, the patients who did not achieve MPA-AUC but have had consistently achieved MPA-C1 still had MPA-AUC close to the target. This emphasizes the usefulness of MPA-C1 monitoring in MMF treatment as a practical tool for therapeutic guidance. Although, limited sampling strategy could be more accurate, it is cumbersome and impractical in the routine care.</p>
<p>Since the dosage of steroids in this study was lower than usual (0.5 mg/kg/day versus 0.8–1 mg/kg/day),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313486949">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313486949"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313486949">3</xref></sup> our approach may have a beneficial steroid-sparing effect. In addition, selected cases of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) might also benefit from this treatment regime as we observed a favorable response in RPGN patients whose renal function stabilized afterwards.</p>
<p>With regards to adverse effects, no serious infections were observed. No association between MPA-C1 level and the side effects were found.</p>
<p>There are limitations to this study. The sample size of this study was relatively small and there were no fixed-dose matched controls to compare for the true efficacy of MPA-C1 monitoring. Nevertheless, the aim of this study was to be a pilot study to elucidate the potential of MPA concentration-controlled therapy, which so far appears promising.</p>
<p>In conclusion, MPA-C1 is a potential tool to monitor MPA exposure in patients with LN as shown by an increase in the rate of a targeted MPA-AUC<sub>0–12h</sub> achievement compared with our prior study and appears to provide an excellent therapeutic response. Measuring MPA-C1 is also convenient and easy to apply in clinic. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm the role of MPA-C1 monitoring in clinical practice.</p>
