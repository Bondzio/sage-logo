<p>Today, psychiatric nurses in the United States live and practice in the postmillennial digital age where technology is almost everywhere, pervasive, and mobile. Yet despite this technological abundance, according to economist Aleph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078390313481999">Molinari (2012)</xref>, nearly five billion or approximately 70% of the current world population still does not have access to computers or the Internet—that is, almost four times the entire current population of India. Whereas only 30% of the world’s population is “digitally included,” Molinari contended that the rest are stuck in the “digital abyss.” Given these astounding global digital disparities, we—U.S. psychiatric nurses—are indeed privileged and uniquely experiencing and enjoying a technological boon that presents us with a historic opportunity and the power to transform both our personal and professional lives. But how many of us have truly taken advantage of the ongoing technological revolution and have acculturated to this evolving digital culture? According to the most recent research conducted by the Pew Internet Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078390313481999">Zickuhr &amp; Smith, 2012</xref>), despite the changing digital landscape and the continued rise of digital connectivity, one in five American adults still does not use the Internet because they are simply disinterested, and almost half (48%) of these adult nonusers felt that the Internet is not relevant or helpful to them. Since there is no current research conducted on the digital behaviors of practicing U.S. psychiatric nurses, this could give us some insights for now—albeit admittedly, it is an obvious overgeneralization or perhaps a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Marc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078390313481999">Prensky (2001)</xref> coined the terms <italic>digital natives</italic> and <italic>digital immigrants</italic> to describe the differences between those individuals who were born and grew up speaking the language of computers, the Internet, and video games and those who were not born in the digital world but at some point in their lives have acquiesced or have adopted to the emerging postmillennial digital culture. Though Prensky’s classic concepts were originally applied in the educational literature to describe the technological gaps between the millennial students and their teachers, it was helpful in understanding digital gaps and differences across generations and groups in every segment of our society. Building on this popular technogenerational paradigm, Brooks-Young described a technology-user under the age of 30 and born in the digital world as a <italic>native</italic> and those over the age of 30 and who was not born in the digital world as an <italic>immigrant</italic> (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078390313481999">Toledo, 2007</xref>). In this Information Age, Prensky’s <italic>digital native–digital immigrant</italic> concept has also been widely credited by many in the field of informatics as a starting point for gaining useful insights on the generational gaps and, at times, conflicts and tensions that occur as each of this group relates to and interacts with various forms of digital technologies in their lives. In a recent CNN article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078390313481999">Joy (2012)</xref> asserted that the digital natives are undoubtedly becoming the world’s most dominant demographic, and they have taken hold of the so-called generational switchover where an individual is defined by the technology that he or she is familiar with or accustomed to. Joy declared that the tacit technogenerational culture war has ended and the natives have won and the immigrants have settled as vestiges from the old world.</p>
<p>Whether you subscribe to or reject Prensky’s digital native–digital immigrant metaphor, it is arguably a helpful framework to use as we attempt to discern our own individual differences as psychiatric nurses when it comes to technology adoption, immersion, and aversion. For instance, if we think about our individual work settings, it can help us develop or frame our understanding of our own attitudes and that of our professional colleagues toward technology. In our current work environments today, such as in inpatient psychiatric settings, we may also witness and experience varying levels of technology-adoption behaviors and differences in our psychiatric nursing colleagues’ attitudes toward various forms of health information technologies (HIT) such as the electronic health record and mobile technologies. Nursing informatics’ leaders and experts have long recognized the implications of the digital native–immigrant dichotomy across the nursing workforce, and their flagrant competency gaps were addressed in the strategic action plans of the Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078390313481999">TIGER Initiative, 2009</xref>) Initiative—a professional nursing collaborative that aims to prepare and engage every nursing student and practicing nurse in the digital era that is unfolding in U.S. health care. The TIGER Initiative acknowledges that there are a number of nursing digital immigrants who still lack basic computer competencies, including information literacy skills and the ability to use HIT effectively to improve or enhance their nursing practice. With the continued growth of <italic>consumer health informatics</italic>—where individuals are becoming more active participants in their own health care decision-making process—knowing which of the individuals or persons we serve and provide care for are natives and which of them are immigrants allows us to help facilitate or encourage their effective use of technology. This individualized understanding can also help us choose, coordinate, or deliver mental health care that is technologically congruent with the person’s unique needs and comfort level when it comes to technology use. In other words, knowing if someone is a digital native or digital immigrant allows us to effectively interact with that individual, which in turn allows for a process that promotes person-centered care and fosters therapeutic alliance through improved connectedness in-person and through the use of technology.</p>
<p>The majority of today’s practicing psychiatric nurses are digital immigrants, and our younger psychiatric nurse colleagues and future psychiatric nurses (nursing students) are digital natives. As these generations continue to cross paths, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078390313481999">Prensky (2009)</xref> posited that “digital wisdom” can transcend the digital divide between them and many digital immigrants can become digitally wise and exhibit digital wisdom. Just like U.S. President Barack Obama, a famous digital immigrant, is well known for being a die-hard Blackberry-user and for masterfully using the Internet and various forms of social media to connect with the young generation of voters (digital natives) during the 2008 U.S. presidential elections campaign. As an alternative, a much broader concept of the “digital melting pot” was conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078390313481999">Stoerger (2009)</xref> as a metaphor of the bridge that connects the divide between the natives and the immigrants. While digital wisdom allows for the immigrant to travel and reside in the native’s technological world and they become eventually digitally wise, the former remains disconnected and segregated. Stoerger argued that with the digital melting pot concept, the immigrants become technologically savvy and are assimilated and acculturated in the native’s digital culture and common life. In essence, they become “naturalized citizens” of the native’s digital culture.</p>
<p>It is a fact that there is no going back in time and more digital natives will soon become part of tomorrow. With the continued rise of digital culture in our society and as it further makes its way to psychiatric-mental health nursing (PMHN), we are presented with an exciting opportunity to welcome the arrival of (more) digital natives—our younger generation and future psychiatric nurses—because they bring with them an innate richness in technological savvy that can only enhance our professional diversity in PMHN. With our knowledge and wisdom as digital immigrants and, more important, as seasoned psychiatric nurses we can partner with the digital natives toward a dynamic professional future that is far beyond just our use of technology. After all, according to futurist William <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078390313481999">Gibson (n.d.)</xref>, “The future is already here—it is just unevenly distributed.”</p>
