<p>Charles Post’s book <italic>The American Road to Capitalism</italic> rigorously traces the origins and protracted development of capitalism in the USA. Based on insights derived from political Marxism, Post provides a powerful critique of the existing historical narratives of the American Revolution and the Civil War, offering a novel ‘social history’ of the US path to state formation and capitalist development.</p>
<p>According to Post, the British expansion into Northern America, the first geographical fix to British capitalism, did not automatically lead to the spread of capitalist property-relations. In the North, the colonial state institutions violently removed Native Americans from their land, and yet they never became strong enough to fully enforce the private claims to landed property – i.e. the majority of European settlers ‘squatted’ on land, with no legal title or payment. In the South, although large chunks of land were seized by plantation farmers, plantations never operated as capitalist farms. The indigenous people, the potential source of labour-power, were either too vulnerable to European diseases or simply fled plantations thanks to their knowledge of the country. The resulting scarcity of labour led to the dominance of slave-labour in the Southern states.</p>
<p>The overall outcome was the establishment of two different ‘non-capitalist’ paths to economic development in British North-American colonies: the ‘independent household production’ in the North, and ‘plantation-slavery’ in the South. Given the weakness of the political apparatus, the northern farmers had easy access to land, which enabled them to maintain self-sufficiency. Likewise, despite intensively producing for the world market, the logic of plantation slavery ‘severely limited the ability of the masters to regulate the size of the labour force, burdening the non-producers with inflexible costs of reproducing their direct producers, slaves’. The implication is that despite being integrated into the capitalist world market, neither forms of social labour were subjected to competitive reproduction in the market place. They were not ‘compelled’ to fully engage in commodity production, hence the relative lack of social division of labour and technological dynamism in the antebellum period.</p>
<p>Against this non-capitalist social background rose a class of merchants who connected independent household production to plantation slavery in the rapidly integrating North American economy. Backed by a coalition of slaveholding planters, independent farmers and land speculators, the merchant class led the American Revolution that ended colonial rule. The American Revolution, however, did not bring about a sudden rupture in the socioeconomic organisation of the Northern American colonies. The years of revolutionary war had resulted in massive increases in public debt, which forced the merchants and land-speculators in the post-revolutionary period to build new state institutions that could impose taxes, collect debts and enforce legal claims to land. The political constitution of a land-market was also a pre-condition to the re-opening and deepening of commercial credit channels in the Atlantic economy. Through the 1780s, Northern independent farmers and Southern slave-owning planters struggled against the central state in order to retain their autonomy and to curtail the state’s capacity to levy taxes. But to no avail. After a series of armed confrontations throughout the 1780s and 1790s, the independent farmers were defeated by the new standing army of the central state.</p>
<p>The ‘unintended’ consequence of closing off access to free or inexpensive land, imposition of heavy taxes and enforcement of debt payment was the gradual subordination of Northern farmers to market competition. That is, they were no longer able to reproduce themselves through their easy access to the means of subsistence or through political mobilisation. Instead, they were compelled to compete in the market for their survival, which forced them to re-organize their relation to land and society. With their political power curtailed, the Northern farmers attempted to retain their access to land by increasing the time and the labour devoted to the production of commodities. This brought in its train increasing specialisation, innovation and concentration of land, and the emergence of a massive home market for industrial goods, which laid the foundations of the US industrial revolution of the 19th century. The subordination of Northern farmers to the imperatives of capitalist accumulation, nevertheless, was not matched by the disappearance of slavery in the South. The Southern plantation owners successfully shifted from tobacco to cotton production (the much-in-demand raw material for capitalist industry in Britain), and were thereby able to meet the tax demands of the centralising state. Consequently, the non-capitalist relations of plantation slavery remained in place, which blocked the deepening of the social division of labour and industrial development in the South.</p>
<p>It is precisely this social context in which Post places the US Civil War. He argues that the contradictions between the two property regimes – plantation slavery in the South and capitalist agriculture/industry in the North – mounted over the future class structure of the territories conquered from Mexico in 1844-6, which in the end led to the breaking out of the Civil War. The Civil War and the Reconstruction Period secured the dominance of capitalist property relations in the USA, while creating new non-capitalist relations in the South: sharecropping. Sharecropping was not as antagonistic to capitalism as slavery, i.e. it posed limits but no serious threat to the future expansion of capitalist social relations. In addition, the liberalisation of immigration laws, protective tariffs and massive infrastructure projects in the Reconstruction Period further galvanised the capitalist economy, precipitating the completion of the ‘transition’ to capitalism in the USA.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important issues Post raises, which is also highly relevant to historical sociology scholarship, is the question of whether the ‘transition’ to capitalism in the USA can be captured through the notion of ‘bourgeois revolution’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309816813489943">Comninel 1987</xref>; Mooers 1991; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309816813489943">Davidson 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309816813489943">Duzgun 2012</xref>). Post reads the American Civil War as a ‘bourgeois revolution’, whereas he remains highly sceptical of the applicability of the same concept to the American Revolution. That is, in the period preceding the Civil War, the Northern bourgeoisie was a capitalist bourgeoisie, whose social reproduction was based on the geographical spread of capitalist relations and which eventually freed itself from pre-capitalist impediments. And yet, the revolutionary war of the previous century was not led by a capitalist bourgeois class and only unintentionally led to the constitution of capitalist class relations in the North. The non-capitalist merchant class and speculators employed various class strategies of reproduction, in the course of which the social monopoly of land was enforced upon independent farmers. In the long run, this paved the way for the emergence of a new society and new class structure in which classes, including the bourgeoisie, were compelled to reproduce themselves in a politically/ideologically constituted and historically novel sphere of social reproduction: the market.</p>
<p>The implication is that capitalism was not driven by a transhistorically defined bourgeois class that was destined to develop the productive forces and expand markets. Rather, capitalism emerged as an unintended outcome of non-capitalist class struggles in the post-Revolutionary period, which ‘allowed the US Civil War to assume the form of a “classic” bourgeois revolution led by a self-conscious class of capitalist manufacturers and commercial farmers struggling to remove the obstacle posed by the geographical expansion of plantation-slavery’. Post rejects an essentialist scheme of historical development led by bourgeois classes programmed to carry out their pre-ordained tasks. In doing so, he aptly departs from the idea of ‘capital unfolding itself’, to ‘capital as a real historical relation’ and ‘process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309816813489943">Thompson 1995</xref>: 85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309816813489943">Wood 1995</xref>: Chp.3), which brings in its train drastic implications for a re-periodisation of capitalism in the USA.</p>
