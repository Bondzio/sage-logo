<p>The<italic> Journal of Macromarketing</italic> is a scholarly publication that examines the interactions among markets, marketing, and society. Though primarily a marketing journal, <italic>JMK</italic> is also multidisciplinary and accepts submissions from a wide range of social science and business fields including management, economics, sociology, public and health policy, environmental studies, and history. The Journal features articles on competition and markets, marketing and development, ethics and distributive justice, sustainability, quality of life, the history of marketing, marketing and public policy, marketing and society, and marketing systems and phenomena in the aggregate. Submissions may consist of conceptual papers, empirical studies, or public policy analyses. Submissions whose primary purpose is to advance management practice or refine statistical methodologies are generally not considered suitable for review. </p>
<p>Manuscripts are reviewed with the understanding that they:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>are substantially new; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>have not been previously published, unless as part of proceedings, without copyrights, distributed by a conference sponsored by the<italic> Journal of Macromarketing;</italic> </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>have not been previously accepted for publication;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>are not under consideration by any other publisher; </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>will not be submitted elsewhere until a decision is reached regarding their publication in the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic>. </p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Different kinds of articles are published in the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic>. Peer reviewed articles present empirical findings and conceptual models. Introductions to special issues position the subject matter and preview the peer reviewed articles. Invited commentaries confirm or challenge viewpoints expressed in peer reviewed articles, while other invited communications provide compelling insights germane to macromarketing. Book and media reviews evaluate new contributions to the literature. Seminar abstracts summarize papers presented at the annual Macromarketing Conference.</p>
<p>Peer reviewed articles published in the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> undergo an evaluation process consisting of input from the Editor-in-Chief, an Associate Editor (if applicable), and at least two and usually three outside reviewers who are experts in their respective fields and who are often members of the Editorial Policy or Manuscript Review Boards. Author names and affiliations are removed prior to forwarding a manuscript to reviewers in order to maximize objectivity and to ensure that manuscripts are judged solely on the basis of content, clarity, and contribution to the field. Articles should be written in an interesting, readable manner, and technical terms should be defined. In some circumstances, the Journal will publish an invited manuscript from a noted scholar on a topic deemed of particular interest to the development of the field of macromarketing.</p>

<title>Manuscript Preparation and Submission</title>
<sec id="section2-0276146713489076">
<title>1. General Considerations</title>
<p>Manuscripts must be submitted electronically to the <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> electronic review system: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jmk">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/jmk</ext-link>. This system requires submitting authors to divide their manuscripts into different components, which are then reassembled as a pdf file available to the editors and reviewers. Manuscripts that reveal author names or are otherwise inappropriately formatted will be returned.</p>
<p>Manuscripts should be double-spaced, including references and formatted for letter size (8.5“ x 11”) paper with 1-inch margins on all four sides. Do not use single spacing anywhere except on tables and figures. Place page numbers in the upper right-hand corner of every page. A .5-inch tab indent should begin each paragraph except those immediately following a heading. Manuscripts ordinarily should be between 8,000 and 12,000 words (inclusive of references and all other items) using Times New Roman 12-point type. Articles of shorter length are also acceptable and encouraged. Please refrain from using first person singular in the text of the manuscript unless it is an invited article or book review. Also, avoid using inefficient “there is (are)” and “it is” phrasing in sentences.</p>
<p>For details of manuscript preparation not covered herein, please examine recent issues of the Journal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146713489076">
<title>2. Submission Process</title>
<p>
<italic>User Account</italic> – The Manuscript Central program asks authors to generate an author/reviewer account if one has not been created already. Authors are required to supply their first and last names, email addresses, and macromarketing keywords either chosen from a list of those used previously in the Journal.</p>
<p>
<italic>Title, Abstract, and Keywords</italic> – Authors first supply the manuscript title and an abstract. The title should be reasonably short and communicate the main idea of the research. The abstract should not be longer than 150 words and should substantively summarize the article. Five keywords to facilitate electronic access to this manuscript should be listed after the abstract. Given that researchers increasingly rely upon Google Scholar and other search engines, choice of appropriate keywords is imperative to encourage downloads and citations.</p>
<p>
<italic>Body and References</italic> – The body of the text and reference list are submitted next. The text should left-justify all headings. Major headings should be in bold with upper- and lowercase letters. Subheadings should be in italics with upper- and lowercase letters. Do not use footnotes in the body of the manuscript. If notes are used, place endnotes in a numbered list after the body of the text and before the reference list. However, please avoid endnotes wherever possible because they interrupt the flow of the manuscript. Acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon are defined unless they are well known (such as FBI) or they can be found in a dictionary. Quotes should include page numbers from the original source. All citations in the text (see below) must have a reference and every reference should be cited.</p>
<p>
<italic>Tables and Figures</italic> – Each table and figure should be prepared on a separate page. The data in tables should be arranged so that columns of like materials read down, not across. Non-significant decimal places in tabular data should be omitted. The tables and figures should be numbered in Arabic numerals, followed by brief descriptive titles. Additional details should be footnoted under the table, not in the title. In the text, all illustrations and charts should be referred to as figures. Figures must be clean and crisp and visually appealing. Please be sure captions are included. Within the body of the text, please indicate where tables and figures should appear by inserting something like the following: [Insert Table 1 about here]. </p>
<p>Because readers increasingly will be accessing <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> articles online, authors are encouraged to use high resolution color images wherever appropriate. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0276146713489076">
<title>3. Reference Citations within Text</title>
<p>Citations in the text should include the author's last name and year of publication enclosed in parentheses without punctuation (Smith 2013). If practical, the citation should be placed immediately before a punctuation mark. Otherwise, insert it in a logical sentence break. If a particular page, section, or equation is cited, it should be placed within the parentheses (Smith 2013, p. 350). For multiple authors, use the full citation for up to three authors, for example, (Smith and DuPont 2013) or (Smith, DuPont, and Meier 2013). For more than three authors, use the first author's name with “et al.” (Smith et al. 2013). When two or more citations are within the same parentheses, they should be in alphabetical order by lead author surnames.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0276146713489076">
<title>4. Reference List Style</title>
<p>List references alphabetically, principal author's surname first, followed by publication date. The reference list should be double-spaced with a .5 inch hanging indent. Do not number references. Please see the reference examples below as well as reference lists in recent issues. Be sure that all titles cited in the text appear in the reference list and vice versa. Please provide translations for non-English titles in references, page ranges for articles and for book chapters, and all author/editor names unless they appears as “et al.” in the publication.</p>
