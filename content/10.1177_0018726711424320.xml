<abstract>
<p>Drawing on contemporary interviews and archival data, we explore how stories can be used as templates to guide jazz musicians’ sensemaking about the leadership of teams, what it means to be a jazz musician and what jazz is (or is not). By going beyond the metaphorical notion of jazz as improvisation, we contribute to theories of leadership by showing how informal storytelling can act as a powerful sensemaking and sensegiving mechanism for leadership and organizing. We also explore the contested nature of stories drawing on the notion of ‘antenarrative’. Our analysis contributes to the body of work on leader sensegiving and storytelling by examining the conditions under which a story’s sensegiving power may be restricted. Our research suggests that the sensegiving power of an ante-narrative and associated stories depends on whether or not they attempt to counter a dominant discourse.</p>

<p>[Art Blakey] had this Zen-like quality of telling you the same stories over and over again to bring home various points that he felt were necessary to help you understand the lengths to which musicians have gone to develop their craft. These stories were repeated so much – it was like Chinese water torture – that one could mouth them word for word as they were being told. The interesting thing is that now I have my own band, I find myself boring my sidemen with repeated tales told to me by Art. Funny, though, they still work.

<p>In this article we explore the role of storytelling as a means of sensemaking and sensegiving about organizing and leadership in jazz. In doing so we seek to explain how jazz musicians and their leaders articulate their understanding of leadership and its influence on the organized action of creating jazz music. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726711424320">Smircich and Morgan (1982</xref>: 257) argue that ‘the concept of leadership permeates and structures the theory and practice of organizations and hence the way in which we understand organized action’. Thus, we view leadership as ‘influential acts of organizing that contribute to the structuring of interactions and relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711424320">Uhl-Biel, 2006</xref>: 662). By viewing leadership as a process we are able to break down the distinction between the leadership of people and the management of organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711424320">Hosking, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711424320">Weick’s (1995)</xref> work, numerous scholars have argued that sensemaking and sensegiving are key elements of the leadership process (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711424320">Colville and Murphy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726711424320">Maitlis and Lawrence, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711424320">Pye, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726711424320">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726711424320">Smirchich and Stubbart, 1985</xref>). Sensemaking is the primary site where meanings materialize to inform and constrain identity and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726711424320">Weick et al., 2005</xref>); it is described as a process which is ‘retrospective, social, ongoing and driven by plausibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711424320">Weick, 1995</xref>: 17). In contrast, sensegiving involves attempts to influence the sensemaking and meaning construction of others towards a preferred redefinition of reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711424320">Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726711424320">Maitlis and Lawrence, 2007</xref>). Through sensegiving efforts, leaders can work to enact shared meaning in their followers as a basis for organized action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726711424320">Smircich and Morgan, 1982</xref>). Although frequently studied in the context of major organizational change events in established organizations, sensemaking and sensegiving are triggered in a broad range of contexts, particularly where issues are deemed to be significant to leaders and/or stakeholders and in environments characterized by uncertainty and complexity (i.e. equivocality) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726711424320">Maitlis and Lawrence, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726711424320">Weick et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We have selected jazz as the focus of our research because equivocality is central to its very essence, creating a particularly challenging environment for leaders. Further, the creation of jazz music commonly involves loose constellations of individuals in bands, whose membership is often rather unstable thus imposing high demands on the leadership of these groups. These demands are heightened because jazz activity takes place in a context of originality and a desire for freedom of expression that arguably transcends the music (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711424320">Berliner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711424320">Coker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424320">Gabbard, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711424320">Lock, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726711424320">Weick, 1998</xref>). Thus jazz represents a theoretically interesting context for two reasons. First, it allows us to contribute to the development of ‘team leadership theories’, rather applying ‘theories of leadership’ to team settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711424320">Burke et al., 2006</xref>); the latter having been criticized for failing to fully appreciate and model the dynamism and complexities of team leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711424320">House and Aditya, 1997</xref>). Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711424320">Mumford et al. (2002)</xref> suggest that extant leadership theories (e.g. transformational leadership) may not be applicable to settings that call for creativity and innovation. For example, the leadership role of inspiring and motivating team members may be less important in creative teams because creative individuals tend to be highly motivated. Rather, leadership processes are likely to involve channelling that motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711424320">Mumford and Licuanan, 2004</xref>). In examining leadership in jazz we highlight the important role of stories for sensemaking and sensegiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711424320">Weick, 1995</xref>: 61). Leaders and followers give and make sense through the use of stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711424320">Gioia and Chittipeddi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726711424320">Maitlis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726711424320">Rhodes and Brown, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726711424320">Snell, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711424320">Gabriel (1991</xref>: 858) defines stories as accounts ‘through which events, at times major, at others trivial, become charged with symbolic significance’. Stories, therefore, are perhaps best understood as recursive, reciprocal and interactive sensemaking and sensegiving vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711424320">Ashforth et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726711424320">Weick et al., 2005</xref>) that shape meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711424320">Putnam et al., 1996</xref>: 386). The jazz bass player Crow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711424320">2005</xref>: ix) exemplifies the idea of sensemaking and sensegiving through stories when he writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Jazz musicians are bound together by a rich and colourful history that lives in the music itself, remembered, recorded, created and recreated. In addition we have stories about ourselves, stretching back to the beginnings of music that are told and retold; legends and laughter that remind us of who we are and where we are from.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the prominence that legendary band leaders hold in many of the classic and oft-repeated tales of jazz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711424320">Crow, 2005</xref>), we embrace and extend Pye’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711424320">2005</xref>: 31) idea that ‘leadership [constitutes] a sensemaking process’. Sensemaking can, however, be both retrospective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711424320">Colville et al., 1999</xref>) and prospective in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711424320">Weick, 1995</xref>), in that how we make sense of stimuli influences future decisions and actions. As such, sensemaking and sensegiving stories have also been attributed with a normative role, being vehicles for the legitimation of ideas and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711424320">Currie and Brown, 2003</xref>) as well as the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726711424320">Maclean et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus of our research is the orally transmitted stories musicians tell off the bandstand <italic>about</italic> leaders in jazz. These stories appear to play an important sensemaking role in how musicians organize their artistic and professional lives. As the stories are told and re-told, embellished and embroidered, they continue to inspire and shape the collective sense of what jazz music is. We show that stories about leaders such as Duke Ellington and Miles Davis are employed as a means of sensemaking about how to operate as a jazz musician and bandleader. We also illustrate that stories about such leaders encompass a sensegiving dimension at the group level; providing templates for organizing and leading groups of musicians.</p>
<p>Through our analysis we seek to make two main contributions. First, we contribute to the literature on jazz and organization to explore the actual organizing processes of jazz musicians. We show how informal storytelling can be used as a mechanism for sensemaking and sensegiving in two dimensions of leadership, namely <italic>orchestration</italic> and <italic>education</italic>. Second, we contribute to the body of work on sensegiving and storytelling, demonstrating that the sensegiving power of stories may be restricted because stories, by their very nature, are contested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424320">Cunliffe and Coupland, 2012</xref> for further discussion of the contested nature of stories). Our study reveals that the extent to which stories are contested is influenced by whether or not the stories run counter to a contextual dominant discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711424320">Näslund and Pemer, 2012</xref> on the notion of a dominant story).</p>
<p>The remainder of the article unfolds as follows. First, we provide a storied account of our methodology, data collection and analysis. Second, we present our empirical findings as studies in storytelling; showing how jazz leadership has at its heart a central creative tension between the need for simultaneous order and chaos. In doing so, we highlight the importance of stories about leadership and the <italic>orchestration</italic> of groups that are largely used for the purposes of sensemaking, and stories about leadership and the <italic>education</italic> of groups, many of which are used for sensegiving. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and draw some conclusions about the way stories help us deal with the problematic nature of sensemaking and sensegiving for organizational leaders in an intrinsically improvisatory creative activity. We revisit and elaborate on our contributions in the conclusion.</p>

<p>This article is an in-depth interpretive exploration of the jazz world – an ‘inquiry from the inside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711424320">Humphreys and Brown, 2002</xref>: 426). Jazz has proved a particularly rich source of theorizing for organizational studies scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711424320">Bastien and Hostager, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711424320">Crossan and Sorrenti, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711424320">Hatch, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711424320">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711424320">Humphreys et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711424320">Kamoche et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726711424320">Moorman and Miner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726711424320"><italic>Organization Science</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726711424320">Tyler and Tyler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711424320">Weick 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726711424320">1998</xref>). However, the predominant focus of this work has used jazz as a metaphor for improvisation in order to understand processes of organizing. We move away from the use of jazz as a metaphor for improvisation in organizations and, instead, explore the actual organizing processes of jazz musicians themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726711424320">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first author draws on 45 years experience of jazz concerts, recordings and biographical accounts of jazz musicians (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424320">Carr, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711424320">Davis and Troupe, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711424320">Russell, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726711424320">Tucker, 1993</xref>). The original idea for the project arose from reflexive interaction between the three authors (all jazz fans) and jazz musician friends. Our appreciation of jazz music and background knowledge of the jazz world was important methodologically, not only because it facilitated informal conversations with musicians, but also because it enriched the data from formal interviews with our primary sources, who included leading contemporary jazz musicians such as Wynton Marsalis, Sean Jones, Tony Kofi, Jean Toussaint, Guy Barker and Alan Barnes. The project, therefore, has considerable personal significance for all the authors. We are all amateur musicians and musically very aware of the achievements and technical brilliance of our interviewees. Hence, immersion in the jazz community and in-depth conversations with some of the current stars of the genre was a very rich personal experience for us, and in itself, a sensemaking process as we began to understand the power of stories within jazz. A reflexive consideration of the ethnographic interactions involved in this research and the effect on researcher identity is, however, a story requiring another article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0018726711424320">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Research suggests that stories are key to understanding, for example, employee socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726711424320">Louis, 1983</xref>), organizational learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711424320">Helmer, 1989</xref>), processes of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711424320">Brown and Humphreys, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711424320">Humphreys and Brown, 2002</xref>) and organizational identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711424320">Brown et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, researchers have focused on the role that stories play as ‘inscriptions of past performances and scripts and staging instructions for future performances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711424320">Czarniawska, 1998</xref>: 20), and ‘the preferred sense-making currency of human relationships’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711424320">Boje, 1991</xref>: 106). In this way we also endeavour to encompass both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711424320">Gabriel’s (2004</xref>: 23) claim that a story ‘does not have to be factually accurate in order to be of use’. Further, stories may be abbreviated and succinct, simplifications in which parts of the plot, some of the characters, and segments of the sequence of events are left to the audience’s imagination – what Boje calls terse stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711424320">Boje, 1991</xref>: 115). We argue that our research subjects can be viewed as operating in a ‘story space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711424320">Boje, 1991</xref>), comprised of both terse stories and more linear, emplotted stories (à la <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711424320">Czarniawska, 1997</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711424320">Gabriel, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, we acknowledge that stories are not static, nor are they ever ‘completed’. They are constantly in the process of being accomplished – assembled, disassembled, refined, elaborated, and embellished – with ‘whole’ and ‘terse’ stories, sometimes coming together and at other times pulling apart in the story space. Finally, we acknowledge that stories may have a political dimension as the ‘hierarchically privileged seek often to use stories to impose their own perceptions of truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726711424320">Rhodes, 2001</xref>: 227). We aimed to do justice to the complex stories and story fragments that emerged during our data collection, and to give a ‘voice’ to the musicians who figure so prominently in our analysis.</p>

<p>We did a gig at The Vortex in Hackney and asked people to put their hand up if they had seen us via MySpace and it was almost half the room. Our publicist jumped on it and she called it ‘jazz for the MySpace generation’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The website provided us with information about when key individuals would be in the UK, and hence available to interview. Once identified, we used MySpace to invite candidates to be interviewed as part of our project. We not only managed to secure formal interviews with internationally renowned musicians, but also found them willing to introduce us to members of their social and professional networks. In addition, we were able to spend a considerable amount of time in the presence of musicians during rehearsals and performances (by the Lincoln Centre Jazz Orchestra, the Guy Barker Big Band and many gigs by the individual musicians such as Jim Watson, Alan Barnes, Tony Kofi, Martin Taylor, Ken Peplowski and Jean Toussaint). These events facilitated rich informal conversations with band members and also provided extensive opportunity for observations that were written up as field notes after each event. In total the research team (including the authors and two other researchers) conducted 20 formal interviews (between 45 and 90 minutes), which we recorded and fully transcribed, and recorded substantial oral data from 42 informal conversations with musicians over a period of six months. Our data were also enhanced by ongoing email exchanges both with our interviewees and other informants.</p>

<p>At a relatively early stage of our fieldwork it became clear that our interviewees commonly referred anecdotally, and often with some reverence, to a small number of inspirational figures. We were intrigued by the story fragments associated with these reference cases as they seemed to represent proto-heroic exemplar accounts of the ways in which jazz musicians worked, and interacted with, one another. This emerging aspect of our research led us to try and match our data to the extensive historical, biographical and anecdotal literature of jazz. Thus, our contemporary interview data were enriched by our compilation and analysis of archival information including autobiographies and biographies of artists, album sleeve notes, published critical commentaries and reviews, as well as individual artist’s web pages. The interaction between our interviews with contemporary jazz artists and archival materials was fascinating and very fruitful. For example, a number of the musicians we interviewed had played with Art Blakey (e.g. Wynton Marsalis and Jean Toussaint) and/or had played in bands with musicians who had been members of Duke Ellington’s orchestra and Miles Davis’s various groupings (e.g. Marsalis had played with Clark Terry and Herbie Hancock).</p>
<p>In analysing our data we sought to identify the stories used by jazz musicians in order to make sense of their professional lives. This involved all three authors reading and re-reading our interview transcripts, field notes of observations and informal conversations, in conjunction with the collected historical published material. From this analysis we developed sets of emergent stories, which we present below. Our four highlighted cases (Ellington, Davis, Blakey and Marsalis) were by far the most frequently cited examples of jazz leaders by our interviewees. We acknowledge that it is our version of actors, actions, events and circumstances that is privileged here – ‘To author a story is always a creative act, and our story is just one of many that could be told . . . Ours is not a quest for scientific truth, but a quest for meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726711424320">Rhodes and Brown, 2005b</xref>: 167). In the next sections we present our analysis of the jazz leadership stories about orchestration and education.</p>

<title>Stories of orchestration</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711424320">Barrett (1998a</xref>: 558) noted: ‘Jazz improvisation involves creating music on the spot without a pre-scripted score or plan. However, jazz is guided by a non-negotiable framework that constrains what the soloist can play’. For the leader of a jazz group this is exemplified in the ongoing tension between the creative diversity of individual musicians and the cohesion of the band. Our data suggest that one way current musicians make sense of this tension is by telling and retelling stories of jazz leaders from the past, particularly Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. We refer to these as stories of <italic>orchestration</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section7-0018726711424320">
<title>Duke Ellington</title>
<p>Orchestration featured most prominently in stories about Ellington. These stories suggest that when Ellington hired new musicians he would quickly analyse their sound and potential contribution to the orchestra and write music that brought out the very best in them. He embraced their unique personalities, preferring to adapt to their idiosyncrasies rather than trying to modify them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711424320">Crow, 2005</xref>). Ellington regarded his entire orchestra as one large instrument saying: ‘My aim is and always has been to mould the music around the man. I’ve found out that it doesn’t matter so much what you have available, but rather what you make of what you do have – finding a good “fit” for every instrumentalist in the group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711424320">Giddins, 1998</xref>: 104). Interestingly, while Ellington is credited in the literature for being a great composer, contemporary bass player Darren Taylor interpreted his approach differently by saying that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>he just wrote a lot of triggers so that musicians at the time could express who they were. In a way, that is a mark of genius because you allow the personalities to express themselves and then just glue all of those things together, so he got the best performance from everybody by having a very informal structure that actually bound people together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A recurring theme in stories about Ellington was his talent for motivation and inspiration, which is perhaps the main reason for the cadre of long-serving core musicians who contributed to the Ellington sound over several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0018726711424320">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>With such a low level of turnover, Ellington was able to ensure a degree of cohesion among a group of very disparate individuals. This approach appears to have guided saxophonist Alan Barnes who, when talking about Ellington, cited him as an influence in his own approach to team formation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just tend to put things together that I know will work, and, like Ellington I know the guys are okay, they’re all personal friends, it’s probably easiest to play jazz with people you know very well because there’s none of those feelings of ‘oh god, do we like what we’re doing?’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The unusual stability of the Ellington orchestra appears to have been facilitated by its leader’s laissez faire attitude towards the behaviour of his musicians. Stories of Ellington describe him as often too soft-hearted to reprimand musicians who caused trouble. It seems that Ellington was willing to put up with the bad behaviour of group members because he saw their foibles as the price to be paid for having access to their talents. For example, if musicians were late, he would start without them, tailoring the music for a smaller group. Ellington’s non-confrontational style was particularly evident in his apparent unwillingness to fire unruly band members. Things did not always go so smoothly and current musicians still tell stories of the conflict between Ellington and Charlie Mingus. As British saxophonist Tony Kofi said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mingus kept getting into trouble with one of the other band members because he was a strong personality and Duke Ellington said that he loved Charles Mingus like a brother and that he was one of the best players out there but this was no place for two leaders and they both knew that Mingus was a leader.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Saxophonist Alan Barnes was explicit in his account of Ellington’s influence on his approach to leadership:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Like Duke Ellington I think the way to deal with it, is not to confront, to decide whether you’ve had enough and say ‘well, that’s it’ tell them why and be honest . . . The way to lead a band is to not tell everyone what not to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, stories about Ellington’s leadership suggest that he adopted a hands-off approach to managing his group, but that he was ‘hands-on’ in tailoring his compositions for individual musicians. Although our next case, Miles Davis, was also renowned for a hands-off approach to managing his groups, stories suggest that his musical orchestration took a different form in that he provided much greater creative freedom to his musicians – we explore these stories below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0018726711424320">
<title>Miles Davis</title>
<p>It is significant that current jazz players still discuss Davis. As Tony Kofi, a virtuoso saxophonist, pointed out:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When Miles Davies came on to the scene he realised that he was never going to be able to play like Dizzy Gillespie because he didn’t have the physical ability to play like him . . . so he went to the cool school of music. And this is what makes leaders – the fact that you can create something so individual.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many stories, including <italic>Miles: The Autobiography</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711424320">Davis and Troupe, 1989</xref>), suggest that in recognizing his own limitations, when forming groups Davis brought together musicians known for their individual creative flair and let the innovation emerge from the creative process. Some argue that this approach yielded some of the greatest landmarks in different phases of jazz history – cool jazz, modal jazz and jazz-rock fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711424320">Gridley, 2002</xref>). Stories suggest that in contrast to Ellington, Davis often chose musicians who did not know each other, because he felt that prior relationships might lead to the development of routines which hampered innovation and improvisation. Inspired by this, trumpeter Sean Jones noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you hire your own friends it becomes a clique. If you hire people from everywhere you can create your own vibe immediately. Miles Davis was very good at that, when he hired a band he never hired his friends, sometimes he hired his enemies.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stories acknowledge Miles as a ‘discoverer of major talents’ and as a leader creating groups ‘composed of super-humans’ (Bill Evans, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424320">Carr, 1982</xref>: 124). In the process, Davis let the group members’ talents speak for themselves: ‘I just bring out in people what’s in them’ (Davis, 1974, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711424320">Carr, 1982</xref>: 280). Thus, Davis’s approach to orchestration took the form of a ‘framework’ with only very limited individual musical direction. For example, according to the liner notes by Bill Evans to the album <italic>Kind of Blue</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As the painter needs his framework of parchment, the improvising musical group needs its framework in time. Miles Davis presents here frameworks which are exquisite in their simplicity and yet contain all that is necessary to stimulate performance with a sure reference to the primary conception . . . The group had never played these pieces prior to the recordings and I think without exception the first complete performance of each was a ‘take’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This lack of explicit direction created high levels of ambiguity for many group members but Davis seemed to hold the view that this kept the group fresh and led to radically new music. This approach is still admired, talked about and emulated by contemporary musicians such as Sean Jones:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Miles hired such different musicians because he was always looking for a sound that was never created before. This is something I will be doing with my band too; I have a guy that is from Jamaica, another from Connecticut, Jersey. They never met each other before until they got into my band.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The key to Davis’s creation of radically new music seemed to be a process of mutual discovery among band members. A common theme in stories about Davis is that he also actively discouraged his musicians from rehearsing because he was afraid that the band members would learn to play in clichés developed through practice. This approach ensured that each group member had to listen carefully to the others and respond accordingly. Contemporary musicians still recount stories of how Davis deployed tactics such as calling familiar songs in a strange key so that the musicians could not rely on learned finger patterns. He seemed to encourage creativity by producing enough anxiety to boost the musicians’ attention necessary for innovative breakthroughs but not so much that it would block creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711424320">Barrett, 1998b</xref>). Such high levels of ambiguity for his musicians created risks for his groups that could lead to mistakes. Miles, however, had a very clear view on this: ‘Do not fear mistakes, there are none’. This is still echoed in current musicians’ accounts of their work; as Alan Barnes said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The sad thing is, when you make a mistake in jazz, it’s there, you made it, you can try to dance around it . . . I mean, sometimes it all falls apart, but the nature of improvising is that mistakes are going to occur. It’s just part of the music. I often put a record out with a squeak on it, but it’s what happens and as long as it’s what happened I don’t mind. I hate it when people start editing things out and making it all perfect, I think perfection is getting in the way . . . it’s the enemy of jazz, perfection is a daft concept – it doesn’t exist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast to Ellington’s band that was comprised of long-standing musicians, stories about Davis emphasize his preference for repeatedly disbanding his groups and subsequently forming new ones. This was a risky strategy but one that led to the creation of radically innovative opportunities exemplified by the albums: <italic>Birth of the Cool, Kind of Blue, Bitches Brew</italic>. A consequence of Davis’s style of leadership was that by selecting the best talent around and sharing creative leadership with band members, once the group became successful it was increasingly difficult to retain musicians. For example, in the period 1955–61, John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Cannonball Adderley all left Davis to become band leaders in their own right.</p>
<p>The various stories about Ellington and Davis we have presented continue to be recounted by contemporary musicians, not just as interesting anecdotes but more significantly as templates for sensemaking about the processes of leadership and organizing in jazz. Our research suggests that these storied templates are particularly important in an organizational environment characterized by improvisation, freedom of expression and creativity. In such a setting conventional approaches to leadership that have been developed in less dynamic organizational settings may be incongruent with the practices of jazz. The orchestration stories of Ellington and Davis represent examples of sensemaking templates that contemporary musicians are able to draw upon to suit their leadership needs and preferences. In the next set of stories, which we label stories of <italic>education</italic>, we explore how stories can also be used to direct the sensemaking of others (i.e. sensegiving).</p>

<sec id="section9-0018726711424320">
<title>Stories of education</title>
<p>In his landmark study of jazz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711424320">Berliner (1994</xref>: 37) noted that: ‘For almost a century, the jazz community has functioned as a large educational system for producing, preserving, and transmitting musical knowledge, preparing students for the artistic demands of a jazz career’. Our research suggests that this system continues to function, and that one of the major modes of education is storytelling. Such stories of <italic>education</italic> centre on what it means to be a jazz musician and a band leader (stories of identity), as well as on the notion of what jazz is (and is not) (stories of definition). Two dominant educational figures emerged from our data, one from the past (Art Blakey) and one still currently operating (Wynton Marsalis). Both illustrate the sensegiving power of storytelling.</p>
<sec id="section10-0018726711424320">
<title>Art Blakey</title>
<p>Blakey’s name is synonymous with the archetypal Hard Bop<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0018726711424320">9</xref></sup> group the <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic>. While the name <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic> was a constant, the composition of the group changed regularly. Stories suggest that although similar to Davis and Ellington in that he sought to bring in the best talent, Blakey’s approach differed in a number of respects. His approach involved identifying young talent and nurturing it. Consequently, Blakey was able to attract the best new musicians who were keen to graduate from his ‘Roving Graduate Programme’, also known as ‘Blakey’s School of Swing’ and ‘Blakey’s Free-form University’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711424320">Giddins, 2004</xref>: 11).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0018726711424320">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Joining Blakey’s band was a highly valued opportunity for young musicians, as recognized by ex-<italic>Jazz Messengers</italic> trumpeter Terence Blanchard, who was fulsome in his evocation of Blakey’s broad and pervasive sensegiving educational influence:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The experience of being a sideman in Art Blakey’s band was more like that of the student and mentor . . . Art taught me more about life and how to relate to people than anyone else in my life other than my father. He was the kind of secure person who could let you grow by letting you make the mistakes you had to make to understand. Two weeks of mishaps would teach you what could take two years of talking-to to learn.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The underlying theme of the Blakey story was that he provided a platform for his musicians to develop by relying on them to compose for the band within the hard-bop genre. Group members therefore knew the parameters within which they were working, and what type of sound they were looking to create. It is clear in accounts of Blakey’s leadership that his didactic style was seen as instrumental in shaping the character and careers of the young musicians he hired. As pianist Bobby Timmons recalls: ‘You learn decorum with him and how to be a man’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711424320">Collier, 1978</xref>: 441).</p>
<p>A particularly striking outcome of Blakey’s relatively dominant style was that he helped create leaders out of his young musicians. Alto saxophonist Bobby Watson was explicit about his debt to Blakey:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He made a leader out of me, taught me how to use, observe and elevate the musicians I hire. He taught me how to read the vibe of an audience and how to use time. He taught me how to build a solo. He taught me the value of a band. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711424320">Goldsher, 2002</xref>: xii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is clear that Blakey’s ‘graduates’ were highly appreciative of his educational leadership, as Jean Toussaint (saxophonist) commented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of the ways he taught us to play was all through the music, he didn’t say much about how he wanted us to play, and he just did it all through different cues when he was playing. I found that to be the strongest way of learning, sort of by osmosis basically, by learning from being in that environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another feature of Blakey’s leadership was his dominance as a father figure. For example, when the improvisations by trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once strayed too far from the appropriate feeling of a ballad, Blakey shouted across the bandstand: ‘Think of the lyrics: think of the lyrics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711424320">Berliner, 1994</xref>: 255). Stories suggest that while Blakey sought to assist and guide his musicians, like Ellington and Davis, he also gave them space to flourish. When interviewed, Marsalis was unequivocal:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have had many mentors. For leading the band I guess I would say it was the great Art Blakey. Just the way he dealt with the band. He was a real natural . . . Jazz musicians don’t need anybody to boss them. He allowed people to be creative, interchange ideas and allowed them to play what they wanted on the bandstand. He also really educated the younger musicians.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Blakey is clearly acknowledged by contemporary musicians as one of jazz’s great educators and there is a wealth of ongoing stories and anecdotes that continue to carry the message of how he inculcated not only musical values but also how to operate as a leader and jazz musician. Blakey’s educational leadership approach appears to have been highly influential on <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic>’ alumni. One notable alumnus is our next case, Wynton Marsalis, who has clearly instigated an overtly sensegiving educational model with the world-famous Lincoln Centre Jazz Orchestra (LCJO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018726711424320">
<title>Wynton Marsalis</title>
<p>In conducting our research we were fortunate to be able to interview Wynton Marsalis along with other musicians, including some of those who have worked with, and currently work for, him. An emergent theme in our research was that Marsalis appears to have consciously taken on the role of <italic>sensegiver</italic> by not only inspiring stories but also by selectively (re)telling stories to shape the future of jazz.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0018726711424320">11</xref></sup> Although Marsalis plays an educational role similar to his mentor Blakey, his approach appears to be very different. Our data suggest that Marsalis is attempting to define jazz.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It [jazz] can’t be sold by being subsumed into the world-music market, and I’m just not willing to – I’m not willing to compromise my integrity under any circumstances. I wouldn’t do it when I was twenty. I’m certainly not going to do it when I’m forty. (Marsalis interviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711424320">Hajdu, 2003</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For several of our contemporary research subjects, Marsalis represents the current heroic jazz leader archetype, cultural sage and aspirational focal point. This appears, to some extent, to be the result of stories told by Marsalis about what jazz is, and what it is to be a jazz musician/leader. Marsalis views jazz music as being predominantly a black American musical art form, but also ‘high’ art. He has, through interviews, and in his music, actively promoted a view that jazz musicians should look to their musical heritage and embrace the work of specific black artists, particularly Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. Marsalis’s view of jazz is clearly retrospective in nature, focusing on a traditional acoustic variant, to the near exclusion of other, arguably more innovative forms such as fusion and free jazz. We therefore suggest that Marsalis is engaged in a sensegiving process in an attempt to define what jazz music is, and is not. He also appears to be attempting to shape the future of the music through his curatorial powers at the Lincoln Center as well as his extensive involvement in media and educational programmes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0018726711424320">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through the selective re-presentation of stories Marsalis seems to be sensegiving about the role of black musicians within jazz, specifically ensuring that jazz is recognized as a black musical art form, and establishing the economic independence of black musicians. He is viewed by many current and ex-members of the LCJO as an inspirational figure. Emphasizing Marsalis’s role in the cultural legitimation of black American music, Abram Wilson, trumpeter with the LCJO notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Wynton Marsalis is one of the people who brought back the acoustic jazz tradition. He did it at a time when it wasn’t very popular and kind of reaffirmed the strength that he has in jazz music. Some people liked it and some people didn’t. The thing that I liked about it was he was a <italic>black</italic> [Black?] <italic>man</italic> doing it. He played classical music and was a heavy classical musician – it kind of legitimised jazz music when you had this classical musician.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marsalis has also downplayed the outsider role of many musicians who do not fit comfortably with his own vision of both jazz and leadership. For example, in an interview he was particularly scathing about the later work of Miles Davis, which he described as a ‘fad’ and as ‘pandering to the marketplace’. As far as Marsalis was concerned, Davis had stopped playing what he considered to be jazz in the late 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711424320">Byrnes, 2001</xref>: 3). In contrast to the ‘drug-ravaged, unpredictable, ageing Davis’, Marsalis was ‘Mr Clean’, presenting himself as a role model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711424320">Byrnes, 2001</xref>: 3). This was confirmed by Abram Wilson:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Marsalis isn’t like a drinker, a drug user or a smoker. He totally redefined the perception of a jazz musician. If you even look today, most of these jazz musicians do not smoke or drink, they are very clean individuals and that kind of started with him. It’s just to have a positive force, a positive black male in the limelight in music.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Marsalis is clearly inspirational to his own band members as well as to particular sections of the wider (jazz) community, among other jazz musicians there is significant scepticism about his role as jazz musician and innovator. Critical acclaim from the classical mainstream is parried by critical disapproval from jazz quarters, accusing Marsalis of ‘neoclassicist nostalgia for a Golden Age . . . all the evidence one might need that jazz is dead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711424320">Deveaux, 1998</xref>: 485). For example, contemporary British pianist Jim Watson, a musician who had played with both older American jazz greats such as James Moody and younger tyros such as ex-<italic>Jazz Messengers</italic> saxophonist Jean Toussaint, said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t see Wynton Marsalis as an innovative jazz musician – he seems to be regressing and becoming more and more self-important. When he first started in jazz he used to play like Miles Davis and Freddie Hubbard but now he seems to have forgotten that, has rediscovered Ellington and Louis Armstrong and is pushing jazz back to the 1920s and 30s. This seems like a creative blind alley. For example, when he comes to London now he plays the classical Prom concerts but he doesn’t play Ronnie Scott’s where he would be seen by other jazz musicians.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stories about Blakey and Marsalis abound in the conversations of contemporary jazz musicians. In contrast to the stories of orchestration about Ellington and Davis, which were characterized by creative freedom in music and behaviour, the educational stories of Blakey and Marsalis are much more directive about what it is to be a jazz leader and musician. In Marsalis’s case the stories are also prescriptive about the nature of jazz music. Thus, in contrast to the menu of stories of orchestration available as a sensemaking guide, stories of education, as sensegiving devices, take the form of rule books for contemporary jazz musicians and their leaders. Stories about Blakey’s sensegiving activities suggest they were restricted to members of the <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic>. In contrast, stories about Marsalis suggest that his sensegiving efforts are targeted at a much wider audience. Our research suggests that these directive sensegiving attempts, particularly Marsalis’s, could be seen as incongruent with the essence of jazz. We expand on this issue below.</p>

<title>Deciphering the message<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0018726711424320">13</xref></sup></title>
<p>Our research suggests that stories should be viewed as important cultural resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711424320">Czarniawska, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711424320">Gabriel, 2000</xref>) that jazz musicians use to communicate meaning. We have examined how jazz musicians draw on stories as contextualized accounts of how leadership may be enacted. Stories enable leadership concepts to be communicated in a way that resonates with jazz musicians, frequently drawing on a common knowledge of the history of jazz music and its people. Over time, stories that are told and retold contribute to a dominant discourse,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0018726711424320">14</xref></sup> which, in jazz, continues to be centred on the quest for freedom of expression, both in music and civil rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726711424320">Lott, 1995</xref>). We now explore how the stories of orchestration and education identified in our analysis resonate with this dominant discourse and with the associated processes of sensemaking and sensegiving.</p>
<p>Stories of <italic>orchestration</italic> are those that provide leadership templates for dealing with the conflicting demands of diversity and cohesion within groups. We argue that such stories are consistent with the dominant discourse of jazz. They emphasize leadership activities that are non-prescriptive, involve the non-didactic provision of minimal frameworks and embrace diversity. For example, Ellington worked individually with each of his musicians, tailoring the music to their specific talents. He created a space in which the different musicians could flourish, educating his band in the importance of tolerating individual differences. Similarly, Davis set broad parameters for his musicians’ interaction, letting them explore their own creative abilities. He achieved this by providing minimal compositional structure, encouraging them not to fear failure, while embracing mutual musical discovery. Contemporary musicians continue to tell stories of the leadership practices of Ellington and Davis. However, these stories appear not to be issued normatively. Instead, the storyteller plays a passive role, recounting stories as illustrations of different ways to approach collective creativity. We view these stories of <italic>orchestration</italic> as improvisations within the dominant discourse of jazz, by providing examples of different ways to enact leadership. In essence, these stories are vehicles for sensemaking about the leadership of creative teams. Thus, our analysis allows us to contribute to the hitherto under-theorized area of creative team leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711424320">Burke et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, the stories we explore provide insights into how leaders of creative teams can direct and structure what is a challenging and ill-defined task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711424320">Mumford and Licuanan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, what we label as stories of <italic>education</italic> appear to relate to issues of identity (i.e. what it means to be a jazz musician), and the problem of definition (i.e. what jazz is [and is not]). We argue that these stories sit less comfortably within the dominant discourse of jazz because they have a strong normative element, and emphasize prescription and conformity above originality and freedom of expression. For example, stories about Blakey suggest that he performed an explicit educational function, encouraging his band members to compose within ‘hard bop’. His leadership was geared towards promoting hard bop and developing the next generation of jazz musicians, as his <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic>. Indeed, the choice of the name <italic>Jazz Messengers</italic> reinforces the idea that the band members were there to promote – indeed ‘tell a story’ of – the hard bop version of jazz. Blakey’s didactic approach to leadership also extended to encouraging his musicians to behave in a particular way – demanding decorum and self-restraint. Stories about, and told by, Marsalis suggest he has drawn on the didactic legacy of Blakey, but with the important difference that his educational efforts appear to be directed at a wider audience. Marsalis seems to have actively attempted to widely promote the view that jazz should be defined in terms of black, economically successful and clean-living musicians, playing a traditional acoustic variant of jazz. These depictions of Blakey and Marsalis suggest that the stories of <italic>education</italic> can be viewed not only as cultural resources for <italic>sensemaking</italic>, but also <italic>sensegiving</italic>. We find the stories of <italic>education</italic> particularly interesting because they are deployed to give sense to musicians and the wider diaspora as band members leave to become band leaders themselves. Furthermore, in the case of Marsalis, he employs the LCJO as a platform for sensegiving to the jazz community at large.</p>
<p>Both Blakey and Marsalis include a strong normative element in their stories. They articulate what ‘their’ vision of jazz is, and appear to perform a sensegiving function through the <italic>selective</italic> (re)presentation of jazz stories. The use of such stories may therefore be viewed as an attempt to legitimate a specific version of jazz history (which they highlight), and in doing so, subordinate and mute other available accounts. Thus, the sensegiving attempts of Blakey, and particularly Marsalis, may be seen as inconsistent with the essence of jazz. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424320">Gabbard (1995)</xref> argued, Marsalis had ‘abandoned the conventional view of jazz as an ever-progressing moment by singling out the bop of the 1950s as the true form of jazz as art’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726711424320">1995</xref>: 19). Since then, he has moved even further back in the jazz canon to (re)present the form in terms of early Ellington and Louis Armstrong. Of course, it is not the first time in the history of jazz that individuals and groups have sought to define it in a particular way, resisting new forms and wanting to preserve another. Yet, the view that ‘jazz extends, reaffirms and replenishes itself’ pervades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711424320">DeVeaux, 1991</xref>: 541). Our findings in relation to the use of stories (of education) for the purposes of sensegiving, support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711424320">Mumford et al.’s (2002)</xref> assertion that leaders of creative teams who attempt to impose a strong vision (commonly associated with transformational leaders), may stifle creativity by preventing creative people from forming or sharing their own unique ideas. Thus, we join others in calling for the development of ‘team leadership theories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711424320">Burke et al., 2006</xref>) that reflect the idiosyncrasies of creative settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711424320">Mumford et al., 2002</xref>) rather than applying extant ‘theories of leadership’ to creative team settings.</p>
<p>We suggest that the controversial nature of the stories about, and told by, Marsalis, can be viewed as a form of ‘antenarrative’, which Boje defines as a ‘fragmented, non-linear, incoherent, collective, unplotted, and pre-narrative speculation, a bet . . . a wager that a proper narrative can be constituted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711424320">Boje, 2001</xref>: 1). Marsalis’s sensegiving stories may then be best viewed as a prospective bet; an attempt to shape the future of jazz through silencing some stories and giving voice to others. Yet, Marsalis’s antenarrative is also retrospective in nature; and is perhaps best described as a ‘revisionist’ antenarrative, in that it draws on a selective account of history while remaining a narrative-in-the-making. Antenarratives can be viewed as an attempt to transform the future through storytelling by projecting past lines into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711424320">Boje, 2001</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711424320">Whittle and Mueller, 2012</xref> for an illustration of this). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726711424320">Vaara and Tienari (2010</xref>: 370) put it, antenarratives are ‘fragments of organizational discourse that construct identities and interests in time and space’. Taking this view, Marsalis’s sensegiving activities can be seen as drawing selectively on some stories to legitimate his view of jazz.</p>
<p>Attempts to create such an antenarrative are likely to be met with resistance as they counter aspects of the dominant discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711424320">Boje, 2001</xref>). Marsalis has attempted to weaken such resistance by selectively invoking particular stories of the history of jazz to legitimate his antenarrative. Thelonious Monk, highlighting the futility of such sensegiving efforts in jazz, once said ‘I don’t know where jazz is going. Maybe it’s going to hell. You can’t make anything go anywhere. It just happens.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711424320">DeVeaux, 1991</xref>: 525). Hence, Marsalis’s sensegiving activities are resisted because they are at variance with the very essence of the music; jazz changes and evolves because ‘its inner logic demands it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711424320">DeVeaux, 1991</xref>: 541). Surprisingly, his ideas are not even shared by a number of the musicians he cites as being key influences, including Duke Ellington:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To me, then jazz simply means freedom of musical speech! And it is precisely because of this freedom that so many varied forms of jazz exist. The important thing to remember, however, is that not one of these forms represents jazz by itself. Jazz means simply the freedom to have many forms. (Ellington in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711424320">Lock, 1999</xref>: 134)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Resistance to Marsalis’s revisionist antenarrative is generating sensegiving and sensemaking stories of its own, which centre on Wynton Marsalis’s approach to jazz’s past, present and future. Indeed, Marsalis has been criticized for appointing himself as cultural spokesperson for jazz worldwide using the LCJO as his megaphone. He has become a controversial figure, one whom many critics view as attempting to stifle freedom of expression:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In both dress and musical style Marsalis and his confreres represent a return to the past, most notably the 1950s . . . they regard the jazz past as a revered tradition and a field ripe for the picking . . . The emergence of Marsalis and the current generation of new traditionalists may lead to an acceptance of a stifling tradition in which musicians are ostracised for not following limited and pre-established protocols of both musical and non-musical styles. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711424320">Elworthy, 1995</xref>: 58–59)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We feel that the sensegiving attempts of Marsalis (and to a lesser extent Blakey) raise important issues for theorizing on the relationship between storytelling and sensemaking in creative leadership. First, historical stories can be seen as cultural resources that individuals can draw on, providing the basis for sensemaking. They may, however, also be used to legitimate an antenarrative. Yet, the antenarrative may be contested when historical stories are selectively used in a way that runs counter to the dominant discourse. Second, whereas individuals may seek to promote an antenarrative, others may seek to defend the dominant discourse. For example, Marsalis’s revisionist account of jazz history has led others to challenge his storytelling. Thus, by demonstrating how individuals work to create, promote or defend a particular discourse, we illustrate how stories might be thought of as continuously interacting and competing with one another, not just existing in some form of stasis.</p>

<title>So what?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0018726711424320">15</xref></sup></title>
<p>Our research illustrates the significance of the oral tradition of storytelling to the organization of jazz. We show how stories allow musicians to make and give sense about the nature of jazz, as well as what it is to be a jazz musician and/or leader. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the potential power and contested nature of stories as sensegiving efforts to shape the present and future direction of the music. Specifically, we render visible Marsalis’s paradoxical attempts to promote a revisionist antenarrative of jazz. In doing so, we view our contribution as twofold.</p>
<p>First, we contribute to the literature on jazz and organizing by going beyond the metaphorical notion of improvisation and instead explore the actual organizing processes of jazz musicians. In particular, we show how informal storytelling can be used as a powerful sensemaking and sensegiving mechanism for leadership. In doing so, we also provide insights into the enactment of leadership in highly dynamic environments that value creativity and innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711424320">Burke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711424320">House and Aditya, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711424320">Mumford and Licuanan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711424320">Mumford et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, we explore two dimensions of leadership, namely orchestration and education, captured in storied form. What we refer to as stories of <italic>orchestration</italic> provide interesting insights into how leaders may seek to balance the potentially conflicting need for both diversity and cohesion. These stories exist as contextualized accounts of the enactment of leadership, which resonate with contemporary musicians and facilitate their sensemaking about leadership in jazz. We contend that these stories of <italic>orchestration</italic> are consistent with the dominant discourse of jazz. In addition, our analysis indicates that leaders can deliberately use stories to sensegive by defining the parameters within which creativity is permitted. These stories, which we have labelled <italic>education</italic>, may be viewed as attempts to constrain the creative process and as running counter to the dominant discourse of jazz.</p>
<p>Second, we contribute to the body of work on sensegiving and storytelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711424320">Dunford and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726711424320">Snell, 2002</xref>) by demonstrating that the sensegiving power of stories may be restricted because stories, by their very nature, are contested (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711424320">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711424320">Brown and Humphreys, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711424320">Cunliffe and Coupland, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726711424320">Sims, 2003</xref>). Our study reveals that the extent to which stories are contested is influenced by whether or not the stories counter a contextual dominant discourse (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711424320">Näslund and Pemer [2012]</xref> on the restrictive effects of the dominant story on storytelling). We therefore embrace the notion that any analysis of the contestability of stories, and hence their sensegiving power, needs to be sensitive to historical context. Historical stories represent cultural resources that enable the storyteller to promote his/her version of jazz. This is illustrated by Marsalis’s attempts at sensegiving via an antenarrative, which is resisted by certain members of the jazz community because of his selective use of historical stories.</p>
<p>In summary, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711424320">Heble (2000</xref>: 8) is referring to the music when he argues that ‘one of the defining features of jazz has been its role as a progenitor of new forms, an inventor of new languages, a creator of new ways to express meaning’, our research suggests that this also applies to the stories off the bandstand. Attempts to selectively fix jazz stories in aspic, or to use them to retrogressively redefine the art-form, would deny their relationship to the creative freedom of the music – and the musicians. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711424320">Gabriel (2004</xref>: 30) so perceptively puts it: ‘Engaging with the story also means engaging with the storyteller, his or her motives, fantasies and desires.’</p>

<p>Of course, an alternative but potentially fruitful approach to research into the organizing processes in the jazz world could extend work on metaphor (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711424320">Cornellisen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711424320">Cornellisen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711424320">Lakoff and Johnson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726711424320">Morgan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726711424320">Oswick and Montgomery, 1999</xref>) to explore the use of metaphor by jazz musicians and their leaders.

<p>A famous Duke Ellington piece written in 1935 on the death of his mother – one of his first extended works.

<p>We use the term discourse here to mean a dynamic socially constructed representation of reality, as experienced by a particular social group (i.e. jazz musicians) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711424320">Cohen and Musson, 2000</xref>).
