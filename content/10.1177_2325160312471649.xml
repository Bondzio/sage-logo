<title>AADE Receives CDC Diabetes Prevention Grant</title>
<p>In September 2012, AADE received a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to expand availability of the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP). Funding from the grant is allowing AADE to provide support and resources for diabetes educators interested in delivering the National DPP lifestyle change program to persons with prediabetes.</p>
<p>“The exciting aspect of this project is that it highlights the leadership role that diabetes educators can play in diabetes prevention efforts,” said AADE Chief Science and Practice Officer Ruth Lipman, PhD.</p>
<p>AADE is partnering with diabetes education programs that will:</p>
<list id="list1-2325160312471649" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>receive lifestyle coach training,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>conduct outreach to and recruit eligible participants with prediabetes,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>follow the CDC’s Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) standards and operating procedures,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>apply for DPRP recognition,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>deliver the year-long evidence-based lifestyle change program in group settings,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>collect and report program outcomes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An overarching goal of this CDC initiative is to make the National DPP a covered benefit. Therefore, the selected AADE sites will not only be capable of delivering the lifestyle change program according to the DPRP standards, but will also be committed to working with AADE toward program sustainability. AADE and the selected programs will also work with businesses and insurers to develop financial support for the National DPP as a covered health benefit for employees and to establish reimbursement criteria that reward successful programs.</p>
<p>In the project’s first year, AADE is committed to establishing AADE sites in Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia. We hope that the success of using accredited diabetes self-management education programs to increase availability of the National DPP will lead to expanded use of our model in additional areas of the country.</p>
