<p>In <italic>Promoting Diversity and Social Justice: Educating People from Privileged Groups</italic>, Goodman offered a compelling argument suggesting that conversations addressing issues of social justice are often done with the intent to empower members of disadvantaged groups; however, in this book she proposes educating members of privileged groups as a way of challenging social injustices. Goodman draws from personal experiences, examples, and perspectives from personal interviews to help develop this 11-chapter book.</p>
<p>In chapter 1, Goodman identifies the levels of advantage and disadvantage resting within the various systems of oppression. In chapter 2, she presents characteristics of members of privileged groups and describes behaviors that center on entitlement, microaggression, and acceptance. Then, in chapter 3, Goodman teaches educators in a three-part sequence how to create an environment that supports social justice education. The sequence includes confirmation, contradiction, and continuity. When creating a learning environment, she uses models such as Hardiman and Jacksons’s five stages of development and Helms’s six stages of social identity development. In chapter 4, the author also presents unique ways in which individuals resist challenging the status quo and the rationale.</p>
<p>In chapter 5, Goodman advises educators not to take the resistance personal by ambushing the student. Instead, take an empathetic approach and “dance” with the opponent or student rather than struggling. Here, dance can be referred to as the personal and curricular strategies implemented to address resistance. As the pair continues to dance, in chapter 6, the educator incorporates a unique strategy that lures members of privileged groups into the throws of social justice by helping them recognize how they suffer as a result of social injustices. Chapter 7 reveals the psychological and material benefits of members of privileged groups releasing their privileged ways of knowing. Goodman presents the voices of members of privileged groups as a way to reflect on the “freeing, healing, and liberating” feelings that individuals experience once they let go of their old ways of knowing (p. 101).</p>
<p>Chapter 8 marks a period of transformation. By now some members (students) are ready to join the movement toward equality by responding through empathy, morals, or self interest. Paying close attention to self-interest, Goodman makes a case for how the concept can serve as a benefit to moving closer to equality. In chapter 9, members of privileged groups are ready to take action by transforming others and convincing them to become agents of change. The author presents the audience with strategies for recruitment. In chapter 10, members of both privileged and nonprivileged groups begin to work toward social justice and become allies to address issues of social justice. In the final chapter, Goodman teaches how to become an effective educator of social justice.</p>
<p>Early in the book, Goodman recognizes that she may be met with some objections as she highlights some systems of oppression in a schematic format. Therefore, she makes relevant the other systems of oppression that can exist. Also, throughout the book Goodman makes apparent how individuals can have membership in privileged and nonprivileged groups. Because of the dual membership, Goodman stresses the importance of knowing your audience.</p>
<p>Goodman makes a call to action and charges educators with becoming change agents by educating members of privileged groups through methods of formal and informal education. She suggests that educators meet members of privileged groups where they are in their particular perspective and throughout their development process in order for learning to take place. As a result, the book is developed in a sequential format that can be compared with stages of human development where the learning starts in an infantile state and as time progresses the learning strategies become suitable for a mature or more informed adult. Goodman points out that appropriate nurturing is needed along the way, which can be provided by the educator.</p>
<p>An initial glance at the title may distort the author’s intent. The portion of the title <italic>Educating People from Privileged Groups</italic> should be placed upfront to emphasize this atypical approach to social justice. To refer to the publication as simply a book is somewhat of a disservice, it is more so a guide for adult educators.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book be incorporated into adult education curricula for educating not just members of privileged groups but also nonprivileged groups. Since the field of adult education offers the flexibility of both formal and informal ways of learning, adult educators can answer the call by educating members of privileged groups through workplace education, postsecondary education, workshops, and through the various forms of community-based learning.</p>
