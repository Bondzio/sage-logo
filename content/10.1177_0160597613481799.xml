<abstract>
<p>This article focuses on the transnational diffusion of social movement ideas. How do social movements in one country or region of the world diffuse to another country or region? How do social movement participants learn about other movements and ideas in faraway countries and mobilize around these same ideas? What are the channels and mechanisms of diffusion? These are the research questions the article addresses. I draw on the theoretical literature on social movements and recent research on diffusion to explore these questions. The discussion is applied to two recent cases of diffusion: The diffusion of the Transition movement from the United Kingdom to the United States and the diffusion of the solidarity economy movement from Latin America, France, and Canada to the United States. I argue that a combination of relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion explain the spread of the transition and solidarity economy movements. The article contributes to the literature on social movements in two ways. First, it contributes to the recent efforts to better understand the process of diffusion of social movements and their ideas. Second, it provides an account of two very recent social movements that have not been fully studied and documented yet.</p>

<title>Personal Reflexive Statement</title>
<p>
<italic>I have long had an interest in (transnational) social movements, especially the global justice movement, and my dissertation research focused on explaining the political outcomes of transnational campaigns. In June 2010, I attended the U.S. Social Forum (USSF) in Detroit, Michigan, with a group of students from Illinois State University. I left Detroit inspired by the energy and passion of the grassroots activists, community organizers, and other individuals I met at the USSF and eager to delve deeper into some of the issues and ideas about which I learned at the USSF.</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>I attended a number of different workshops at the USSF—one of these workshops was an introduction to the concept of solidarity economy, and another focused on transition communities. The ideas, perspectives, and values of these two movements piqued my interest, and I started to learn a bit more about them. I began thinking about how these movements started in other countries and then diffused to the United States and about the larger question of how ideas travel. This article presents my research on this question.</italic>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social movement scholars have long recognized that social movements, their ideas, and their organizational, cultural, and tactical repertoires can spread transnationally. For example, one of the key insights about the origins of modern social movements is that their repertoires and forms of contention are cosmopolitan and modular, that is they are used in different structural and spatial contexts. This means that unlike traditional forms of contention that were very limited in scope to narrow issues and immediate grievances that were particular to certain localities, social structures, and groups of people, modern forms of contention were coordinated and sustained across localities, social actors, structural contexts, and issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597613481799">Tarrow 1998</xref>). This implies a process of diffusion within countries, but also between countries. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597613481799">Tarrow (1998</xref>:42) maintains in his discussion of the origins of modern social movements, “by the beginning of the nineteenth century, a new repertoire of contention was becoming internationally known and widely practiced”. However, we still know relatively little about exactly how social movements diffuse, as there has been little systematic research about diffusion processes. How do social movements in one country or region of the world diffuse to another country or region? How do social movement participants learn about other movements and ideas in faraway countries and mobilize around these same ideas? What are the channels and mechanisms of diffusion? These are the research questions the article addresses.</p>
<p>I draw on the theoretical literature on social movements and on recent research on diffusion to explore these questions. The discussion is applied to two recent cases of diffusion: The diffusion of the Transition movement from the United Kingdom to the United States and the diffusion of the solidarity economy movement from Latin America, France, and Canada to the United States.</p>

<title>The Diffusion of Social Movements and Their Ideas Transnationally: A Review of the Literature</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly (2001</xref>:68), I use the term diffusion here to refer to the “transfer in the same or similar shape of forms and claims of contention across space or across sectors and ideological divides”. While this definition encompasses instances of diffusion within as well as across countries, this article focuses specifically on cross-national diffusion. This definition also encompasses the transfer of both claims and forms of contention, which I interpret to include ideas, frames, and organizational forms. Diffusion entails the spread of information about a movement, but in the context of this article it goes beyond the spread of information and refers more specifically to the process by which social movement organizations act upon this information and adopt language, frames, ideas, and organizational forms that originated in other countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597613481799">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is evidence that diffusion processes were pivotal for the emergence of modern social movements. The emergence of broad-based modern social movements that straddle social and spatial divisions was possible from the eighteenth century onward in part because of two key trends. One was the expansion of literacy and the commercial print media. The other was the rise of new forms of association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0160597613481799">Tarrow 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>But even though social movement scholars have long recognized that social movements and their ideas and repertoires of contention can spread across countries, the systematic study of diffusion processes, their mechanisms, and the actors involved in them is relatively recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">McAdam and Rucht 1993</xref>). Studies of diffusion have begun to shed light on these aspects of diffusion, and this article draws on the recent conceptual tools and empirical findings of this research to identify the mechanisms by which the solidarity economy and Transition movements diffused to the United States from other parts of the world. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597613481799">Tarrow (2010</xref>:208) has noted, studying the mechanisms of diffusion is critical for establishing that the mobilization of the same social movements or other forms of political contention in different places is indeed the result of diffusion processes and not merely coincidental or indicative of independent reactions to the presence of the same or similar structural conditions, triggers, or grievances in different countries. In other words, if social movement scholars put forward the argument that the simultaneity of different social movement ideas in different countries can be explained in terms of diffusion, then it is very important to show how these ideas spread. Diffusion cannot be simply assumed, but it must be retraced to make diffusion arguments more compelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2010</xref>:204 and 208; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">McAdam and Rucht 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This focus on studying the mechanisms of diffusion is consistent with the trend in the social sciences to understand causation in terms of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597613481799">Gerring 2007</xref>). The mechanism “is the causal pathway, process or intermediate variable by which a causal factor of theoretical interest is thought to affect an outcome. Thus: X1→X2→Y, where X1 is the exogenous cause, X2 the pathway(s), and Y the outcome” (Gerring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597613481799">2007</xref>:163). More succinctly, a mechanism is “the pathway or process by which an effect is produced or a purpose is accomplished” (Gerring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597613481799">2007</xref>:178). Social movement theory has recently also emphasized an analysis of social movements that focuses on the dynamic aspects of contention, specifically on processes and mechanisms. According to McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly, social processes “consist of sequences and combinations of causal <italic>mechanisms</italic>. To explain contentious politics is to identify its recurrent causal mechanisms, the ways they combine, in what sequences they recur, and why different combinations and sequences, starting from different initial conditions, produce varying effects on the large scale.” Among the processes and mechanisms that the three leading social movement theorists study is “the diffusion of contention to new sites and actors” (McAdam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">2001</xref>:12-13). Following McAdam Tarrow, and Tilly, this article understands diffusion as a mechanism that unfolds through a number of other pathways that combine to bring about diffusion (McAdam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">2001</xref>). These pathways are relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion (see below).</p>
<sec id="section4-0160597613481799">
<title>Actors and Pathways of Diffusion Processes</title>
<p>The key actors in the diffusion process are the transmitter and the adopter,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0160597613481799">2</xref>
</sup> and these actors are linked by pathways or channels of diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">McAdam and Rucht 1993</xref>). Ideas, goods, information, and other items diffuse through these channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">McAdam and Rucht 1993</xref>:59). Following earlier research, McAdam and Rucht distinguish between two different models of diffusion, each of which focuses on a distinct diffusion channel. The relational model of diffusion identifies interpersonal contact and communication between transmitters and adopters as the main diffusion channel. The nonrelational model of diffusion emphasizes channels of information diffusion that do not depend on personal contact, such as the media. Nonrelational diffusion depends not only on the availability of information about the item that is diffused but also assumes potential adopters who identify with transmitters in some way, socially constructing similarity between themselves and the transmitters. Relational and nonrelational diffusion are sometimes referred to as direct and indirect diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597613481799">Soule 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this earlier research, McAdam and Rucht argue that in most cases of diffusion, some level of both relational diffusion and nonrelational diffusion will be present, and that both forms of diffusion will depend to some extent on the identification of adopters with transmitters, which involves a process of social construction or attribution of similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">McAdam and Rucht 1993</xref>:59-64; for an example of how relational and nonrelational diffusion can be present in the same diffusion process see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597613481799">Roggeband 2007</xref>). Roggeband has also argued that sometimes adopters actively seek a new idea or practice and argues that her “findings suggest a model of active ‘seekers’” as opposed to a “sender-receiver model” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597613481799">Roggeband 2007</xref>:255), which entails a greater initiative and a proactive role on the part of adopters.</p>
<p>Other scholars make similar arguments, even though they may not use the same terminology. For example, in a review of the literature on diffusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule (1998)</xref> imply that diffusion entails that potential adopters learn about a diffusing practice and observe it or its consequences, either directly or by hearing about it secondhand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:269). Strang and Soule also distinguish between external sources, which diffuse a practice, ideas, or information into a population, and internal sources, which diffuse these things within a population. External sources of diffusion include the mass media as well as change agents who diffuse certain movement ideas or repertoires through workshops and training sessions. Internal sources of diffusion include strong or weak social ties and face-to-face interaction as well as adopters’ perceptions of similarity to the transmitters in terms of their structural position and cultural identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:270-276). Finally, Strang and Soule also point to the importance of the cultural processes underlying diffusion. These include the process of making sense of certain diffusing items through framing, which assigns meaning to a diffusing practice, or theorizing, which interprets practices “in terms of general models and causal relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:276). Viewed this way, the term framing here refers to the collective action frames developed by social movement participants to give their mobilization effort and their cause meaning and to encourage and validate their actions and agendas (as opposed to media frames—see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597613481799">Boykoff and Laschever 2011</xref>). Cultural processes also include the extent to which the diffusing practice resonates with other norms and ideas, with more resonant items diffusing more rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:278-279).</p>
<p>More recently, Tarrow has identified three different pathways of diffusion: relational diffusion, nonrelational diffusion, and mediated diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2010</xref>). All of these pathways entail the “emulation of local forms of collective action in other places” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2005</xref>:102). Relational diffusion occurs through preexisting interpersonal channels and communication networks of people who share strong ties, trust, and a sense of identity. Nonrelational diffusion occurs through the media and the internet and involves individuals who have no social ties. In the absence of social ties, diffusion is possible because of a process of theorization, which refers to “a kind of “folk theory” that defines “some thing or activity in abstract terms and locates it within a cause-effect or functional scheme” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2005</xref>:104). As mentioned above, theorization has been likened to the concept of framing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597613481799">Soule 2004</xref>:304) because much like theorization, framing entails creating meanings and developing understandings and interpretations of specific issues and experiences that can help individuals make sense of them and act accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597613481799">Benford and Snow 2000</xref>:614). In other words, both framing and theorization “require that a complex set of ideas and policies or tactics are distilled into easily understandable (and modular) units that are more easily imported into a variety of different settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597613481799">Givan, Roberts, and Soule 2010</xref>:11). This is consistent with the conceptualization of framing in social movement research, which refers to “how social actors frame their claims, their opponents and their identities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">McAdam et al. 2001</xref>:16). Framing in this context “is not simply an expression of preexisting group claims but an active, creative, constitutive process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">McAdam et al. 2001</xref>:16) and is distinct from the concepts of media frames and media effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597613481799">Boykoff and Laschever 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Mediated diffusion occurs through the activities and efforts of movement brokers, actors who have ties to both transmitters and adopters and connect these otherwise unconnected activists and thereby diffuse ideas and information. Brokers can be individuals or organizations that serve as “movement halfway houses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0160597613481799">Tarrow 2005</xref>). As Givan, Roberts and Soule have argued, mediated diffusion is an especially important pathway of diffusion at this time of accelerated globalization as transnational advocacy networks have created transnational crosscutting connections between social struggles, local and national organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597613481799">Givan et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that although these pathways are conceptually distinct from one another, they sometimes overlap empirically. For example, relational or nonrelational diffusion can overlap with mediated diffusion if the adopter in one of the first two diffusion processes becomes a broker who connects the transmitter and its ideas to other potential adopters. As I show below, this has occurred in both of the cases I study in this article.</p>
<p>All three mechanisms of diffusion, relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion are consistent with the three categories of mechanisms that McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly identify for social movements and other forms of contentious politics: environmental, cognitive, and relational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">McAdam et al. 2001</xref>: 25-26; for environmental and cognitive variables see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597613481799">Guenther 2008</xref>); the latter two of these three mechanisms are particularly relevant here. Environmental mechanisms are broader trends that shape the context in which social movements mobilize. Cognitive mechanisms pertain to the perceptions (understandings, interpretations) of individuals and groups and the changes of those perceptions prior to and during collective action. Relational mechanisms is a term used to refer to changes in the connections and ties between individuals and groups—brokerage is a mechanism that falls under the category of relational mechanisms (which is not to be confused with relational diffusion).</p>

<sec id="section5-0160597613481799">
<title>The Role of Agency in the Diffusion Process</title>
<p>In regard to mediated diffusion, we do not know much about the brokers whose role is so important as the diffusion literature does not profile movement brokers. Who are they, and why are they in a good position to help diffuse social movements and their ideas transnationally? These questions are about agency in the diffusion process, and they are questions that remain somewhat understudied, although there have been a few attempts to address the role of agency in the diffusion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0160597613481799">Soule 2004</xref>). These questions are important because in the case of <italic>transnational</italic> diffusion, identifying the paths of diffusion of ideas requires that we address their complexity. More specifically, it is important to understand the processes of communication and exchange that take place between social movement organizations and activists who mobilize in very different settings. Similarly, it is important to study the ways ideas are interpreted, translated into, and adapted to new and different settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597613481799">Roggeband 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To explore these questions further and expand the discussion of mediated diffusion, I draw on the work of Sally Merry and her coauthors, whose research has focused on the question of how international human rights norms and ideas are adopted, adapted, and implemented in local social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160597613481799">Levitt and Merry 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597613481799">Merry 2006</xref>). Merry and Levitt explain that human rights ideas are localized through a process of vernacularization that interprets global norms in ways that make them resonate with local ideas and social norms while at the same time preserving their potential as transformative ideas that can bring about social change. The key actors in this process are described by Merry and Levitt as translators, social movement activists, NGO staff, or other individuals who are connected to both local and global sites of activism and well versed in global and local discourses and norms and can diffuse and translate global norms in local contexts because they “have one foot in the transnational community and one at home” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0160597613481799">Merry 2006</xref>:42). I argue that the social movement brokers Tarrow identifies as the central actors in the process of mediated diffusion can often be seen as translators who bestride local and global activist communities and have both local and global ties and are therefore in a good position to be movement brokers.</p>
<p>In addition, I draw on Snow and Benford’s (1999) discussion of agency and of different types of diffusion processes that differ in terms of the agency of transmitters and adopters. Snow and Benford distinguish between three main types of diffusion: (a) reciprocation, which is a “process in which the transmitters and adopters are interested in the object of diffusion and thus are actively involved in the process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597613481799">Snow and Benford 1999</xref>:26); (b) adaptation, which is a process in which the adopter is the active agent and strategically and purposefully adapts the diffusing item to its local setting or culture; and (c) accommodation, which is a process in which the transmitter is the active agent and adapts the diffusing item to the culture or context to which it seeks to diffuse it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0160597613481799">Snow and Benford 1999</xref>). As I show below, the two cases discussed here are characterized by a combination of reciprocity, the active engagement of transmitters and adopters in efforts to diffuse an idea or practice, and adaptation, the efforts of pro-active adopters to learn about and adapt an idea or practice in their local settings. Both of these processes involve active adopters and are consistent with the “seekers” model mentioned above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0160597613481799">
<title>The SPR Model of Organization and its Relevance for Diffusion Processes</title>
<p>Diffusion, especially nonrelational and mediated forms of diffusion, seems more likely to occur in cases of social movements that are segmentary, polycentric, and reticulate (SPR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597613481799">Gerlach 1999</xref>). Segmentary movements are movements that encompass diverse groups that evolve and change, expand and decline, and merge or divide over time. Polycentric movements have no permanent and central leadership structure or designated individual leaders. Rather, leadership is transient and changing. Reticulate movements are diverse and have no hierarchical leadership structure. Groups within these movements are integrated in networks in which they exchange information and ideas—these networks are based on shared identities and common opponents. The linkages that make this kind of integration possible are similar to the linkages that relational, nonrelational, and mediated forms of diffusion create (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597613481799">Gerlach 1999</xref>:90-91). They include personal relationships, traveling members of the movement who spread its ideas and forge new ties and connections, events like workshops and conferences that can spread movement ideas and help participants connect with others, and media and communication technologies that facilitate coordination and information exchange, allowing groups and individuals to expand their connections with one another. While Gerlach does not speak of diffusion specifically, his ideas and arguments echo the diffusion literature reviewed above. I argue here that an SPR form of organization, which as I show below is characteristic of both the solidarity economy movement and the Transition movement, is conducive to diffusion because of the absence of centralized bureaucratic structures.</p>
<p>Finally, before turning to the case studies, it is important to address two additional questions pertaining to diffusion:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0160597613481799">3</xref>
</sup> First, under what conditions is diffusion more likely to occur? Second, how do we know that diffusion has occurred? In other words, how do we know that the adoption of language, ideas, frames, or organizational forms in one context is the result of diffusion from another context? These two questions are discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0160597613481799">
<title>Conditions Facilitating Diffusion</title>
<p>The diffusion literature gives us some insights into the conditions that can facilitate the diffusion process. Previous research on diffusion suggests that preexisting social structures and internal organization are very important for diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597613481799">Morris 1981</xref>). As noted above, the literature also suggests that diffusion can depend on the construction of similarity between adopters and transmitters. Construction of similarity can occur through collective action frames that define the central cause and goals of the movement and the identity of its participants in ways that make it possible for adopters to identify with the transmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0160597613481799">McAdam et al. 2001</xref>). Arguments showing diffusion among actors with cultural affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:275-276) suggest that cultural variables can facilitate the process of construction of similarity. In addition, social movement scholars have argued that structurally equivalent actors can tend to emulate each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">Strang and Soule 1998</xref>:274) and that structural or institutional equivalence can facilitate the construction of similarity. Structural or institutional equivalence implies, for example, that “labor unions tend to regard their counterparts in other countries as potential models for their own actions” and that “more heterogeneous populations such as college students, environmentalists, or feminists may come to regard their counterparts in other countries as salient reference groups” (McAdam and Rucht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597613481799">1993</xref>:64). Perceptions of structural equivalence depend on a number of different variables, including demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as culture, values, beliefs, and identity (Wejnert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160597613481799">2002</xref>; see also Strang and Soule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0160597613481799">1998</xref>). In addition to these variables, other factors both internal and external to social movements have been found to facilitate or hinder diffusion. Internal variables include the level of cohesion within the movement to which an idea or practice diffuses, and the presence within a movement of “credible articulators,” individual champions of the diffusing idea who enjoy credibility and are respected. External variables include the general political climate of the locale to which an idea diffuses and the responsiveness of public officials to the claims of a social movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597613481799">Guenther 2008</xref>). Other external or environmental factors that affect diffusion include political conditions and the level of compatibility of a diffusing idea or practice with the adopter’s culture. Finally, variables pertaining to the characteristics of the diffusing idea or practice and to the transmitters can impact the diffusion process, although this article does not focus on these two categories of variables (for an overview, see Wejnert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0160597613481799">2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Finding Empirical Evidence for Diffusion Processes</title>
<p>Attributing the adoption of ideas, frames, or other features of social movements originating in one part of the world by social movements in another part of the world to diffusion is, of course, key to any argument that focuses on diffusion. I follow other studies of diffusion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597613481799">Guenther 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597613481799">Morris 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597613481799">Roggeband 2007</xref>) in using data collected from interviews with movement participants who have been involved in the very early stages of movement building. Their experiences, perspectives, and insights about how the Transition movement and the solidarity economy movement began in the United States have been invaluable in this research, and as detailed below, have helped me identify and describe the dynamics and mechanisms of diffusion. In addition to the interview data, publications authored by social movement participants and/or sources published by civil society or social movement organizations have been an important source of data pertaining to diffusion and relevant to the theoretical questions addressed here. Other students of social movements have used these kinds of publications and reports to study diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597613481799">Guenther 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0160597613481799">Morris 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0160597613481799">Roggeband 2007</xref>).

<title>Method</title>
<p>Much of the information included in this article about the two cases I study was gathered in interviews with some of the individuals who are most involved in the two movements. Many of the individuals I interviewed have also been active in these nascent movements since the early stages of movement building. Their experiences and the information they provided about the processes through which these two movements diffused to the United States are the empirical focus of this article. The phone interviews listed in the references section below were not recorded. I took detailed notes during each interview, and I include excerpts from my interview notes throughout the case studies. Interviewees are referred to in the third person in my notes. My notes very much represent the voices of the interviewees, and even though they are not word for word quotes, the key words in my notes are the interviewees’ words. I refer to all interviewees using pseudonyms throughout the article.</p>
<p>Interviewees were identified via the website of the U.S. Solidarity Economy Network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.populareconomics.org/ussen/">http://www.populareconomics.org/ussen/</ext-link>) and the website of Transition US (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://transitionus.org/">http://transitionus.org/</ext-link>). Each organization’s website contains contact information for the organization as well as listings of its staff members and/or key volunteers. In addition, some of the publications and campaign materials developed by each organization are authored by individuals whose contact information is often publicly available online. The initial interviews helped me identify additional organizations and individuals involved in the two movements.</p>
<p>I asked respondents to answer a series of questions about how the two movements and their ideas have spread and diffused to and within the United States. These questions were derived from the theoretical literature reviewed above, and the responses I received allowed me to develop the account of diffusion that I present in the case studies, finding evidence for relational, nonrelational and mediated diffusion, as well as providing fresh perspectives on the role of agency, active seekers, and translators in the diffusion process. The interviews were semistructured—I asked the questions that were on the list I had prepared, but I also followed up on answers or comments made by the respondents that were interesting or relevant to the topic of this study. The phone interviews were on average about 45 minutes in duration, and each respondent listed in the interview list was interviewed once.</p>
<p>In addition to the interview data, I used publications authored by individuals affiliated with the two movements I study, campaign publications, and websites. Solidarity economy workshop reports and workshop handouts from the 2007 U.S. Social Forum, which are included in the book <italic>Solidarity Economy: Building Alternative for People and Planet</italic>, have also been immensely helpful for my research on the Solidarity Economy Network. All of these sources helped round out the data obtained in interviews and were invaluable for this research as they contained a lot of information that is directly relevant to the topic of this article and to the theoretical formulations reviewed above. Together with the interviews they provide data that allow me to explore the research questions discussed above and to provide a theoretically informed account of the diffusion of the Transition movement and the solidarity economy movement to the United States.</p>

<title>Overview of the Solidarity Economy Framework</title>
<p>The solidarity economy is a term used to refer to an alternative economic model and framework based on a number of values and principles, including mutualism and cooperation, equity, social welfare, social and economic democracy, pluralism and diversity, and sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597613481799">Miller 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0160597613481799">4</xref>
</sup> Individuals and groups espousing this framework see it as an economic framework that is transformative of the prevailing economic values and institutions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0160597613481799">5</xref>
</sup> Beyond a commitment to the values underlying this framework, the concept of solidarity economy is still only minimally defined and is still fluid and open-ended. The limited available literature on this framework sometimes defines the concept by naming various economic arrangements and initiatives that are anchored in the values identified above. These include, but are not limited to, fair trade; local exchange systems and community currencies; community supported agriculture (CSA); worker, consumer, housing, and other types of cooperatives; and community development credit unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597613481799">Miller 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0160597613481799">6</xref>
</sup> Many of these initiatives predate the use of the term solidarity economy and the mobilization of a solidarity economy movement, and many do not use the term solidarity economy to describe their work today, but they all share, embody, and are motivated by the values underlying the framework of solidarity economy. Individuals, groups, and communities involved in these initiatives and arrangements continue to define and develop the concept by developing transformative economic initiatives that put in practice the values mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597613481799">Miller 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0160597613481799">7</xref>
</sup> The term solidarity economy describes not a blueprint for an alternative economy, but a diversity of initiatives and arrangements that are all informed by the same set of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0160597613481799">Miller 2010</xref>). This is consistent with the SPR model of organization reviewed above.</p>

<sec id="section13-0160597613481799">
<title>History of the Solidarity Economy Network</title>
<p>The U.S. Solidarity Economy Network (SEN) was formed following a series of meetings held at the first U.S. Social Forum (USSF) in the summer of 2007 with the support of other actors in the global solidarity economy movement. Housed at the Center for Popular Economics (CPE) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, SEN was founded to build a solidarity economy movement and strengthen solidarity economy initiatives in the United States by fostering coordination and collaboration, facilitating communication, developing best practices, creating a sense of common purpose among the groups involved in these initiatives, among other activities. In pursuing these goals, SEN follows the example of active and successful solidarity economy networks in other countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0160597613481799">8</xref>
</sup> Other goals that SEN pursues include connecting the U.S. solidarity economy movement with the global movement, creating a joint vision that can guide the work of solidarity economy initiatives in the United States, generating resources to promote the solidarity economy, and facilitating research to generate knowledge that can support movement building and the solidarity economy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0160597613481799">9</xref>
</sup> SEN is led by a board on which a variety of organizations are represented, and its work is organized into four working groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0160597613481799">10</xref>
</sup> The network structure of SEN and the absence of organizational hierarchy are also indicative of the SPR model of organization.</p>
<p>It is clear that the emergence of a solidarity economy movement in the United States and the founding of SEN reflect a process of diffusion. As mentioned above, SEN is modeled on the example of other solidarity economy networks, and one of its goals is to integrate the U.S.-based movement with the global solidarity economy movement. As two individuals active in the movement explain, “the spread of the solidarity economy framework is closely connected to the Social Forum movement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>:3), and the term “may not have spread without the aid of truly global networking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>:4), which implies that diffusion was important for the growth of the solidarity economy movement. In addition, given that the solidarity economy movement and the Social Forum movement emerged relatively late in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>:7), diffusion likely played a role in the emergence of both of these movements in the United States. The evidence I present below supports this view.</p>
<p>How did the movement start in the United States? There are a number of different answers to this question.</p>
<p>Heather, who is affiliated with the CPE and SEN, had become involved with social economy work around the year 2000 while working in Northern Ireland (Interview #4). When she returned to the United States and joined CPE, whose mission is to “provide progressive economic analysis to activists and educators who are organizing for social change,”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0160597613481799">11</xref>
</sup> she was part of a strategic planning process. This process was designed to find ways for the CPE to explore alternatives to the current economic system:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Heather was working in Northern Ireland when she became involved in the social economy around 2000. When she returned to the U.S. she [joined] the Center for Popular Economics in 2004. In 2004, as part of a strategic planning process at the Center for Popular Economics there was a desire to emphasize alternatives to the current economic system… . During that process Heather and the Center for Popular Economics learned that the solidarity economy is really transformative. In 2005 Heather started hearing about plans for the U.S. Social Forum in Atlanta and became involved in planning for the USSF. (Interview #4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>During that early stage, the CPE sought to connect with individuals and groups in the United States and abroad. One of the first individuals Heather contacted was Dan Swinney of the Center for Labor and Community Research (Interview #4). Swinney was involved with the North American Network for the Solidarity Economy (NANSE), and he connected Heather and the CPE to solidarity economy groups in Canada. One of these groups, Groupe d'économie solidaire du Québec (GESQ), had an international focus and North-South connections. GESQ was also involved in the formation of RIPESS (International Network for the Promotion of the Social Solidarity Economy), which helped connect the CPE to the global solidarity economy network (Interview #4). Representatives from Canadian organizations later attended the USSF as did individuals from Latin America. CPE also reached out to other individuals and groups, including the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives, Julie Matthaie, and Ethan Miller. Matthaie had been writing on economic alternatives and Miller had been writing on the solidarity economy (Interview #4). Some members of the Solidarity Economy Working Group, which was established to organize a solidarity economy track at the first USSF, had attended other Social Forums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597613481799">Allard and Matthaei 2008</xref>:8), and had thus been exposed to the ideas and work of the global solidarity economy movement.</p>
<p>At the solidarity economy caucus meetings and workshops held at the 2007 USSF, where SEN was launched, a number of individuals active in solidarity economy movements in different countries were in attendance and addressed the meetings and workshops to share their perspectives and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597613481799">Allard 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597613481799">Cote, Neamtan, and Villareal 2008</xref>), which points to a process of reciprocation. Also, one of the handouts that were provided to caucus members sketches proposals and ideas for solidarity economy movement building in the United States and makes references to solidarity economy networks in other countries. It also states that creating a network in the United States would support movement building and help the U.S.-based movement join and learn from the global movement. This indicates that networking and learning, which entail some level of diffusion, were explicit objectives of movement building and the formation of SEN in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0160597613481799">Solidarity Economy Working Group for USSF 2007, 2008</xref>:397). It also denotes a sense of structural equivalence on the part of those who actively sought inspiration and models of organization from like-minded groups in other countries and regions.</p>
<p>Apart from the initiative of the CPE and the Social Forum process, there is evidence that suggests that connections with solidarity economy groups abroad were/are actively sought and valued and that relational diffusion is critical and is perceived by activists to be so. For example, the Center for Labor and Community Research, which was grappling with the consequences and ramifications of deindustrialization in Chicago, sought inspiration from Mondragon, a large worker cooperative in Spain, to find new approaches for addressing local problems whose solutions were not obvious (Interview #1):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The Center for Labor and Community Research was addressing economic problems in the U.S. These problems had to be addressed and solved, but the answers were not obvious, so activists started searching far and wide and looking to other countries for solutions and inspiration. (Interview #1)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another individual involved in solidarity economy work in the United States, Jennifer, was first introduced to the framework of solidarity economy while on a graduate school trip to Chile. She brought some of the ideas to which she was exposed back to the United States:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Jennifer visited Chile, where there are lots of solidarity economy initiatives by/for former victims of torture and authoritarianism. Jennifer was in graduate school in social work in a program that had a strong focus on human rights. One of the trips offered in the program was to Chile to meet with people who organized during/after the dictatorship. In Chile Jennifer met with people who were finding new solutions and she brought back their ideas. (Interview #2)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>She hopes to travel to Italy, where there is a tradition of industrial and agricultural coops. She also hopes to learn more about cooperatively run social services, in particular in Northern Italy (Interview #2). A third person, Amy of Rural Coalition, had international connections and was invited by a Rural Coalition board member, who had worked in Mexico, to attend the second World Social Forum (WSF), where she was one of the first individuals from the United States to serve on a panel on the solidarity economy (Interview #3). A fourth individual, Melissa, an academic, had worked with colleagues in Canada to research the social economy (Interview #5). A fifth interviewee, David, had been an alter-globalization activist and was doing research about alternative economic models when he traveled to Brazil in 2002 to attend the World Social Forum:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In the post-Seattle [David is referring to the protests against the WTO in Seattle in 1999] years, between 1999 and 2001, David was doing a lot of anti-globalization work in Maine, including teach-ins… . During the teach-ins someone would always ask: “What are the alternatives to economic liberalism?” People understood the problems with the current system, but were asking about alternatives. David therefore started doing research about alternatives to both capitalism and state-controlled economies—by capitalism David is referring to economic relationships that he feels are not democratic… . In 2002 David attended the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in Brazil with a group of activists from Maine. He attended workshops in the solidarity economy track, and suddenly there was another framework and language to think about economic alternatives. (Interview #8)</p>
<p>Also, there was a solidarity economy market, and worker-controlled enterprises were selling products they made… . David also visited an MST (Landless Workers’ Movement) community. David, therefore, did not only hear people talk about the solidarity economy, he experienced it. (Interview #8)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Back home, David continued learning about the solidarity economy by reading materials in Spanish and Portuguese as there was little to no literature available in English about the solidarity economy. He eventually began to write about the solidarity economy himself, which helped connect him to other individuals who were doing solidarity economy work or were getting interested in that framework (Interview #8).</p>
<p>One of those individuals was Michelle, another person interviewed for this study. Michelle had been studying economic alternatives and first learned about the solidarity economy framework at a WSF. She later read an article by David about the solidarity economy and contacted him and began working with him and others to plan the solidarity economy track at the 2007 USSF. Unlike other individuals involved in the solidarity economy movement, Michelle was not trying to address specific local problems that required new approaches. She is an academic studying alternative economic models, and learning about the solidarity economy prompted her to shift her thinking and academic work away from a quest to find a new transformative model and toward understanding the plethora of transformative institutions and practices that are already available and that are subsumed under the framework of solidarity economy (Interview #11). But like other interviewees, the solidarity economy framework helped her approach issues with which she was grappling from a fresh perspective –these issues were intellectual in nature.</p>
<p>The examples above support the “seeker” model and the view that adopters are proactive in acquiring information and learning from the experiences of transmitters. This, in turn, suggests that the activists seeking transnational connections and examples on which to model their work were motivated by a sense of structural equivalence, which is a sense that they share with the social movement participants with whom they sought to connect a similar set of values, beliefs, and identities:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Activists went to Quebec, Canada, and to other countries—10-12 people who had been to international conferences then got together and formed a committee to plan for the 2007 U.S. Social Forum. Eighty workshops plus meetings were organized at the USSF in Atlanta and the US Solidarity Economy Network was established. People from Quebec, Peru, and Mexico came to Atlanta. There was cross-fertilization from international meetings. The movement is much stronger in Latin America and Quebec—the U.S. is a latecomer. (Interview #1)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The examples above also support both the nonrelational and relational model of diffusion. While nonrelational diffusion makes activists initially aware of initiatives in other countries, relational diffusion makes possible the in-depth exchange of ideas, information, and experiences. Or, if activists become first aware of the solidarity economy network in meetings or workshops, as David did at the World Social Forum, nonrelational forms of diffusion, including intensive reading, can also help activists gain a deeper understanding of the solidarity economy. In other words, for many of the individuals I interviewed, their thinking about economic alternatives and about the solidarity economy framework in particular was shaped by relational and nonrelational forms of diffusion.</p>
<p>There is also substantial evidence for mediated diffusion, which is another indication that the pathways of diffusion overlap. In some ways, the members of the Working Group who helped plan the solidarity economy track at the first USSF in Atlanta in 2007, many of whom had attended international meetings and the WSF, can be seen both as adopter-activists and as change agents and movement brokers who connect transmitters and their ideas and experiences to potential adopters through education and outreach activities, such as workshops and trainings. The CPE and SEN, along with its member organizations, are also brokers and translators who diffuse certain movement ideas or repertoires through workshops and training sessions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0160597613481799">12</xref>
</sup> This demonstrates that the different pathways of diffusion can overlap.</p>
<p>Since 2008, solidarity economy presentations and workshops have been held in different places and for different audiences, and the CPE has incorporated the solidarity economy framework into all of its workshops, even those that do not focus mainly on the solidarity economy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0160597613481799">13</xref>
</sup> In addition, SEN has participated in the Left Forum, an annual conference for activists and academics at Pace University in New York City. SEN members have also reached out to the Occupy Wall Street movement (Interview #1; Interview #2; Interview #4; Interview #5). They have produced short papers for this movement’s participants and held workshops in different cities, including Boston and New York to help protestors translate their opposition to the economic system that is currently in place into a viable alternative (Interview #4; Interview #5):<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0160597613481799">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>SEN did some outreach to Occupy movement—the occupy movement is a big boost for the solidarity economy movement. (Interview #1)</p>
<p>Protestors of the Occupy Wall Street movement know what they do not want—but what do they want? Solidarity economy workshops were requested and offered … in NYC, … in Boston, and … in Pittsburgh to identify a path for a more just economy. (Interview #2)</p>
<p>Workshops were held at Occupy movements all over the country including NYC, Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. The Occupy movement knows what it is against and what is wrong with the current system, but what is it for? That is where the solidarity economy framework is helpful. (Interview #5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All of these examples support a view of individuals and organizations affiliated with SEN as movement brokers or change agents and “movement halfway houses” that help introduce global ideas and innovative economic models into the national and local debate. This is especially true for the CPE and the Highlander Center, whose missions have a strong education focus. (Interview #4)</p>
<p>In addition to being movement brokers, SEN and its members are translators. There is a need for translating the solidarity economy framework on a number of different levels. The framework needs to be made relevant to different audiences, which is an ongoing process and challenge (Interview #4):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>SEN is trying to make the solidarity economy relevant—you have to frame it and use vocabulary relevant to different sectors, different social movements, different communities (racial groups, poor communities, credit unions, coops). (Interview #4)</p>
<p>There is a need for public education. Translating on all levels is needed: translating to the broad public, to specific sectors, to other social movements. (Interview #4)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are also some cultural barriers that make the reinvention of the solidarity economy framework challenging in the U.S. context (Interview #8). But the main point here is that SEN members are in a particularly good position to do the translation work that is needed to make the solidarity economy framework relevant to the unique circumstances of different communities. They are well connected to solidarity economy activists abroad and embedded in transnational networks, but at the same time they are very knowledgeable about the idiosyncratic needs that their communities have and the particular problems and challenges that they face. The work of the Center for Labor and Community Research and the Jersey Shore Neighborhood Cooperative are good examples of how ideas and models that inspired and informed local solidarity economy work are adapted to local settings and applied to specific local issues.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that while some translation and adaptation are necessary to make the solidarity economy framework relevant in different places, the problems and struggles in different countries and communities also have similarities that make it possible for the framework to diffuse and have relevance transnationally. One interviewee described that during the interview as my notes demonstrate:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When IMF policies tore away safety nets in Latin America, people turned to each other, and coops and solidarity economy initiatives were launched. The idea came from below as a response to structural adjustment programs. In the U.S. the context for the emergence of solidarity economy was deindustrialization and plant closings. This was the area of interest of the Center for Labor and Community Research, but at the 2007 USSF in Atlanta there was more diversity (intentional communities, alternative currencies). Since 2008 the financial crisis, breaking up unions, spending cuts, … etc. made the situation in U.S. similar to that in other countries. (Interview #1)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Another interviewee, Melissa, pointed out that even though there are distinct struggles in different places, struggles are in some ways very similar (Interview #5). For example, unlike countries in Latin America, the United States was not affected by the structural adjustment programs that helped inspire the solidarity economy movement in Latin America. Nevertheless, there is the same need for alternative economic development in the United States (Interview #5). This interviewee mentioned a number of examples of the problems facing communities in the United States that require a solidarity economy response, such as deindustrialization. She noted that the neoliberal economy creates similar problems in different places and indicated that what holds the global solidarity economy movement together is the search for alternatives:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The neoliberal economy was creating similar problems in different places. What holds the global movement together is the quest to find alternatives and a set of principles that include: dignity, non-exploitative and non-hierarchical work, local economy, and sustainability. (Interview #5)</p>
<p>The commonality that all groups share is their common enemy, a system run by corporate and financial capitalism. (Interview #5)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to her, the big issue for the solidarity economy movement is the question of what kind of economic relations provide jobs, dignity and nonexploitative and nonhierarchical work (Interview #5).</p>
<p>Similarly, David noted that the same ideology underlying structural adjustment programs is present in the United States and results, for example, in the elimination of social services (Interview #8). In comparing solidarity economy initiatives in the United States to those in Latin America, where such initiatives have been in place longer, he said that there are many differences, but also similarities between the United States and Latin American countries:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is clear to David and the solidarity economy movement in the U.S. that the contexts are different. The U.S. does not mimic the solidarity economy in Brazil and Latin America. It is clear to people that the solidarity economy has to be reinvented in the U.S. (Interview #8)</p>
<p>The same ideology that generates structural adjustment programs is present in the U.S. even though there are no IMF-imposed structural adjustment programs. The effects are playing out differently, but solidarity economy in the U.S. is also geared to communities that are left behind by economic neoliberalism. (Interview #8)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In other words, what unites the global solidarity economy movement is both the opposition to neoliberal capitalism and the recognition that there are alternative practices and institutions already in place that can bring about change (Interview #11). According to Michelle, two things unite the global movement:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the recognition that neoliberal capitalism is not the way forward, and the recognition that there are already many different alternatives that are transformative. (Interview #11)</p>

<p>This indicates that the concept of theorization is an important dimension of nonrelational diffusion could be applicable to the solidarity economy movement. Despite significant differences between the United States and other parts of the world, there is a shared analysis of the economic system among solidarity economy advocates, and one could argue that this facilitates the social construction of similarity between transmitter-activists and adopter-activists as all countries are affected in similar ways by the same global economic system.</p>
<p>In sum, the diffusion of the framework of the solidarity economy and the solidarity economy movement in the United States are the result of relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion. I find evidence that all three channels of diffusion have been important in some way for the diffusion of this movement to the United States. I also find significant evidence supporting the view that adopters and brokers or change agents are active seekers (as opposed to receivers) who are very interested in connecting with like-minded groups internationally from whom they can learn and whose experiences can inform solidarity economy initiatives at home. Similarly, I find evidence of reciprocation as transmitters have worked with U.S. adopters to help them diffuse the framework of solidarity economy. Finally, the brokers and change agents are also often translators. They are often individuals who pursue and maintain international connections and are very involved in global networks. At the same time they focus their work on domestic and local issues and bring the ideas, lessons, and experiences of like-minded activists abroad back home and engage in a process of translation to make ideas, models, and practices from abroad relevant for and practicable in local settings.</p>

<title>Overview of the Transition Movement</title>
<p>Transition US is part of a global Transition movement seeking to help communities adapt to and mitigate critical economic and environmental challenges, namely, peak oil, climate change, and the economic crisis. Communities that develop transition initiatives develop local grassroots efforts and action that increase community resilience and adaptability to these three crises that have coincided to create new challenges for communities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0160597613481799">15</xref>
</sup> Transition initiatives can address a plethora of issues connected to the three crises, including food, energy, housing, and transportation. The overall goal is to mitigate the impact of the three crises and to create resilient, cooperative, and equitable communities and increase well-being at the community level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0160597613481799">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Transition movement is the brainchild of an educator, Rob Hopkins, who after first developing an Energy Descent Action Plan with his students in Ireland moved back to the United Kingdom and started Transition Town Totnes in early 2006, an initiative that served as a model for other communities. In late 2006, the Transition Network was founded in the United Kingdom to help grow the international Transition movement and to connect and provide support and training to transition communities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0160597613481799">17</xref>
</sup> As of October 2011, there were 103 official transition initiatives in 31 different states in the United States, and 397 official initiatives worldwide.<sup>

<title>History of Transition US</title>
<p>Transition US describes itself as a “resource and catalyst for building resilient communities across the United States that are able to withstand severe energy, climate or economic shocks while creating a better quality of life in the process.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0160597613481799">19</xref>
</sup> Transition US was started in 2007 to provide coordination and support to transition initiatives in the United States in partnership with the Transition Network. Transition US provides trainings, facilitates networking and communication, and serves as a catalyst for the U.S. Transition movement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0160597613481799">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Transition US describes its work and activities in terms of four categories: awareness raising, transition initiative and leader support, transition training, and capacity building.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0160597613481799">21</xref>
</sup> Awareness raising encompasses a variety of activities, including developing a website that can serve as a resource for those who visit it, producing a newsletter, and increasing the number of media stories and reports about Transition US and the Transition movement more generally. Support for developing or new local transition initiatives includes helping them network with other initiatives, trainers, and mentors, and providing support and information in meetings and by phone and e-mail. Transition training is one of the cornerstones of the activities of Transition US. Transition US develops training programs and materials and facilitates on-site 2-day training events as well as virtual training events, such as webinars. Finally, capacity building encompasses a variety of activities, including fund-raising. These main areas of activity combined with the nonhierarchical network structure of the Transition movement are key features of the SPR model of organization.</p>
<p>The precursor to the Transition movement in the United States is the Relocalization Network, an initiative of the Post Carbon Institute that spanned the years 2003 to 2009 and at one point involved 200 local groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0160597613481799">22</xref>
</sup> Around the time that the Transition movement was launched in the United Kingdom, the Relocalization Network in the United States was declining (Interview #7; Interview #9). Part of the reason for its decline was the lack of a model (Interview #7; Interview #10)—the individuals involved in doing relocalization work were passionate but did not have a method or a model (Interview #9). Individuals involved with the Relocalization Network in the United States began to pay attention to the Transition movement in the United Kingdom because it had the method that the Relocalization movement was lacking (Interview #9):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>James was living in Colorado and completing an internship with a group working on relocalization issues, the Post-Carbon Relocalization Network. This network was in decline because there was no model to follow, and that is why individuals associated with it began to get interested in the transition model. (Interview #7)</p>
<p>It was clear to people involved with the Relocalization movement that something different, important, and interesting was happening with Transition. (Interview #9)</p>
<p>The Relocalization Network had a similar goal … but there was no particular model or means to make relocalization happen. When the transition model emerged, it provided the means and model. (Interview #10)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the important resources available to those involved in relocalization initiatives was the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic>, which was authored by Rob Hopkins, the founder of the Transition movement (Interview #7). In addition, several individuals traveled to the United Kingdom to learn more about the Transition movement there (Interview #7; Interview #9; Interview #10). For example, in 2008 Robert, who at the time was involved in relocalization work in Boulder County, Colorado, traveled to the United Kingdom, where he met with Rob Hopkins and attended a two-day transition training; later, Transition Colorado (a statewide transition hub for Colorado) became the first recognized transition initiative in the United States. A number of other individuals also traveled to the United Kingdom for the same purpose of learning about transition initiatives (Interview #9). One of them was Angela, who is now affiliated with Transition US. Robert himself was later also involved in the effort to create Transition US. When Transition US was formed, it assumed the Post Carbon Institute’s field operations, and the Post Carbon Institute provided funding for Transition US. The Post Carbon Institute then became a think tank and Transition US focused on doing grassroots work (Interview #7; Interview #9).</p>
<p>Transition US adopted an organizational structure modeled on the structure of the Transition Network,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0160597613481799">23</xref>
</sup> which demonstrates that the diffusion of the Transition movement to the United States encompassed the diffusion of both ideas and organizational forms. The examples mentioned above also support the “seeker” model of proactive engagement by adopters in the diffusion process. Seeking ties and inspiration from like-minded individuals and groups points to a sense of structural equivalence and a process of construction of similarity. Finally, these examples also illustrate the overlap of different pathways of diffusion as those individuals who initially were adopter activists in a relational or nonrelational diffusion process can also be seen as brokers in their work to establish Transition US (more on this below).</p>
<p>Much like the individuals described above, other transition activists also initially found out about the transition model first through Internet searches (Interview #10), or through the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic> (Interview #9) or through other media. For example, one interviewee, Christopher of Transition Houston (Interview #6), initially found out about the Transition movement through a blog he followed and later purchased the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic> and found Transition US:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Christopher’s first contact with the Transition movement was when he read about Totnes and other transition initiatives in the UK on a blog—the Treehugger blog. Christopher then bought the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic>, which was written by Rob Hopkins, the founder of the Transition movement. Christopher bought this book in 2008 and read it and that was the impetus to start Transition Houston. (Interview #6)</p>
<p>In late 2008 and after reading the book, Christopher searched online and found Transition US. (Interview #6)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is also important to note, however, that not all those who become interested in the nascent Transition movement complete the training program (Interview #9). In short, different individuals and communities have come to learn about and adopt the transition model through a combination of relational and nonrelational channels of diffusion.</p>
<p>In addition, mediated diffusion has been very important for the spread of the transition model within the United States. In December 2008, at the invitation of Transition US, a series of training sessions was given by the two Transition Training founders in the United Kingdom, which is indicative of reciprocation. One of these training sessions was a “Train the Trainers” course, which trained a group of 21 individuals to be transition trainers themselves. These individuals now facilitate transition trainings across the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0160597613481799">24</xref>
</sup> In addition, Transition US offers webinars, publishes a newsletter, and organizes conference calls (Interview #10). Transition US, therefore, can be seen as a broker in a process of mediated diffusion, helping connect local communities throughout the United States, the adopters, with the global Transition movement, the source, and serving as a “movement halfway house.” One could also describe Transition US as a change agent who diffuses movement ideas into a new population via workshops and trainings and serves as an external source of diffusion, much in the way described by Strang and Soule (see above). Apart from the transition training, the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic>, and the <italic>Transition Companion</italic>, which are both authored by Rob Hopkins, there are additional channels of diffusion. They include the blog <italic>Transition Culture</italic>, which is also written by Hopkins, as well as the Transition Network annual conference, which is held in the United Kingdom and which individuals from the United States attend. The main mechanism of diffusion, however, is the two-day transition training (Interview #9), and interviewees consider face-to-face contacts, that is, relational diffusion, in different venues and settings to be very important (Interview #9; Interview #10).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the process of translation of the transition model has been somewhat difficult. One interviewee notes that translation and adaptation are important (Interview #10):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Adaptation is needed because of different cultures. Adapting the model is critical for its adoption and for the model to have buy-in; the model begs to be adapted. Transition US leaves it up to the communities to do the adaptation, while Transition US spotlights cases and initiatives that can serve as examples and models. (Interview #10)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Other interviewees have other perspectives on the issue, and in some ways, there seems to have been too much adaptation of the transition model, while in other ways, the model seems not sufficiently adapted for the U.S. context. One interviewee, Robert, reports that the transition model was adapted in most communities, but that adaptation has been problematic for the Transition movement in the United States (Interview #9):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The model was adapted by most communities. Some people were inspired by the transition idea, but did not follow the UK model closely, and this has caused problems. The initial UK model continues to evolve based on the experience of over 400 communities, but communities are so locally oriented… . Information and experience sharing has worked better in the UK where there is a national conference. People from other countries, including the U.S. also attend, but the focus of the conference is on the UK. (Interview #9)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the same time, the main resources available to local transition initiatives are not entirely suitable for the U.S. context. The blog <italic>Transition Culture</italic> and the <italic>Transition Handbook</italic> and <italic>Transition Companion</italic> are all very important resources (Interview #9; Interview #10), but they are very U.K.-oriented (Interview #9). The U.K. movement predates the U.S. movement, and it has been breaking new ground, while the U.S. movement has been following it (Interview #10). Also, the transition training is not specifically designed for the United States (Interview #9). The Train the Trainers event used the same training program developed in the United Kingdom, and while transition trainers in the United States have considered revising the training program, revisions have been limited (Interview #7). The training program is sometimes adapted to fit a specific trainer or a specific audience (Interview #10):</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The transition training was originally adopted and then adapted and changed over time to fit the strengths and sensibilities of individual trainers. As long as the objectives of the training are always met there can be some differences. Also, some trainers have given training to culturally specific groups (for example, one trainer gave the training to a congregation) and adapt it to the specific group. (Interview #10)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By and large, however, the interviewees indicate that the adaptation of the training, a key diffusion tool, has been incremental and piecemeal:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The transition trainer group has considered revising training programs to be more US-centric… . A few trainers have individually started to revise materials to include U.S. data. But in general, there is concern about tinkering with the model too much; people tend to adopt the model wholesale. (Interview #7)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In sum, The Transition movement in the United States is the result of a diffusion process that involves relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion. I find evidence that adopter-activists in the United States actively sought ideas and models that they can apply in their own communities and looked to the Transition Network for inspiration. These adopter-activists are individuals whose work is very focused on their immediate communities, but who at the same time view themselves as participants in a transnational movement and discourse. Their work and activities are very locally oriented, but they have looked to other countries for ideas and models that can help them address the local issues with which they are grappling. While some of them may learn about the Transition movement initially through nonrelational channels of diffusion, such as books, relational channels of diffusion, such as training workshops or conferences, are also key in the diffusion process.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The point of departure for this article is the question of how and by what mechanisms and processes social movements in one country or region of the world diffuse to another country or region. To address this question, I have drawn on the theoretical literature pertaining to the diffusion of social movements and their ideas and applied it to two nascent movements in the United States: the solidarity economy movement and the Transition movement. My findings suggest that all channels of diffusion identified in the literature are important: relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion. A combination of different channels helps activists learn about social movement ideas and bring them to their own societies and communities.</p>
<p>I have argued that a combination of relational, nonrelational, and mediated diffusion explains the spread of the Transition and solidarity economy movements. I also find evidence that the actors who adopt ideas and models that originated in other countries are individuals who are deeply immersed in their own communities but at the same time have a global frame of reference and look to like-minded activists and change agents in other countries for inspiration and new ideas and models that they can apply to the problems with which they are grappling in their own communities. The article contributes to the literature on social movements in two ways. First, it contributes to the recent efforts to better understand the process of diffusion of social movements and their ideas. In doing so, it highlights the role of active agents, seekers, and translators, in the process of cross-national diffusion. Second, it provides an account of two very recent social movements that have not been fully studied and documented yet.</p>
<p>In addition to providing more evidence that shows how and through what processes transnational diffusion takes places, this article makes other contributions to the literature. First, it offers some reflection on and discussion of the actors who are involved in the diffusion process. I have argued that these actors can be viewed as translators whose work is locally oriented, but whose connections and frame of reference are transnational. My findings also indicate that they are seekers of new ideas and frameworks and models that can help them address local problems. In other words, they are not simply receivers of information and ideas, they are pro-active seekers who pursue transnational connections, ideas, and inspiration. Second, the article helps document two recent movements that have not yet received much attention in the literature.</p>
<p>My findings point to several avenues for further research. It will be important and interesting to study diffusion as a process that involves proactive adopters who do not just receive information passively, but who actively seek new ideas and models. There is relatively little emphasis on the process of actively seeking new ideas in the diffusion literature, and we know relatively little about the individuals who are involved in that process. Who are the seekers and translators who look beyond their country’s borders for ideas and inspiration and then bring these ideas back to their communities and try to adapt them to meet local needs and circumstances? What motivates them to play that role, and what skills and experiences do they have that allow them to do so? What are the resources that they need to successfully do so? And how, specifically, do they attempt to translate an idea into a local setting? Under what circumstances is translation possible and effective, and what are the obstacles that individual activists encounter when they attempt to translate ideas and models that originated abroad into practices that are suitable and workable in their local settings? These are all interesting questions, and they offer opportunities to draw on and integrate different strands of social movement theory to better understand the processes of diffusion and translation.</p>

<p>For example, the author attended a workshop at the second USSF in Detroit in June 2010 that was designed to introduce those in attendance to the solidarity economy framework and that was facilitated by two individuals, one from the CPE and one from the Highlander Research and Education Center, a member of the SEN board. The workshop, titled <italic>Introduction to the Solidarity Economy: Building an Economy for People and Planet</italic>, was held on Friday, June 25, 2010. The facilitators began the workshop by offering a very brief definition of the solidarity economy. They then encouraged attendees to form small groups of three people each to think about their values and their visions for the future of their communities and to explore ways to bring about change in their communities. This was followed by a presentation introducing the solidarity economy framework and a general discussion about that framework.</p>

<p>The website of the Post Carbon Institute explains that “Relocalization is a strategy to build societies based on the local production of food, energy and goods, and the local development of currency, governance and culture. The main goals of relocalization are to increase community energy security, to strengthen local economies, and to improve environmental conditions and social equity. The relocalization strategy developed in response to the environmental, social, political and economic impacts of global over-reliance on cheap energy.” See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.postcarbon.org/relocalize">http://www.postcarbon.org/relocalize</ext-link> (accessed February 19, 2012).</p>
