<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Over recent years numerous patients with severe forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) refractory to conventional therapies have been treated with intense immunosuppression followed by autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT). The clinical outcome and the toxicity of AHSCT can be diverse, depending on the various types of conditioning protocols and on the disease phase.</p>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To report the Italian experience on all the consecutive patients with MS treated with AHSCT with an intermediate intensity conditioning regimen, named BEAM/ATG, in the period from 1996 to 2008.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes of 74 patients were collected after a median follow-up period of 48.3 (range = 0.8–126) months.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Two patients (2.7%) died from transplant-related causes. After 5 years, 66% of patients remained stable or improved. Among patients with a follow-up longer than 1 year, eight out of 25 subjects with a relapsing–remitting course (31%) had a 6–12 months confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale improvement &gt; 1 point after AHSCT as compared with one out of 36 (3%) patients with a secondary progressive disease course (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009). Among the 18 cases with a follow-up longer than 7 years, eight (44%) remained stable or had a sustained improvement while 10 (56%), after an initial period of stabilization or improvement with median duration of 3.5 years, showed a slow disability progression.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows that AHSCT with a BEAM/ATG conditioning regimen has a sustained effect in suppressing disease progression in aggressive MS cases unresponsive to conventional therapies. It can also cause a sustained clinical improvement, especially if treated subjects are still in the relapsing–remitting phase of the disease.</p>

Up to now more than 500 MS cases have been treated worldwide with AHSCT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511429320">18</xref></sup> as a rescue therapy in severe forms of the disease, usually in small phase I and II studies done by single centres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511429320">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511429320"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511429320">21</xref></sup> or, more rarely, by collaborative efforts of a number of teams in the same country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511429320">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511429320">23</xref></sup> In spite of all this activity, in MS no prospective phase 3 trial comparing AHSCT with conventional treatments has been reported until now. Therefore, it is very relevant to have more data on the activity, the clinical outcome, the safety and the transplant-related mortality (TRM) of this procedure, the use of which has been greatly increasing in recent years. Numerous Departments of Haematology and Neurology have collaborated to organize prospective studies and to treat severe MS cases, unresponsive to conventional therapies, over recent years in Italy. All the patients received the same mobilizing and conditioning regimen, and the data on the activity and safety profile have been continuously recorded and reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry and to the country’s coordinating centres. This paper reports the long-term follow-up of this cohort of patients.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>All patients with MS treated in Italy with same procedure (BEAM/ATG as conditioning regimen) and reported to the EBMT registry are included in the analysis. In 1996, six centres joined together in order to organize a phase I/II study with the target to evaluate the activity of AHSCT on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511429320">24</xref></sup> Thereafter other centres developed local programmes, all using the BEAM/ATG regimen, reporting their data both to the EBMT registry and to the two leading haemato-neurological centres in Italy (Florence and Genoa). The present study includes 74 consecutive cases treated with AHSCT from 1996 to 2008. Some 21 cases were enrolled in the pilot prospective multi-centre trial;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511429320">23</xref></sup> the remaining cases were treated with AHSCT as a rescue therapy, following the decision of the treating physician, an informed patient consent, the approval of the local Ethics Committee and the EBMT guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511429320">25</xref></sup> All the cases had definite MS according to Poser criteria with a severe clinical course in the last year, defined as a deterioration of at least 1 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) point, despite conventional therapy.</p>

<sec id="section4-1352458511429320">
<title>Transplant procedures</title>
<p>Peripheral haematopoietic stem cells were mobilized by the association of cyclophosphamide (CY, 1.5–4 g/m<sup>2</sup>) in 1–2 days followed by daily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 5–12 µg/kg per day), until the completion of the harvest. The conditioning regimen was BEAM, which includes BCNU (carmustine) 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day −6; ARA-C (cytosine-arabinoside) 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and VP (etoposide) 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> from day −5 to day −2; and melphalan 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day −1. Rabbit ATG was added at a total dose of 7.5–10 mg/kg at day +1 and +2. BEAM/ATG is considered an intermediate intensity conditioning regimen in the EBMT classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511429320">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Clinical examinations and outcomes</title>
<p>All patients were examined every 3 months for the first 2 years and then at least once a year in the subsequent period. Baseline is defined as the assessment within 1 month before the administration of the mobilization regimen. A relapse was defined as the appearance of any new symptom or the recurrence of previously disappeared symptoms that lasted more than 24 h without fever. Progression was defined as an increase of 0.5 or 1 point at EDSS examination if EDSS score at baseline was &gt; 5.5 or ≤ 5.5, confirmed after 6 or 12 months. Early and late adverse events were those occurring within or after the first 100 days from transplantation. Confirmed neurological improvement following AHSCT was defined for the 61 patients with a follow-up ≥ 12 months as a decrease in EDSS score from baseline of 0.5 or 1 point at EDSS examination if EDSS score at baseline was &gt; 5.5 or ≤ 5.5, confirmed after 6 or 12 months.</p>
<p>The 18 patients with a follow-up longer than 7 years were further classified according to their EDSS changes over time as compared with baseline EDSS as:</p>
<list id="list1-1352458511429320" list-type="bullet">

<list-item><p>stable patients: patients with no EDSS changes (EDSS = baseline EDSS) over the entire follow-up;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>progressed patients: patients either stable or improved as compared with the baseline but with a subsequent deterioration of the EDSS confirmed after 6–12 months during the follow-up.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511429320">
<title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Summary statistics were reported as mean or median values and standard deviations (SD) or ranges. Comparisons between groups were carried out by the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Progression-free survival (PFS) at different time points was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier survival curves and compared between groups by the log-rank test.</p>

<title>Patients’ characteristics</title>
<p>Patients were followed for a median period of 48.3 months (range 0.8–126), and their distribution across the Italian centres is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511429320">Table 1</xref>. Amongst the 74 transplanted patients, 41 (55%) were in the secondary progressive (SP) phase and 33 (45%) were still in the relapsing–remitting (RR) period of the disease. Mean age at transplantation was 35.7 years (range = 16–53), mean disease duration before AHSCT was 11.2 years (range = 1–28), and median EDSS at baseline was 6.5 (range = 3.5–9). All patients clinically deteriorated in the previous year, with an increase of EDSS of at least one point (average EDSS change = 1.5 points, range = 1–9), 76% had at least one relapse, with a higher relapse rate for RR patients (average number of relapses in the previous year = 2.8, range = 0–8) than for SP patients (average number of relapses in the previous year = 1.1, range = 0–4). Demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the patients are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458511429320">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>All the included patients had failed previous treatments: glatiramer acetate (five subjects), interferon-beta (43 subjects), cyclophosphamide (23 subjects), mitoxantrone (26 subjects), azathioprine (23 subjects), in different combinations. All the patients had previously been treated with steroids during relapses, but none had received a chronic and continuous steroid therapy. In total, 45 (61%) patients had an MRI examination in the 3 months preceding AHSCT: of these 71% had an active MRI with Gd-enhancing lesions (mean number = 4.4, median = 1, range 0–28).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458511429320">
<title>Toxicity and transplant-related mortality</title>
<p>Early toxic effects occurred in 80% of treated cases: the more common events were neutropenic fever, occurring in more of 70% of cases, sepsis in 30% of patients, urinary tract infections in 25% of cases, diarrhoea and severe mucositis in 15% of treated subjects. In five cases, a reactivation of cytomegalovirus with fever was observed and successfully treated with specific therapy. Late toxic effects occurred in 5% of patients and were usually recurrent varicella zoster or urinary tract infections.</p>
<p>Transient worsening of neurological symptoms with headache, fatigue, deterioration of motor or sensory symptoms occurred in more than 50% of cases and were usually transitory and related to fever during the neutropenic period.</p>
<p>Three patients died in the study period. The first patient, 56 days after transplantation, had a brief loss of consciousness, possibly due to a syncope, with subsequent head trauma. Due to the presence of an increase of fibrinogen in the blood exams, the patient underwent an echocardiography, showing a partial, asymptomatic, thrombosis of the pulmonary veins, treated with thrombolytic therapy. After a few hours following therapy a massive intra-cerebral haemorrhage occurred and the patient died 48 h later. An independent committee, composed of two haematologists, experts in auto and allogeneic transplantation and one neurologist, was asked to express its opinion in order to define this event as related or not related to transplant. The final opinion of all the three experts was that it was not related to the AHSCT therapy.</p>
<p>The second patient had an engraftment failure for undetermined reasons and died 24 days post transplantation due to an opportunistic infection caused by <italic>Actinomyces</italic> sp and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The third patient died, 1 month after transplantation, from an encephalopathy not due to infective causes, possibly a Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The neuropathological evaluation of this case is still pending. These two latter cases, therefore, died for reasons related to the transplantation procedure.</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458511429320">
<title>Clinical outcome, progression-free survival and improvement</title>
<p>The average number of relapses in the year before AHSCT was 2.8 in the RRMS group (range 0–8) and 1.1 (range 0–4) in the SPMS group. In total, 61 subjects (26 RR and 35 SP) had a follow-up longer than 1 year; 85% of these subjects were relapse-free after 5 years of follow-up. The proportion of patients with a relapse during follow-up was higher in the RR group (30%) than in the SP group (10%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03).</p>
<p>After 6 months–1 year from AHSCT, no Gd-enhancing area was observed in the 45 cases where a MRI evaluation was available. This almost complete suppression of MRI activity was sustained with time: only two out of the 24 patients with an MRI assessment at year 2 had a scan positive for Gd-enhancing lesions.</p>
<p>After a median follow-up period of 48.3 months (range = 0.8–126), 19 out of 74 treated cases were progressed and PFS at 5 years was 66% (SE = 7%). PFS was slightly, but not significantly, higher in subjects with an age at AHSCT less than 40 years (5 years PFS = 69%) versus subjects over 40 years of age (5 years PFS = 52%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.33), in RR subjects (5 years PFS = 71%) than in SP subjects (5 years PFS = 62%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511429320">Figure 1</xref>, panel (b)).

<title>Long-term follow-up</title>
<p>Amongst the 18 patients (14 SPMS and four RRMS) with a follow-up longer than 7 years, three subjects (17%) remained stable with no EDSS changes over the whole follow-up period, and five (27%) had an EDSS improvement as compared with baseline confirmed at the end of their follow-up (ranging between 7 and 12 years).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In Italy, there is a particular interest in, and attention given to, AHSCT as a possible new strategy to treat severe autoimmune disorders, probably because the idea of a clinical application of the animal studies was proposed at an early stage in our country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511429320">2</xref></sup> and because of the existence of a consolidated network between the haematological and the neurological communities. Therefore, just after the first MS case was treated in Greece in 1995,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511429320">13</xref></sup> a prospective phase I/II study, with the aim of evaluating the activity of AHSCT on MRI was soon organized;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511429320">24</xref></sup> the clinical efficacy of the procedure was subsequently reported;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511429320">23</xref></sup> and the ASTIMS (Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Multiple Sclerosis, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.astims.org">www.astims.org</ext-link>) trial was organized and initiated. Moreover, in recent years, a large number of single cases of severe MS unresponsive to the approved therapies have been treated with AHSCT as a rescue therapy. The clinical efficacy as well the toxicity in AHSCT can be different when varying types of conditioning protocols are utilized: indeed, a relationship between regimen intensity, clinical outcome and TRM was shown in a retrospective analysis of patients affected by various autoimmune disorders and reported to the EBMT registry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511429320">27</xref></sup> This association was not confirmed, however, in a recent update on 900 patients reported to the EBMT registry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511429320">26</xref></sup> In Italy, apart from two small prospective studies evaluating low-intensity regimens,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511429320">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511429320">29</xref></sup> the various Italian centres have always utilized BEAM, an intermediate intensity regimen, that was chosen in the first multi-centre study organized in Italy. In the present paper, we report the analysis of all the consecutive cases of MS treated in our country with the same treatment protocol. Being a retrospective analysis, this study has intrinsic limitations. However, the large number of treated cases provided an opportunity to use the experience gained over these years to draw some conclusions on toxicity and the activity of the procedure that could be useful for future studies.</p>
<p>AHSCT was used to treat 74 patients with MS, and 66% remained stable or improved 5 years later. The 44% of subjects with more than 7 years of follow-up were stable or had a sustained improvement for the whole follow-up, ranging from seven to more than 10 years. This clinical outcome is of particular interest, taking into account that the population of enrolled patients was made up of severe forms of MS that worsened at least by 1 point of EDSS during the previous year and failed the approved immunomodulating or immunosuppressive therapies.</p>
<p>The most relevant information coming from the present study is that RRMS cases showed a better outcome than SPMS cases. This is not an unexpected finding in MS, where the therapeutic window is well known to be during the early years from the onset of the disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511429320">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, such a pattern in AHSCT was first reported in RRMS cases treated with an autologous non-myeloablative regimen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511429320">31</xref></sup> and then confirmed in two other mono-centric analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511429320">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511429320">33</xref></sup> In our series, 71% of RR cases did not progress after 5 years as compared with 63% of patients with SPMS, even if this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, when evaluating the changes in EDSS in the year following the procedure and sustained for the subsequent years, patients with RRMS had significantly higher improvements as compared with SP patients, with 31% of RR subjects experiencing a decrease of EDSS score higher than 1 point as compared with 3% of SP patients. Similarly, patients with MS aged less than 40 years and with a shorter disease duration had a significantly greater improvement after the treatment as compared with older patients and with patients with a longer disease duration. Moreover, when MS patients with or without Gd-enhancing lesions in the months preceding AHSCT were evaluated, patients with MRI activity at baseline had a higher PFS and fared significantly better than patients with no Gd-enhancing lesions. AHSCT has, therefore, a profound effect during the early phases of the disease, when inflammation is the main pathological process and degenerative changes, although present, are of minor relevance and contribute to a lesser extent to the clinical picture of the disease. Indeed, the dramatic effect on the relapse rate and the MRI activity points to the direct effect of AHSCT on inflammation. It is possible that this important capacity to decrease inflammation could have an influence on the subsequent process of degeneration of the nervous tissue, producing a favourable effect, although smaller, on the clinical outcome in the secondary phase of the disease also.</p>
<p>The main problems of AHSCT are the safety issues. Its toxicity, especially in the first period of transplantation, is not negligible, with fever, possibly sepsis, infections, mainly in the urinary tracts, cytomegalovirus reactivation and, later, varicella zoster virus infections. These problems are usually faced relatively well, especially in a setting where there is experience with auto and allo-transplantation in haematological malignancies. TRM is the main concern of the procedure. In the European experience, the mortality due to AHSCT fell from 7.3% in the years 1995–2000 to 1.3% in the 2001–2007 period, probably due to a better selection of patients and avoidance of high-intensity conditioning regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511429320">15</xref></sup> In Italy, considering that one death was classified by an independent panel of expert as not related to AHSCT, we have had two casualties, one for an engraftment failure and the other for a possible nutritional encephalopathy, setting the TRM of our experience to 2.7%. Considering that the mortality risk cannot be completely eliminated, only cases with a poor prognosis for advanced disability and dependence risk in a short period of time, without any other therapeutic options, can be considered candidates for AHSCT. Since AHSCT is, by far, more effective in the RR phase of the disease, poor responders to approved drugs who continue to relapse, accumulating disability and showing signs of MRI activity, should be considered as candidates for this therapeutic strategy, possibly within an approved and organized clinical trial.</p>
<p>In conclusion, AHSCT can be considered as a possible therapeutic option in rapidly evolving MS cases unresponsive to the available treatments, where the severity of the disease justifies the toxicity and the TRM risk of the procedure. In other situations, the superiority of AHSCT versus the approved therapies has not been demonstrated. A phase III study randomizing MS patients that failed interferon in AHSCT compared with FDA-approved standard of care is running in Chicago, Sweden and Brazil (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT00273364). A large phase III study that compares AHSCT vs. the best approved therapy after the failure of first and second-line therapies in serious MS cases is also now under discussion in the scientific community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511429320">18</xref></sup></p>
