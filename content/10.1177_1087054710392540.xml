<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: This study examined parental and professional beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment strategies for ADHD. <bold>Method</bold>: Parents of children with and without ADHD and seven medical and nonmedical professional groups (<italic>N</italic> = 673) completed a questionnaire examining their beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment regimes. <bold>Results</bold>: Principle component analysis identified four factors—school-based interventions, medical and allied health interventions, parent interventions, and nontraditional interventions. Although there were some group differences in the level of endorsement for these factors, there was a high degree of concordance between the groups. The school-based interventions factor was the most highly endorsed, whereas the nontraditional interventions factor was the least endorsed by the sample as a whole. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: The results suggest that the low level of interdisciplinary interaction that has been reported in the literature is not due to differences in beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment strategies for ADHD.</p>

<body>
<p>ADHD is a commonly diagnosed neurobehavioral condition that affects 3% to 7% of the school-aged population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710392540">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710392540">Blanchard, Gurka, &amp; Blackman, 2006</xref>). With onset in childhood, this condition is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention, impulsivity, and motor overactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710392540">APA, 2000</xref>). Despite the enormous body of research into this condition, the treatment of ADHD remains controversial for both the families and professionals involved. This controversy is partly because of the often-conflicting information regarding the efficacy of various treatment strategies available for children with ADHD in both the lay and professional literature. Treatment strategies that have been used for this condition include, but are not limited to, various psychotropic medications, megavitamin and orthomolecular therapies, dietary management, sensory-integration therapy, chiropractic manipulations, meditation or relaxation training, traditional play therapy, and faith healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710392540">Bussing, Zima, Gary, &amp; Garvan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710392540">Chan, Rappaport, &amp; Kemper, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710392540">Concannon &amp; Yang, 2005</xref>). Of these treatment strategies, efficacy has been demonstrated only for parent training (e.g., counseling and behavior management), teacher training (e.g., educational and behavior management), cognitive behavior therapy, and stimulant medication. There has been a lack of empirical support for the other treatment approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710392540">APA, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710392540">Baumgaertel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710392540">Farrelly &amp; Standish, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710392540">Purdie, Hattie, &amp; Carroll, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Stimulant medication (e.g., methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine) has become an integral part of most treatment interventions for ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710392540">LeFever, Dawson, &amp; Morrow, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710392540">Reid, Hakendorf, &amp; Prosser, 2002</xref>). Although stimulant medication has been demonstrated to reduce the core symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710392540">The MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710392540">2004</xref>), it remains controversial because of concerns regarding its long-term use in young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710392540">Goldman, Genel, Bezman, &amp; Stanelz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710392540">Wolraich et al., 1990</xref>) and lack of long-term randomized trial evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710392540">Schachter, Pham, King, Langford, &amp; Moher, 2001</xref>). Critics have argued that there is an overemphasis on pharmacological treatment that has resulted in the neglect of nonmedication treatment regimes or served as a distraction from adequately addressing problems in the family and educational system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710392540">Searight &amp; McLaren, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, stimulant medication has not yet been shown to improve the long-term outcome for school achievement, peer relationships, or behavior problems in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710392540">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710392540">Purdie et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This controversy and concern on how to best manage this condition have led organizations such as the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710392540">National Institutes of Health (2000)</xref> and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710392540">American Academy of Pediatrics (2001)</xref> to advocate a multimodal or multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. However, available data suggest that there is little interaction between the various professions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710392540">Kwasman, Tinsley, and Lepper (1995)</xref> reported that in their survey of 380 pediatricians, 39.1% contacted the schools attended by child patients with a diagnosis of ADHD; only 18.7% indicated that they were likely to refer children with ADHD to a psychiatrist, psychologist, special educator, social worker, or some other professional in a related discipline; and only 14.6% indicated that their patients consulted a psychologist before beginning treatment on stimulant medication. A more recent survey of 723 medical practitioners found that only 17.3% routinely referred their patients to other professionals (e.g., psychologists, counselor, or psychiatrist) for ADHD evaluation and diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710392540">Rushton, Fant, &amp; Clark, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The low level of interaction between relevant professional groups may, in part, be due to variations in their beliefs about the efficacy of various treatments for ADHD. Although several studies have examined the attitudes and beliefs of medical practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710392540">Rushton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710392540">Shaw, Wagner, Eastwood, &amp; Mitchell, 2003</xref>) and parents of children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710392540">Johnston, Seipp, Hommersen, Hoza, &amp; Fine, 2005</xref>) about the use of different treatment strategies, few studies have explored the beliefs of nonmedical professionals who, under current treatment guidelines, are increasingly more involved in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Given this, the current study examined the beliefs about the efficacy of ADHD treatments held by the various medical and nonmedical professionals involved in this condition, and among parents of children with and without ADHD. Understanding the similarities and differences in beliefs among the various groups could facilitate better communication not only between parents and professionals but also between the various professionals. It may be argued that beliefs about ADHD represent a critical component in understanding the experience of the condition and has a potential to affect not only treatment planning but also the treatment outcomes of the child diagnosed as having ADHD.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054710392540" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The participants comprised of psychologists (<italic>n</italic> = 101), general medical practitioners (<italic>n</italic> = 82), specialist paediatricians (<italic>n</italic> = 22), occupational therapists (<italic>n</italic> = 64), social workers (<italic>n</italic> = 73), dieticians (<italic>n</italic> = 20), primary school teachers/special education teachers (i.e., educators, <italic>n</italic> = 145), parents of children with a diagnosis of ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 79), and parents of children without a diagnosis of ADHD (<italic>n</italic> = 87).</p>
<p>Psychologists, medical practitioners (i.e., general practitioners and specialist pediatricians), and dieticians were recruited from the telephone directory from both metropolitan and regional areas of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Practitioners whose contact details appeared in the telephone directory were approached by mail. Social workers and occupational therapists were recruited through professional association mailing lists for these two groups. Educators (i.e., teachers/special education teachers) were recruited from 16 government and 15 nongovernment primary schools in both metropolitan and regional areas of NSW. Recruitment involved sending the questionnaire to primary schools for distribution among the teaching staff.</p>
<p>Parents taking part in the study were recruited from community health centers, neighborhood support centers, ADHD parent support groups, and government and nongovernment funded primary schools in both metropolitan and regional areas of NSW. The questionnaire was distributed to parents through newsletters of ADHD parent support groups, sent home with children at primary schools and left at community health centers, neighborhood support centers, and libraries. Parents who participated in this study were not associated with the same primary schools as those participants who formed the educator group. This was to ensure that participants comprising these two groups did not have the opportunity to discuss the study with each other.</p>
<p>The six-part, 117-item questionnaire examined beliefs about ADHD with regard to the (a) cause, (b) characteristics, (c) treatment and management, (d) life course of ADHD, and (e) help-seeking options available to parents. The remaining section of the questionnaire obtained demographic details of the participants. Only the sections of the questionnaire and results relevant to the treatment of ADHD are reported here. Details of the questionnaire and results relating to the causes and characteristics of ADHD can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710392540">Dryer, Kiernan, and Tyson (2006b)</xref>.</p>
<p>The questionnaire items were derived from a pilot study involving semistructured interviews with 25 participants comprised of parents of children with and without the diagnosis of ADHD, and professionals in the medical, mental health, and allied health fields. These participants were not involved in the main study. Participants were asked to answer open-ended questions examining their beliefs of ADHD. The responses to these questions were recorded and, where necessary, clarified. Any beliefs that were stated by two or more of the participants were included in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>The section of the questionnaire that examined the beliefs surrounding the treatment and management of ADHD consisted of 23 strategies. Participants indicated their beliefs regarding how effective each strategy would be in the treatment and management of this condition on a 5-point rating scale (0 = <italic>not at all effective</italic>, 4 = <italic>extremely effective</italic>; intervening rating categories were not labeled). For these rating scales, ratings greater than 2 (i.e., ratings of extremely effective, or one category below, of the five possible ratings) were interpreted as an endorsement of the proposition (e.g., effective and useful), whereas ratings less than 2 (i.e., ratings of <italic>not at all useful</italic> or one category above) were interpreted as a lack of endorsement. Parents were also asked to indicate whether their child had an existing diagnosis of ADHD.</p>
<p>A letter containing information regarding the nature and purposes of this study accompanied the questionnaire distributed to participants. A reply-paid envelope was also included to facilitate confidentiality and return of the questionnaires. Return of the questionnaire was taken as informed consent. The overall response rate to the questionnaire distribution across the different groups was 24.4%, which was calculated using only questionnaires with valid responses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Obtained ratings for items that examined treatment approaches to ADHD were subjected to a principle component analysis. A four-factor solution was determined by inspecting the scree plot. As the correlations among the factors obtained from a nonorthogonal (Oblimin) rotation were all less than <italic>r</italic> = .3, an orthogonal (Varimax) solution was selected. The four-factor solution explained 52.15% of the variance in the items. Items were deemed to contribute to the interpretation of a factor only if their loading was greater than .4. Item loadings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710392540">Table 1</xref>, along with the mean rating, standard deviation, and the ranking for each item. Rankings represent the ordering of the items derived from their mean ratings.</p>

<p>The first factor was labeled <italic>nontraditional interventions</italic> (19.57% of variance; Cronbach’s α = .88) as it was comprised of seven items concerned with dietary changes and intervention strategies that have not been traditionally employed in the treatment of ADHD (e.g., sound therapy, biofeedback, kinesiology, and chiropractic manipulations). Seven items loading onto the second factor related to interventions involving parent training and input (e.g., stricter control by parents; increasing parental attention, love, and guidance) and behavior control procedures (e.g., implementation of behavior modification programs and increasing disciplinary powers in schools). Accordingly, this factor was labeled <italic>parent interventions</italic> (13.30% of variance; Cronbach’s α = .77). The third factor was labeled <italic>school-based interventions</italic> (12.52% of variance; Cronbach’s α = .78) and comprised of intervention strategies involving changes to the educational structure and greater teacher support or input. The last factor labeled <italic>medical and allied health interventions</italic> (6.76% of variance; Cronbach’s α = .57) included five items such as the use of medication, occupational therapy, speech therapy, reducing stimulation in the environment and providing a structured environment.</p>
<p>Factor scores were calculated by adding the responses for the items loading most highly (i.e., above .40) on that factor and then dividing by the number of items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710392540">Kline, 1994</xref>). A repeated-measures ANOVA employing contrast testing using the Scheffe post hoc procedure was used to examine main effect differences in the overall ratings of the four factors. This procedure, although conservative, enables confident inferences to be made about differences between means and sets of means (contrasts) after inspecting the data (Scheffe, 1953, as cited and interpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710392540">Harris, 1994</xref>). Mean factor scores averaged across the groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710392540">Table 2</xref>. Controlling the familywise error rate at .05, with 8 and 688 degrees of freedom, the Scheffe critical <italic>F</italic> statistic was 15.61. The nontraditional interventions factor received little endorsement on average, and the mean factor score was significantly lower than that of the other three factors (<italic>F</italic> = 85.59). The school-based interventions factor was strongly endorsed on average and was rated significantly higher than the factors of parent interventions and medical and allied health interventions (<italic>F</italic> = 60.38). The factors representing parent interventions and medical and allied health interventions were both endorsed on average but did not differ significantly from each other (<italic>F</italic> = 4.25).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710392540">Table 2</xref> shows the mean factor scores (and standard deviations) for the nine groups on each of the four factors. Differences in mean ratings between the groups were examined for each factor separately using the Scheffe procedure. As the four factors were examined separately, to validly maintain the familywise error rate at .05 for each Scheffe contrast, each test employed a per-test alpha of .0125 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710392540">Ferguson &amp; Takane, 1989</xref>). With 8 and 688 degrees of freedom, the critical <italic>F</italic> statistic was 19.67.</p>
<p>Post hoc contrasts confirmed that parents of children without a diagnosis of ADHD rated the nontraditional interventions as more effective than did the remaining groups on average (<italic>F</italic> = 58.09) and that, as a cluster, psychologists, pediatricians, and general medical practitioners rated these interventions as less effective on average than all other groups (<italic>F</italic> = 101.59). No significant differences were detected on any pairwise comparisons among the clusters of psychologists, pediatricians, and general practitioners (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 7.90) nor among the occupational therapists, dieticians, social workers, educators, and parents of ADHD children (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 18.44).</p>
<p>Parents of children without a diagnosis of ADHD did not differ significantly from educators (<italic>F</italic> = 3.57) in their endorsement of parent interventions, but these two groups endorsed this factor significantly more than the average of the remaining groups (<italic>F</italic> = 65.87). No significant differences were detected among the remaining groups. For example, pediatricians, who rated this factor lower than all other groups, did not differ significantly from general medical practitioners, even though this is the largest observable difference between means (<italic>F</italic> = 4.95).</p>
<p>Parents of children with ADHD endorsed school-based interventions more than the average of all other groups (<italic>F</italic> = 23.46), but neither was the endorsement by occupational therapists, the next highest mean rating, significantly higher than the average of the remaining groups (<italic>F</italic> = 4.76) nor was the endorsement by pediatricians significantly lower than the average of the other groups (<italic>F</italic> = 1.86).</p>
<p>Occupational therapists endorsed the medical and allied health interventions more strongly than the average of the remaining groups (<italic>F</italic> = 52.81). No other differences were detected among the groups on this factor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study found that parents and professionals endorsed a diverse range of treatment strategies believed to be effective in the management of ADHD. However, the mean factor scores obtained for the four treatment factors indicated that the respondents did not see these intervention strategies as being equally effective. The group of strategies contained within the school-based interventions factor was clearly considered by the sample as a whole to be the most effective intervention approach to this condition. The next group of strategies to be considered to be effective was that contained within the parent interventions factor and the medical and allied health interventions factor. The least endorsed group of strategies was that contained within the nontraditional interventions factor. The level of endorsement for this factor was significantly lower than that of the other three factors, with a mean factor score reflecting a “not at all effective” response.</p>
<p>Although parents and professionals showed a high degree of agreement in their beliefs regarding the efficacy of various treatment strategies, important differences were observed between the groups. For example, parents of children without a diagnosis of ADHD, compared with the other groups, rated the strategies comprising the nontraditional interventions factor as being more effective (although rated lower than other interventions). The health professionals (in particular, the psychologists and medical practitioners) regarded these strategies as being not at all effective in addressing ADHD. Interestingly, parents of children with ADHD, similar to the health professionals, did not regard these strategies as being very effective. This is unexpected, given that the results of previous surveys on parents of children diagnosed with ADHD have reported that nontraditional treatments (most commonly diet therapies) are widely used and considered by a small proportion of parents to be helpful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710392540">Concannon &amp; Yang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710392540">Stubberfield, Wray, &amp; Parry, 1999</xref>). There are a number of possible explanations for the difference in findings obtained in the current study compared with previous studies. First, it is possible that the parents of children with ADHD, who participated in the current study, have children who have had the diagnosis for a number of years. These parents may have in the past used nontraditional therapies but have generally not found them effective in alleviating the symptoms of ADHD. Their beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment strategies may have also been influenced by the health professionals they would have consulted during the course of managing their child’s condition. Consequently, these parents may have less confidence than parents of children without ADHD and parents of children recently diagnosed with this condition, in treatment strategies considered controversial by the scientific community such as dietary changes, sound therapy, kinesiology, biofeedback, and manipulations by a chiropractor.</p>
<p>The difference in beliefs regarding the efficacy of nontraditional intervention strategies observed between the two parental groups may also be due to parents of children without ADHD regarding the management of this condition to be primarily the parent’s responsibility and attributing the cause of the condition to parenting style and family environment. They may have regarded the items contained within the nontraditional interventions factor (e.g., eliminating foods that cause allergies from the diet, use of health food supplements, and eliminating food additives from the diet) as strategies that are easily implemented and controlled by parents of children with ADHD. This explanation is consistent with the current finding that parents of children without a diagnosis of ADHD endorsed the strategies involving parents (i.e., those comprising the parent interventions factor) significantly more than the other groups, including parents of children with ADHD. It is also consistent with the results obtained in a related study that examined the beliefs of the causes of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710392540">Dryer et al., 2006b</xref>). In that study, it was found that parents of children without ADHD attributed this condition to the behavior of the parents (e.g., poor parental management, poor monitoring of the child, and parent–child conflict) and to an unstable family environment, more than parents of children with ADHD and health professionals (e.g., psychologists and social workers).</p>
<p>Educators were also found to significantly endorse the strategies involving parents more so than the other groups. In contrast, parents of children with ADHD, compared with the other groups, regarded the group of strategies involving the school and teachers (i.e., the school-based interventions factor) as being more effective in addressing this condition. Firsthand experience of the difficulties associated with implementing intervention strategies either at home or at school may explain the observed differences between these two groups. Furthermore, parents of children with ADHD may see teachers and schools compared to them as having more resources, expertise, and training to address the difficulties experienced by their children. Consequently, they see intervention strategies involving teachers and schools as being effective in addressing this condition.</p>
<p>There was generally a high degree of endorsement for the medical and allied health interventions factor across the groups, especially among the occupational therapists who were observed to endorse these strategies more than the other groups. This indicates that there was a general level of acceptance of traditional therapies involving health professionals. Given the current debate on the use of medication in the treatment of children diagnosed with ADHD, the mean level of endorsement for the medication item in the questionnaire was examined (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710392540">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the level of endorsement for this item for the overall group was at the same level as the most endorsed factor, the school-based interventions factor. This suggests that the respondents regarded the use of medication as being an acceptable and effective treatment strategy for ADHD. This is consistent with the results of research such as the multimodal treatment study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710392540">The MTA Cooperative Group, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710392540">2004</xref>), which have reported that medical management is effective for the core symptoms of ADHD. However, it is worth noting that given the different sample sizes of the nine groups in this study, examining the mean level of endorsement for the group as a whole may be more reflective of the attitudes of the groups with the larger numbers of participants such as psychologists, medical practitioners, and educators. Psychologists and medical practitioners, in particular, may be more likely to consult medical literature and empirical research reports in which the results of the MTA study can be found.</p>
<p>This study found that the medical and nonmedical professionals held relatively similar beliefs about the effectiveness of various treatment strategies for ADHD. This suggests that the low level of interaction between professional groups that has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054710392540">Kwasman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710392540">Rushton et al., 2004</xref>) is not because of differences in beliefs about the efficacy of various treatment strategies for this condition. It is possible that this low level of interdisciplinary interaction is due to perceived differences in beliefs about ADHD rather than actual differences and that the barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration do not have a valid basis. The results of this study may also indicate that there has been a change in the beliefs held by the professional groups from when the studies reporting low interdisciplinary interaction were conducted. The various professional groups may have over the years changed their beliefs about ADHD, and these beliefs are becoming more similar among the professional groups.</p>
<p>There are a number of limitations in the current study. First, respondents were not provided with the opportunity to express additional beliefs that were not addressed by the questionnaire. Steps were taken to ensure the comprehensiveness of the questionnaire, in particular, by using an open-ended interview procedure in the pilot study during the development of the questionnaire. However, it may still be argued that this study did not explore all possible beliefs about the optimal treatment and management strategies for ADHD. Second, this study did not balance the number of items that could potentially load on different factors. It could be argued that the dominance of some factors over others in the analyses was the result of an overrepresentation of items pertaining to the dominant factors. Third, the small number of dieticians who participated in this study was likely to have contributed to the lack of significant differences observed between this group and the other professional and parental groups. Fourth, this study did not examine whether the individual’s level of experience with ADHD influenced the beliefs of the respondents. It would be useful for future research to compare the implicit beliefs of professionals with little experience with ADHD with those with extensive experience. Fifth, due to the low overall response rate to the questionnaire (24.4%), the current findings may not reflect the full range of beliefs held by the targeted professional and parental groups. Finally, the questionnaire did not investigate whether respondents accept that ADHD exists as a valid clinical syndrome. The impact of diagnostic labeling on professional decisions concerning the treatment and management of ADHD was examined by the authors in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710392540">Dryer, Kiernan, &amp; Tyson, 2006a</xref>). The authors manipulated the presence versus absence of the diagnostic label “ADHD” in a vignette study describing the key characteristics of this condition. As in the current study, participants were comprised of professionals in the educational, mental health, and allied health fields. After reading the vignette, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire examining beliefs about the causes of ADHD and the treatment and management strategies for this condition. The results indicated that the presence of the diagnostic label changed the beliefs about the causes of ADHD but did not significantly change the beliefs regarding how to best treat or manage the behaviors characteristic of ADHD. The inclusion of an ADHD label did not lead to a greater acceptance of medical and allied health intervention strategies. School-based intervention strategies were the preferred approach by the professionals regardless of whether the behaviors were described as ADHD.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study examined differences in beliefs about the optimal treatment of ADHD and found that beliefs about treatment are more convergent than would be expected, given the reported low level of interdisciplinary cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710392540">Rushton et al., 2004</xref>). All groups, on average, rated school-based interventions as the most effective treatment approach, although parents of children without ADHD rated parent interventions to be as effective. These results suggest that a failure between professional groups to engage in collaborative and interdisciplinary treatment approaches is because of factors other than treatment efficacy, such as differing beliefs about the causes of ADHD, differential government support for treatment options and treating professionals, or even differential success at market-place competition between the professions. Examination of these issues is beyond the scope of the current article; however, the results of the current research suggest that there are few, if any, impediments to an integrated treatment approach that is related to beliefs about the treatment of ADHD among related professional groups or parents of children with ADHD.</p>
