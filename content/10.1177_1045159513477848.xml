<body>
<p>For generations of men and women in academia, the words <italic>publish or perish</italic> have served as either a cornerstone for a career or a boulder that blocks professional advancement. In <italic>The Handbook of Scholarly Writing and Publishing</italic>, editors Tonette S. Rocco and Tim Hatcher present information that can help emerging scholars and accomplished professionals in all fields strengthen their academic writing.</p>
<p>In the preface, Rocco and Hatcher (2011) indicate their aim was to “fill a conceptual and practical gap in the literature” (p. xiii), so readers can better understand the process of scholarly writing and publication. They reached this goal with the collection of essays that comprise this text, essays written by a diverse group of academicians and practitioners with a wide range of areas of expertise (e.g., adult education, educational leadership, communications, business, human resource development, and teacher preparation). The book’s overriding message is that academic writing, though sometimes “a miserable chore” (Rocco &amp; Hatcher, 2011, p. 3), can be mastered with expert guidance and focused practice.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045159513477848">John W. Creswell (2011)</xref>, a highly regarded researcher and writer, penned the foreword in which he recommends the book as an “original contribution” . . . [with information on topics] “seldom discussed in the research literature” (p. xi). Effectively arranged in four parts, those topics include “Becoming a Published Scholar” (Part 1), “Improving Writing Techniques” (Part 2), “Preparing Scholarly Manuscripts” (Part 3), and “Reflecting on the Writing and Publishing Process” (Part 4). In each chapter, contributors present advice that is nonpedantic and easy to follow with diagrams, matrices, and screenshots.</p>
<p>Chapter titles, including “Finding Voice,” “Working With Coauthors,” and “Addressing Feedback From Reviewers and Editors,” lead to sage advice such as “a characteristic of good writing is a voice that draws us in and engages us as readers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045159513477848">Lee, 2011</xref>, p. 103), “getting along is as important as producing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045159513477848">Nevin, Thousand, &amp; Villa, 2011</xref>, p. 280), and “the ogres and the good-ship-lollipop reviewers represent opposite ends of the continuum” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045159513477848">Donmoyer, 2011</xref>, p. 244). There is clearly much more to academic writing than writing.</p>
<p>Chapters by prolific researchers such as Stephen D. Brookfield, Baiyin Yang, and Isadore Newman, as well as unknown yet experienced practitioners and doctoral students, present scaffolding that can move fledgling researchers out of their zones of proximal development and into areas of potential growth. Rocco, associate professor and codirector of the Adult Education and Human Resource Development Program at Florida International University in Miami, and Hatcher, professor of human resource development and adult education at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, have published extensively, are veteran reviewers and editors, and have reputations as mentors for less-experienced academicians.</p>
<p>As an early-career faculty member at a research university, I am particularly grateful for the book’s final chapter, “Resources: Further Reading for Scholarly Writing.” This chapter is replete with references categorized under headings such as “Tricks of the Trade,” “Choosing the Journal,” and “Dealing With Pressures.”</p>
<p>Although the last chapter’s 13 pages are vital, other parts of the 300-plus page book are wordy. Furthermore, future editions should pay more attention to the mechanics of self-editing and ethical issues related to writing, sometimes a challenge for established and emerging authors. Despite those critiques, this book serves as a valuable guide on how to approach writing, manage projects, and become a published scholar. Hence, for students, recent graduates, midcareer academicians, and practitioners willing to construct and maintain a strong writing portfolio, this handbook offers the tools for the task.</p>
