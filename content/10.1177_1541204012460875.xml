<abstract>
<p>The psychometric properties of the risk and resiliency checkup (RRC) were examined in a sample of 2,835 youth offenders. Solid evidence for internal consistency and convergent validity were demonstrated by correlations between the RRC subscales and the total scores. Three hypothetical factor models for the RRC were explored: a second-order factor model, a first-order 2-factor model without covariance, and a first-order 2-factor model with covariance. The first-order 2-factor model with covariance of the RRC was selected for further analyses. Recognizing that measurement invariance was rarely tested with risk assessments, this study examined the measurement invariance of the RRC model across three ethnic groups. The data supported configural invariance as well as partial metric invariance. This study presents substantial empirical evidence for the construct validity of the RRC across three ethnic groups. However, the first-order 2-factor model for the RRC indicates that risk and protective factors appear to be different dimensions.</p>

<p>Risk assessment has become increasingly prevalent within juvenile justice systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460875">Baird, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204012460875">Walters, 2011</xref>). It helps not only obtain the risk levels of youth offenders but also predict future recidivism. It helps juvenile justice agencies make decisions about an offender’s level of supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204012460875">Hoge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204012460875">Vincent, Chapman, &amp; Cook, 2011</xref>), and allocate resources efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204012460875">Turner &amp; Fain, 2006</xref>). Risk assessment assumes that those most likely to recidivate can be assessed for a high level of risk, and then receive intensive service, which can discourage recidivism. Therefore, standardization of risk assessment is fundamental for this assumption.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a number of methods and instruments for measuring the risk of youth offenders have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204012460875">Schmidt, Campbell, &amp; Houlding, 2011</xref>). These instruments include the Youth Level of Services and Case Management Inventory (YLS/CMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204012460875">Andrews, Bonta, &amp; Wormith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204012460875">Onifade et al., 2008</xref>), the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204012460875">Hoge, 2002</xref>), the Psychopathy Checklist Youth Version (PCL: YV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204012460875">Vitacco et al., 2006</xref>), the Communities that Care Youth Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460875">Arthur, Hawkins, Pollard, Catalano, &amp; Baglioni, 2002</xref>), the Risk and Resiliency Assessment Checkup (RRC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204012460875">Turner &amp; Fain, 2006</xref>), the Structured Assessment for Violence Risk in Youth (SAVRY; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204012460875">Vincent et al., 2011</xref>), the Psychological Inventory of Criminal Thinking Styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204012460875">Walters, 2011</xref>), and the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument (MAYSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204012460875">Marczyk, Heilbrun, Lander, &amp; DeMatteo, 2003</xref>). However, assessment tools should be examined by their validation and testing efficacy before dissemination and utilization in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204012460875">Margison et al., 2000</xref>). Other than the YLS/CMI, the SAVRY, and the PCL: YV, there has been little investigation of the psychometric properties of these instruments, with the exception of predict validity. Most studies on reliability and validity of risk assessment focus primarily on predictive validity since predictive ability is critical in criminal justice for predicting as well as preventing future recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204012460875">Catchpole &amp; Gretton, 2003</xref>). However, in order to validate the structure of the instruments an examination of the internal consistency and construct validity of instruments is a prerequisite to the study of predictive validity.</p>
<p>Unlike the other instruments, the SAVRY and the RRC incorporate both risk and protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460875">Fougere &amp; Daffern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204012460875">Vincent et al., 2011</xref>). There are few validation studies on the RRC while several studies have examined the SAVRY. Preliminary investigations of the RRC have provided evidence of its reliability and predictive validity for future recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204012460875">Turner &amp; Fain, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Within juvenile justice systems, ethnic minority youth comprise a major proportion of the total population of youth offenders. Ethnic differences and cultural factors are associated with youth behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204012460875">French, Kim, &amp; Pillado, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204012460875">Taylor, Lovett, &amp; Carona, 2007</xref>). Understanding the variations among ethnic groups in risk assessment helps juvenile justice agencies accurately assess the risk level of youth offenders and provide culturally relevant intervention. Therefore, invariance of risk assessment across the ethnic groups should be confirmed, although most risk factors are equally valid predictors for youth offenders regardless of sex, and race or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204012460875">Rosay, Gottfredson, Armstrong, &amp; Harmon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1541204012460875">Williams, Ayers, Abbott, Hawkins, &amp; Catalano, 1999</xref>). Without such confirmation, the risk assessment may not apply to different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Measurement invariance is a logical prerequisite to addressing group differences in order to test whether the internal structures of measures are the same across groups. Finding a difference or similarity across groups can be interpreted clearly after measurement invariance is confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460875">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>). Measurement invariance is indicative of the equivalence of measured constructs across independent groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204012460875">Chen, Sousa, &amp; West, 2005</xref>). Therefore, the invariance of valid and reliable measurements is a necessary condition for assessing clients, evaluating their change, and comparing different interventions and treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460875">Eddy, 1998</xref>). Thus, practitioners or researchers who intend to compare the risk levels of youth offenders with different backgrounds, including ethnicity, should withhold their judgments until the measurements are proven to be equivalent across different backgrounds. Cross-ethnic comparisons can be interpreted as valid when the measures used are invariant across ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204012460875">Switzer, Wisniewski, Belle, Dew, &amp; Schultz, 1999</xref>). Lack of measurement invariance implies that the structure of a specific measure is different across the ethnic groups. Accordingly, the results and the estimation of the measurement cannot be interpreted in the same way in different groups. Central to measurement invariance is the construct validity of measures across ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204012460875">Eddy, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>Risk and Protective Factors in the RRC</title>
<p>The determinants of juvenile delinquent activity are embedded within several systemic contexts (e.g., family, peer, school, and community) that influence such behavior, and are called risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204012460875">U.S. Office of the Surgeon General, 2001</xref>). Risk factors have been well recognized as factors related to recidivism among delinquent youths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460875">Arthur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204012460875">Heggeler, 1991</xref>). Heggeler’s causal model (1991) suggested that delinquent behavior was predicted directly from four latent factors comprised of family relations, school performance, peer relations, and general individual delinquency, which explained 54% of the variance in delinquent behavior (e.g., drug use, delinquency, violence, and school dropout) among youth offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204012460875">Hawkins, Laub, &amp; Lauritsen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204012460875">Lipsey &amp; Derzon, 1998</xref>). The relationship between the number of risk factors and the likelihood of becoming involved in delinquent behavior has been well supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460875">Arthur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204012460875">Newcomb, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204012460875">Pollard, Hawkins, &amp; Arthur, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the numerous correlates with delinquent behavior, these systemic contexts (family, peer, school, and community) play the roles of both risk and protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204012460875">U.S. Office of the Surgeon General, 2001</xref>). While research on protective factors is limited, some studies reported that protective factors significantly increase the amount of variance in recidivism as explained by the risk factors alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204012460875">Fougere &amp; Daffern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204012460875">Lodewijks, Ruiter, &amp; Doreleijers, 2010</xref>). As a result, the consideration of protective factors in risk assessment such as the SAVRY, and the RRC is potentially noteworthy.</p>
<p>However, some scholars argue that protective factors are conceptually distinct from risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204012460875">Guerra, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204012460875">Wasserman &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>), and may not lie at the opposite end of risk factors on a single spectrum. Some scholars have defined protective factors as characteristics or conditions that interact with risk factors or buffer the effects of risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204012460875">Davis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460875">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1996</xref>). However, to date there is little evidence of interaction between risk and protective factors. Moreover, studies reported that the number of risk factors is more predictive of delinquent behavior than certain types of risk factors present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204012460875">Arthur et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204012460875">Sameroff, Seifer, &amp; Baldwin, 1998</xref>). Taken together, there is no agreement that protective factors either directly or indirectly affect delinquent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204012460875">Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, &amp; Turbin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204012460875">Stattin &amp; Magnusson, 1996</xref>). Just as risk factors do not necessarily cause delinquent behavior, protective factors do not directly cancel out the risks of delinquent behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204012460875">Farrington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204012460875">Lipsey &amp; Derzon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204012460875">Thornberry, Huizinga, &amp; Loeber, 1995</xref>). Therefore, designing a risk assessment instrument must be done with great care.</p>
<p>The RRC, a risk assessment tool for youth offenders, covers both risk and protective factors in order to assess levels of resiliency after canceling out protective factors. Two validation studies reported that the RRC showed high levels of correlations among total risk and total protective scores, and subscales within risk and protective scores, as well as predictive validity for youth offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204012460875">Turner &amp; Fain, 2006</xref>). However, to date no further studies have examined the internal consistency and factor structure of the RRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204012460875">Vincent, Terry, &amp; Maney, 2009</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204012460875">Turner and Fain (2006)</xref> reported that the RRC seemed less predictive for Hispanic and “other” youths. This result implies the need for a measurement invariance test on the instrument in order to be validated for other ethnic groups, as measurement invariance leads to unbiased scientific and clinical inferences about the differences among individuals and groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460875">Horn &amp; McArdle, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the factor structure of the RRC as well as its internal consistency, and convergent validity. The factor structure of the RRC was explored with construct validity tests in order to confirm the RRC factor model. The study also examined measurement invariance across three ethnic groups: African American, Caucasian, and Hispanic youth offenders.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1541204012460875">
<title>Study Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 2,835 youth offenders who were arrested by law enforcements, and placed under regular supervision programs in the Los Angeles County Probation Department (LACPD). The sample data were extracted from a data system that the department maintains. For regular supervision, probation officers who received extensive training on the RRC administered it to youth offenders when youth offenders were transported to the area offices. These youth were assessed as part of the probation officers’ mandatory supervision and case management requirement. Youth offenders were included in the sample if they met the following criteria for data extraction: (1) were placed under regular supervision and (2) were administered the RRC during the 2-month period from March 1, 2008 to April 30, 2008.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1541204012460875">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The RRC was originally designed to assess the level of resiliency that covers positive and negative behaviors of youth offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204012460875">Vincent, Terry, &amp; Maney, 2009</xref>). It has gone through several revisions based on the results of validation studies. It is composed of two main factors: Risk and protective factors. These two factors are structured in six conceptual domains: Delinquency, Education, Family, Peer, Substance Use, and Individual domains. Each of the six domains has five questions, for a total of 30-subscale questions each for risk and protective factors. The six domains under risk and protective factors summed separately. Later risk factor scores are subtracted from protective factor scores in order to generate a Resiliency score.</p>
<p>All 60-subscale questions for risk and protective factors are scored as follows: yes, 2; somewhat, 1; and no or unknown, 0. The subscale questions in the six domains for risk factors correspond to the inverse of subscale questions in the domains for protective factors. For example, the question “communicate with family” in the Family domain under protective Factor corresponds to “poor relation with parent(s)” in the same domain under risk factor. The sum score of risk factors is converted to a negative score. The net of the negative sum of risk scores and the positive sum of protective scores yields a single resiliency score. One important difference between the RRC and most other risk assessment tools is that a higher score on the RRC implies lower risk and a lower score corresponds to a higher risk of reoffending, contrary to other risk assessment tools, which associate high scores with a high risk of recidivism. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204012460875">Figure 1</xref>, the numbers in the squares indicate the observed six areas with 60-subscale questions according to the RRC manual. The labels in the ovals represent the latent factors that correspond to the risk and protective factors. The small circles connected to the observed variables correspond to measurement errors.</p>

<title>Hypothetical Factor Structure of the RRC</title>
<p>The RRC consists of two factors representing risk and protective factors as described in the previous section. Originally the RRC could derive one latent factor of resiliency from a total of 12 subscales under risk and protective factors, which may yield a valid estimate of the resiliency level of youth offenders since the RRC was designed to produce a final score of resiliency. However, this study considered that risk and protective factors are not simply on opposite ends of a spectrum, wherein a protective factor cancels out the effect of a risk factor. Therefore, this study explored two additional factor models, which place risk and protective factors in different conceptual domains, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204012460875">Figure 1</xref>. Based on the conceptual structure of the RRC and the two additional models, this study tested three different factor models: (1) a second-order factor model of resiliency, (2) a first-order 2-factor model for risk and protective factors without covariance, and (3) a first-order 2-factor model for risk and protective factors with covariance. After confirming and selecting the RRC factor model from the three hypothetical models, the study proceeded to test measurement invariance tests across the three ethnic groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1541204012460875">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Because no previous study has tested the construct validity of the RRC, the data analyses were conducted in four steps. In the first step, basic descriptive analyses, including frequency distribution, mean, and standard deviation, were performed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent <italic>t </italic>tests were conducted for comparing means.</p>
<p>In the second step, exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were conducted for three different models, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1541204012460875">Figure 1</xref>, and confirmed the final hypothesized model. After confirming the final model, internal consistency scores (Cronbach coefficient alpha) were calculated for each of the items indicated by the factor analysis. In addition, convergent validity was examined. As the third step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted for the Caucasian sample as a reference group. Testing for measurement invariance would not be conducted if the result of a Caucasian group CFA does not fit the data. A lack of fit in CFA for the reference group would indicate that even a lower level of invariance, which is configural invariance, across the three ethnic groups, would not be retained.</p>
<p>In the final step, measurement invariance tests across the three ethnic groups were conducted using multiple-group CFAs. The multiple-group CFA is considered the best method for testing measurement invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204012460875">Ployhart &amp; Oswald, 2004</xref>). Measurement invariance was tested by constraining several elements in the hypothesized factor structure models. Three different types of factorial invariance were tested: Configural, partial metric, and full metric invariance, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460875">Horn and McArdle (1992)</xref>. Configural invariance means that the factor structure underlying items is equivalent across groups. It requires the same factor pattern metrics, and allows the magnitudes of factor loadings and their measurement error variances to vary across all groups.</p>
<p>Partial metric invariance is defined by the presence of equal factor loadings across groups, but with the error variance allowed to vary across the groups. It requires configural invariance, but allows some loadings on items to be different across groups. Full metric invariance is defined by placing an additional equality constraint on the correlations among the measured variables and the measurement errors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204012460875">Horn and McArdle (1992)</xref> have stated that it is less reasonable to expect metric invariance in human measurements since the configuration of zero and nonzero pattern coefficients may not be realistically expected to remain invariant across groups. Therefore, partial metric invariance is the more practical invariance (Byrne, Shavelson, &amp; Múthen, 1989).</p>
<p>Basic descriptive analyses were performed with SPSS 16.0. All factor analyses were performed with AMOS 17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204012460875">Arbuckle, 2008</xref>). In order to evaluate the overall goodness-of-fit of the model to the data, three fit indices were examined as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204012460875">Arbuckle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1541204012460875">Kline, 2005</xref>): Chi-square statistics, Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The study focused on CFI and RMSEA. For the CFI, values higher than .95 indicate that a hypothesized model is acceptable. For RMSEA, values lower than .08 are acceptable. For the model comparisons, the study used Chi-square statistics, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bollen’s Incremental Fit Index (IFI).</p>

<title>Levels of Resiliency by Three Ethnic Group</title>
<p>The resiliency levels were determined according to the manual of the RRC, which indicates that the higher the score are, the higher the levels of resiliency. The mean differences in resiliency scores were found to be significant by gender (<italic>F</italic> = 10.69, <italic>p</italic> = .001) and ethnicity (<italic>F</italic> = 7.59, <italic>p</italic> = .001). As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204012460875">Table 1</xref>, Caucasian youth offenders had the highest mean resiliency scores compared to African Americans and Latinos. Likewise, protective scores and risk scores differed by gender and ethnicity. Caucasian youth had the highest protective scores and low risk scores compared to the other ethnic groups. Females had higher resiliency and protective scores than males.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1541204012460875">
<title>Internal Consistency of the RRC</title>
<p>For the entire sample, the mean resiliency score was 5.92 (<italic>SD</italic> = 25.33). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204012460875">Table 1</xref> presents the mean scores for each item. The internal reliability of the scale was found to be great (α = .95). According to the item-total correlation, the top 3 items were peer relation and individual under risk factor, and individual under protective factor. For the African American, Caucasian, and Latino groups, the internal reliability of the scale was found to be also great (α = .95). The top 3 items for African American and Latino groups were peer relation, individual under risk factor, and individual under protective factor. The top 3 items for Caucasian group were peer relation, individual, and delinquency under risk factor.</p>

<sec id="section11-1541204012460875">
<title>Convergent Validity of the RRC</title>
<p>Pearson product–moment correlations were calculated between resiliency and protective, risk, and subscale scores. All correlations for the entire sample were strongly correlated with resiliency scores with a range of .74 to .93. The range of all correlations for the three ethnic groups was similar to those of the entire sample. For the entire sample, the domains of individual under protective factor and peer relation under risk factor were the subscales with the highest correlation. Across the three ethnic groups, peer relation domain under risk factor was found to be the highest subscale. However, under protective factor, the family domain for Caucasian youth, and the individual domain for African American as well as Latino youth were found to be the highest subscales. In general, the pattern of correlations supported the convergent validity of the RRC for the entire sample and for the three ethnic groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1541204012460875">
<title>Construct Validity: CFA</title>
<p>In accordance with the RRC manual, the resiliency scores were computed as the net sum of protective and risk factors. Therefore, three hypothesized models were proposed: The second-order factor model of resiliency, the first-order 2-factor model of risk and protective factors without covariance, and the first-order 2-factor model of risk and protective factors with covariance model. As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204012460875">Table 2</xref>, among three models, the first-order 2-factor model of risk and protective factors with covariance fit the data marginally (χ<sup>2 </sup>= 146.07, <italic>df</italic> = 47, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .073). This result suggested that the first-order 2-factor model of risk and protective factors would be a plausible model for explaining the covariance among item scores separately. In addition, it implies that risk and protective factors should be viewed as separate domains.</p>

<title>Measurement Invariance Across Three Ethnic Groups</title>
<p>The first-order 2-factor model of risk and protective factors with covariance was tested for measurement invariance across the three ethnic groups (African American, Caucasians, and Latinos) using multiple-group CFAs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204012460875">Table 4</xref>).

<p>In summary, the results showed that the RMSEA are lower than .08 and that CFI are higher than .95. The satisfactory goodness-of-fit with the configural invariance model indicates that the first-order 2-factor model with covariance is extracted from each of the three ethnic groups, which, in turn, supports the construct validity of this factor model. The partial metric invariance without constrained covariance between the risk and protective factors provides support that the subscale scores of this factor model of the RRC can be compared across the three ethnic groups: African American, Caucasian, and Latino youth offenders. Since the χ<sup>2 </sup>differences among the models were sensitive to the large sample size, the current study examined Bollen’s IFI. IFI values close to 1 indicate a very good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204012460875">Arbuckle, 2008</xref>). In addition, −.01 was used as the critical value for indicating model differences between the two invariance models (Cheung &amp; Rensvold, 2000). The configural invariance model was used as a baseline model, and two model comparisons were conducted. The first model comparison showed a value of −.01, indicating an insignificant model difference between the configural and the partial metric invariance models. However, the model difference between the full metric invariance and the partial metric invariance models had a value large enough to be significant, as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204012460875">Table 4</xref>. The study rejected the full metric invariance model, and accepted the configural and partial invariance models as plausible model from a theoretical and a practical perspective.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1541204012460875">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There are three main findings in the present study. First, the RRC was found to be reliable and valid. Second, the construct validity of the RRC was confirmed as first-order 2-factor with covariance. The first-order 2-factor with covariance model showed a good fit to the entire sample and the Caucasian youth as a reference group. Third, the cross-ethnic construct validity of the RRC factor model was supported by the presence of measurement invariance across African American, Caucasian, and Latino youth. The data supported the configural invariance of the RRC factor model as well as the partial metric invariance of item loadings, representing substantial empirical evidence for the construct validity of the RRC factor model across the three ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Our findings have three important implications for the use of the RRC among youth offenders. First, the RRC can be used with African American, Caucasian, and Latino youth as a risk assessment tool. The 12 subscales of the RRC can be used in practice and research across the three ethnic groups. This finding is consistent with Williams Ayers, Abbott, Hawkins, and Catalano’s (1999) study, which tested racial differences in risk factors for delinquency and substances use, including peer influences, family relationships, and school attachment. They found similarities in the patterns and path of the risk factors across both substance use and delinquency for both African American and Caucasian youth groups.</p>
<p>Second, the 2-factor structure of the RRC validates the practice of assessing youth offenders in juvenile justice systems. At this stage of analysis, a higher common factor of the RRC may not exist. Currently, the RRC has been operationalized to generate resiliency scores in order to determine the level of risk among youth offenders. However, its psychometric soundness was not supported directly by the data. This finding implies that risk factors and protective factors may not derive the resiliency score. Rather, risk and protective factors are highly correlated, but a separate dimension. This finding is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204012460875">Baird (2009)</xref>’s point suggesting that risk assessment should test on risk factors. Furthermore, two studies on predictive validity of the SAVRY discussed that protective factors desist recidivism and compromise the predictability of risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204012460875">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204012460875">Vincent et al., 2011</xref>). This study is meaningful because it provides the first empirical evidence supporting that risk and protective factors on recidivism, as well as the effect of protective factors on risk factors still remains unclear.</p>
<p>Third, the RRC can be useful for comparing differences in the levels of the risk and protective factors across the three ethnic groups, which confirms the RRC’s utility for both clinical and research purposes. This practical implication is inferred from our findings that the partial metric invariance of item loadings in the factor model fit the data. It should be noted that partial metric invariance enables the use of the measure of interest to test the group mean difference without any loss of the scientific validity of the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204012460875">Byrne, Shavelson, &amp; Muthen, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides evidence that the RRC can be used as a reliable and valid risk assessment to assess the level of risk of youth offenders while also, comparing quantitative differences in the levels of risk and protective factors across different ethnic groups. The findings from the current study support the utility of the RRC in juvenile delinquency practice and research, which has particular relevance in criminal justice, where a strong commitment to ethnic minorities is needed. However, since the current study has not confirmed the second-order factor of resiliency, the current study recommends the utilization of risk factor in order to assess the level of risk among youth offenders.</p>
<p>Despite this being the first examination of the RRC factor model, this study has several limitations. We used three ethnic groups assuming that each of the three groups was homogenous in terms of background culture. However, heterogeneity may exist in each of the three groups. For example, some Latino groups might differ substantially in terms of their country of origin or generation in the United States. Thus, future research should control for the confounding effects of possible subgroups among Latinos and African Americans. Future research should attempt to validate the RRC factor model using a variety of samples. This will address the generalizability of the model. We did not test the invariance of the RRC across gender or age groups. It is widely acknowledged that age effects are considerable. Age at first arrest was found to be significant with later recidivism. Most researchers have assumed that the determinants of delinquency are dependent on adolescent age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204012460875">LaGrange &amp; White, 1985</xref>). In addition, a different developmental stage may affect the degree of each predictor differently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204012460875">Heggeler (1991)</xref> reported that variances attributed to family relations, school influences, and delinquent peer relationships differed among age groups of 12, 15, and 18-year-olds. Therefore, the investigation of age effects across the diverse age groups is required.</p>
<p>In juvenile justice systems, the proportion of female offenders has been relatively small compared to their male counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460875">Emeka &amp; Sorensen, 2009</xref>). As a result, because females’ risk factors still remain unexplored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204012460875">Johanson &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 2009</xref>), most risk assessments have been derived from traditionally male-based risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204012460875">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204012460875">Salisbury, Voorjos. &amp; Spiropoulos, 2009</xref>). Therefore, most risk assessments fail to identify unique female risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204012460875">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>), or predict recidivism for female youth offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460875">Emeka &amp; Sorensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204012460875">Funk, 1999</xref>). Future studies on measurement invariance across gender groups are also required, although studies have reported that male and female delinquents and risk factors appear to have more similarities than differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204012460875">Johanson &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204012460875">Tracy, Kempf-Leonard, &amp; Abramoske-James, 2009</xref>). Moreover, further exploration of risk assessments that address gender-specific risk factors such as substance abuse, mental-health issues, victimization, out of home placement experience, and a history of physical and sexual abuse are also required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204012460875">Andrews et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204012460875">Emeka &amp; Sorensen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204012460875">Piquero et al., 2005</xref>)</p>
