<body>
<p>Stanley Aronowitz’s book on C. Wright Mills makes a major point of Mills’ use of densely textured social biography, social history personalized, to situate those who create and diffuse ideas. A very large difficulty marks the analysis. If thought is determined by its antecedents and context, why expect thinkers to develop a greater measure of human freedom than anyone else? If Wright Mills was the solitary prophet depicted by Aronowitz, why would his prophecy have carried as far as it did? The text studiously, even rigorously, avoids scrutiny of Mills’ own assumptions—but its utility (impossible to describe it as charm) is precisely the author’s capacity to look into the abyss, and then look away. That gives him a measure of consolation. He thinks that we would be, intellectually, much better off if his prescriptions were followed. A fallen intellectual world, however, provides him with much material for instructing the rest of us on our failings.</p>
<p>Aronowitz reproaches us for thinking in small terms, for refusing to confront the totality of our experience. We suffer from both lack of intellectual ambition and political timidity. The prevailing canons of scholarship do not encourage either risk taking or civic engagement, especially when engagement offends the vigilantes so ready to send posses onto our campuses. Mills seems larger, the smaller his intellectual biographer’s picture of his contemporaries and successors. Mills did not see himself in such starkly heroic terms. He had a good measure of capacity for self-criticism, and he was often unsparing with himself, perhaps too much so. He did not regard his life as a prolonged exercise of virtue but as the search for it.</p>
<p>Biography is the mode of the argument, and I can supply some. I was a graduate student in sociology at Harvard between 1947 and 1952, and did not in this period meet Mills. I heard him speak, once, at the Eastern Sociological Society meeting in New York in 1948. I knew persons who knew him (Lewis Coser, then studying sociology at Columbia was one and Clement Greenberg of <italic>Partisan Review</italic>, who knew him glancingly, was another). I did read his articles and books. I had decided to study sociology when an undergraduate at Williams College because I had read Lederer, Mannheim, Weber and thought of sociology as an inquiry into themes of class, nation, political, and social movements. I had also spent two wartime years as an employee at the Office of War Information in New York, and had met an interesting array of American and European academics, artists, journalists, writers—including some of the group around <italic>Partisan Review</italic> and the newer <italic>Commentary</italic>.</p>
<p>I suffered considerable bewilderment when I arrived at Harvard to find that the ideas and questions that concerned me were deemed unimportant by my teachers—or were phrased so differently as to be empty of texture and worse, unconnected to what I thought of as the world.</p>
<p>It was decidedly not primarily the work of Talcott Parsons, who was cultivated and historically aware. It was the result of a mind set termed “methodolatry” by the philosopher, Morton White, who I had the good fortune to come to know. What was primary was the construction of methods to study society. I recollect a striking instance of academic hazing by the anthropologist Clyde Kluckhohn, when he informed the first-year students in the Department of Social Relations (which then encompassed clinical and social psychology, social anthropology, and sociology as separate fields) that were Durkheim to present <italic>Suicide</italic> or Max Weber <italic>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</italic> posthumously to the Department as doctoral theses, these would be rejected on grounds of methodological insufficiency.</p>
<p>The Cold War and then an appreciably warmer version of it in Korea became permanent, nuclear weapons spread, the GI Bill, suburbanization, and union-achieved wage benefits in industry altered the domestic social landscape, a new industrialization of cultural production changed consciousness, and McCarthyism ravaged the political scene. In area studies, economics, history, and government, the Harvard faculty attempted to deal with a changed society, some by commuting to Washington regularly, others by creating doctrines like “modernization” to replace the formulations of the pre-war decades, still others by musing on the new American consensus. We were carted over to suburban Newton to study “social mobility” in a local high school and to reach the conclusion that offspring of educated middle-class families were more likely to attend Ivy institutions than offspring of the white working-class ethnic groups, Irish and Italian. Catholicism in American life was ignored, so was the problem of women, and African American existence merited a very loud silence.</p>
<p>Mills, applauded by Aronowitz, was later (especially in <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic>) to criticize the political instrumentalism and subordination of American sociology. The trouble at Harvard in my time there was, rather, Harvard sociology’s disconnection from politics, and from the larger currents of American and world history as well. Parsons was in this setting a convincingly ambiguous figure. He had studied in the decade following World War I at the London School of Economics and Heidelberg; as the son of a Midwestern theologian and college president who had been a missionary in Japan he could and did look with bemusement on the elite of the East Coast, and was quite aware of the torments of modern history. His passion for abstraction was a desperate attempt to make sense of the chaotic contradictions of mid-century society. Among the students, Parsons was most drawn to a contingent of Irish American Jesuits, and to a very sophisticated secular priest from Belgium. I think he appreciated their sense of history. He also had a positive view of the synthetic capacities of Catholic intellectuality.</p>
<p>Personally, I owe him a great deal. He sensed my restlessness, and initiated arrangements that made my years in Cambridge much much better. Harvard had begun to require of entering students that they take a sequence of General Education courses in the humanities, the natural sciences, the social sciences. A social science course on Western civilization, in some part a great books course, in another a view of modern society, had been developed by an inspired teacher and critical political philosopher, Sam Beer (who had been at pre-war Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar from Michigan and had an unfailing eye for the foibles of British and Cambridge society). He asked Parsons to suggest a graduate student in sociology to join the course as a Teaching Fellow, and Parsons did me the very great favor of asking Sam to consider me. At the same time, he proposed my name to the Master of the student college, Adams House, as a resident tutor. From the dismal periphery of the university I was able to move to its center, could teach some quite scintillating undergraduates, met contemporaries like Bernard Bailyn, McGeorge Bundy, Carl Kaysen, Henry Kissinger, Thomas Kuhn, and Richard Wilbur, and met too an entire contingent of faculty, H. Stuart Hughes, Perry Miller, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.</p>
<p>No doubt, Talcott was not acting only out of paternal generosity. There were not a lot of graduate students in sociology able to move in that company. My legacy as a New Yorker counted for much and a Williams education for the rest. I grasped Parsons’ pleasure and pride at his own ascent, through Amherst College, from an Ohio parsonage to senior status at Harvard. It was, then, no surprise when one day in 1952 he took from my hands on the steps of the building housing sociology (Emerson Hall, next to the Widener Library) a copy of the newly published <italic>White Collar</italic>. Declaring that he had not read it, he nonetheless opened with unerring accuracy to Mills’ description of the American university as a higher (or lower) synthesis of bureaucracy and feudalism. Rather unnecessarily, if with some irritation, he announced that the description did not correspond to his own understanding.</p>
<p>I left Harvard shortly thereafter and experienced in short order two very different societies. I spent a year in what was then West Germany gathering material for my doctoral dissertation, on the Reformation in German cities. I could not return at the end of the year to an assistant professorship at Harvard or any other place, since I had not finished it—and a compensatory stroke of good fortune brought me to the London School of Economics, where minor matters like doctorates were secondary to the capacity to put on what the British considered a good show: that required exhibiting presence and a decent modicum of wit. One had to convey one’s thoughts with a dosage of irony, which bespoke seeing through one’s own pretensions. That, in turn, indirectly but firmly carried the message that one’s interlocutors were at risk: they too could be subjected to stringent scrutiny. Learning these things was a matter of joining a club with unwritten but rather fixed rules. Somehow, I managed.</p>
<p>Mills was awarded a Fulbright for the academic year 1956 to 1957 to visit at the University of Copenhagen. I learned that he was there and my colleagues at the LSE invited him for a short visit in the spring of 1957. Appreciative of the hospitality and interest we showed, Mills asked why his initial inquiry to the LSE about joining us for the year had met with a negative response. He had asked through the Fulbright office in London and all that we could say was that they had not relayed the message.</p>
<p>Nineteen fifty-six had been the year of the Khruschev speech denouncing Stalin, of the near rising in Poland and the actual one in Hungary, of the Anglo-French-Israel assault on Egypt. At the International Sociological Congress in Amsterdam in 1956, two kinds of scholars from the Soviet bloc made their appearance. There were the familiar purveyors of official phrases, but there were also some critical spirits and some who expressed criticism by a dogged empiricism. Mills would have been in his element in the discussions but did not attend. By the time he came to London, the British response to all of this turbulence had taken several forms.</p>
<p>One group of scholars, predominantly historians (Christopher Hill, John Saville, Edward Thompson) had founded a journal of opposition within the British Communist Party, <italic>The Reasoner</italic>. John Saville showed me a letter from the executive committee of the party (Politburo would have been considered too un-British a term) to himself and Thompson. The leaders expressed interest in, even approval of, the editors’ insistence on more open discussion in the party. They would be glad to cooperate, and asked the editors as a token of good faith to suspend publication of their journal. They responded by leaving the party and continued with the journal, renamed <italic>The New Reasoner</italic>.</p>
<p>The twenty or so miles of water separating England from France did make a difference. Phillip II, Napoleon I, and Hitler each failed to clear Customs at Dover. The Anglo-Marxist historians of the journal <italic>Past and Present</italic> (there was marked overlap with <italic>The New Reasoner</italic> group) had taken the French journal <italic>Annales</italic> as a model. They considered economic processes and class struggles as long-term phenomena, and attended to their consequences for the formation of their nation. In their idea of society, simple notions of “base” and “super-structure” gave way to far more complex descriptions. The <italic>Annales</italic> historians emphasized what they termed “<italic>mentalite</italic>”—a mixture of cultural and ideological analysis. The <italic>Past and Present</italic> group and more conventional British historians were at odds. The latter, asked about the theoretic implications of their work, were likely to reply derisively. (“Theory? My dear chap, history is no theoretical matter, it is one damned thing after another.”) In fact, (I had joined the Board of Editors of <italic>Past and Present</italic>) as I dimly saw, they were united by a common belief in the uniqueness of Great Britain’s history. <italic>The New Reasoner</italic> editors, trying to make sense of post-Labour Britain, saw in Mills someone who wrote of American history as itself unique, a thinker they could appreciate.</p>
<p>There was another new journal on the scene. It was <italic>Universities and Left Review</italic>, first published at Oxford in the fall of 1956 after the Soviet repression in Hungary and the failed invasion of Egypt. Its editors were a Jamaican, Stuart Hall, a Canadian, Charles Taylor, a Londoner from the Jewish labor movement, Ralph Samuel, and a lifelong student of British literature, Gabriel Pearson. The social changes wrought by post-war Labour had opened the universities to working-class and lower middle-class students. Most concentrated on careers, and the Oxford journal’s editors took it upon themselves to articulate what they supposed were their contemporaries’ critical impulses. That included considerable admiration for the critical and experimental energies of American culture. It combined with disdain for the cultural unimaginativeness of the Labour leadership. The older Marxists of <italic>The New Reasoner</italic> taxed the leadership of the Labour Party with too much readiness to accept an anodyne class compromise. <italic>Universities and Left Review</italic> charged it with ignoring the new cultural classnessless. An enlarged editorial board included any number of academics, but also cineasts like Lindsay Anderson and writers like Doris Lessing and Iris Murdoch.</p>
<p>Mills by the time he came to London was already charmed by the color and density of European culture. Now he was received as someone who had much to teach a post-imperial Britain—by British intellectuals who did not stand on cultural seniority. It was quite unlike the reception he had coming from Texas and Wisconsin to New York. The editors asked him how he would go about writing a British <italic>Universities and Left Review</italic> version of <italic>White Collar</italic>. They called his attention to the cultural criticism of Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams, who asked about the consequences of the new patterns of social class in Britain for what had been fixed demarcations in knowledge, sensibility, taste. These were not matters for which his talks with Lionel Trilling and William Phillips had prepared Mills. I did what I could to serve as Mills’ guide, and learned early on that he preferred to struggle with foreign matter on his own.</p>
<p>David Glass and T.H. Marshall, veterans of the 1930s and 1940s, were our senior colleagues and they set aside the skepticism they normally reserved for matters and persons American to spend quite a lot of time with the visitor. Glass indeed gave a party in his honor to which an interesting cross section of London’s left intelligentsia came. I introduced Mills to the <italic>Universities and Left Review</italic> group at my apartment in Hampstead.</p>
<p>At some time during this crowded initial visit, Wright met our colleague in political science, Ralph Miliband. He has been written about recently as if his most memorable achievement were the fathering of the Miliband brothers. Ralph was the last student of Harold Laski and a considerable presence in the Labour Party, where he was the academic voice of the party’s left wing, dissenting from the new consensus voiced by the party’s leader, Hugh Gaitskell, the pursuit of (in Gaitskell’s words) “a modest program of social reform.” Ralph knew a great deal about France and the rest of Europe, had joined the editors of <italic>The Reasoner</italic> once they left the Communist Party, and had an inner independence (even defiance) that clearly appealed to Mills.</p>
<p>Later, Mills travelled to some of the Soviet bloc countries with Miliband. They became close friends, united by common residence in the borderland in which moral commitment fixes political choices. Mills appreciated Miliband’s use of his role as a recognized critic of the reigning welfarist consensus in Britain, of the vantage point his affiliations in the Labour Party afforded, and of his international network of colleagues and political comrades. The intellectual currents of the nascent British New Left, with a protest movement at Britain’s military nuclearization, flowed into politics in ways then unthinkable in the United States.</p>
<p>The British universities were more openly hospitable to radical thinkers than their American counterparts, a consequence of the confluence of several things. There were obdurate British traditions of both empiricism and liberalism which insisted on naming things by their names. There was also the experience of the British elites at riding with punches. John Wycliffe, the medieval theological dissident, was at Balliol College, which has cultivated its radicalism since. That has not prevented it from graduating all kinds of academics, bankers, businessmen, civil servants, journalists, politicians, theologians, writers who in one or another way ran their country. Indeed, it lent a bit of color and depth to their views of the world. Finally, a certain obviousness (mixed with obliviousness) in American interventions in British and European intellectual life engendered resentment. Mills joined an interesting list of Americans and Europeans not invited to participate in events sponsored by the Congress for Cultural Freedom or to publish in its journals like <italic>Encounter</italic> and <italic>Der Monat</italic> and <italic>Preuves</italic>. Some suspected the CIA provenance of their funding, others disliked the manners of the Americans in charge of the project. <italic>Encounter</italic>, indeed, later published an attack on Mills by Edward Shils which many found distasteful.</p>
<p>Britain was not like the continent and the Western European democracies were quite different from the societies ruled by single parties which could not escape their Stalinist origins. Aronowitz suggests that Mills enjoyed Europe so much because he found the intellectual and political companionship there he lacked in the United States. It was not my impression that Mills experienced his life in the United States as deprived. His very positive response to Europe had a distinctly American dimension. In welcoming him, the Europeans were honoring the alternative America of his own imagination, a nation returned to itself. He appointed himself to an ambassadorship of the spirit.</p>
<p>What were Mills’ ideas and how can we now respond? Aronowitz is a helpful guide to their manifest content, once we grasp that he also wishes us to accept his idea of Mills’ America. I am quite unsure that the decades he describes can be understood in his terms, and I think Mills is at once more flawed and more profound, the messenger bearing disappointed hopes and very uncertain advice on a new beginning.</p>
<p>Recall that advertisement in the New York subway depicting an American Indian eating, with obvious enjoyment, a corned beef sandwich. The inscription read: “You do not have to be Jewish to like Levy’s rye bread.” You do not have to be Texan to understand much of our nation’s history, but it helps. It was contested terrain (European invaders against Indians, Anglos against Mexicans, slaveholders against freeholders, blacks against whites, small farmers against big ones) before industrialization. The late nineteenth and early twentieth century class conflicts added to earlier ones, inclined Texas to populism and then the New Deal. When Mills went to the University of Texas at Austin as an undergraduate, he had an array of radical traditions to draw upon. There was also a family history of migration and unremitting toil, of mixed religious descent.</p>
<p>Mills’ neglect of culture and religion in his own account of his development—and in his later account of American society—is quite striking. He came to pragmatism as a solitary seeker of truth, a figure he derided when others claimed it. His earlier writings on pragmatism are rather cursory in dealing with the Protestant legacies of Dewey and James. As he was working on an American philosophic legacy, he was absorbing another one, the critical sorts of German thought Hans Gerth had brought to Wisconsin. It is not difficult to understand the dilemmas of the younger Mills. A critical sociology as the culmination of the secular march of American thought was (and is) an ideal construction. Add to the burdens of working on this path the difficult task of understanding another culture’s response to modernity, and the load becomes unsupportably heavy, even for Mills with his quite unusual determination. What he sought was a view of the whole of American society, and he sought it for the purposes of engaged citizenship.</p>
<p>The younger Mills taught at the University of Maryland as the New Deal expansion of government gave way to the wartime consolidation of the powers of the American state. It would have been simple for Mills to find an initial area of inquiry in which he could move easily between the academy and governmental consulting and research. Instead, he moved to Columbia. It was a productive center of sociological inquiry and the young Mills’ intellectual aspirations were certainly represented by his elder colleagues Robert Lynd and Robert MacIver. Mills had signed on at the Bureau of Applied Social Research as an intellectual journeyman, and turned to full time teaching at Columbia College later. The move to New York had other dimensions. No one is born a metropolitan intellectual. They are made, not born—and self-made, at that. It is as true of migrants from Brooklyn and the lower East Side as of those from westward of the Hudson River. Mills had written for Dwight Macdonald’s <italic>Politics</italic>, and clearly envisaged a career for himself at the center of the New York vortex. As I gather from talks with him much later, he was surprised to find that it had no center. Ethnicity, generation, ideology, politics were foci of the formation of cliques and anti-cliques. Mills made friends of longer and shorter duration: Bell and Macdonald, his Columbia colleague Hofstadter, the writers Miller, Swados, Wakefield. His articles were admired by some, indifferently perused by more, ignored by many.</p>
<p>Mills’ book on labor, <italic>The New Men of Power</italic> (1948), was a confession of disorientation. After large gains in numbers and political influence during the New Deal and wartime years, the unions expected to assume a major role in the post-war social settlement. There was no settlement, and a continuous if somewhat haphazard process of primarily economic bargaining ensued instead. A third of the labor force, primarily in industry, was unionized, but had to struggle with capital and its political representatives over every concession. Indeed, the term “concession” speaks volumes: unions could effectively claim little as rights. True, when Truman unexpectedly won the 1948 Presidential election, the chair of the Democratic National Committee declared the victory was owed above all to organized labor. Subsequent expressions of gratitude were conspicuous by their absence. The workers thought of themselves as citizens occasionally, consumers always. The most historically acute of their leaders, like Walter Reuther of the automobile workers, reluctantly renounced earlier demands for participation in management in favor of major gains in wages. Unionization drives in the South failed. Post-war labor legislation had put a stop to the New Deal attempt to include union representation and power in a new Constitutional jurisprudence. The new men of power were, like their contemporaries in the cultural industry, business and finance, government and politics, opportunistic manipulators at worst, resigned realists at best. In no case would they lead the United States into a second, more extensive New Deal. They would keep what could be kept of the first one and rely on a fragile American consensus for the rest.</p>
<p><italic>White Collar</italic> was published in 1952 (the preface is dated first of May, 1951) and depicts the social composition of that consensus. It joins analysis of the bureaucratization of economy and society to a portrait of the culture and politics of a changed nation. It owes a very great deal to the European writings of the period between the two World Wars, but lends an American pathos to the new situation—in which personal autonomy and democratic citizenship suffer equally. <italic>The Power Elite</italic>, published four years later, may be read as a large appendix to <italic>White Collar</italic>. It was a sketch (in black) of the political consequences, systematic passivity, of a society organized by and for its upper strata. It was also a description of Cold War America, in which political centralization and cultural leveling were related necessities of social mobilization. <italic>White Collar</italic> earned Mills, along with some stringent criticism, a good deal of praise. <italic>The Power Elite</italic> was for many hard to take, since it made them out to be willing accomplices of a situation they ostensibly and in some cases ostentatiously deplored.</p>
<p><italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> (1959) was a self-justificatory tract. Mills situated himself in a larger tradition of historical analysis and philosophical reflection, deplored the limiting canons then dominant in academic American sociology. They were not dominant, however, in American historiography or political philosophy, or a good deal of political science, and did not impress the macro-economists. In no case were they dominant in Western Europe. In the Soviet bloc, per contra, a bit of obsessive empiricism was frequently an expression of rebelliousness. <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> was a chapter in a long quarrel, of interest to its American participants and of course, their captive publics, junior colleagues and students and decidedly less so to others.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, <italic>White Collar</italic> and <italic>The Power Elite</italic> were widely and respectfully discussed. <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> was largely ignored. Methodological arguments were pronouncedly national. When <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> appeared, the British were taken with Ernest Gellner’s criticism of the limitations of analytical philosophy as then practiced in their universities (<italic>Words And Things</italic>.) Some years later, Paul Lazarsfeld visited Oxford, intimated his large capacity to restrain his enthusiasm for Mills, and declared that he, Lazarsfeld, thought about matters political only “after six o’clock.” I recall the indignation with which Jean Flood and A.H. Halsey responded. In 1963, a German translation of <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> appeared and I wrote an introduction to situate it in its American context, which was what interested the German public. Mills’ writings on social structure were well received in France, but the contemporaries of Braudel, Merleau-Ponty, and Sartre did not consider that they required instruction on method from across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In the final years of Mills’ life, he achieved his early ambitions of political influence. In 1958, he published <italic>The Causes of World War Three</italic>. Originally a set of lectures at the LSE, it very tentatively extended the depiction of the concentration of power in the United States of the Cold War to the Soviet Union, to portray the superpowers on a collision course for nuclear war. In 1960 he published <italic>Listen, Yankee</italic>, in which a fictive Cuban revolutionary voices Latin American as well as Cuban grievances with the United States. In 1960, too, he published a “Letter To The New Left” (in <italic>New Left Review</italic> and the American journal, <italic>Studies On The Left</italic>) proposing a long-term strategy for social transformation.</p>
<p>Reading <italic>The Causes of World War Three</italic> today, one is reminded of the familiar texts on the near catastrophic outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1963. <italic>Listen, Yankee</italic> justifies the authoritarianism of the Cuban Revolution and Castro’s enlistment in the Soviet bloc as a defense against the permanent counter-revolution organized by the United States. The “Letter To The New Left” is, by contrast with the familiar simplifications of the first two texts, an attempt to discern in the complexities of industrial society in the second half of the twentieth century new if obstacled roads to participatory democracy and the sovereignty of autonomous citizens.</p>
<p>The question of how much political influence Mills had is, of course, a matter of interpretation. Even without the popular and polemical texts of his last years, Mills’ major books were extremely influential contributions to American debate on the historical situation of the nation. Aronowitz mentions a number of persons with whom Mills argued, corresponded, taught, quite a few of them interesting and influential intellectuals themselves. He was an active reviewer of other scholars’ work and had access to sites as varied as <italic>Dissent, Partisan Review</italic>, and <italic>The New York Times Book Review</italic>. Yet Aronowitz depicts Mills as lonely and solitary—so much so that he sought relief in his activities and friendships in Europe.</p>
<p>I do not think the imagery used by Aronowitz is appropriate. Mills had a distinctive voice, but he was not alone in expressing profound skepticism about the direction of American society and strenuous opposition to mobilization for the Cold War. Marcuse’s <italic>One-Dimensional Man</italic> (1964) was preceded by his profound, if not always widely read, <italic>Eros and Civilization</italic> (1955) in which the theory of “surplus repression” was developed. That was a psycho-cultural premise of a culture which could afford persons much more inner and outer autonomy. John Kenneth Galbraith’s <italic>The Affluent Society</italic> (1958), an entire set of historical works critical of American foreign policy and social development by William Appleman Williams in the 1950s, Paul Goodman’s <italic>Growing Up Absurd</italic>, were quite consonant with Mills’ American legend. Mills, with Mailer among others, was indeed a dissenting voice in the 1952 <italic>Partisan Review</italic> symposium “Our Country and Our Culture.” When the journal published a symposium on the Cold War in 1962, shortly after Mills’ sadly early death, his insistence on the deformation of American democracy in the Cold War was echoed by several of the contributors. David Riesman and Mills portrayed the United States with very different accents, although the other-directed protagonists of <italic>The Lonely Crowd</italic> obviously peopled the offices, schools, shopping malls, and suburbs of <italic>White Collar</italic>. Yet Riesman was anything but a celebrant of post-war American politics. In the “Committees of Correspondence” he initiated in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he joined, most importantly, significant segments of the scientific community in opposition not only to the arms race but to the cultural and political processes which engendered it.</p>
<p>The student component of the American social movements first audible at the end of the 1950s included many who had read Mills. The major role of intellectuals, primarily students, teachers, writers, in these movements in several societies clearly encouraged Mills to turn to what he termed the cultural apparatus in his quest for agents of creative dissidence in modern societies. The history of nations in which there have been sizable groups of intellectuals does not, however, allow the conclusion that they are invariably adherents of progress or bearers of civic courage. There is plenty of contrary evidence. The European intellectuals on both sides of the Berlin Wall sought, in the late 1950s and the 1960s, alliances with other population strata. They thought that their own custodianship of knowledge imposed moral responsibilities on them which other citizens would honor. The report of the Czech Academy of Sciences in 1966 on the possibilities of cultural and social development in industrial societies, edited by Radovan Richta, was a charter of social reform, a Soviet bloc counterpart to a considerable amount of Western thinking. The ensuing movement for “socialism with a human face” was erased by the Stalinists, and post-Soviet Eastern Europe is not led by critical intellectuals.</p>
<p>There is an interesting footnote to Mills’ championship of the Cuban Revolution. Jean Daniel, the French journalist, was one of the last visitors to talk with John Kennedy before his murder in Dallas. Daniel had stopped in Washington en route to an appointment with Fidel Castro in Havana, and asked the President if he had any message for his Cuban colleague. Daniel recounts Kennedy saying that perhaps Castro could remind himself that he, Kennedy, was not a professor of sociology but President of the United States and under decidedly non-professorial constraints. One supposes that Kennedy had read <italic>Listen, Yankee</italic>. He might even have read <italic>The Causes of World War Three</italic>. The text of his speech outlining a project for co-existence (June 10, 1963 at American University) would not have displeased Mills. Unfortunately, the speech may have contributed to Kennedy’s fate.</p>

<label>Editor’s Note:</label>
<p>In the acknowledgements to <italic>The Sociological Imagination</italic> (Oxford University Press, 1959, p. 228), Mills thanks 32 fellow scholars for their help as he wrote the book, not all of them sociologists, most of them now deceased. He named, among others, Robert Bierstedt, Herbert Blumer, Tom Bottomore, Lewis Coser, Robert Dubin, Si Goode, Marjorie Fiske, Peter Gay, Llewellyn Gross, Richard Hofstadter, Irving Howe, H. Stuart Hughes, Floyd Hunter, David Kettler, Charles E. Lindblom, Ernst Manheim, Ralph Miliband, Barrington Moore, Jr., David Riesman, Meyer Shapiro, Paul Sweezy, and the novelist, Harvey Swados. Mills could hardly have found better or more influential scholarly advisors than these. Among them, Robert Dubin (b. 1916), Peter Gay (b. 1923), Llewellyn Gross (b. 1914), David Kettler (b. 1930), and Charles E. Lindblom (b. 1917) survive. One other name appears on Mills’ list, that of Norman Birnbaum (b. 1926), whose work still regularly appears in <italic>The Nation</italic> and elsewhere, especially in European outlets with strong political orientations. His multilingual cultural and political analyses remain unique among sociologists born in the United States, and his understanding of Mills is personally anchored and politically astute in ways that cannot be duplicated by scholars who did not know Mills in his prime. It is for this reason that I asked him to evaluate Stanley Aronowitz’s new book.</p>
