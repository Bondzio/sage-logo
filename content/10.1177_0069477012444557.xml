<title>Fatal Poisonings Due to Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines or Ethanol</title>
<p>A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess the association between buprenorphine-related death and use of benzodiazepines or ethanol. Subjects aged 14 to 44 years at the time of death were identified from Finland’s postmortem toxicology database between 2000 and 2008. During the study period, 1363 opioid-positive cases were identified, of which 391 (29%) involved buprenorphine. Buprenorphine poisoning was considered the primary cause of death in 182 cases, with accidental poisonings accounting for 94%. The mean age at time of death was 27 years. Of the 391 cases observed, 92% involved no other opioids than buprenorphine, 82% involved benzodiazepine(s), and 58% involved ethanol. Compared with other causes of death, 79% involved no additional opioids, 83% involved benzodiazepines, and 32% involved ethanol. Concurrent use of alcohol and buprenorphine was also more commonly associated with fatal poisonings than in cases with other causes of death (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Only 1 fatal poisoning was identified that did not involve either alcohol or drugs other than buprenorphine. The mean fatal buprenorphine concentration was found to be 4.5 µg/L. The median blood buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine ratio was 1.8 in fatal buprenorphine poisonings compared with 0.86 for cases with other primary causes of death. Among fatal buprenorphine poisonings, death occurred immediately, was delayed, or followed an unknown course in 10%, 52%, and 38% of cases, respectively.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that use of benzodiazepines and alcohol was more likely to be associated with a fatal buprenorphine poisoning than other causes of death. Benzodiazepines may act synergistically with opioids in reducing respiratory function and increase the risk of opioid overdose. The authors note that buprenorphine concentrations are not a major determinant of the fatal outcomes observed, as serum concentrations vary significantly depending on the level of opioid tolerance in an individual patient; however, a buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine level &gt;1 was suggestive of poisoning and &lt;1 suggestive of other causes of death.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: Drug Interactions and Increased Risk of Myopathy</title>
<p>On March 1, 2012, the FDA notified health care professionals of revisions to prescribing information regarding interactions between protease inhibitors and certain statin drugs that increased the blood levels of statins and increased the risk for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Labeling revisions also included dosing recommendations for those statins that may safely be coadministered with HIV or HCV protease inhibitors.</p>

<title>Lansoprazole, Disopyramide No. 75</title>
<sec id="section8-0069477012444557">
<title>Drug Interaction: QT Prolongation</title>
<p>A 73-year-old female was admitted to the hospital due to recurrent syncope. Concurrent medications included disopyramide (300 mg daily), methimazole (5 mg daily), and lansoprazole (15 mg daily); lansoprazole had been initiated 1 month prior to admission. Past medical history was significant for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hyperthyroidism. Electrocardiogram 3 months prior to admission revealed a corrected QT interval of 0.57 seconds; on admission, the corrected QT interval had increased to 0.69 seconds with the development of Torsades de Pointes. Laboratory results including electrolytes (potassium, calcium, magnesium), thyroid function, and renal function were within normal limits. The patient was treated with rapid cardiac pacing (100/minute) and disopyramide was discontinued. Repeat electrocardiogram showed a corrected QT interval of 0.52 seconds without Torsades de Pointes. Carvedilol (10 mg daily) was later initiated for left ventricular obstruction without recurrence of QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that lansoprazole may influence the pharmacokinetics of disopyramide, potentially causing prolonged corrected QT interval and Torsades de Pointes. Disopyramide is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, whereas lansoprazole is metabolized by CYP2C9 and 3A4. While not available in this case, the authors note that genetic testing for long QT syndrome and CYP polymorphisms may further explain this interaction.</p>

<title>Necrotizing Fasciitis (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012444557">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 59-year-old female presented with severe pain in the right axillary line that had persisted for 6 hours. Past medical history included hypothyroidism, cerebrovascular ischemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. Prior treatment regimens for rheumatoid arthritis had included methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, adalimumab, and etanercept. Two months prior to presentation, the patient had been initiated on monotherapy with intravenous tocilizumab (800 mg every 4 weeks). Laboratory results, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram were normal, and the patient was prescribed diclofenac and acetaminophen for suspected myalgia or bursitis. Several hours later, the patient returned to the emergency department due to increasing pain. Physical exam then revealed a tender small red spot next to the right breast. Computed tomography scan revealed suspicion of extended infection, which was possibly necrotizing fasciitis. The patient was treated with gentamicin, penicillin, and clindamycin for sepsis due to <italic>Streprococcus pyogenes</italic>. She also underwent surgical debridement of the pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, and latissimus dorsi muscles. Diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis was confirmed, and the patient continued treatment with penicillin and clindamycin for 11 days in addition to receiving intravenous immune globulin. Hydrocortisone was also administered on days 6 to 10 in accordance with hospital protocol. Two additional surgical debridements were performed due to disease progression; however, the patient later developed multi-organ failure and infectious complications and subsequently died.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient’s disease course was likely exacerbated due to the immunosuppressive effects of tocilizumab on interleukin-6. While causality could not be determined in this case, infectious complications are known to occur after treatment with tocilizumab. The authors recommend further postmarketing surveillance to determine the true association of this potentially lethal adverse reaction with use of tocilizumab.</p>

<title>Serious Adverse Effects</title>
<p>A retrospective study was conducted to describe the adverse drug reactions associated with bevacizumab. Reports were identified from the French Pharmacovigilance Database between 2005 and November 2010. During the study period, 455 reported cases were identified. Of these, 351 cases were “serious” and were associated with 626 reported adverse drug reactions. Among reported serious adverse drug reactions, 40 cases were grade 6 (death), 42 were grade 5 (life threatening), 14 were grade 4 (disability/incapacity), 208 were grade 3 (hospital admission/prolonged hospitalization), and 47 were grade 2 (medical intervention/drug withdrawal). Bevacizumab was the only suspected agent in 121 (34.3%) cases. Median duration of bevacizumab exposure was 4 cycles (range 1-30) when the adverse drug reactions were reported. Adverse drug reactions primarily affected the gastrointestinal (21.9%) or nervous system (11%), with reports also associated with vascular disorders (9.4%) or respiratory system disorders (9.1%). The most commonly reported serious adverse drug reactions were gastrointestinal perforation (4.8%), thromboembolic events (4%), pulmonary embolism (3.2%), hypertension (2.7%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (2.7%), and cerebral hemorrhage or vascular accident (2.6%).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that bevacizumab has been associated with a variety of severe adverse drug reactions. The authors reinforce the importance of reporting adverse drug reaction cases to pharmacovigilance systems to further describe the safety profile of new pharmacologic agents.</p>

<title>Acute Pancreatitis</title>
<p>A 53-year-old male presented with nausea and intolerable abdominal pain in the right and left upper quadrants that had appeared suddenly and lasted for 2 to 3 hours. Concurrent medications included aspirin (81 mg daily), metformin (1000 mg every morning and 1500 mg every evening), simvastatin (80 mg at bedtime), tadalafil (20 mg as needed), glimepiride (4 mg twice daily), and subcutaneous liraglutide (1.2 mg daily). The liraglutide dose was initiated 2 months prior to presentation. Abnormal laboratory parameters on admission included elevated amylase (3963 units/L; reference = 20-90 units/L) and lipase (&gt;15 000 units/L; reference = 73-393 units/L). Hemoglobin A1c was 14.4% three months prior to admission. Laboratory parameters were within normal limits with the exception of blood glucose (410 mg/dL; reference = 70-110 mg/dL), white blood cell count (12 800 cells/µL; reference = 4000-12 000), and absolute neutrophil count (10 400 cells/µL; reference = 1500-8000 cells/µL). Computed tomography scan revealed peripancreatic inflammation, and acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. All medications were discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous fluids and analgesics. Insulin detemir (5-13 units daily) was initiated for basal glycemic control. Amylase and lipase levels decreased over 7 days. The patient was discharged on hospital day 8, at which time amylase and lipase levels were 133 and 532 units/L, respectively. Home medications were restarted at discharge with the exception of liraglutide. Enalapril (5 mg daily) was also added for renal protection.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient likely experienced pancreatitis due to liraglutide. Application of the Naranjo probability algorithm produced a score of 5, indicating a probable causative relationship. Liraglutide has rarely been associated with cases of pancreatitis, and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program is established for this agent. The authors did not propose a mechanism for this adverse reaction.</p>

<title>Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy</title>
<p>A literature review of case reports of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following electroconvulsive therapy was performed to examine the evidence of this condition following electroconvulsive therapy. The literature search produced 7 documented cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 4 cases of myocardial stunning, and 1 case of cardiogenic shock following electroconvulsive therapy. Of the 7 document cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, 2 cases were documented after single sessions of electroconvulsive therapy, 2 cases were documented after the patient had received multiple electroconvulsive therapy sessions, and 3 cases involved the successful readministration of electroconvulsive therapy in patients with a history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following electroconvulsive therapy. Patients received β-blockers in 4 of the cases. The authors do not report the exact time frame for β-blocker administration. The authors note that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not mentioned in 5 cases; however, some clinical characteristics were consistent with this diagnosis. Patients in the majority of cases had return of normal left ventricular ejection fraction function and electrocardiogram results within a few days after therapy.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a serious but transient potential complication of electroconvulsive therapy.

<title>Hepatic Failure</title>
<p>A 46-year-old female patient developed hepatic failure after a 5-week course of oral itraconazole (200 mg daily) for onychomycosis. Nausea and vomiting gradually presented following initiation of itraconazole. Generalized pruritus ensued 1 week before admission. She was jaundiced on examination without abdominal tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory results were alanine transaminase 2571 IU/L, aspartate transaminase 3789 IU/L, total bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL, albumin 3.1 g/dL, prothrombin time 13.57 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.43. Serum antinuclear antibody and anti–smooth muscle antibody, as well as tests for hepatitis A, B, C, and E were negative. Multiple erythematous papules appeared on her lower extremities 5 days after admission. Pathological findings were compatible with a diagnosis of erythema multiforme. Despite supportive treatment, the patient’s condition worsened. She developed ascites 10 days after admission, and laboratory results were reported as alanine transaminase 532 IU/L, aspartate transaminase 1298 IU/L, total bilirubin 12.8 mg/dL, albumin 2.3 g/dL, prothrombin time 18.35 seconds, and international normalized ratio 2.77. Initial treatment was intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg every 8 hours). The dose was decreased (20 mg every 12 hours) over 1 week and the patient dramatically improved. Ascites was resolved and laboratory values were total bilirubin 8.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time 12.75 seconds, and international normalized ratio 1.24. The patient was transitioned to oral prednisone (10 mg every 12 hours), and her conditioned deteriorated shortly after. A liver biopsy showed cholestasis hepatitis with marked bile plugs. Methylprednisolone (20 mg every 8 hours) was restarted and gradually tapered over 2 weeks. The patient remained stable and was discharged on hospital day 36.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced hepatic failure due to drug-induced hepatotoxicity related to itraconazole. According to the Naranjo causality algorithm, this reaction was rated as probable in relation to the drug (score = 6).</p>

<title>Lumbosacral Paresthesia</title>
<p>Reports of lumbosacral paresthesia are described in a phase II study evaluating an intensive protocol used to treat central nervous system recurrence of systemic B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The regimen consisted of dexamethasone (40 mg on days 1-4), cis-platin (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1), cytarabine (2 × 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> on day 2), rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 5), and methotrexate (3 g/m<sup>2</sup> on day 15). Once the regimen was completed, autologous stem cell transplantation was performed in patients with recurrent aggressive B-cell lymphoma with central nervous system localization. The above regimen was administered as three 28-day cycles. Rituximab was initially administered as 10 mg with subsequent increases to 25 mg if no toxicity occurred. None of the patients experienced side effects after the intrathecal administration of rituximab with the exception of a minor sensation of pressure in the sacral area in 1 patient. However, after the first administration of the higher dose, 2 of 12 patients experienced very painful paraesthesia in the buttocks, legs, and feet immediately after administration. The duration of pain was 30 to 60 minutes. Despite adaptation of the protocol, including a new dilution and additional premedicants, another patient reported similar symptoms with resolution of pain occurring within a few hours. A reduction of the rituximab dose to 10 mg in combination with intrathecal dexamethasone (4 mg) was used to treat an additional 12 patients without further reports of paraesthesias.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the painful yet transient adverse effect of intrathecal rituximab prevents this agent being safely administered at higher doses via lumbar puncture. They note that this has not been reported after intraventricular administration.</p>

<title>Skin Reaction</title>
<p>A maculopapular rash developed in 9 of 13 metastatic melanoma patients who were initially treated with ipilimumab and then switched to vemurafenib. The dose of ipilimumab ranged from 3 to 10 mg/kg for 1 to 11 doses. A grade 3 rash developed in 4 of the patients within 6 to 8 days after the initiation of vemurafenib and was not responsive to treatment with glucocorticoids. The rash began on the face or chest and progressed to the back, trunk, and extremities. Development of rash was not associated with the occurrence of an immune-related adverse event during treatment with ipilimumab. Pathological examination of rash site revealed spongiotic and perivascular dermatitis, with lymphocytes and eosinophils, consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction. In all patients who had grade 3 rash (n = 4), vemurafenib therapy was interrupted for up to 11 days to allow resolution of the rash. All 4 patients were retreated with a lower dose of vermurafenib without serious event.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that some patients with prior ipilimumab treatment experienced a rash during the first week of therapy with vemurafenib. They noted that clinicians should be aware of this possible reaction and that it is not responsive to treatment with glucocorticoids. They suggest that treatment with a lower dose of vemurafenib after therapy interruption may be better tolerated.</p>

<title>Hospitalizations Related to Hyponatremia</title>
<p>In a retrospective case–control study, risk factors were evaluated for patients who were hospitalized with the primary or secondary diagnosis of hyponatremia while concurrently receiving thiazide therapy. Of 10 805 patients identified, 1802 cases (hyponatremia related to thiazide use) and 9003 control (thiazide use without hyponatremia) patients were selected and analyzed for risk factors. Patient cases were significantly older (mean age = 71.1 vs 60.5 years; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and weighed less (mean weight = 74.0 vs 88.2 kg; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) than the control group. In addition, a greater percentage of the case group was women (70.8% vs 57.3%). Hydrochlorothiazide and thiazide combinations represented the majority of thiazide use in both groups. However, the case group had a higher percentage of concurrent therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, potassium supplements, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or potassium sparing diuretics. Comorbidities present more often in the case group included hyperlipidemia, hypokalemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, type 2 diabetes, and urinary tract infections. Multivariate analysis revealed that a 10-year increase in age corresponded with a 75% increased risk of hospitalizations related to thiazide-associated hyponatremia. An increase of 5 kg also resulted in a 9% decrease in the risk of thiazide-associated hyponatremia. Other risk factors included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which had an odds ratio of 1.53 of developing thiazide-associated hyponatremia. Potassium supplements had a protective effect with a decreased odds ratio of 0.60. Gender was not a risk factor. In addition, the 5 most frequent comorbidities were also considered a risk factor after analysis. In particular, hypokalemia was associated with 40-fold higher risk of developing thiazide-associated hyponatremia, whereas patients with a urinary tract infection were only 4 times as likely to develop thiazide-associated hyponatremia.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that advanced age was associated with an increased risk of developing thiazide-associated hyponatremia, whereas an incremental increase in weight was associated with a protective effect. Additional risk factors included the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the presence of hypokalemia, urinary tract infections, type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or hyperlipidemia. The authors cautioned clinicians that these risk factors should be considered when initiating patients on thiazide diuretics. In addition, closer monitoring of such patients may reduce the incidence of hospitalizations related to hyponatremia.</p>

<title>Abuse in the United Kingdom</title>
<p>A review of relevant databases, literature, and Internet sites was performed to identify key data on phenazepam use and abuse in the United Kingdom. Information from the review suggested that there is a potential for serious adverse health effects when the drug is being used recreationally. The first use of the drug was reported in the United Kingdom in October 2009 with the first 2 deaths associated with abuse occurring in July and November of 2011. A total of 9 fatalities have been reported in which this agent was identified in postmortem toxicological screenings.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the abuse of phenazepam may present health problems as frequency of use increases. Clinicians should be aware of what types of symptoms and health problems might occur.</p>

<title>Toxicity from Repeated Dosing in Children</title>
<p>A systematic review of cases describing toxicity associated with repeated acetaminophen dosing in children was performed. Cases were collected from the published literature, voluntary adverse event reports received by the Food and Drug Administration and/or manufacturer, and cases reported to the National Poison Data System of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Cases were defined as children who were younger than 6 years of age who had repeated exposure to acetaminophen (at least 2 doses over greater than 8 hours) and where a death or hepatic abnormality was mentioned in the report. The reports were assessed by a panel of 5 physicians with substantial experience in the assessment and treatment of acetaminophen poisoning in children. A total of 2531 cases were identified, of which 146 unique cases met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 102 were rated at least potentially related to acetaminophen (76 nonfatal hepatic abnormality and 26 deaths). Of the remaining 44 cases, 15 were judged as unlikely related, 11 lacked sufficient information to determine hepatotoxicity related to acetaminophen, and 18 were excluded based on further review of inclusion criteria. Of the 76 related nonfatal cases with hepatic abnormality, 63% were younger than 2 years of age and 63% were female. The acetaminophen dosing was therapeutic in 12% of the cases, supratherapeutic in 57%, and unknown in 32% of the cases. For the fatal cases that were at least potentially related to acetaminophen, 54% were younger than 2 years of age, and 355 were male. The reported dosing was therapeutic (less than 75 mg/kg daily) in 4% of the cases and supratherapeutic (greater than 75 mg/kg/d) in 58% of the cases and could not be determined in 38% of the cases. The lowest dose associated with a fatal outcome was 9.4 mg/kg daily.</p>
<p>After an extensive review of the case reports that described toxicity associated with repeated dosing of acetaminophen in young children, the authors noted that majority of cases involved dosing greater than 75 mg/kg daily. They suggested that acetaminophen doses less than 75 mg/kg daily may be safe for children less than 6 years.</p>

<title>Severe Cytomegalovirus Reactivation and Gastritis (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012444557">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 71-year-old female patient with grade 3 follicular B cell lymphoma developed cytomegalovirus reactivation after receiving combination chemotherapy with bendamustine (90 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d on days 1 and 2) and rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1) every 21 days. One week prior to cycle 4, the patient was hospitalized with fever, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and severe epigastric pain. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria, and a chest x-ray was negative. However, a cytomegalovirus antigen screen yielded a cytomegalovirus viral copy number of more than 1 000 000/mL. Epigastric evaluation revealed numerous punctate areas of gastric mucosal erythema and ulceration, especially in the fundus. Results of a biopsy demonstrated mild to moderate inflammation with mucosal edema and focal interstitial hemorrhage. After treatment with anti-cytomegalovirus therapy, including intravenous gancyclovir followed by oral valgancyclovir, the fever and gastric pain resolved promptly. The cytomegalovirus antigen titer decreased and became undetectable after 7 weeks of antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient developed cytomegalovirus reactivation during treatment with bendamustine for advanced follicular lymphoma. They noted that this is the first case of cytomegalovirus reactivation and associated cytomegalovirus gastritis in a patient receiving bendamustine as first-line therapy.</p>
