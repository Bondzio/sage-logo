<p><italic>Objectives</italic>. Atypical mycobacterium (AM) involvement in refractory chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is sought by some surgeons with customary acid-fast bacilli cultures (AFBC) in the operating room (OR). We evaluate our experience with AM in CRS by describing (1) associated risk factors, (2) species identified, and (3) frequency of positive cultures in clinic versus OR.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Case series with chart review.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. Tertiary rhinology practice.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. AFBC taken between 2005 and 2011 were identified from a microbiology laboratory database.

<body>
<p>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease that affects millions of Americans. Pathophysiology of CRS is likely multifactorial and includes infectious, atopic, autoimmune, and structural etiologies. Diagnostic tools include nasal endoscopy, cultures, allergy testing, and imaging, while treatment options include antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory oral and topical medications, immunotherapy, extraesophageal reflux medications, and sinus surgery. Yet despite the impressive armamentarium of available resources, clinicians are occasionally faced with recalcitrant CRS, even when maximal medical and surgical treatments are used. In monitoring our own experience with patients who failed to improve with culture-directed antimicrobial therapy as well as other standard CRS treatment, we identified a relatively large subset of non-HIV patients with sinonasal cultures positive for atypical mycobacteria (AM). The objective of this report was to present our experience with CRS in the setting of positive acid-fast bacilli cultures (AFBC) by describing associated risk factors, AM species identified, and frequency of positive cultures in the clinic setting versus the operating room (OR).</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective analysis of AFBC data identified from a Baycare microbiology laboratory database and culture reports of Sinus &amp; Nasal Institute of Florida patients between 2005 and 2011. Data regarding the number of positive AFBC, positive AFB events, and total number of AFBC sent from the OR and from the clinic setting were reviewed. Positive AFBC patient charts were reviewed for gender, age, medical history, risk factors for AM, pathogen types, and treatments. The source of cultures in all settings was purulent material encountered in the sinus cavities during office endoscopy or endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). The purulence was typically associated with a thin film of crusting adherent to the sinus mucosa. Documentation as to specific anatomic site within the sinus cavity that was the source for the purulent material was not routinely documented. All cultures sent from the OR included samples for aerobic, anaerobic, fungal cultures, and AFBC as a standard protocol. Therefore, OR AFBC were classified as “customary,” as opposed to “in-office” cultures, which were as a rule ordered based on high clinical suspicion for presence of AFB and were therefore referred to as “targeted.” The potential benefits of “targeted AFBC” for cases with high clinical suspicion were compared with “customary AFBC” in the OR for patient data collected between 2005 and 2010, with statistical comparison using Pearson χ<sup>2</sup>. This case series report is associated with a quality assessment and improvement activity, and according to Basic HHS Policy for Protection of Human Research Subjects, it is considered exempt under §46.101(b) 4.</p>

<title>Demographics and Patient Data</title>
<p>Thirty-seven patients were identified with AM between 2005 and 2011. The mean age of the patients was 58.5 years (range, 17-80 years). There were 17 men and 20 women. A history of CRS was present in 30 patients, while 7 patients had a history of sinonasal tumors. The source of positive culture was an OR sample in 8 patients, office-based sample in 26 patients, and both settings in 3 patients. Evaluation of patients whose AFB culture was obtained in the office setting showed that 23 had CRS as their primary diagnosis. In this outpatient CRS group, history of ESS prior to AFB diagnosis was present in 21 of 23 patients (91.3%). Six of 23 patients (26.1%) had 1 ESS, and 15 of 23 patients (65.2%) had 2 or more procedures. On average, there were 2.2 procedures per patient in this group prior to diagnosis of AM-associated CRS with a range of 0 to 6 procedures. Five patients with CRS had their diagnosis of AM-associated CRS derived from OR cultures only. In 3 patients with a history of sinonasal tumors, positive AM culture came from an office setting, while 4 patients with a history of a sinonasal tumors were diagnosed with AM via an OR culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812437333">
<title>Risk Factors</title>
<p>Ten patients had 1 or more risk factors for AM, including foreign body (n = 4), non-HIV immune dysfunction (n = 4), and history of chemoradiation (n = 4). Multiple risk factors were present in 2 patients. Foreign bodies included dacryocystorhinostomy stents in 3 patients and a metal postcraniotomy repair plate in 1 patient. Three patients were diagnosed with immunoglobulin G deficiency, with 1 of the patients in this group receiving intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Four patients had a history of chemotherapy and radiation as part of treatment of a sinonasal malignancy, which included melanoma (1), chondrosarcoma (1), esthesioneuroblastoma (1), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (1). There were no HIV patients in our case series.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812437333">
<title>AM Species and Laboratory Evaluation</title>
<p>In all, 6 different AM species were identified: most frequently <italic>M abscessus</italic> (57.1%), followed by <italic>M avium-intracellulare</italic> complex (14.3%), <italic>M chelonae</italic> (14.3%), <italic>Mycobacterium mucogenicum</italic> (6.1%), <italic>Mycobacterium avium-kansasii</italic> (4.1%), and <italic>Mycobacterium neoaurum</italic> (2.0%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812437333"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). Speciation was not possible in 1 specimen secondary to overgrowth of other bacteria. Overall, there were 49 AFB-positive events, with AFB culture providing diagnosis in 23 cases and the AFB probe method providing the diagnosis in 26 cases. However, there was a total of 83 positive AFB tests in these 37 patients when considering that many AM grew out in fungal cultures initially (20 AFB-positive fungal cultures), which prompted subsequent evaluation with an AFB probe. An AFB probe was also done on every single AFB-positive culture for diagnosis confirmation as part of standard laboratory practice.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an evaluation comparing AFBC from an outpatient setting and routine AFBC in the OR was performed on samples from patients who were tested between 2005 and 2010. Over that time period, there was a total of 563 AFBC performed, 190 of which were from the outpatient setting and 373 from the OR. Ten of 190 (5.3%) outpatient AFBC were positive, whereas 10 of 373 (2.6%) of OR AFBC were positive (<italic>P</italic> = .12; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812437333"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment and Outcomes</title>
<p>Macrolide therapy was employed in 23 of 37 (62%) patients with AM-associated CRS but was not routinely prescribed in patients with positive OR AFBC alone. In 21 patients, treatment was initiated based on an outpatient positive AM event, while only 2 patients with positive AM based on an OR sample received macrolide therapy. In 1 of these patients, treatment was initiated based on subsequent positive outpatient laboratory testing. There was no record of use of therapy in 2 of the patients for whom macrolide antibiotics were prescribed. After exclusion of the latter 2 patients, our data indicate that 10 patients were treated with azithromycin and 12 patients were treated with clarithromycin. One patient was treated with clarithromycin initially, followed by azithromycin due to antibiotic intolerance. Another patient was treated with a combination of rifampin and ethambutol along with azithromycin. The average duration of therapy was 13.4 weeks, with a range of 2 to 52 weeks. Side effects included gastrointestinal complaints in 2 patients and dry mouth in 1 patient. Improvement in the presence of sinonasal edema, pus, or crusting on endoscopy was seen in 13 of the 21 patients. No evidence of improvement was observed in 4 patients. In addition, 2 patients reported feeling better when questioned regarding their symptoms by phone. Two patients were lost to follow-up. The DCR stent was removed in 2 of the 3 previously mentioned patients. Improvement was achieved and subsequent cultures were negative in 1 DCR patient; however, there was ongoing AM-associated CRS in 1 postradiation patient even after the DCR stent removal. The ongoing infection in the latter patient was partly related to poor compliance with the medical regimen. Another patient with the DCR stent decided against macrolide therapy as he had a history of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> in the past. Average follow-up after treatment was at least 7.6 months (range, 1-30 months) and is still ongoing for many patients. Seven patients in the treatment group had subsequent negative AFBC, while the remaining patients were not recultured.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the largest series describing an experience with AM-associated CRS. While AM-associated pathogenicity involving pulmonary, cutaneous, and soft tissue in the setting of trauma, nosocomial infection, and immunosuppression has well been described in literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437333">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437333">2</xref></sup> there remains a paucity of information regarding AM-associated CRS, with available published reports presenting 1 to 4 cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437333">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437333">4</xref></sup> and 1 abstract describing 21 patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812437333">5</xref></sup> To be sure, this is an uncommon condition; in our experience, we have identified only 37 AM-associated CRS patients out of more than 2000 new patient visits during this 6-year timeline. Of clinical significance is the fact that while 10 patients in our case series had risk factors for AM-associated CRS, including history of non-HIV immunodeficiency, foreign body, and chemoradiation, the remaining 27 individuals were free of foreign body or overtly altered innate/adaptive immunity. The most frequent organism was <italic>M abscessus</italic>; however, a variety of other species including <italic>M avium-intracellulare</italic> complex, <italic>M chelonae, M avium-kansasii, M mucogenicum, and M neoaurum</italic> were cultured. Diagnostic modality methods included AFBC that were either customary from the OR or targeted from the clinic setting in cases of high clinical suspicion, which included but was not limited to cases of refractory rhinosinusitis despite multiple antibiotic courses and/or those patients with risk factors for AM. In the case of “targeted AFBC,” there was a 5.3% positivity rate, whereas only 2.6% of “customary AFBC” were positive (<italic>P</italic> = .12). While the difference between the two does not reach statistical significance, there is a clearly higher rate of culture positivity when it is sent with clinical suspicion. Furthermore, a substantial majority of patients who received therapeutic intervention for AM-CRS were treated as a result of “targeted AFBC.” This warrants a reevaluation of our standard procedure of sending OR samples for laboratory evaluation of a full range of microbial cultures (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, and AFBC). Based on our case series, we propose that “targeted AFBC” should be employed as a more cost-effective alternative to routine cultures. It is also important to mention that additional diagnoses resulted from AM organism growth in fungal cultures, leading to confirmation of those samples with an AM probe (same protocol as for AFBC). Many of these patients also received macrolide therapy.</p>
<p>The decision to proceed with macrolide treatment was made on a patient-to-patient basis with consideration typically given to patient’s overall health status, predisposing risk factors, severity of CRS, and failure of prior medical/surgical treatment. Patients were not typically treated when a routine AFBC was positive. Most patients on macrolide therapy improved on either objective or subjective evaluation. Minor side effects were present in a small minority of patients; however, there were no significant adverse side effects. Although there were differences between subsequent therapeutic interventions between the treated and untreated group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599812437333"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>), no valid conclusion could be drawn from the comparison secondary to patient variability and specific patient requirements that were decided on an individual basis. It is also important to mention that long-term administration of low-dose clarithromycin is an effective treatment in chronic sinusitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812437333">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812437333">7</xref></sup>; however, uncertainty exists regarding the mechanism of the therapeutic effect, which may be anti-inflammatory rather than bactericidal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812437333">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the difficulties in diagnosing AM-associated CRS relates to its clinical rarity and need for a high level of suspicion. Generally, the appearance of AM-associated CRS may mimic that of other biofilm-producing bacterial infections. A high level of suspicion is especially required with AIDS patients within whom disseminated AM infections are common and AM sinusitis is possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437333">9</xref></sup> Other risk factors such as non-HIV immunosuppression and the presence of indwelling foreign bodies need to be considered. AM biofilms have been found to grow on materials that are commonly used in the health industry, including metals such as stainless steel and copper, as well as plastics, such as polyvinyl chloride and polycarbonate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437333">10</xref></sup> Structural abnormalities of the ciliated epithelium from radiation insult, as in the case of cancer therapy, may predispose to AM-associated CRS. However, as illustrated in our case series, the AM-associated CRS is not limited to those with aforementioned risk factors but may affect seemingly risk-free individuals. Furthermore, following the identification of AFBC positivity, a decision needs to be made with regard to which patients are selected for a therapeutic intervention with a macrolide, as anti-AM treatment may not be necessary in every individual initially and needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Clinicians need to be aware that AM colonies possess variability with regard to biofilm formation ability, growth rate, and virulence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437333">10</xref></sup> Unlike <italic>M tuberculosis</italic>, which is highly infectious and is transmitted by contact with an infected human reservoir, AM is found in the soil, sewage, and, most worrisome, in drinking water.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437333">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437333">11</xref></sup> Various reports in the literature have described the presence of <italic>M abscessus</italic>, <italic>M gilvum</italic>, <italic>M gordonae</italic>, <italic>M mageritense</italic>, <italic>M avium</italic>, and <italic>M scrofulaceum</italic> in municipal water supplies around the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437333">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, AM are typically tolerant to a wider range of pH and temperature than most other water-contaminating pathogens and are more likely to withstand the effects of chlorine. Needless to say, patients who irrigate their nasal cavity with tap water are potentially putting themselves at risk of acquiring AM-associated CRS. We are recommending that clinicians educate their patients regarding correct irrigation procedures, which should include boiled water cooled to an acceptable temperature or a pharmacy-prepared solution. All irrigation devices need to be properly cleaned on a daily basis to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have presented a large case series in which we have evaluated our experience with AM-associated CRS patients. It is an uncommon condition, and a high level of suspicion is warranted in those with certain risk factors as well as in patients who have failed previous medical/surgical therapy. Although our results do not definitively demonstrate this, “targeted AFBC” may be more resource efficient than routine OR AFB cultures by helping to decrease cost and improve yield. The identification of these organisms in tap water, the frequent use of nasal irrigations in CRS, and the possible role of these organisms in biofilms warrant further investigation.</p>
