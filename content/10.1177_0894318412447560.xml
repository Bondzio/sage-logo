            <p>The war in Iraq and Afghanistan has involved the deployment of hundreds of thousands of American soldiers, many of whom are married and have children. The experience of one military family living through a deployment in Iraq in 2011 is discussed and interpreted in light of Parse’s humanbecoming family model. The model provides a useful way for nurses, and others, to understand families, in a way that honors their values and struggles in an everchanging and unpredictable world. Included is a brief discussion on how communication technologies are changing the experience of military deployment for families.</p>

      <p>In the decade that followed 9/11/2001, hundreds of thousands of families in the United States (US) lived with a family member serving in Iraq or Afghanistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447560">Institute of Medicine, 2010</xref>). While spouses of deployed soldiers experience deployment in their own way, there is evidence that army wives of service men in Iraq or Afghanistan have used mental health services at much higher rates than wives of non-deployed military husbands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447560">Mansfield et al., 2011</xref>). The authors here discuss the experience of one such family using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> humanbecoming family model to help nurses understand the unique challenges faced by military families and to better understand the model. This military family story was told by Laura, a 32-year old wife and mother, about 1 week before her husband’s return to the US from a year long deployment in Iraq and the official end of the US war in that country.</p>
      <p>The 1978 film <italic>Coming Home</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447560">Ashby, Jones, Salt, Dowd, &amp; Wurlitzer, 1978</xref>) was a decidedly antiwar movie produced by Jane Fonda, who also played the lead character in the story. The film and the book it was based on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447560">Davis, 1972</xref>) was inspired by Fonda’s friendship with Ron Kovic, a paraplegic Vietnam War Veteran, who wrote his autobiography, <italic>Born on the Fourth of July</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447560">Kovic, 1976</xref>) which also became a major motion picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447560">Norden, 1994</xref>). Unlike these films, the unfolding coming home story told below is about a family of a soldier who, fortunately was not injured during this deployment, at least not physically. In addition, unlike in the film <italic>Coming Home</italic>, the soldier in this coming home from war story is not about someone coming to a spouse involved with someone else, nor is it told by someone seeking to make a political statement or discuss the ethics of war and deployment. It is about a family, put on hold (“it’s as if we pushed the pause button”) by wartime deployment. It is interesting to note that the French verb to deploy, <italic>déployer</italic>, in French means <italic>to unfold</italic>, while in English it usually means to strategically go to the front lines as in a military conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447560">Deploy, 2011</xref>). Both of these meanings fit this story, in that the family is poignantly unfolding unpredictably, and that like many military families, one or more members leave home to go to the front lines. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> view, all families are always unpredictable, changing, and defined by indivisible connectedness. In military families during wartime, tensions among family members are often played out amid uncertainty, strong emotions, separations, and family relocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447560">Boudreau, 2008</xref>).</p>

         <title>The Story of Laura’s Family</title>
         <p>Laura is a mother of a 20-month old boy, Derrick (the names in this story have been changed). Her husband Paul was in Iraq for about a year, which was his third deployment to that country. As mentioned above the story was told by Laura about 1 week prior to Paul’s <italic>coming home</italic> to the US. Laura was informed that Paul would have to undergo 2 weeks of debriefing upon his return. She heard from him that he was due to be stationed in the US after this debriefing. She hoped it would be for the rest of his military career. Thus, at the time of telling her, Laura was fairly certain about what was going to happen next, and that Paul was safe. She admitted that if she had been asked to talk about her life and her family 6 months earlier, it would be a very different story.</p>

            <title>Revering Intentions</title>
            <p>The first essence of the humanbecoming family model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>) is based on the humanbecoming school of thought assumption that “health and quality of life are cocreated with ways of living human freedom and dignity” (p. 306). Revering intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>) can be seen as articulations of how families seek to revere loved ones as they structure meaning to make sense of their everchanging situation and connections. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> words, family is lived in the “well-spring of laughter and tears in honoring the personal significance of joy-sorrow” (p. 307). While the experience of joy-sorrow is not unique to military families, military families who live with multiple relocations and deployments can be seen as living it in both unique and shared ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447560">Boudreau (2008)</xref>, a marine veteran of Iraq, said that returning home for him was “a strange mix of melancholy and joy” (p. 17). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse (2009)</xref> identified celebrating and grieving as key processes associated with the family essence of revering intentions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447560">Vanier (1979)</xref>, a former naval officer said that to grow in communities, life must shift from heroism (the willingness to rough it for awhile) to dailiness. By <italic>dailiness</italic> he referred to the routine aspects of living together with others, such as preparing meals and washing dishes, as well as moments of “joy and celebration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447560">Vanier, 1979</xref>, p. 55). The process of cocreating with significant others is a challenge for families of deployed and returning soldiers.</p>
            <p>Laura reflected that it is interesting when Paul is deployed. She said that at first there was dread, she missed him so very much, and then with time she stopped missing him. That in the day-to-day she came to the point where she did not really care. “I know I care on a global scale, I know I need my partner to live a happier life than the one I live day-to-day without him.” But she said she gets busy with Derrick, and walking the dogs, and taking a shower, such that if she doesn’t talk to him that day, she does not necessarily miss talking to him. Because he has been deployed before, she knew, before he even left, that she would get to this point. She shared, “I know I will see him soon, and I can just wait until then, and that is the part that I have dreaded the most.”</p>
            <p>Laura said that hers was not a <italic>normal</italic> family. She said, “I am often asked if I spoke to him that day, and how is he doing?” She admitted that she usually answers that she did speak with him, and “he’s fine, we’re fine.” Laura reported, that for the past year, “our family presses pause.” The metaphoric reference to use of a remote control for one’s family life reflects the infusion of technology in life and surroundings. She explained that Paul knows that she is faithful and she knows that he is faithful. She says that they love each other, and that she knows that Paul loves their son, “even though he has not seen him much this year.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse (2009)</xref> used the term <italic>treasured</italic> in her articulation of family life, and reverence as a “virtue shown in respectful appreciation of confirming and at once not confirming family members” (p. 307). Laura said that while they are not together physically there is a “little break in the emotional relationship.” She thinks that this break in the “emotional relationship” happens in all deployment families and that it leads to breakups of many military marriages.</p>
            <p>In the film <italic>Saving Private Ryan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447560">Spielberg &amp; Rodat, 1998</xref>), Captain Miller (played by Tom Hanks), said that after days of intense fighting, he felt like he was moving further away from his wife and the life he had back home, and he wondered if he would ever be able to return home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447560">Boudreau (2008)</xref> suggested that the trauma of war involves feeling powerless with the moral injury of having to engage (kill) the enemy. Captain Miller also said that if doing his duty gains him the right to go home and be with family again, then thinking about that helps him make sense of the surreal nature of the experience of war and helps him carry out his orders, even if they make no sense. This struggle to find coherence in situations that make no sense echoes the premise of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447560">Frankl (1997)</xref>, who came to appreciate that thoughts of his beloved, while surrounded by violence and cruelty helped him to survive a German concentration camp. The character of Captain Miller is also relevant to this discussion because he, like many of the US troops who served in Iraq, was older, better educated, and more likely to have a family, when compared with drafted service personnel in earlier US military engagements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447560">Sherman &amp; Bowling, 2011</xref>). Revering intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>) involves searching for meaning and explanations for the feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that arise when being separated from loved ones, not only by miles and hardships, but also the senselessness that is common to the experience of war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447560">Boudreau, 2008</xref>).</p>
            <p>Laura was confident that they are happy enough with each other and committed to staying married, so that they will be able to return to the active version of family life. She saw her current family as an abstract idea “because we are not together.” She reported that Derrick recognizes pictures of Paul but gets sad when his grandfather (whom he now lives with) goes to work in the morning. Laura’s said, “I think in Derrick’s experience, my father is playing the role of his father.” “So I think Paul and I have this abstraction, this idea of a family, technically we are a family now, but in practice it is broken, it is on hold.” She added, “we both think that is a shame, we both acknowledge that it is too bad, that this is something we don’t want to repeat, it’s not easy, it does not feel normal or easy.” Laura reported that when Derrick talks to Paul on the phone, he says “hi Da Da,” and “bye Da Da,” but then he sees his uncle who looks like Paul, he also calls him Da Da. She does not think Derrick understands who his dad is, and what the Dad function is, and she thinks this is too bad. She stated that it is good that Derrick is so young, and hopes that being separated from his father for a year while he is young is not as bad as if he were older, “because he will not remember this.” “If Paul had to be gone for a year of Derrick’s childhood, this year is probably the best one.”</p>
            <p>Laura stated that the strength of her relationship with Paul, even though they have to live separated much of the time, is based on shared values and beliefs about marriage. This makes their separations easier. “We both know the other one is being a good spouse. We both know that we value communication and honesty, and those things.” Laura said that she is aware that she has become the sole caregiver to Derrick while Paul is deployed, and that she has been disciplining him in any way she chooses. She said that she does not know if Paul would agree with the way she has been disciplining their son, and she anticipates things may be “a little bumpy” when he returns. She remains uncertain if she will have to negotiate with Paul on these issues, or concede power to him, or even to know how much responsibility to give him. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447560">Sherman and Bowling (2011)</xref> referred to these issues as “regaining emotional connection,” and “renegotiating family roles” (p. 210). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> humanbecoming family model this is seen as part of the ongoing process of shifting patterns. Laura anticipated Paul’s returning home as going to be “interesting” and she wondered “who Derrick will listen to?” She also wondered, how long would take Derrick to learn how to play them against each other?</p>

            <title>Shifting Patterns</title>
            <p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> humanbecoming family model, the second essence of the model is described as shifting patterns, which typifies the everchanging unpredictability of families. The model holds that shifting patterns involves “opportunities and restrictions in varying intimacies of communion-solitude” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>, p. 307). Laura reported that her family experience has definitely been “like waves, since we have been married.” She said that this was Paul’s second deployment during their 5 ½ year marriage. Laura described how during Paul’s first deployment they lived in Kansas and she stayed there by herself, which she liked very much. She had friends, a job she liked, and a dog. This time, she has been living in her father’s house, with her stepmother and two children from her stepmother’s first marriage. Laura now has Derrick and two dogs. She explained that while both deployments were a year long and her husband was in Iraq both times, they were very different experiences for her. She attributed this difference to not having her own home and having to be with “additional characters.”</p>
            <p>Laura also said that her experience of being with her husband during his mid-tour home visits during each deployment had been very different. “The first time it was just the two of us, we had our own home, it was like a vacation, a very nice time alone.” This year when he came home, it was a “complete whirlwind” of family and family events. She said Paul was taking long morning walks with Derrick, and that her time with him was rarely private or quiet. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse (2009)</xref>, communion-solitude is being together and being alone with the ebb and flow of attending-distancing. The processes of <italic>being together</italic> is described as “witnessing with diverse fervor” and <italic>being alone</italic> as “moving away from a recognizable cadence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>, p. 307). Changes in the way of being together and being alone can be seen during both of Paul’s deployments and his mid-tour home visits. In some ways, families with a deployed family member, as described in the story of Laura’s family, live an on-again-off-again, or start-pause-restart experiences, requiring considerable flexibility and negotiations amid various entrances and exits, in the ever shifting pattern of being alone and together.</p>
            <p>Laura further reflected on living celebrating and grieving, which she described as living “the yin and yang, or circle of life.” Deployment and the family of a deployed person, she said, make celebrating and grieving more immediate. Laura shared,
<disp-quote>
                  <p>I don’t know if every family celebrates and grieves as often as we do, because at one point there is the impending deployment, then there is the anxiety of the deployment, then there is the coming home of the mid-tour, and going away again, then there is the coming home. This happens a number of times in less than a year. I think every family has this, we are having a baby, he’s turning two and he is not a baby anymore, I guess you could grieve for that change, but this is more heightened and rapid fire.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Laura said that she could see the benefits for her son to have spent a year with his grandparents and great-grandparents. She said that “if we had lived anywhere in the US military world, we wouldn’t have been this close to them. I think that is really nice for Derrick, and it is has been nice for me too.” Laura also appreciated that she has had the opportunity to live in various places that “she never would have thought of living in and at the same time she is feeling pretty ready to stop moving around as soon as she will be able to.” She said she does not mind finding a new place to live and making new friends, but she does wonder how Derrick has experienced moving around and living in his grandparent’s house. She images that he might think this is normal. The chief restriction for Laura’s recent family life is not having her own house. She described living with her father and his new family as feeling
<disp-quote>
                  <p>simultaneously grateful and suffocated. It is very nice of them to have us there, but I am 32 and I can’t use the kitchen the way I would if it was my own kitchen, and I can’t leave a mess if Derrick makes one, I feel I have to clean it up before anyone else gets home. I think that bothers me, but it is a fair trade.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>For Laura being together and alone has been “interesting,” because typically Paul and I like to spend a lot of time together without anyone else. But she also admits that she likes and requires time alone, more than he does when he is stateside. “So that when we live together, I have to insist, that I need some time alone, because I am used to so much time alone now. So that when he comes back, it is almost becomes too much company. It goes from no company at to too much.”</p>

         <sec id="section5-0894318412447560">
            <title>Unfolding Possibilities</title>
            <p>The third essence of the humanbecoming family model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>), is unfolding possibilities. In the model, unfolding possibilities, is articulated as that which “surfaces with the warp and woof of beginnings and endings in birthing-dying” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>, p. 308). According to Laura, Paul’s deploying and then re-deploying, which is his coming home, is very much like a rebirth. His deployment is like a “cocoon year,” where his coming home is a time when they will have to “establish a new home, and establish our own new family patterns.” She pointed out that when Paul left in the beginning of 2011, Derrick was an infant, but when he comes home he will be coming home to a child. Laura said that it is interesting experiencing birthings and dyings from a far distance. She recalled how far she had been from other family members during the first deployment, and that at first she did not like it, but then she came to “like it a lot, for our own autonomy.”</p>
            <p>Laura stated that her hopes and dreams have changed 180 degrees since being in a family with a deployed partner, “it becomes much more short-term and specific.” She recalled that as little as a month ago, she was hoping for Paul to come home, hoping to find out that when he was going to come home, and now she said she could not wait, and “dreaming of my own house. So this is my short-term goal, which is my complete fantasy now. Buying or renting a house, and being able to move in. Ten years ago, I would have been horrified that this is my hope and dream now, to live in my own house.”</p>
            <p>Laura thinks that living with deployments has made her more practical, and that she “almost likes that.” She acknowledged that when they are all together, they do not take their time together for granted. She speculated that if Paul is able to stay close for 5 or 10 years, that they may begin to take their time together for granted.</p>

         <p>Laura admitted that communication technology has dramatically changed being in a family with a deployed person. She recalled that when Paul was deployed in 2003, he had almost no communication with his family. When he was deployed in 2005, the year before they got married, a friend stationed with him had Skype video-calling, but he did not because he did not have internet in his tent. This past year they both had and used webcams and Skype, when they could. Laura said that when they were first married and Paul was deployed (in 2006) they did a lot of talking on the phone. “I had a cell phone and he had an Iraqi cell phone. So he would call me, I could not call him but he could call me.” Laura said that in the past few years there have been many more lines of communication open to them. Family members in the US in 2011 could not call close others in Iraq, but they could email them from a phone and as in the case of Paul,

               <p>He is checking email all the time. Such that there have been a number of times, in the middle of the night, when Derrick is making me crazy, I email him and say call as soon as you can, and he often calls within half an hour. So it is nice when we can Skype and Derrick can see Paul, and vice versa, and now with a smart phone I take videos of Derrick everyday and email them. So Paul will be surprised to see Derrick’s developments in the past few months but he will not be shocked, because he sees him on Skype and on videos, everyday. That’s nice; it makes it more like he is in Kansas or Florida. We are talking on the phone, it is almost as if the time difference does not matter, there is a couple of hours I don’t hear from him when I am awake and a couple of hours when he does not hear from me when he is awake. But other than that, we are in contact maybe 15 times a day. Paul has told me stories, of soldiers with older children, and these soldiers discipline their children from Iraq.</p>

         <p>There are unfolding possibilities arising with the everchanging communication technology for families with deployed family members. It is interesting to consider how these changes are shifting patterns of how persons are with and apart from various family members, or to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> notions, how technology is changing living revealing-concealing, enabling-limiting, and connecting-separating. Communication technology allows family members separated by thousands of miles and multiple time zones to be together in new ways as they co-create their lives. Family connectedness continues to rely on revering intentions of family members living shared values and beliefs, and hopes and dreams.</p>
         <p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse (2009)</xref> liberating and initiating is part of the “coming and going that show the familiar-unfamiliar in new light” (p. 307). Laura speculated that if her husband did not have the career he has, “and if we were not in this situation, with moving and him going away for extended periods of time, I never would have thought I would have been able to do this year with Derrick, so I guess this has been liberating.” At the same time she admitted poignantly, “I wish I didn’t have to know it.” This remark hints at concealed portion of Laura’s family story. What she did say was that she was quite capable, and that she probably would not have given herself credit for that before, and now “I am a little more Zen about how time passes, that is liberating. What is the worst thing that could happen? If he wakes up in the middle of the night, I will just bring him into my bed, and it will be fine.”</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Despite dramatic improvements of communication technology and somewhat more respect for military services personnel since 9/11, families with a deployed family member continue to experience prolonged periods of disruption in their preferred ways of living family. Even the most fortunate among them, live unpredictable everchanging connectedness, with intermittent experiences of joyful celebrations and anxious sorrowful separations. Laura’s family story provides a window into the experience of one family with a deployed member. The anticipated coming home story told above is very different from stories presented in some famous films about coming home from Vietnam. The authors hope that this will translate into improved support, healthcare services and opportunities for families with post-deployed family members.</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse’s (2009)</xref> humanbecoming family model provides a useful lens for looking at families living with deployed family members. It avoids pathologizing persons or families and it remains true to the assumptions of the humanbecoming school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>), in particular that “humans are open, freely choosing meaning with situations, bearing responsibility for decisions” (p. 306). Also it seeks to honor all family members’ perspectives, choices and sacrifices, as well as the strengths of persons and families. It also provides a language to talk about the unpredictable everchanging nature of families in modern societies, while appreciating the importance of reverence for family members, as they live their “value priorities in speaking-being silent and moving-being still” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447560">Parse, 2009</xref>, p. 307).</p>
