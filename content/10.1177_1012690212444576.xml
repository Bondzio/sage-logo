<abstract>
<p>The ‘greening’ of mega-sporting events such as the Olympic Games (OG) has become an increasing priority of event organizers in the past two decades. This paper explores the legacies from the greening of the OG through an analysis of Beijing 2008, Singapore 2010, and London 2012, drawing on interviews with key stakeholders. While each OG is different, the key determinants for green legacies include: the breadth and depth of environmental commitments during the bid process; embedding sustainability in the vision, mission and branding of organizing committees; embedding sustainability in various aspects of OG organization, which is an important practical application of a sustainability vision; and the transfer of knowledge from one OG to the next, allowing newer host cities to enhance green legacies. The findings indicate institutionalization of elements of sustainability in the OG with legitimation and mimetic processes at play. The study found that legitimation is a key strategy during the bidding process and in operations of the OG.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many cities around the world vie to host large-scale sporting events like the Olympic Games (OG), the World Cup, and the Commonwealth Games. Such mega-sporting events are seen to benefit the host city in various ways, such as through the promotion of tourism and economic growth. In recent years, the OG has developed into one of the most significant, if not the most significant, mega-sporting events held internationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690212444576">Malfas et al., 2004</xref>). The traditional summer OG brings together over 10,000 athletes from over 200 nations to participate in more than 300 events. The sheer scale of the event ensures that the host city is impacted long after the OG has come and gone.</p>
<p>The impacts of mega-sporting events can be significant and numerous. These events can produce positive outcomes – referred to as legacies – for host nations in relation to image, economy, tourism and infrastructure. The Olympic Charter states that part of the role of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is ‘to promote a positive legacy from the Olympic Games to the host cities and host countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690212444576">IOC, 2010b</xref>: 1). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690212444576">IOC (2010b</xref>: 1) acknowledges that legacy is a complex subject, ‘as many of the benefits of an event may not be seen until years later, some may be dependent on continued support from local authorities once the Olympic Games Organizing Committee (OGOC) has ceased to exist and others may be difficult to measure but are felt by the local population’.</p>
<p>A substantive section of the literature on the impact of mega-sporting events is focused on the economic impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1012690212444576">Davies, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690212444576">Ingerson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690212444576">Jennings and Sambrook, 2000</xref>). While there are many drivers for staging mega-sporting events, one perspective is that the most important reason behind the decision to host an event is the potential positive impact on the local economy, which in turn can improve the social conditions of the host community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690212444576">Malfas et al., 2004</xref>). At the same time, the hosting of these events has significant environmental impacts. Given the many thousands of kilometers travelled to attend the event, not only by the numerous athletes and their coaches but also by Olympics officials, worldwide media representatives, sponsors and spectators, the OG represent a massive use of resources and energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>). In 1996, the IOC acknowledged the potential negative environmental impacts and modified the Olympic Charter to ‘[e]ncourage and support a responsible concern for environmental issues, to promote sustainable development in sport and to require that the Olympic Games are held accordingly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690212444576">IOC, 2011</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>While concerns about the negative environmental and social impacts of the OG have been raised by scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690212444576">Halls and Hodges, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690212444576">Lenskyj, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690212444576">Malfas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690212444576">Ruthheiser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1012690212444576">Weicker, 2003</xref>), research on its green legacies is relatively scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690212444576">Tian and Johnston, 2008</xref>). More generally, despite an increasing emphasis on ‘greening’ sporting events such as the OG, connections between sports and the natural environment are relatively understudied in scholarly work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690212444576">Mincyte et al., 2009</xref>). The term ‘greening’ refers to strategies and initiatives undertaken to integrate sustainability (environmental and social outcomes) into the OG. Greening is variously described as ‘a state to which we aspire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690212444576">Chernushenko, 1994</xref>: 9) and ‘a process rather than a quick fix’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690212444576">Lenskyj, 1998</xref>: 343). However, the authors acknowledge that there is no consensus on the meaning of sustainable development, sustainability, and greening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690212444576">Dresner, 2008</xref>) – they mean different things in different social contexts. Taking a lead from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690212444576">Mincyte et al. (2009)</xref>, in this paper the terms sustainable development, sustainability, and greening encompass environmental and social issues, acknowledging the interrelatedness of these issues, and the paper uses the terms interchangeably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this paper is to expand the understanding of legacies arising out of the greening of the OG by examining stakeholders’ perspectives on the social and environmental initiatives and outcomes of three OG: Beijing 2008, Singapore Youth Olympics 2010, and London 2012. The paper first reviews the history of the greening of the OG, followed by a description of the methods used in the research study. It then discusses the approach of each of the three OG to creating green legacies and the key determinants for positive environmental and social outcomes from the OG. It concludes with reflections on the institutionalization of sustainability in the OG.</p>

<title>The greening of the Olympic Games</title>
<p>The institution of the modern OG was established in 1896 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who claimed that international sport could foster individual and collective goodwill and even contribute to world peace. The modern OG was revived as an expression of an ideology and philosophy that Coubertin called Olympism. The Olympic Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690212444576">IOC, 2011</xref>: 12) describes Olympism as:<disp-quote>
<p>A philosophy of life, exalting and combining in a balanced whole the qualities of body, will and mind, which, by blending sport with culture and education, seeks to create a way of life based on the joy found in effort, the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, the goal of Olympism is to ‘[p]lace everywhere sport at the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690212444576">IOC, 2011</xref>: 12). The wording of the Olympic Charter suggests that social considerations were at the forefront of the Olympic Movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690212444576">IOC, 2010a</xref>) from the beginning. However, before the 1990s, environmental considerations did not feature strongly in the OG decision-making process.</p>
<p>The environmental damage caused during the Albertville 1992 Winter Olympics catalyzed a move towards environmental considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690212444576">Cantelon and Letters, 2000</xref>). The IOC and OCOG appeared relatively unconcerned by environmental questions during the game’s preparation. Consequently, environmental damage took place relatively unimpeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690212444576">Terret, 2008</xref>). Following the OG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690212444576">Galford (2000)</xref> recounted ecologist groups’ predictions of devastated plant and animal habitats, scarring above the tree line that could take centuries to heal and compounding damage to the already shrinking Alpine wilderness. The negative publicity that followed Albertville prompted the IOC to recognize the importance of being viewed as an environmentally responsible organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690212444576">Cantelon and Letters, 2000</xref>). Preparations for the Lillehammer 1994 winter Games were well underway at this stage. Grassroots environmental activism led Lillehammer’s OCOG to incorporate environmental responsibility into its preparations, transforming Lillehammer’s initial bid for a ‘Compact Games’ into the organization of a ‘Green Games’. By aligning itself with Lillehammer’s green profile, the IOC began to restore its image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690212444576">Lesjo, 2000</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690212444576">IOC (2011</xref>: 12), the Olympic Movement and the environmental movement were seen to share the common ideal of building a ‘better and more peaceful world’ for humanity. In this statement, the IOC acknowledged a duty to foster environmentally sound activities within the Olympic Movement and beyond.</p>
<p>In 1994, the IOC signed a cooperation agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to develop joint initiatives. ‘Environment’ was approved as the third pillar of Olympism, in addition to ‘sport’ and ‘culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690212444576">Cantelon and Letters, 2000</xref>). In 1996, the Olympic Charter was modified to acknowledge the environment. After Lillehammer, the IOC added an environmental overseer to its bid assessment committee. An educational dossier for an environmental awareness campaign within the global sports community, the IOC Manual on Sport and the Environment, was released in 1997 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690212444576">IOC, 2005</xref>). Each of these documents advocated for sports activities to take place with due respect for the environment and in the spirit of sustainable development, and pledged the commitment of the Olympic Movement in this regard. Most of this content has now been integrated into the Bidding Manual and the IOC’s criteria for host city selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690212444576">IOC, 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>Since 1994, candidate cities for both summer and winter OG have been evaluated on their environmental plans. The IOC’s bidding procedure encompasses issues of environmental protection, environmental impact measurement, Olympics legacies, and ecological studies. These form a significant portion of the candidature file. Although formal expectations for environmental sensitivity and sustainability are expressed generally enough to accommodate the specific circumstances of candidate cities, the driving forces are now expressed forcefully through the – not necessarily homogenous – expectations of the public, NGO representatives, and governments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690212444576">Mincyte et al. (2009</xref>: 105) claim that since the Sydney 2000 OG, ‘environmentalism is now inseparable from the Olympic brand’.</p>
<p>These expectations led to the release of the OG Impact (OGI) study in 2003. The principal objectives of OGI are: to measure the overall impact of the OG, to assist bidding cities and future OG organizers through the transfer of strategic directions obtained from past and present OG, and to identify potential legacies, thereby maximizing the benefit of the OG. In order to measure the impact of the OG, more than 100 research indicators were created and grouped into the three internationally recognized spheres of sustainable development: economic, socio-cultural, and environmental. The OGI indicators cover a vast range of activities, from those that are a direct result of the staging of the OG, such as the construction of competition venues or the Olympic Village, to other more indirect consequences, such as the evolution of transport and accommodation infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690212444576">IOC, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>From the perspective of a city vying to host the OG, having a sound green proposal has been a key component of a winning bid since environmental considerations were first taken into account in the staging of the 1994 Lillehammer winter OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690212444576">Fang et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer (2006)</xref> argues that in order to secure the OG over other serious contenders such as Paris and Toronto, Beijing had to turn its attention to the third pillar of Olympism – the environment. In 1993, Beijing lost the OG to Sydney, which had made sustainability a major component of its bid. Learning from this strategy to green the OG, Beijing submitted a bid for the 2008 OG that included a comprehensive environmental plan and supported its bid with ‘a massive environmental campaign’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer, 2006</xref>: 426). China’s bid for a Green Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690212444576">Mobley, 2008</xref>) for the 2008 OG addressed international criticism of China’s pollution problems and Olympics officials’ concern for the well-being of athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690212444576">Manzenreiter, 2010</xref>). China spent a large amount of money to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>While other studies of the Mexico City, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Athens OG show mixed results and do not confirm that a green proposal leads to a winning bid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690212444576">Tian and Brimblecombe, 2008</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690212444576">Fang et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that by design or by coincidence, the OG have become grounds for nations to test ideas and models for sustainable development. The hosting of the OG is now seen as an opportunity for a city to create environmental and social improvements in relation to urban design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>) and social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690212444576">Mol, 2010</xref>). Other efforts at greening the OG for lasting positive effects are evidenced in studies on the Beijing OG, which examine legislative changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690212444576">Loh, 2008</xref>) and other efforts to curb air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690212444576">Fang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690212444576">Shen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1012690212444576">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) for the OG. They indicate that while there has been improvement in environmental conditions as a result of these initiatives, it remains to be seen if the positive effects will last.</p>
<p>While there is substantial research on the OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690212444576">Fowler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690212444576">Gratton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690212444576">Kornblatt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690212444576">Mahon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690212444576">Poynter, 2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690212444576">Tian and Johnston (2008)</xref> highlight gaps in the scholarly literature on the social and environmental legacies of the OG. One of the ways in which these legacies could be better understood is to explore the perspectives of the relevant stakeholders involved in the greening of the OG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1012690212444576" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>An exploratory study was used to shed light on this little researched topic. It employed an interpretivist approach, drawing on ‘insider’ accounts of green legacies of the OG to generate understanding of the drivers of green legacies. Interpretivism views the social world as the world interpreted and experienced by its members from the ‘inside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690212444576">Blaikie, 2000</xref>). An inductive study was undertaken as it is useful for exploration (developing a rough description or an understanding of some social phenomena). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690212444576">Blaikie (2000)</xref>, inductive research starts with collecting data, followed by data analysis, and then by the development of generalizations that, with further research studies and testing, can become law-like propositions to be used to explain aspects of social life. Data were collected through case studies as they are an appropriate method for theory-building when little is known about the phenomenon under investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690212444576">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). The multiple case study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1012690212444576">Yin, 2009</xref>) was employed and the three most recent summer OG – Beijing 2008, Singapore 2010, and London 2012 – were chosen to explore the most recent developments in green legacies. Beijing is the host city of the most recently completed full summer OG. China aimed for a green Olympics in 2008. Heightened demand led stakeholders of the OG to make greater efforts than at any other prior OG to introduce environmental and social sustainability initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>). The inaugural Youth OG held in Singapore in 2010 marked the beginning of a new branch of the Olympic movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690212444576">IOC, 2010b</xref>). Preparations for the London 2012 OG were taking place at the time of this study. This OG claims to be the most holistic in the area of sustainability of any OG in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690212444576">London 2012, 2010</xref>). Primary data for these OG were collected through semi-structured interviews with insiders – stakeholders who have a ‘stake’ in the greening of the OG – supplemented with direct observation (Singapore).</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge there are limitations to this approach. One limitation of using a small number of case studies is that the sample may not necessarily be representative of the population of OG and will not allow for generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1012690212444576">Blaikie, 2000</xref>). However, this is not the intention of the research study. The aim is to start to generate a theoretical understanding of the drivers of green legacies of the OG that can be tested in other contexts to establish their range of application. Issues also arise due to the political contexts and scale of the sample OG. Singapore and Beijing may not be considered ‘open’ societies, in the sense that some stakeholders such as OG officials may not feel that they can speak candidly. Comparing the three OG raises other issues due to the small scale of the Singapore Youth OG compared to Beijing and London in aspects such as age and number of athletes, media attention, sponsorship opportunities, and infrastructure investment. As such, the type and scale of legacies from Singapore may be quite different to other summer OG.</p>
<p>Primary stakeholders of the OG were identified from the literature review (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1012690212444576">Figure 1</xref>). Nineteen stakeholders accepted a face-to-face or telephone interview between the months of June and September 2010 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690212444576">Table 1</xref>). All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The interviews provide a rich data set. In keeping with the interpretivist approach, interviewees had the opportunity to explain their experiences, attitudes, and perspectives in detail. Specific issues could also be probed in depth. However, the data are limited by who chose to participate in the interviews, what they chose to say and what they chose not to say.</p>

<p>The participant sample is skewed towards Olympic representatives and government officials (11 interviewees) – who may be considered evangelists of the OG – with a small representation of NGOs (three out of nine NGOs agreed to an interview), who may provide a more critical perspective. This raises another limitation of the exploratory approach, as the data reflects the views and perceptions of the interviewed stakeholders and the sample may not adequately reflect more critical perspectives on the greening of the OG. The interview data were supplemented by secondary data from publicly available sources to triangulate the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1012690212444576">Yin, 2009</xref>), such as company, media, and IOC reports, as well as academic sources in the form of books and peer-reviewed journal articles. Information was sought through the UNEP online library, reports by organizers in host cities, press releases, and reports by sponsors and partners. Secondary data sources were more heavily relied upon for analysis of the Beijing Games due to the difficulty in obtaining interviews. Nevertheless, the views of the sample of stakeholders interviewed may not be representative of the population of OG stakeholders and may have limited operationalization. As mentioned previously, future research studies can test the findings in other contexts to establish their range of application.</p>
<p>Grounded theory techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690212444576">Neuman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690212444576">Patton, 2002</xref>) were used to code and analyze the data and draw out themes. The transcripts were read over line by line and annotations that linked sections back to the research question and objectives were made on the margins of the transcripts (microanalysis). These annotations were informal code categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690212444576">Patton, 2002</xref>), which were then refined as further interview data were generated and annotated. Codes were grouped together and classified under new themes as patterns emerged within the data (second-level codes). Second-level codes were grouped together and further classified under separate themes (third-level codes). Where the interview data generated items that were unassignable, codes were modified to accommodate them or the items were placed under a general heading until they could be appropriately classified. Finally, four themes emerged from grouping the third level codes. The authors acknowledge that these four themes were derived from the limited sample of interview data and additional, or different, themes may well emerge from interviews with a different set of stakeholders. Further research studies using a larger sample of OG stakeholders would verify and/or enhance these themes.</p>

<title>Research findings</title>
<p>The four determinants of green legacies that emerged from the interview data are: the breadth and depth of environmental commitments during the bid process; embedding sustainability in the vision, mission, and branding of organizing committees; embedding sustainability in various aspects of OG organization; and knowledge transfer from one OG to the next. However, the research also found that the uniqueness of each host city is significant in generating green legacies. There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to legacy creation, but rather it is host city-specific. The three cities have different political systems, regulatory systems, policy setting processes, and starting points (pre-existing environmental conditions) for addressing environmental issues. The authors acknowledge that these are critical components influencing the environmental outcomes and influencing the extent to which criticism can be raised about the accomplishments. This is a limitation of the current study, as the interview questions did not probe these aspects. The study aimed to explore stakeholders’ perspectives on what drives the integration of environmental legacies into the OG. Further in-depth studies can probe these issues, and other issues highlighted in this study, for each of the OG.</p>
<p>Key findings from each host city are first discussed, followed by a discussion of the four key determinants of green legacies common across the three OG. Quotes from stakeholders are used (the codes in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690212444576">Table 1</xref> identify the stakeholder) ‘to reveal the patterns of meaning by which they understood their own experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690212444576">Lawrence, 2002</xref>: 73).</p>
<sec id="section5-1012690212444576">
<title>Beijing</title>
<p>The themes of the Beijing Olympics were ‘Green Olympics’, ‘People‘s Olympics’, and ‘Hi-tech Olympics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690212444576">BOCOG, 2003</xref>). In terms of how well the goals of a ‘Green’ and ‘People’s’ Olympics were achieved, interviewees involved with the OGI study and UNEP assessments had differing views as to their accuracy and effectiveness. The UNEP assessment was seen by two NGOs and one IOC representative to provide the most accurate independent reflection of the green outcomes of the OG.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer (2006)</xref> argues that the 2008 bid revealed Beijing’s pre-existing environmental problems: the city’s poor air-quality due to high levels of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from its dependence on coal and increasing number of vehicles and its above average concentrations of total suspended particulates, directly linked to the desertification of northeast China (Beijing’s average levels exceeded the World Health Organization standards by almost 400%).</p>
<p>The UNEP assessment found that the city experienced significant improvements in urban infrastructure, and waste and water treatment facilities were significantly enhanced. Secondly, there were adjustments in national environmental standards, policies, and procedures. These were most evident in the area of air quality control.</p>
<p>Some interviewees emphasized the potential impact of the environmental education and awareness that came about as part of OG preparation. They spoke favorably of influential business projects and innovations, and the potential legacies of these initiatives. The social aspects revealed included adjustments in social standards, policies and procedures, societal education and behavior change, a change in the mindset of the state, cultural expansion, and social cohesion within the nation (NGO 2, SPONSOR 1, OLYMPICS 1).</p>
<p>Other interviewees questioned the authenticity of Beijing’s commitment to and vision of achieving a ‘Green’ and ‘People’s’ Olympics. They did not see the same commitment level to sustainability on the ground compared with the London Games, suggesting that these themes had a marketing focus (SPONSOR 1, MEDIA 1).</p>
<p>There are significant challenges to achieving legacies from the green initiatives undertaken at the Beijing Olympics. While the initiatives and lasting opportunities of the OG may ease existing pressure on the environment, they may not keep up with demands from the growing population and individual consumerism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690212444576">Tian and Johnston’s (2008)</xref> research revealed that people seemed unsure if Beijing would ever become a highly liveable city in regard to its natural environment. Locals acknowledged government efforts to improve roads and the public transportation system, but felt it was difficult to imagine that the improvement would solve existing problems. An IOC interviewee stated that at this stage, it is too early to tell the lasting impact of the OG with respect to these issues (OLYMPICS 2). One interviewee suggested the most important legacy that came out of these Games was that they highlighted the nation as ‘all-conquering’ (MEDIA 1).</p>
<p>From a social sustainability perspective, there is documented evidence that the OG led to an increase in housing rights violations and displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690212444576">Fowler, 2008</xref>). The Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) found that the OG was used as an inducement to encourage residents to relocate voluntarily from areas that were not Olympic venues in order to ‘beautify’ the city. It was also reported that some residents were coerced into relocation with the threat that the longer they delayed moving, the lower their compensation would be. These rates did not meet legal requirements and some residents were left in lower quality housing in remote areas as a result. In the eyes of some foreign media, these outcomes tarnished the social benefits of the OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690212444576">Associated Press, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1012690212444576">USA Today, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690212444576">Reuters, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690212444576">Tian and Johnston’s (2008</xref>: 35) research study found that one of the biggest challenges facing Beijing’s efforts to deal with its environmental problems was government agencies’ attitude that environmental problems are ‘unavoidable tuition’ for economic development; that is, that environmental and social problems are part of the ‘development package’. While this study’s interviewees did not ratify or refute this position, a recent media report that consolidated the views of environmental NGOs and select government representatives indicates that this contentious perspective continues to hold true post-Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1012690212444576">Moser, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1012690212444576">
<title>Singapore</title>
<p>The Youth Olympic Games (YOG) held in Singapore in August 2010 was operationally distinct from other summer OG in terms of age group, time, and scale. Firstly, the YOG are designed for athletes between the ages of 14 and 18. Secondly, the organizers had two and a half years between winning the bid and OG implementation to prepare, a significantly shorter time frame than is ordinarily available for the preparation phase of any OG. Thirdly, approximately 3600 athletes took part in the OG, a much smaller number than is usually seen at summer Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690212444576">SYOGOC, 2010b</xref>). The YOG also had a unique purpose, which suggests that the environmental considerations were not central to the bid, and possibly were an after-thought:<disp-quote>
<p>The Bid Committee’s vision for Singapore 2010 is to stage a youth-focused Games that has Olympism at its heart, with integrated sport, educational and cultural programmes that exploit new media technologies to connect youth worldwide before, during and after the OG to the Olympic Movement and to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690212444576">SYOGOC, 2010a</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, one NGO involved with the preparation for London 2012 saw the outcomes of the YOG as limited when matched against how green legacies of the OG are traditionally gauged. The interviewee stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I think when you look at the three things key to having a transformational Games, which [are] investment in sustainable infrastructure, major engagement with big corporates, and massive global audiences, I don’t think at this stage that the Youth Olympic Games ticks any of those boxes (NGO 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it was acknowledged that the youth-focused nature of the OG did add a dimension to how the green legacies of these events are viewed. Interviewees saw these as being first and foremost about youth education, development and awareness creation. Important environmental themes included the physical legacies that resulted from retrofitting existing sports facilities, and environmental messaging for both the youth and general public in Singapore. According to two government officials, Singapore’s environmental concerns were seen to be minor in comparison to less developed, larger nations like Beijing. The YOG were of a much smaller scale, which limited the scope of significant environmental sustainability initiatives on education and awareness creation (GOV 2, GOV 3). Socially, there was a view to fostering youth leadership, cultural exchange and network building, the creation of a sporting culture, volunteerism, and workforce development. Stakeholders of the YOG expressed significant commitment to realizing the sustainability goals that were set for the OG.</p>
<p>Legacy considerations were built into the Youth Olympics project from the start. This was done by establishing a legacy unit within the organizing committee to encourage, oversee and monitor how its goals were being accomplished prior to and during the OG. This unit handed over its responsibilities to several parent agencies post-Games. For example, the National Sports Council is responsible for monitoring the continuing growth of the sports industry in Singapore after the OG, and the Ministry of Education is responsible for building on the Culture and Education Programme.</p>

<sec id="section7-1012690212444576">
<title>London</title>
<p>For London 2012, organizers displayed an unprecedented commitment to sustainability as an important theme of the OG from the outset. London’s bid candidature file focused on sport, health, and environment. The London organizers completed full environmental impact assessments for the venues early, putting London ahead of all the other candidate cities. The Sustainable Development Strategy was released for London in early 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690212444576">London 2012, 2010</xref>). It has five principal themes: climate change, waste, biodiversity and ecology, inclusion, and healthy living. A further document, <italic>The London 2012 Sustainability Plan: Towards a One Planet 2012</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690212444576">Bioregional UK, 2010</xref>) was issued in late 2007 and is updated annually. It brings together all aspects of the preparations and staging of the OG and aspires to the concept of living within the means of the planet. It also proposes carbon footprinting studies. In order to help enforce development’s remaining in line with policies, compliance with 40 key performance indicators has been and will continue to be built into any contracts awarded for the building and staging of the OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690212444576">Bioregional UK, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Interviewees emphasized that environmental and social sustainability considerations and legacies are a major theme of the London OG. LOCOG’s focus is on generating a physical legacy by restoring derelict areas, utilizing temporary structures and sustainable design, implementing a low-carbon OG, and engaging with corporate sponsors and partners for environmental behavior change. The social aspects that emerged from the interviews included raising the quality of life of local communities, creating business and employment benefits, promoting health and well-being, education and awareness, and enhancing the involvement and inclusion of various local communities. What is unique about London 2012 is that sustainability criteria are more deeply embedded in several facets of OG planning and preparation than previously seen. This is demonstrated in the collaboration between LOCOG and select local NGOs, and the active role of monitoring from the preparation phase of the OG through to implementation. What is not clear from the interviews is whether the bid process was a means to help finance an already well-established urban renewal project and, more generally, whether urban renewal projects for major sporting events help drive federal funding for needed infrastructure improvements or vice versa. Further research is required to clarify this point.</p>

<sec id="section8-1012690212444576">
<title>Key determinants of green legacies: The importance of the bid process</title>
<p>Two IOC interviewees and an NGO representative emphasized how bidding has evolved to increasingly incorporate environmental commitments and how this has resulted in legacies for host cities. An interviewee on the IOC Evaluation Commission panel with long-standing involvement in environment and sustainability considerations within the OG described a positive trend in terms of the breadth and depth of environmental commitments that constitute bids and host city contracts. According to this interviewee, once a city wins the right to host the OG, it is seen as honor-bound to meet those commitments. Where it is unable to do so, changes are negotiated with the IOC so as to minimize any adverse effects that may result. It must also be noted that the negotiations must be balanced if the OG facility construction has unintended consequences (such as cross country ski trails being altered after Lillehammer because they encroached on migratory bird nesting terrain). In the case of London, in his Transport Strategy of 2004, the Mayor of London stated the goal of reaching a 40% increase in rail and tube capacity. Bidding and aiming to win gave this goal a strict deadline, leading to a positive legacy for the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690212444576">London Civic Forum, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>According to an IOC interviewee, using the term ‘legacy’ within bidding criteria has had the effect of both increasing host city commitment to environmental initiatives for the OG and focusing the attention of organizers on the green legacies of such activities. This interviewee stated:<disp-quote>
<p>Since we introduced the term legacy into the lexicon of bids and Games planning and operation in the nineties, then every Games has got more deep and wide in terms of its environmental and sustainability commitments (OLYMPICS 2).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With environmental issues gaining greater prominence in the OG bidding process, questions related to this point within the Bidding Manual have been expanding both in quantity and in level of detail. The principle of sustainable development is a key area in themes directly associated with Olympics urbanism. Theme five asks the applicant city to provide detailed information on the environmental and meteorological conditions of its surroundings, including geographical features, potential natural hazards, ambient air and drinking-water quality and climatic data. Cities are also asked to elaborate their key environmental action plans at a holistic level as well as for individual projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690212444576">IOC, 2010b</xref>). An initial environmental impact assessment for all Olympics venues and facilities is required, to be presented together with relevant studies during the site visit of the Evaluation Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao, 2009</xref>). To one London NGO, this section of the bid requirements was not sufficient to reflect the vision that London 2012 had for sustainability within the OG and beyond. This interviewee described his position as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>At the time of writing the bid, because the IOC’s requirements for submitting a bid were sort of quite old-fashioned in terms of what you had to say about… there was a section called ‘Environment and Meteorology’ where you have to kind of convince them that the weather is going to be ok for hosting the OG and environment was sort of in that category, and because London wanted to do something ambitious in terms of sustainability, that section didn’t enable them to do justice to that vision they were trying to create. So they produced with us this document called ‘Towards a One Planet Olympics’ (NGO 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Singapore’s response to these aspects of the Bidding Manual was to follow in London’s footsteps. The perspective of one media interviewee who analyzed and covered Singapore’s bid was:<disp-quote>
<p>When Singapore bid for the Youth Olympic Games it used the same tactics as London… when they were making the bid, Singapore was also saying, ‘we want to leave a legacy’, we want to leave a legacy for the kids in Singapore, we have a lot of grassroots support (MEDIA 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the environmental aspects of Beijing’s bid, the UNEP report noted the Evaluation Commission’s position:<disp-quote>
<p>Beijing … has an ambitious set of plans and actions designed and comprehensive enough to greatly improve overall environmental conditions… Although many of the plans are not Olympic-specific, the bid has provided, and a Beijing Games would provide, an impetus and a catalyst for many measures, and their timing… The Bid Committee claims the Beijing and OCOG environmental plans and actions will leave the greatest Olympic Games environmental legacy ever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690212444576">UNEP, 2009</xref>: 25).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This source indicates that Beijing’s response was to align its sustainability commitments as closely as possible with already established national objectives. In all three cases, responses to criteria at the bid stage set the scene for environmental and social sustainability initiatives and legacies. However, Beijing’s starting point for green legacies was very different to that of Singapore and London.</p>
<p>The findings of this research study are aligned with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690212444576">Fang et al. (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690212444576">Pitts and Liao (2009)</xref> – having a sound green proposal is key to winning an OG bid. However, this study found that from the perspectives of most stakeholders, it is too early to tell whether honoring the bid promises made for the planning and implementation of the OG has guaranteed green legacies post-Games. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690212444576">Tian and Brimblecombe (2008)</xref> provide evidence that environmental improvements (such as better air quality) promised during bidding are often short-lived, the bid is nonetheless an important means for candidate cities to commit to green legacies.</p>

<sec id="section9-1012690212444576">
<title>Embedding sustainability in vision, mission, and brand</title>
<p>The embedding of sustainability considerations within vision, mission, and brand is seen by interviewees to have begun with the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Singapore organizers, viewed it as crucial in achieving their goal of an ongoing educational legacy post-Games. Two OCOG representatives and the UNEP interviewee saw the YOG event not as an end in itself but as a means to realize a grander vision of lasting social benefit for the nation’s people. Similarly, Beijing envisaged a ‘Green Olympics’ and a ‘People’s Olympics’ as part of its bid commitment towards a sustainable OG. The realization of these commitments was surrounded by various controversies which called BOCOG’s mission into question. While the UNEP representative, an IOC representative and two sponsor interviewees were quick to point out how successfully the OG were greened and the validity of BOCOG’s vision, other interviewees had differing views as to the authenticity of this form of branding. A corporate sponsor believed that the slogans were more about showcasing the nation as committed to sustainability than they were reflective of the reality of BOCOG’s intent. This sponsor is of the view that pertaining to its sponsorship role, London’s vision is being translated into a greater commitment. This interviewee explained,<disp-quote>
<p>Although Beijing called it a green Games, there wasn’t the same commitment level to sustainability and the environment as the London Games have. So within the London Games it was something that was a key criteria for signing up any partner (SPONSOR 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An NGO interviewee has a similar view of London 2012. This interviewee stated,<disp-quote>
<p>The thing I think they did really well was in the beginning, they made sustainability part of their original vision, they engaged with a wider sector of the community than had traditionally happened with the Olympic Games (NGO 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1012690212444576">
<title>Embedding sustainability in OG organization</title>
<p>Organizing committees now include environment and legacy units to implement and advocate for green initiatives and legacies. One perspective from an IOC interviewee is that:<disp-quote>
<p>There has always been a concern for the environment and the athletes etc, but it’s definitely increased over the last ten years or so… a lot of it manifests in the organizing committees. There has been a change… before a lot of them had environmental functions with one or two or three people, now we have sustainability functions with eight, 10 or 12 people that work with a multitude of organizations outside the organizing committee and they have a lot larger scope than ever before (OLYMPICS 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, this does not acknowledge that environmental concerns became important to the IOC only after the negative publicity that followed Albertville. Such work with organizations outside the organizing committee is best exemplified by London 2012’s collaboration with environmental NGOs throughout the course of planning and preparation for the OG. An OCOG interviewee placed emphasis on their role in maintaining a commitment to sustainability as core to the principles of the OG.</p>
<p>Integrating sustainability into the supply chain and procurement procedures during the planning and preparation phase is another way of embedding sustainability within the organization of OG. For example, the Singapore organizing committee implemented guidelines and best practices such as a sustainable environmental policy, green checklists, and incorporation of environmental considerations in procurement contracts. An environmental working group was set up that provided expertise and professional input, as well as assisting in the execution of these guidelines. An OCOG interviewee explained that by having sustainability criteria for tendering in place, contractors providing materials for the OG were forced to seek sustainable sources as well as to conduct eco-friendly disposal of materials post-Games. These contractors were thus encouraged to engage in environmental best practice, a way of doing things that is transferrable to future events that they tender for. This interviewee explained:<disp-quote>
<p>So contractors get used to it after doing this event. The next event comes around and they know. They can recycle this… they know what to do with this material. There should already be sustainable best practices in place (OLYMPICS 7).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it is questionable how transferrable these processes are from host city to host city given that there is no global ‘best practice’, standard, or regulation for sustainable supply chains and procurement practices. Each host country is likely to set its own benchmark for best practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1012690212444576">
<title>The value of knowledge transferred</title>
<p>IOC, OCOG, government, and NGO interviewees involved in OG since 2000 pointed to the value of accumulated knowledge from past OG. This was seen as a way of learning what to do for future OG, and knowing what pitfalls to avoid in greening the OG. While the Vancouver winter Games of 2010 are not covered within this research study, the contribution that these OG made to the sustainability knowledge base for London and future OG deserves attention. As part of its legacy for future organizing committees, the Vancouver organizing committee (VANOC) created a new sustainability governance model for organizations staging mega-sporting events, which included reporting frameworks and a sustainable sport event toolkit. VANOC produced five annual sustainability reports on its winter Games. These covered what was promised, what VANOC was able to control, and finally how VANOC performed against its goals. In November 2010, VANOC produced its final sustainability report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690212444576">2010 Legacies Now, 2010</xref>). In order to meet its commitment to its stakeholders, a third party auditor conducted assurance on selected key performance indicators in the final two reports. The auditor found the content of the reports to have been represented fairly in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690212444576">GRI 2006</xref>) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690212444576">2010 Legacies Now, 2010</xref>). These audited sustainability reports provide a clear indication of Vancouver’s environmental performance – against the goals it set itself – from its efforts to ‘green’ the OG. The frameworks, toolkit, and reports provide a means to transfer knowledge to future OG.</p>
<p>In the case of the Singapore OG, organizers saw the inaugural Youth Olympic Games as having provided a solid foundation for future OG to build on. A Singapore government interviewee expanded on the idea of knowledge transfer between OG to include the transfer of personnel trained in creating and implementing sustainability initiatives from one mega-event to the next as a means of achieving a social legacy. The UNEP interviewee saw the knowledge transfer concept as applicable to corporate sponsors as well. As sponsors increasingly take part in the creation of green initiatives around their sponsorship of the OG, and green their companies through association with the organization of green OG, they generate new knowledge that other sponsors and similar industry players can learn from.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer’s (2006)</xref> study found that a host city can learn from another host city how to use greening as a bid tactic. While there is no IOC obligation for host cities to adopt past greening practices, particularly when the uniqueness of each host city is significant in generating green legacies, the interview data suggests that sustainability-related knowledge transfer is a legacy in itself.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this paper was to shed light on an under-researched topic: that of how green legacies result from the greening of the OG. The findings indicate institutionalization of elements of sustainability in the OG. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690212444576">DiMaggio and Powell (1983</xref>: 148) refer to institutionalization as ‘the emergence and structuration of an organizational field as a result of the activities of a diverse set of organizations; and, second, the homogenization of these organizations, and of new entrants as well, once the field is established’. The media, supranational bodies such as the United Nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690212444576">Jennings and Zandbergen, 1995</xref>), the IOC, NGOs, governments and the public have all been instrumental in driving the greening of the OG, although they have differing levels of political and economic power and commitment to environmental issues. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690212444576">Bansal (2005)</xref> found that the media plays an important role in mobilizing social movements such as sustainability, shaping the norms of acceptable and legitimate practices. In the 1990s the media played an active role in shaping institutional norms around environmental protection through the stories it was publishing. The environmental damage at Albertville was reported through the international media, although the IOC dismissed these reports at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690212444576">Cantelon and Letters, 2000</xref>). This ‘coercive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690212444576">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>) pressure and the positive environmental experience at Lillehammer led the IOC to redefine its position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690212444576">Cantelon and Letters, 2000</xref>) and to develop strict environmental guidelines for future OG bids.</p>
<p>Mimetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690212444576">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>) and legitimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690212444576">Suchman, 1995</xref>) processes are also at play in the greening of the OG. Each OG has learnt from previous OG and green legacies now appear to be a competitive driver in bids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690212444576">Jennings and Zandbergen (1995)</xref> found that if a practice comes to have some recognized value, the organization will simply mimic other organizations (past host-city bids) rather than questioning the practice’s value. In addition, they found that other practices are adopted to gain a competitive advantage. Learning from its loss to Sydney, which had made sustainability a key element in its bid, Beijing presented a comprehensive plan for sustainable development in its bid for the 2008 OG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690212444576">Beyer, 2006</xref>). London upped the ante by releasing its Sustainable Development Strategy and 2012 Sustainability Plan ahead of other bidders. Singapore mimicked the tactics of London’s bid in its quest ‘to leave a legacy’. Host cities seek to reduce the level of uncertainty by imitating the structure and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690212444576">Bansal, 2005</xref>) of other OG bids. Through imitation, host cities can capitalize on the success of previous bids.</p>
<p>Legitimation is a key strategy during the bidding process and in the organization and operations of the OG. Legitimacy can be described as a ‘generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690212444576">Suchman, 1995</xref>: 574). Bidding cities have to talk green to be seen as legitimate contenders to host the OG. They must also be seen to be learning from previous OG while demonstrating the potential for their host city to deliver even more legacies than the previous OG. However, positive legacies occur if key promises are delivered upon, which the research study did not evaluate. While this research study identified key determinants of green legacies based on the three most current summer OG, the findings can be tested in other contexts, such as through longitudinal studies conducted in host cities long after the attention of the world’s spectators and media has moved on, as well as through studies of the legacies of summer and winter OG and other candidate cities since 1994.</p>
<p>The increasing recognition of ecological limits has increased the demands placed on stakeholders in the greening of the OG. The notion of sustainability appears to be shifting from an ideal to an imperative. While it remains to be seen how the OG will continue to evolve and what legacies will eventuate, the steps towards greening the OG signal a resolve to leverage the OG for transformational results.</p>
