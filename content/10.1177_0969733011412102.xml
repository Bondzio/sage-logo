<abstract>
<p>Ethics support is called for to improve the quality of care in elderly institutions. Various forms of ethics support are presented, but the needs for ethics support remain unknown. Using a mixed-methods design, this article systematically investigates the specific needs for ethics support in elderly care. The findings of two surveys, two focus groups and 17 interviews demonstrate that the availability of ethics support is limited. There is a need for ethics support, albeit not unconditionally. Advice-based forms of ethics support are less appropriate as they are removed from practice. Ethics support should be tailored to the often mundane and easily overlooked moral issues that arise in long-term care. Attention should also be given to the learning styles of nurses who favour experiential learning. Raising awareness and developing a climate of openness and dialogue are the most suitable ways to deal with the mundane moral issues in elderly care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing international awareness that attention should be given to the further development of elderly care to maintain or improve the quality of care.<sup>

</sup> The volume of elderly care is increasing as a consequence of the growing number of clients resulting from the increasing numbers of older citizens in the population. Cost cuts, the sector’s negative image, care standardization, an ever increasing workload, and understaffing all impose a heavy burden on elderly care. <sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Nurses and care assistants in elderly care are confronted with various ethical issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011412102">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>

</sup> Ideally, a nursing home should provide a living context where residents can live in accordance with their own standards. However, life in an institution is seldom a continuation of life as it was at home. Living in an institution inevitably means that personal preferences and autonomy are curtailed by the necessary routines, the presence of fellow residents, family members, dependency on professional caregivers and limited resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412102">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412102">14</xref>
</sup> Nursing homes still resemble the ‘total institution’ depicted by Goffman in the 1960s,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412102">15</xref>
</sup> in spite of recent developments such as person-centred care, hospitality care, and small-scale living. Nurses must deal with conflicting interests,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011412102">16</xref>
</sup> difficult behaviour,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011412102">17</xref>
</sup> limited resources, and social problems stemming from a community of residents who did not choose to live together.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412102">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011412102">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A seemingly easy situation, such as the routine of washing older adults involves a set of complex values such as dignity, autonomy, bodily integrity and wellbeing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>
</sup> However, the complexity of such a situation is easily overlooked as working routines and habits lend structure to daily care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412102">19</xref>
</sup> Moreover, given the relatively low formal education and training of most nurses, reflection in long-term care and enduring client-professional relations are challenging.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412102">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011412102">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Several forms of ethics support have been introduced to help nurses deal with moral issues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412102">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011412102">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412102">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412102">22</xref>
</sup> The most common form of support is the clinical ethics committee.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412102">23</xref>
</sup> Some authors have observed that a traditional ethics committee tends to be far removed from practice<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412102">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412102"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412102">26</xref>
</sup> and some studies promote alternative forms of ethics support for long-term care, i.e. moral case deliberation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412102">27</xref>
</sup> ethics rounds<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412102">28</xref>
</sup> and a care-ethics lab.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>
</sup> To date, no systematic studies have investigated the extent to which the range of ethics support currently on offer actually meets the needs of ethics support in elderly care.</p>
<p>This article systematically assesses the specific needs for ethics support in elderly care. The research question is: ‘What are the specific needs for ethics support in elderly care?’ The data are based on a mixed-methods study conducted among elderly care organizations in the Netherlands. This study focused on the ethics support currently available, on evaluating these forms of ethics support, and on the needs for ethics support in elderly care. The argument is that the specific moral issues that arise in elderly care and the learning styles of nurses have implications for the kind of ethics support that best fits with institutionalized elderly care. Here, the term nurses also includes care assistants.</p>

<title>Data collection, analyses and quality procedures</title>
<p>The need for ethics support was investigated using two survey questionnaires, prepared by reading the literature and talking to experts from different fields. Both questionnaires focused on the needs for ethics support, the goals of ethics support, and the different forms of ethics support.</p>
<p>Questionnaire 1 was directed at the board members of healthcare institutions. It was developed by reading the literature, talking to experts (<italic>N</italic> = 7) from different sectors and testing the questionnaire with board members and experts (<italic>N</italic> = 9) from various sectors. The participants found our questionnaire too long, and board members were not the right people to answer some of the questions. We searched for ways to get as much information as possible in a short questionnaire. The main topics we wanted to ask the board members about were included in the short questionnaire based on Slowther.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412102">23</xref>
</sup> We added open-ended questions on the goals of ethics support, the desirability of ethics support, and on existing forms of ethics support. An additional advantage of using Slowther’s questionnaire was that we were able to place the results in an international context.</p>
<p>Questionnaire 1 was sent (postal) to all intramural healthcare institutions (<italic>N</italic> = 2137) registered with the Netherlands Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733011412102">Table 2</xref>), and included elderly care establishments, hospitals, mental healthcare and institutions for the mentally disabled. The data collection (April–July 2008) included two reminders and a telephone follow-up. The 2137 individual healthcare institutions turned out to be members of 864 legal bodies, i.e. umbrella organizations with a legal status. Hence, there are two response rates for this first questionnaire, namely 30% (638/2137) at the individual institution level, and 56% (485/864) at the legal body level.</p>

<p>Questionnaire 2 was distributed to ethics support staff, who are, generally speaking, professionals involved in organizing, implementing and executing ethics support in their institutions, such as the chairs of ethical committees, or spiritual caregivers. The questionnaire was also developed by reading the literature and by holding discussions with experts (<italic>N</italic> = 12) from different sectors; for example, people with methodological experience in (digital) surveys and people with substantial knowledge of ethics support. This questionnaire was first tested among 12 experts from different fields, who completed the questionnaire and gave feedback by email. Questionnaire 2 included the questions that the board members were unable to answer in the pilot; for example, on content, participants, integration and evaluation of ethics support.</p>
<p>Questionnaire 2 was sent (digitally) to all the ethics support staff members (<italic>N</italic> = 515) designated by the respondents in Questionnaire 1. The number of ethics support staff members was less than the number of respondents for Questionnaire 1 (<italic>N</italic> = 638) because not all respondents in Questionnaire 1 designated a best informant. The data collection (April 2009–July 2009) included two reminders and a telephone follow-up. The response rate was 48% (247/515).</p>
<p>Elderly care (care homes, nursing homes and sometimes home care) is the largest group (78%) in the research population of the original study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733011412102">Table 2</xref>), and it is also the group with the highest response rate in the dataset. More than half the respondents (62% for Questionnaire 1, and 55% for Questionnaire 2) are from elderly care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0969733011412102">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The data provided by the questionnaires were analysed separately and transformed for further analysis and comparison (crossover track analysis).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733011412102">29</xref>
</sup> The closed questions were first analysed using MS Excel and SPSS 15. Subsequently, the answers to the open-ended questions were labelled and clustered into (sub)themes following an inductive qualitative analysis. Relations were visualized in a mind map and discussed in the research team and validated in the advisory committee and the focus groups.</p>
<p>We organized two focus groups (summer 2009) which were attended by participants who had completed the questionnaires. The groups were a mix of board members/directors, ethics support staff, general staff members and a healthcare professional. There were 22 participants, including seven participants from elderly care. The elderly care participants were three staff members (including one who was also head of the ethics committee), one head of the ethics committee, one spiritual caregiver, one director, and one nursing home doctor). The meeting itself was structured by the issues emerging from the surveys, and followed an agenda that left ample room for exploration and dialogue. Each two-hour session was moderated by an experienced senior researcher and the first author. Group dynamics were taken into account. The initial analysis of the data from both questionnaires was discussed. Furthermore, they also completed a handout about the preliminary findings. The conversations were analysed and a summary sent to the participants for validation (member check). Any additional email and telephone responses were incorporated in the further analysis.</p>
<p>Semi-structured interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 17) were conducted to establish corroboration and to gain a deeper understanding of the findings. The interviewees included three people from elderly care, one staff member and the head of an ethics committee, one staff member from an elderly care umbrella organization, and one staff member from a centre of expertise for long-term care. The interviews were conducted by the first author and lasted about 1.5 hours. Themes again included the need for developing goals for ethics support, and the forms of ethics support. The interviews were recorded, analysed, returned for validation (member check), and used to establish corroboration and gain a deeper understanding. The analysis of the focus group and interview transcripts followed a thematic content analysis. Transcripts were read for recurring themes, which were labelled and clustered until a robust framework was developed. The analysis was completed by the first author together with a team of senior researchers. The combination of methods (triangulation procedure) added breadth to the study, and the qualitative data helped provide explanations for the numeric data from the surveys.</p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>Informed consent was obtained by an explanatory introduction letter to respondents of Questionnaire 1 and 2. Prior to the meeting, participants of the focus groups and interviews received information by telephone and/or email about the focus group or interview. At the start of the meeting there was a short presentation of the preliminary findings and afterwards they received a member check for agreement. Respondents participated voluntarily. Anonymity was guaranteed by not using names in the analysis and reports.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section7-0969733011412102">
<title>Ethics support in elderly care</title>
<p>Currently, ethics support, as in the existence of ethics committees (56% are without), moral case deliberation (64% are without), and ethics consultants (92% are without) is severely limited in elderly care in the Netherlands. When a moral question arises in elderly care, other forms such as pastoral care (78% have this), group meetings in the form of multidisciplinary meetings (65% have them), or policy-like guidelines (54% have them) are used (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011412102">Table 3</xref>). The findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011412102">Table 3</xref> also show that ethics support is not automatically considered to be important in elderly care institutions. For example, only 23% of the ethics committees are deemed to be important within the institution (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0969733011412102">Table 3</xref>). Collaborative meetings, such as multidisciplinary team meetings, are the most highly esteemed (26%).</p>

<title>Conditional need</title>
<p>The answers to the open-ended questions in the first questionnaire (Q1) illustrate that some elderly care institutions see no need for ethics support because they are satisfied with their existing forms of ethics support:<disp-quote>
<p>Regular, informal deliberation is enough. (Q1, Director, nursing home)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents also indicate that the need for ethics support may not be evident or even espoused. They explain that the ethical dimension of care is implicit and therefore the need is hidden:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m convinced there is a need, but what makes it complicated is that this need is hidden from view. (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long-term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some argue that moral issues in elderly care do not arise very often and if they do, they are not particularly complicated. For example, they compare their situation with hospitals where, given the complex and structural nature of medical ethical issues in that context, the need for ethics support would be more obvious. The following is from the chairman of a board who probably has a traditional view of ethics and is not aware of the mundane nature of many ethical issues:<disp-quote>
<p>Ethical issues in our care home generally tend to be incidental and less complex than those in, say, a hospital. (Q1, Chairman of the board, health care centre with assisted living facilities)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Elderly care institutions may not give priority to ethics support for organizational reasons such as the size of the healthcare institution: ‘It is important, but our care home is too small’ (Q1, Care manager, health care centre with assisted living facilities); and the spiritual background: ‘The Bible is the precept behind all our care and services’ (Q1, Director, health care centre with assisted living facilities).</p>
<p>Some respondents have also noticed a discrepancy between what elderly care institutions want and what they actually have in place. They want to use ethics support to help them deliver good care, yet they do not embark on ethics support because there are so many other priorities and because implementing ethics support would change the organization.<disp-quote>
<p>All those organizations really have a lot on their plate. So, because there are so many other priorities, if they have to make a choice, they won’t, out of the blue, just implement some kind of ethics support. It really is something that organizations do want to get up and running, but it’s quite intensive because you actually shake the very core of your organization.

<title>Specific needs</title>
<p>The data of this study as a whole indicate that elderly care has specific needs regarding ethics support. Most board members concur that ethics support is desirable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0969733011412102">Table 4</xref>) and the answers to the open ended questions explain the specific needs for ethics support in elderly care. First, the moral issues in elderly care require ethics support. Second, given the characteristic moral issues and skills required of nurses working in elderly care, it is a very specific kind of support that is needed.</p>

<sec id="section11-0969733011412102">
<title>Moral issues in elderly care</title>
<p>The answers to the open-ended questions illustrate that the type of moral questions influence the specific need for ethics support in elderly care:<disp-quote>
<p>Employees are confronted every day with questions from an ever increasing group of elderly, vulnerable clients. (Q1, Regional manager, healthcare centre)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The findings indicate there is some discrepancy as to the perceived number of moral issues in elderly care. A minority of respondents indicate that moral issues are uncommon in elderly care. Conversely, most respondents emphasize that there are many complex questions that require more structural and systematic attention. They point to care ethical questions, organizational constraints, and nurses’ attitudes.</p>
<p>Several board members and ethics staff members emphasize that ethics is much broader than dilemmas about life and death.<disp-quote>
<p>Ethics support is absolutely essential when caring for frail and vulnerable people; it influences what you do, and it’s a basis to help you make decisions. (Q1, Spiritual caregiver, nursing home)</p>
<p>Ethics is an everyday issue, when are you doing the right thing, and for whom is it the best thing to do? Ethics is more than dilemmas about life and death. (Q1, Head of the day-care unit, health care centre with assisted living facilities)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The quantitative findings of Questionnaire 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0969733011412102">Table 5</xref>) confirm that there are not many medical ethical issues in elderly care (40% indicate that these kinds of questions do not arise frequently).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>However, moral questions about one’s attitude as to how to treat someone do emerge frequently (73%). These questions often generate a feeling of powerlessness:<disp-quote>
<p>When you really have the idea that you can’t do anything to make life more pleasant for the residents. (Interview with staff member of an umbrella organization for elderly care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As a nurse it is obviously very difficult when you feel you cannot influence the situation:<disp-quote>
<p>When you really have the feeling that you can’t do anything to make someone’s life easier and more pleasant. (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long-term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents point out that nurses in elderly care have less professional training in ethics than, for example, registered nurses in hospitals. Those respondents who understand ethics to encompass more than medical ethical issues such as end-of-life decisions are not satisfied with how nurses currently deal with the moral dimension in healthcare:<disp-quote>
<p>They are confronted with ethical questions, but they are not fully equipped to recognize or deal with them. (Q1, Board member, health care centre with assisted living facilities)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nurses tend to associate ethics with medical ethical issues such as respect for autonomy, tube feeding, resuscitation or euthanasia, while most ethical questions in elderly care actually different. For example:<disp-quote>
<p>An old lady with dementia and diabetes who wants to eat cake every day. When you believe she’s autonomous, then you should let her have cake every day, but then that doesn’t feel like being a good caregiver. (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Several respondents state that nurses do not have sufficient skills to identify and deal with ethical issues. They indicate that nurses in elderly care do feel when there is an ethical question, but they are unable to say what it is:<disp-quote>
<p>They often experience a feeling of powerlessness without recognizing the ethical basis of the situation. (Focus group participant, staff member elderly care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nurses feel uncomfortable, but simply return to their routines in order to deal with the unpleasant feeling they experience since they see no alternatives. One interviewee comments that employees wrongly assume that giving attention takes time:<disp-quote>
<p>When serving food there was one caregiver who waited until the patient answered ‘thank you’ after she had said ‘enjoy your meal.’ The others just got on with handing out food without waiting for an answer:… enjoy your meal, enjoy your meal, enjoy your meal… (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long-term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011412102">
<title>Specific support</title>
<p>Given the type of moral issues to be found in elderly care, and the skills of the nurses involved, respondents postulate that specific ethics support is needed, which, they believe, is up to the organization to facilitate. In elderly care, particularly those people with an exemplary role can be very supportive for nurses, so that they learn how to deal with ethical questions:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s all about how people learn. Most caregivers in elderly care don’t learn from theory. They tend to learn from good examples, by copying the behaviour of role models. If there’s a team with colleagues they respect and admire then they might think something like ‘I’d also like to do it the way they do’. In these cases many beautiful things happen. They’re often new people or students. (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long-term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents suggest that elderly care might possibly require forms of ethics support that differ from what is found in other healthcare settings, particularly because nurses in elderly care lack confidence and do not feel appreciated for the effort and energy they put into their work. The broader political image in society at large of what elderly care entails actually exacerbates the situation and results in nurses being ashamed of working in elderly care. Ethics support should help get the work of these nurses recognized, rather than introducing yet another innovation or course that may again be perceived as criticism of their effort:<disp-quote>
<p>Elderly care is not really appreciated. Nurses should get more support, more recognition. It’s only when they become aware that they really do make a difference that they’ll start to appreciate themselves and again be proud of their profession. For example, if asked about their job at a party, they hardly dare say they are nurses. They are usually associated with urine and faeces instead of with wellbeing, whereas for me it is wellbeing that really counts. (Interview staff member centre of expertise for long-term care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents argue that implementing ethics support as ‘yet another’ course only serves to foster the feeling that nurses ‘do not do enough’, while in fact they actually give a lot of themselves. There is a tension here for elderly institutions because, on the one hand, they should not introduce ‘yet another innovation,’ but on the other hand they are assumed to be responsible for ethics support, as the following quote illustrates:<disp-quote>
<p>Employees who have to deal with difficult questions are entitled to get support for this in their work. (Q1, Spiritual caregiver &amp; member of ethics committee, care home)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Respondents prefer not to opt for a specific form of ethics support and advocate a combination of different forms: most often cited are – group deliberation (informal: 26%; in a committee: 23%; moral case deliberation: 16%). Apparently there are advantages to group deliberations, as the following respondent illustrates:<disp-quote>
<p>Ethical dilemmas are sometimes discussed during team or work meetings. Perhaps this isn’t really official support, but in practice it is meaningful and useful to make an ethical decision in a short space of time. (Q2, Nursing home physician, nursing home)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, many elderly care institutions reject isolated forms of ethics support. Respondents prefer integrated ethics support which blends in with daily activities i.e. it is not something new, and low threshold. Ethics should become a shared responsibility. Role models and leadership are essential:<disp-quote>
<p>Don’t formalize it as a ‘service.’ That only involves extra money and leads to problems; easy accessibility would disappear. Rather define it as an integral responsibility. (Q1, Chairman of the board, health care centre with assisted living facilities)</p>
<p>Employees and management should feel and behave responsibly because otherwise they might think that ‘the ethics committee is responsible for this’. (Q1, Site director, care home)</p>
<p>Directors say it’s important that the work floor is ethical, but they don’t get involved themselves. And their involvement really is necessary if the goals of ethics support are to be achieved. (FG, Staff employee elderly care)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Therefore, elderly care institutions have a need for organized and integrated low threshold, familiar ethics support.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings illustrate that ethics support in elderly care institutions in the Netherlands is limited. There is a need for this kind of support, albeit not unconditionally. The data indicate that advice-based forms of ethics support transcend and do not match up with the nature of moral problems found in long-term care. The belief is that advice-based forms of ethics support are far removed from actual practice and that they are not in tune with the real issues in the workplace. Several authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of ethics committees,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412102">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412102"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412102">26</xref>
</sup> and they confirm that the extent to which a committee is appropriate for creating a communication platform for mundane issues is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Many moral issues in elderly care arise daily, and often involve seemingly ‘trivial’ issues. The literature refers to this as ‘everyday ethics’,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412102">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011412102">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412102">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011412102">17</xref>
</sup> which includes everyday practice, the routines and encounters with clients and relatives. Everyday ethics looks beyond the extra-ordinary dilemmas, such as death and dying – the traditional focus of bio-ethics<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011412102">30</xref>
</sup> – and broadens the scope to the context in which ethical dilemmas arise.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011412102">31</xref>
</sup> One problem observed in our study is that everyday ethical questions may be overlooked or found to be, as Caplan puts it, ‘mundane’ or ‘banal’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412102">14</xref>
</sup> Our respondents argue that ethics support should therefore first and foremost help nurses recognize and identify these problems as being moral problems. This corresponds with the literature that says that explicit attention should be given to the moral dimension of daily practice, as ‘the challenge of recognizing everyday ethical issues lies in their ordinariness.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412102">32</xref>
</sup> Blind spots may easily arise in institutional settings that are regulated by a rigid regime and working routine.</p>
<p>Another emergent characteristic of everyday ethics is that many moral problems are continuous in nature. End-of-life decisions are irreversible: once a decision has been taken, nurses have to deal with the consequences. The majority of moral issues in elderly care are not irreversible decisions but problems that last much longer. This also implies that everyday ethical questions often create more space for experimentation and for trying out different options. Yet this space for creative interaction can only be used if there is ongoing evaluation of delivered care, underlying values and an analysis of the context.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011412102">11</xref>
</sup> As Caplan rightly states: ‘everyday questions are no less deserving of careful thought and deliberation.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412102">14</xref>
</sup> This implies that ethics support should create space for reflection in order to encourage nurses to experiment in their dealings with elderly clients.</p>
<p>Our respondents indicate that specific needs for ethics support are also related to the nurses’ education level. Daily care (e.g. personal care, leadership on the ward, assistance at mealtimes) is generally provided by lower educated and cheap nursing staff.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412102">13</xref>
</sup> They are task oriented<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412102">33</xref>
</sup> and focus on practical work.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011412102">2</xref>
</sup> These nurses also prefer to learn in concrete and active ways<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412102">34</xref>
</sup> and can, as Kolb puts it, be typified as ‘accommodators.’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412102">35</xref>
</sup> In an empirical study in two nursing homes and six care homes in the Netherlands, Snoeren and Dekker-VanDoorn<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412102">34</xref>
</sup> found that lower educated nursing staff were less capable of perceiving abstract problems, were reluctant to change, often did not analyse problems thoroughly and therefore found it difficult to evaluate solutions. Negative communication patterns within the team and a tendency for a quick evaluation or for no evaluation at all, and waiting for the manager to solve a problem can also obstruct learning processes. Van der Dam S et al.,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412102">22</xref>
</sup> Snoeren and Dekker-VanDoorn<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412102">34</xref>
</sup> and Slettebø<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011412102">36</xref>
</sup> found that an important strategy for dealing with difficult situations is the use of former experience, by applying solutions that have proven successful in the past. One risk of this strategy, also known as casuistry, is that experience and solutions become private and are not discussed in the team. This means that dialogue and group learning cannot take place. Traditional ethics support does not match well with these learning styles and the need for collective learning.</p>
<p>We should not overlook the problems related to the context in which the nurses work. Our respondents draw attention to feelings of powerlessness as a human response to the chasm between their low educational level and the complex questions they encounter. Instead of being recognized for the difficult work they do, nurses are overloaded with new assignments and innovations which may, in turn, further increase their feeling of powerlessness. There is a need for empowerment rather than for just another form of ethics support.</p>
<sec id="section14-0969733011412102">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Our findings are somewhat limited because we only included the perspectives of board members and ethics support staff in the elderly care institutions. However, this is the first broad overview of ethics support, and it clearly forms the basis for further research into the needs for ethics support, also with other stakeholders in elderly care.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the empirical data were collected in the Netherlands, so therefore it remains unclear to what extent these findings can also be applied in an international context. However, because the international literature corresponds with many of our results, the findings might be relevant for other countries outside the Netherlands. Moreover, this article can serve as a starting point for a discussion about the need for ethics support in elderly care abroad.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0969733011412102">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Since many issues in elderly care are mundane and long term, it is important to focus ethics support on reflection and learning instead of on decision making. Reflection here refers to being able to get a handle on complex situations, understanding their complexity and the underlying values and duties.</p>
<p>Ethics support should also be adapted to the learning styles of nurses and focus on reinforcing learning. It is recommended that a developmental perspective be taken and that once formal education has been completed, learning should realistically be continued. Work-based learning is probably a good way to do this. Education is important and should be linked to explicit actions in a specific context. Experiential learning is more appropriate than frontal learning. For example, moral case deliberation (MCD) stimulates reflection and mutual learning. Another example of ethics support grounded in concrete experience is the recently developed sTimul care ethics lab. This is an educational setting where nurses take the role of a patient in order to experience what it means to be a care-receiver. After preparation and selection the participants join a so called ‘empathy session’ of two days in which they receive care from nursing students. During the session the simulation exercise is stopped twice to invite both groups to reflect on their experiences. After two months there is a follow-up including a return-day for the nurses and ethical reflection in lessons for the students. The personal and embodied simulation of the vulnerability of older care-dependent people leads to an enhanced insight into ethical intuitions and expression of ethical perceptions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412102">9</xref>
</sup> What these approaches also share is that they build on the moral insights of participants as opposed to following the advice of an expert. This is not to say that traditional ethics support models, i.e. ethics committees and consultants, are no longer needed. These forms of ethics support can be complementary; for example, an ethics committee may help introduce and coordinate MCD or alternatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we recommend the development of an ethical climate of reflection-in-action, openness and dialogue. Ethics support should empower nurses and encourage them to be creative. A cultural change might even be more important than simply another form of ethics support. As things stand, it would appear that ethical issues have reached a status quo, whereas what is really needed is a dynamic climate. Such an organizational culture is characterized by openness, it is a context in which something which might appear obvious is questioned. Creative and higher educated nurses may act as role models and foster cultural change in the workplace, if supported by leadership from top and middle management. Middle managers in particular might serve as role models and create the opportunity and space for reflection. We recommend that ethical competences become part of the criteria when recruiting middle managers.</p>
<p>This study was conducted among respondents in the higher echelons of elderly care organizations. We recommend that the need for ethics support also be investigated from the perspectives of practitioners and care receivers in elderly care, namely the residents and their families.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Elderly care generates specific needs for ethical support. Everyday ethics in elderly care requires mundane issues to be recognized as moral issues, otherwise they may all too easily be overlooked. The continuous nature of moral problems in long-term care requires methodical evaluation and reflection to be able to optimally use the room for creative experimentation. There should also be room for learning-by-doing and collective reflection to counter the tendency to focus on getting the work done and finding solutions to practical problems based on former experiences. In addition to an ethics committee or consultant, elderly care institutions might benefit from ethics support that focuses on reflection and learning among nurses. However, this starts with the development of a climate and culture of openness and dialogue, and the recognition of the valuable work done by nurses.</p>
