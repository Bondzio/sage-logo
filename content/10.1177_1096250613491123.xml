<p>There are certain periods of a child’s development that are considered points of transition—qualitative shifts that reveal a significant change in the way a child understands and interacts with his or her environment. These transitions are marked by child behaviors that reflect his or her previous and emerging ways of interacting. Transitions can be a tough time to assess for current developmental status given the fluctuating expression of competencies. Yet, they are actually considered prime occasions for intervention. While change is naturally occurring, adults can intercede with adaptations and scaffolded expectations to maximize the opportunity of growth already unfolding. Over the course of this year, I see DEC as undergoing a very similar transition, most particularly resulting from the shift in Executive Board governance and the expected turnover of a long-term Executive Director. These natural occurrences in an organization’s life span were enhanced by serious reflection on where DEC currently is and what we would like DEC to become, and then utilizing this transitional opportunity to move toward that vision.</p>
<p>Throughout this year, the President’s Message has been focused primarily on the Executive Board’s work in applying the Policy Governance Model to DEC. Just like child developmental transitions reflect both past and future interaction approaches, the DEC Executive Board has, over the past year, had one “foot” in the old governance model and one in Policy Governance. As DEC activities and operations are once again guided by an Executive Director, the Executive Board is readied to move fully into Policy Governance. By focusing Board efforts on crafting/revising Ends (the vision for DEC’s impact on young children with disabilities and their families) and policies to guide meeting those Ends; linking with DEC members; and monitoring the work of the Executive Office—and Executive Office energies are concentrated on implementation—DEC will be well-positioned to continue to be a vibrant, important organization that makes a significant contribution to the vision we have for young children with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p>During the search for a new Executive Director, the Executive Board had an opportunity to envision the qualifications needed of an Executive Director who will lead DEC into the future. We are very excited to have Leah Weiner, EdD as DEC’s new Executive Director. Dr. Weiner blends expertise in leading organizations that work on behalf of individuals with disabilities with a strong commitment to access issues, most particularly for children with disabilities living in poverty. Her role as Executive Director will focus on planning, developing, administering, facilitating, and overseeing all operations and activities of DEC, consistent with DEC’s primary outcome and commensurate with Board expectations. Her leadership of the organization will result in numerous opportunities for DEC members to spearhead, and be engaged in, various DEC initiatives.</p>
<p>This year’s transition period emerged a renewed commitment to DEC members as leaders of DEC’s activities. Our first DEC conference with a Program Chair other than the President and President-Elect is occurring in October (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dec-sped.org/Conference">http://www.dec-sped.org/Conference</ext-link> to register). The Recommended Practices Commission, comprised of DEC members, is steering the effort to revise DEC’s recommended practices. In addition, 12 DEC members have taken on the significant responsibility of Priority Area Leads (PALs). With the Executive Board’s support, these PALs are heading the important work of various DEC activities. It is only through the service of DEC members can these numerous initiatives and activities move forward to benefit young children with disabilities and their families. I would like to thank the PALs, those who worked with the PALs, all DEC members who asked how they could help, and those who simply gave help as they saw fit, throughout this transition year.</p>
<p>I would also like to express my appreciation to Sarah Mulligan, DEC’s former Executive Director, for her years of commitment to DEC. And as usual, now is the time for the annual transition of certain Executive Board positions. I would like to thank the three retiring Board members—Immediate Past President Kristie Pretti-Frontczak of Ohio, Member at Large Gregory Cheatham of Kansas, and Member at Large Megan Purcell of Indiana. The 2012-2013 DEC Executive Board was as strong a board as I have ever experienced, evidenced by the successful navigation of this transition. I now hand the reigns over to Carol Trivette of North Carolina as the 2013-2014 President and take on my new role as Immediate Past President. I would also like to welcome our new Board members: Erin Barton of Tennessee, who is DEC’s Vice President, and three Members at Large—Rashida Banerjee of Colorado, Jen Newton of Virginia, and Mark Smith of Nebraska. Their contact information, as well as for all Board members, can be found on the DEC website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dec-sped.org/About_DEC/Who_We_Are/Executive_Board_Members">http://www.dec-sped.org/About_DEC/Who_We_Are/Executive_Board_Members</ext-link>).</p>
<p>And one more transition is happening . . . this President’s Message in <italic>Young Exceptional Children</italic> will now be the DEC Executive Board’s Message. Different Executive Board members will contribute a message on behalf of the entire Executive Board, providing an opportunity for DEC members to hear from various board members.</p>
<p>As DEC transitions into its next developmental phase, I applaud the efforts of so many DEC members who have helped transform DEC to be readied for organizational evolution in order to best realize its vision for early intervention and early childhood special education.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
