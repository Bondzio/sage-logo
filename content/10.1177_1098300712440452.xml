<abstract>
<p>Students at risk for, or with, emotional disturbance during preadolescence struggle to adjust socially, behaviorally, and academically and often make choices about relationships that support problem behaviors. Research suggests explicitly teaching self-determination skills as early as preschool may prevent referral to special education with a label of emotional disturbance. This study examined the effects of a multimedia goal-setting intervention on students’ knowledge of the self-determined learning model of instruction and disruptive behavior. Results indicated a functional relationship between the independent variable and dependent variables. Limitations, suggestions for future research, and implications for practice are provided.</p>

<p>All students are expected to meet behavior and academic expectations during their school-age years. For students at-risk for, or with, emotional disturbance (ED), meeting academic and behavior expectations required by schools can be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712440452">Farmer et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098300712440452">The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (2004)</xref> mandates educators of students with disabilities use academic and behavioral strategies to address students’ inappropriate behavior to reduce the likelihood of students being identified with ED. If educators fail to implement effective academic and behavioral interventions, students at risk for, or with, ED often continue to experience negative in-school and postschool outcomes.</p>
<p>Specifically, students with ED face negative in-school outcomes, such as discipline referral, suspension, expulsion, and school drop out, and are likely to face incarceration at some point during their school years (National Longitudinal Transition Study–2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098300712440452">2006</xref>). Poor in-school outcomes are often followed by poor postschool outcomes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098300712440452">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, and Knokey (2009)</xref> indicated that students with ED continue to have difficulty maintaining postschool employment, rarely attend postsecondary education, and are not likely to live independently.</p>
<p>Although early intervention strategies have targeted preventing ED in young children, there remains a lack of interventions to support preadolescent and adolescent students at risk for ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712440452">Lane, Wehby, &amp; Barton-Arwood, 2005</xref>). Preadolescent students at risk for ED have increased difficulty with meeting behavior expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098300712440452">Farmer et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, it is important that behavioral interventions focus on reducing the risk of continued behavior problems, which may ultimately lead to identification as ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098300712440452">Lane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098300712440452">Tobin &amp; Sugai, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>One method for improving outcomes for students at risk for, or with, ED is to teach students self-determination skills (e.g., goal setting, choice making). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712440452">Test et al. (2009)</xref> identified self-determination as an in-school predictor of positive postschool employment and education outcomes for students with disabilities. In addition, research on teaching self- determination skills to students at risk for, or with, ED has shown to be an effective method for improving problem behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712440452">Agran, Blanchard, Wehmeyer, &amp; Hughes, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, in a literature review conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098300712440452">Shogran, Faggella-Luby, Bae, and Wehmeyer (2004)</xref>, overall findings suggested that when individuals with disabilities were provided opportunities to make preferences and choices disruptive behaviors decreased.</p>
<p>One intervention that has successfully reduced students’ problem behavior and increased self-determination is the Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction (SDLMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712440452">Palmer &amp; Wehmeyer, 2003</xref>). The SDLMI addresses a variety of self-determination component skills including goal setting, problem solving, choice making, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098300712440452">Wehmeyer, Palmer, Agran, Mitaug, &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>). The SDLMI includes three instructional phases: set a goal, make a plan to meet the goal, and adjust progress toward the goal (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/sped/tri/selfdeterminedmodel.htm">http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/sped/tri/selfdeterminedmodel.htm</ext-link> for more information on the SDLMI). Several studies support the use of the SDLMI as an effective model for teaching students at risk for, or with, disabilities to self-set goals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712440452">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712440452">Benitez, Lattimore, &amp; Wehmeyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712440452">Palmer &amp; Wehmeyer, 2003</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712440452">Agran et al. (2002)</xref> found when middle school students with autism, intellectual disabilities, or multiple disabilities were taught the SDLMI, they were able to self-set goals and target classroom behaviors (e.g., appropriate touching, following directions) improved. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712440452">Palmer and Wehmeyer (2003)</xref> found teaching elementary students at risk for, or with, disabilities to self-set academic and behavior goals using the SDLMI was effective for improving students’ goals and level of self-determination. More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712440452">Benitez et al. (2005)</xref> used a modified version of the SDLMI and found teaching adolescents with ED to self-set employment goals was effective for improving students’ ability to make progress toward achieving targeted goals.</p>
<p>In each of these studies, the SDLMI was taught using traditional teacher-directed instructional methods. Unfortunately, teachers have indicated that they do not have the skills or time to incorporate self-determination instruction into the curriculum (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712440452">Stang, Carter, Lane, &amp; Pierson, 2009</xref>). Therefore, using computer-assisted instruction (CAI) to teach the SDLMI may provide teachers an alternative method for teaching self-determination skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098300712440452">Okolo, Bahr, and Rieth (1993)</xref> defined CAI as “the use of a computer and other associated technology with the intention of improving students’ skills, knowledge, or academic performance” (p. 1). CAI can involve multiple components, including graphics, photographs, audio, text, and video (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098300712440452">Hutcherson, Langone, Ayres, &amp; Clees, 2004</xref>). One advantage of CAI as an instructional tool for students at risk for, or with, disabilities is that it can deliver instruction on specific self-determination skills (e.g., choice making, goal setting). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098300712440452">Richter and Test (2011)</xref> found that using a multimedia social stories intervention was effective for teaching students with intellectual disabilities about options for postschool life. Next, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098300712440452">Fitzgerald and Werner (1996)</xref> found that using a goal-setting interactive hypermedia program was effective for reducing problem behavior and increasing the students’ ability to use self-monitoring.</p>
<p>Although these studies demonstrated CAI as an effective method to teach self-determination skills to students, to date research involving CAI to teach students goal-setting using the SDLMI is limited to one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti, Wood, Test, &amp; Fowler, 2012</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al. (2012)</xref> found the computer-assisted SDLMI to be effective for increasing students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and decreasing disruptive behavior, limitations and recommendations for future research suggested evaluating setting or situation generalization of students’ behavior in untrained settings and identifying alternative methods for recording students’ responses during intervention.</p>
<p>Therefore, this study was a systematic replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al. (2012)</xref> and attempted to address limitations and future research needs noted in previous research. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712440452">Horner et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that single-subject research requires five criteria for a practice to be considered evidence based. One of those criteria indicated that “experimental effects are replicated across a sufficient number of studies, researchers, and participants to allow confidence in findings” (pp. 175–176). This study served as a replication of previous research, but included a different student population. In addition, this study has the potential to add to the literature and promote computer-assisted SDLMI as an emerging evidence-based practice. More specifically, this study (a) included only students at risk for ED, (b) attempted to evaluate students’ disruptive behavior in an untrained setting to determine generalization effects, and (c) used an alternative method for collecting treatment fidelity data and recording students’ responses during intervention. The purpose of this systematic replication was to examine the effects of a multimedia goal- setting intervention (MGSI) on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior with preadolescent students at risk for ED.</p>

<sec id="section2-1098300712440452">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants (pseudonyms used below) for this study included four preadolescent students at risk for ED aged 10 and 11. Prior to data collection, the researcher obtained written consent from the school’s principal, parents, and students indicating willingness to participate in the study. Participants met the following inclusion criteria: (a) were in the fourth or fifth grade, (b) participated in the general education classroom, and (c) were identified by the general education teacher as a student at risk for ED based on teacher knowledge of student behavior and the <italic>Student Risk Screening Scale</italic> (SRSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>). The researcher asked teachers to identify a minimum of four students who consistently exhibited disruptive classroom behavior. Once teachers had identified four students, they were asked to complete the SRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>) on each student. Students identified as moderate or high risk were included in the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1098300712440452">
<title>SRSS</title>
<p>The SRSS is a screening tool used to identify students at risk for ED. The instrument is a teacher rating scale with seven items (i.e., stealing, lying, cheating, sneaking, behavior problems, peer rejection, low academic achievement, negative attitude, aggressive behaviors) used to evaluate student behavioral concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>). The items are scored using a 4-point Likert-type rating scale (i.e., <italic>never</italic> = 0, <italic>occasionally</italic> = 1, <italic>sometimes</italic> = 2, <italic>frequently</italic> = 3), and scores can range from 0 to 21 with 21 indicating the highest level of risk (i.e., 0 to 3 = <italic>low risk</italic>, 4 to 8 = <italic>moderate risk</italic>, 9 to 21 = <italic>high risk</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098300712440452">Lane, Kalberg, Parks, and Carter (2008)</xref> found the SRSS has strong test–retest reliability and convergent validity.</p>

<sec id="section4-1098300712440452">
<title>Darius</title>
<p>Darius was an 11-year-old African American male who had been expelled from his previous school for disruptive and aggressive behavior. His general education teacher indicated that Darius exhibited several disruptive classroom behaviors, including excessive talking, beating on the desk, refusal to comply with teacher requests, drawing, looking around, or getting out of seat during instruction. Based on results of the SRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>), Darius was identified as high risk for ED with a score of 13.</p>

<sec id="section5-1098300712440452">
<title>Eboney</title>
<p>Eboney was a 10-year-old African American female. Eboney had been referred for special education services for behavior and academic problems, but the referral process was not complete, and she was not identified as having a disability during the study. Her general education teacher indicated Eboney exhibited several disruptive classroom behaviors, including excessive talking, playing with various items during instruction, chewing gum in class, refusal to obey teacher directions, and failure to complete class work. Based on results of the SRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>), Eboney was identified as high risk for ED with a score of 10.</p>

<title>Danilo</title>
<p>Danilo was an 11-year-old Bosnian male. His general education teacher indicated that Danilo exhibited several disruptive classroom behaviors, including excessive talking, arguing when asked to comply with teacher instructions, annoying other students when working in groups, getting out of his seat without permission, and daydreaming. Based on results of the SRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>), Danilo was identified as high risk for ED with a score of 11.</p>

<title>Jarrett</title>
<p>Jarrett was an 11-year-old African American male. Jarrett had been referred for special education services for behavior and academic problems, but the referral process was not complete, and he was not identified as having a disability during the study. His general education teacher stated Jarrett exhibited several disruptive classroom behaviors, including excessive talking and playing with items during instruction, annoying other students, disinterest in work resulting in incomplete class work, and not paying attention during instruction. Based on results of the SRSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098300712440452">Drummond, 1994</xref>), Jarrett was identified as moderate risk for ED with a score of 8.</p>

<sec id="section8-1098300712440452">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>All training and intervention sessions were conducted in a public, urban elementary school with approximately 953 students located in the southeastern United States. The school’s student population was diverse, with 64% African American, 22% Caucasian, 10% Hispanic, 2% Asian or Pacific Islander, 1% American Indian, and 1% unspecified students. The school followed a schoolwide model of positive behavioral interventions and supports. Three students (i.e., Eboney, Darius, Danilo) were in the same general education class with one general education teacher. Jarrett was in another general education class with one general education teacher. Intervention sessions were conducted with students individually in a small tutoring room located between the two general education classrooms. Located at each end of the tutoring room was a two-way window, which allowed observers to see into each classroom. All intervention sessions and data collection for the SDLMI and disruptive behavior were conducted in the tutoring room. The researcher (first author) conducted intervention sessions daily, 5 days per week during the first morning block at 7:30 a.m. The length of intervention sessions ranged from 8 min 22 s to 13 min 46 s (<italic>M</italic> = 10 min 42 s).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098300712440452">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Eight multimedia goal-setting lessons were adapted from the SDLMI and developed by the researcher. The lessons covered the three parts of the SDLMI (i.e., set a goal, make a plan, adjust your goal). The researcher’s development of the computerized intervention for the SDLMI lessons took approximately 1 to 2 hr per lesson. A laptop computer equipped with Microsoft PowerPoint<sup>©</sup> was used to present lessons and create visual and audio components of the intervention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098300712440452">Wood, Mackiewicz, Van Norman, &amp; Cooke, 2007</xref>). Participants navigated through lessons using an external mouse. In addition, cartoons were created using ToonDoo<sup>©</sup> and were downloaded using SNAGIT<sup>©</sup> (i.e., screen capture software program). Google Images<sup>©</sup> was used to retrieve stock photographs to demonstrate appropriate classroom behavior in lessons, and photographs were downloaded using SNAGIT.</p>
<p>Next, Camtasia Studio<sup>©</sup> was used to collect treatment integrity data and record students’ responses to questions embedded within each lesson. Camtasia Studio© is software that allowed the researcher to create video and audio recordings of each lesson as a student navigated through PowerPoint slides. Finally, a digital voice recorder was used for data collection. The digital voice recorder was used to record student answers to the 27-point probe (i.e., first primary dependent variable) and was used by the second observer for interrater reliability on the first primary dependent variable (i.e., students’ knowledge of the SDLMI).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1098300712440452">
<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>Data were collected on two dependent variables. The first primary dependent variable was students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process measured using a 27-point probe. Knowledge of the SDLMI process was defined as students’ ability to orally define the three basic part questions and 12 supporting questions (4 questions per part). The researcher measured students’ responses item-by-item based on students’ oral response to the questions. The total number of points on the 27-point probe were calculated and converted to a percentage. This allowed the researcher to compare students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process to the second dependent variable (i.e., participants’ disruptive behavior), using the same percentage scale when data were graphed.</p>
<p>Probes for students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process were administered following each intervention session and included five questions (one question with a possibility of 1 point, four with a possibility of 2 points, for a total of 9 points) per SDLMI part. Questions for the SDLMI probe were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712440452">Palmer and Wehmeyer (2003)</xref>. Probes were read aloud to students, and students provided answers orally. The researcher scored items using a probe checklist by circling incorrect (0 points) or correct (1 point) for the three questions that required the participant to provide a single response and rated answers for the 12 questions that required a partial or totally correct response using a 3-point Likert-type rating scale (i.e., 0 = <italic>incorrect</italic>, 1 = <italic>partially correct</italic>, 2 = <italic>correct</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1098300712440452">Figure 1</xref> provides an example of the probe checklist for SDLMI responses.</p>

<p>The second dependent variable was a measure of students’ disruptive behavior. Disruptive behavior was defined as (a) talking or conversing off-topic during teacher instruction (i.e., talking to another student during instruction, singing), (b) annoying other students (i.e., making faces, giggling, touching, making noises, tapping or hitting on desk, throwing or manipulating objects), (c) paying attention to other stimuli (i.e., playing or attending to objects in desk or other instructional items), (d) scribbling or picture drawing, (e) note writing, (f) spitting, (g) finger sucking, (h) getting out of seat without permission (i.e., leaving assigned area), (i) tipping or moving chair to bring legs off floor, and (j) calling out (i.e., not raising hand when teacher asks a question, before another student responds, or before teacher answers question; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098300712440452">Lambert, Cartledge, Heward, &amp; Lo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al., 2012</xref>). Disruptive behavior was measured using 16 s partial-interval recording. Disruptive behavior data were collected daily from the tutoring room through a two-way window from which all participants could be viewed. Students were observed during a 12-min observation period, and observations for each participant were rotated after every 16 s interval (10 s observe, 6 s record). Each participant was observed for 15 intervals during one 12-min observation period. The percentage of total intervals in which the disruptive behavior occurred was graphed.</p>
<p>In addition, setting/situation generalization data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712440452">Cooper, Heron, &amp; Heward, 2007</xref>) were collected on students’ disruptive behavior. Students were observed in a classroom different from the students’ primary general education classroom (i.e., science, music, technology). Generalization data were collected (a) once during baseline, (b) once per week during intervention, and (c) once per week during maintenance. Data collection followed the same procedures as the second dependent variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1098300712440452">
<title>Interrater Reliability</title>
<p>Interrater reliability data were collected on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI on 30% of probes distributed evenly across phases of the study. The observer listened to audio recordings of probes and used item-by-item scoring to determine reliability. An agreement was recorded if both observers identically scored the answer the same way as correct or incorrect. A disagreement was recorded if questions were not scored identically. Percentage agreement for each probe was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements multiplied by 100. Interrater reliability for the primary dependent variable ranged from 88.8% to 100.0%, with a mean of 98.1%.</p>
<p>In addition, the researcher and a second observer used the same behavior recording form to collect interrater reliability data on the second dependent variable and generalization for 30% of sessions distributed evenly across phases of the study. The researcher and second observer participated in one 1-hr training session prior to baseline data collection, during which the partial-interval recording system was used to score disruptive behavior based on mock observation periods that included an individual (i.e., third author) exhibiting various disruptive behaviors. Observers practiced recording disruptive behavior, compared data collection sheets, and discussed discrepancies until there was 100% agreement during observation periods. All interrater observation sessions (i.e., baseline, MGSI, maintenance) were independent in that the researcher and second observer stood at opposite ends of the two-way window, used a clipboard to ensure scoring could not be seen by each other, did not speak during recording, and recorded observations independently based on occurrence or nonoccurrence of disruptive behavior. Interval-by-interval comparison was used to determine agreements and disagreements. An agreement was recorded if both observers identically scored the interval as <italic>off</italic> or <italic>on</italic>. A disagreement was recorded if intervals were not scored identically. Percentage agreement was calculated by dividing the number of agreements by the number of agreements plus disagreements multiplied by 100 for a minimum of 30% of the 12-min observation periods. Interrater reliability for the second dependent variable and generalization ranged from 80.0% to 100.0%, with a mean of 96.7%.</p>

<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>This study assessed the social acceptability of intervention and outcomes based on teacher and participant perceptions. At the conclusion of the study, students’ general education teachers were given a questionnaire to assess their perceptions of the social importance of behavior change of study participants (three questions) and the social acceptability of the intervention (three questions). The questionnaire consisted of six open-ended questions. Students were given a 4-point Likert-type rating scale (i.e., 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) questionnaire to assess their perceptions of the acceptability of the intervention and the effect on behavior change.</p>

<title>In addition to collecting social validity data, social comparison data were collected</title>
<p>With social comparison, data are collected on the behavior of a normative sample and compared to the participant’s behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712440452">Cooper et al., 2007</xref>). For this study, students’ general education teachers identified the three “best behaved” students in the general education classroom, and data were collected on these students and compared to the behavior of the study participants. This helped determine whether or not change in students’ behavior was within the socially acceptable range within the general education classroom. Data were collected daily using the same partial-interval recording for students’ disruptive behavior and generalization. Range and mean of social comparison data for the “best behaved” students were graphed.</p>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>This study used a multiple probe across participants design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098300712440452">Gast, 2010</xref>) to evaluate the effects of the intervention on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process and disruptive behavior. In this design, baseline data were collected initially on all students; the student with the lowest (or highest targeted for reduction) behavior and most stable baseline data entered intervention first. Once the first student showed an increase on SDLMI probes for three consecutive sessions during intervention, another baseline data probe was administered to the remaining students to determine if their levels of performance had remained stable. The remaining two students entered the intervention phase using the same method as the first student.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<sec id="section17-1098300712440452">
<title>General procedures</title>
<p>Students participated in the intervention for approximately five 15-min sessions per week. After each intervention session, probes were conducted to evaluate students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process. Following the probe, participants returned to the classroom and the researcher collected data on students’ disruptive behavior. Generalization data were collected once per week in different classroom settings (i.e., science, music, technology).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1098300712440452">
<title>Baseline</title>
<p>Prior to beginning the MGSI, the researcher collected baseline data on all students for knowledge of the SDLMI process and disruptive behavior. Students were administered probes to determine knowledge of the SDLMI, and partial-interval recording was used to determine disruptive classroom behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1098300712440452">
<title>MGSI</title>
<p>Prior to beginning intervention, students received step-by-step instruction on how to navigate through the multimedia program. Training was conducted using a module developed by the researcher. Specifically, students were taught to use the mouse to navigate through the program and respond to visual and audio components of the intervention. First, students watched the researcher demonstrate procedures. Second, students practiced the procedures with the researcher. Finally, students practiced the procedures independently until mastery (i.e., 100% on treatment integrity checklist) was obtained.</p>
<p>The intervention followed the teacher-directed SDLMI model and was presented in three parts (i.e., set a goal, make a plan to reach the goal, adjust progress toward the goal; see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.beachcenter.org/education_and_training/self-determination/default.aspx">http://www.beachcenter.org/education_and_training/self-determination/default.aspx</ext-link> <italic>for teacher-directed SDLMI lessons</italic>). The beginning of each lesson included an introductory slide, a slide of a SmartArt<sup>©</sup> graphic that identified the three parts of the SDLMI, and a slide that identified the primary question for each part (i.e., Part 1: “What is my goal?”; Part 2: “What is my plan?”; Part 3: “What have I learned?”). A model-lead-test format was used throughout all lessons. Part 1 included the following: (a) Lesson 1, <italic>Identify Strengths and Needs</italic>, included instruction on what a goal is, class expectations, and examples of strengths and needs. At the end, participants identified two strengths and two needs and reviewed the three parts of the SDLMI and primary question; (b) Lesson 2, <italic>Expected Behavior</italic>, included instruction on what a goal is, how to compare student’s current behavior to class expectations, examples of appropriate behavior, and changing self or surroundings. At the end, participants identified two ways to change behavior; and (c) Lesson 3, <italic>Setting a Behavior Goal</italic>, included instruction of what a goal is and identifying a behavior change goal. At the end of Part 1, each student identified a self-selected behavior goal to work on in the general education classroom. Behavior goals included focus on work and complete assignments (Darius), focus on work and not be distracted by others (Eboney), not talk to others and stay in seat during instruction (Danilo), and follow teacher directions and listen when teacher is talking (Jarrett).</p>
<p>Next, Part 2 included the following: First, Lesson 4, <italic>Barriers and Solutions</italic>, included instruction of barriers and solutions and identifying barriers and solutions to meet goals. At the end, participants identified two barriers and two ways to remove the barriers. Second, Lesson 5, <italic>Identifying Supports to Achieve Goals</italic>, included instruction on sttif that could be taken for goal success (e.g., “if someone is talking to you, you can raise your hand and ask to be moved”) and tools for achieving behavior goals (e.g., cue cards, self-monitoring checklist). At the end, participants chose a tool to monitor behavior. Third, Lesson 6, <italic>Finalize the Plan</italic>, included identifying specific sttif to improve behavior, developing a timeline to meet the behavior goal, and identifying supports required for meeting the goal. At this point, each student began monitoring the self-selected behavior goal in the general education classroom.</p>
<p>Finally, Part 3 included the following: First, Lesson 7, <italic>Progress Monitoring</italic>, included instruction on progress since students began learning to self-set behavior goals (e.g., viewed behavior data during lesson), students graphed progress toward the behavior goal, reviewed the plan, and completed sttif were identified. And second, Lesson 8, <italic>Adjusting the Goal</italic>, included identifying whether the behavior goal was met, identifying changes to participant’s behavior goal, and examples of how and why changes may need to be made to goal were included. MGSI followed the same format for each SDLMI part and included a model-lead-test format.</p>
<p>Lessons for each intervention part (i.e., set a goal, make a plan, adjust your goal) were presented sequentially daily (i.e., 5 days per week), and probes were conducted at the end of each lesson. Mastery criteria for student responses to the probes were set based on number of points for each SDLMI part. Students remained in intervention for each part of the SDLMI until they scored 7 out of 9 possible points (78%) on each part for 2 consecutive days. If a student met mastery criteria prior to completion of lessons for each part of the SDLMI, instruction and probes continued until all lessons were taught.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1098300712440452">
<title>Booster sessions</title>
<p>If a student did not meet mastery criteria, booster sessions were conducted for the part of the SDLMI the student was having difficulty mastering. Two types of booster sessions were used in this study. Booster 1 was conducted using the final lesson for a specific part of the SDLMI if a student was having difficulty reaching mastery criteria. Each one of the SDLMI lessons builds on the other, in that each day there was a review of the prior day’s lesson. The final lesson for each part of the SDLMI (i.e., set a goal, make a plan, adjust your goal) reviewed what was taught during that entire part. Booster 2 included all components of Part 1 of Lesson 3 plus two additional PowerPoint slides. The first additional slide included (a) a review of the definition of <italic>goal</italic> using a model-lead-test format and (b) examples (e.g., staying in seat during instruction) and nonexamples (e.g., becoming a famous football player) of behavior goals. The second additional slide included opportunities for a student to practice distinguishing between examples and nonexamples of classroom behavior goals.</p>

<sec id="section21-1098300712440452">
<title>Response Maintenance</title>
<p>When students met mastery criteria on probes for all three SDLMI parts, the intervention was stopped and maintenance data were collected on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI process once per week for 3 weeks. In addition, students’ disruptive behavior was monitored in the classroom and generalization settings once per week.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1098300712440452">
<title>Treatment Integrity</title>
<p>To ensure intervention procedures were implemented as planned, treatment integrity data were collected for 39.7% of all lessons distributed evenly across participants. Treatment integrity ranged from 91.0% to 100.0%, with a mean of 97.5%. Item 7 on the treatment integrity checklist was, “Student navigates correctly through the program.” The reason treatment integrity was not consistently 100.0% for all sessions is the result of one student not navigating correctly through the MGSI because the student was playing with the mouse during Part 1. In addition, there were a few instances of the computer program malfunctioning.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Results for each student are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1098300712440452">Figure 2</xref>. Each graph indicates student results across baseline, MGSI, and maintenance. Data for students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior are shown as percentages. Based on visual analysis of graphed data, results indicated a functional relationship between the MGSI and students’ increased knowledge of the SDLMI and decreased disruptive behavior for all students. Based on criteria established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098300712440452">Cooper et al. (2007)</xref> for multiple-probe designs, a functional relationship was established because prediction was evident based on a stable baseline for both dependent variables (DVs) for Darius indicating that a change in DVs did not occur until MGSI was added. Next, verification of baseline prediction was established based on baseline data for the other three participants, which remained unchanged after the MGSI was implemented with Darius. Finally, replication of effect was established based on increased knowledge of the SDLMI and decreased disruptive behavior replicated across the other three participants after MGSI was introduced. Four participants maintained knowledge of the SDLMI and low levels of disruptive behavior for 3 consecutive weeks following removal of the MGSI.</p>

After Lesson 3, Jarrett did not reach mastery criteria of 7 out of 9 possible points and exhibited difficulty mastering the concept of setting a classroom behavior goal. Since Jarrett did not reach mastery or set a classroom behavior goal, a booster session (i.e., Booster 1) was conducted. After participating in Booster 1, Jarrett still did not reach mastery criteria for Part 1 of the MGSI and did not master the concept of setting a classroom behavior goal. Therefore, an additional booster session (i.e., Booster 2) was developed that included all of the components of Lesson 3 plus two additional PowerPoint slides to provide additional practice. After participating in Booster 2, Jarrett met mastery criteria of 7 out of 9 possible points for Part 1 for 2 consecutive days.</p>

<title>Setting/Situation Generalization</title>
<p>To assess setting/situation generalization, students’ disruptive behavior was observed in a classroom setting different from the participants’ primary general education classroom. Three students (i.e., Darius, Eboney, Danilo) were observed during science, two students (i.e., Eboney, Danilo) were observed during music, and one student was observed during technology (i.e., Jarrett). Because these data were not collected repeatedly across all conditions (i.e., baseline, intervention, maintenance), a functional relationship could not be determined between the MGSI and students’ disruptive behavior for setting/situation generalization. However, results indicated that two of three students’ showed lower levels of disruptive behavior in science during intervention and maintenance when compared to baseline (i.e., Darius: BSL = 67%, INT = 40%, 33% [2 observations], MAINT = 27%; Danilo: BSL = 53%, INT = 13%, 20%, 47% [3 observations], MAINT = 27%). Two students showed lower levels of disruptive behavior in music class during intervention and maintenance when compared to baseline (i.e., Eboney: BSL = 40%, INT = 20%, MAINT = 20%; Danilo: BSL = 47%, INT = 33%, 20% [2 observations], MAINT = 33%), and one student showed lower levels of disruptive behavior in technology class during intervention and maintenance when compared to baseline (i.e., Jarrett: BSL = 67%, INT = 40%, MAINT = 33%).</p>

<title>Social Validity</title>
<p>Although the general education teachers were not directly involved in implementing the MGSI, they indicated that they saw positive changes in students’ disruptive behavior in the classroom as a result of the MGSI instruction. They also felt the MGSI helped students acquire self-determination skills. Specifically, one teacher indicated she saw “substantial improvement” in one student’s self-determination skills. Jarrett’s teacher indicated that he “became aware of his off-task behavior during this time and was able to set his own goals.” Teachers felt the intervention helped students self-set behavior goals and indicated they saw improvement in all students’ disruptive behavior. Finally, teachers indicated they would be willing to use MGSI in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Students strongly agreed or agreed (a) the computer program helped them learn how to set goals for their behavior, (b) the computer program was easy to use, and (c) they liked learning how to set goals for their behavior.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of MGSI on students’ knowledge of the SDLMI and disruptive behavior with preadolescent students at risk for ED. Visual analysis of graphed data indicated a functional relationship between MGSI and students’ increased knowledge of the SDLMI and decreased levels of disruptive behavior. Three participants maintained knowledge of the SDLMI and low levels of disruptive behavior for 3 consecutive weeks, and one participant maintained knowledge of the SDLMI for 3 weeks and low levels of disruptive behavior for 1 week following removal of the intervention. In addition, all participants’ disruptive behavior improved in a different untrained setting.</p>
<p>As a systematic replication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al. (2012)</xref>, this study extends previous SDLMI literature because it is the second study to use CAI rather than teacher-directed instruction to teach the SDLMI. Because this study was replicated across a group of different participants, (i.e., preadolescent students at risk for ED), confidence is increased that the MGSI may be an effective intervention for reducing students’ disruptive classroom behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098300712440452">Horner et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, this study extends findings of Mazzotti et al. because not only were students taught the SDLMI process, but also data on disruptive classroom behavior were collected in a general education classroom and a different setting (i.e., science, music, technology classes). In addition, this study extends the findings of Mazzotti et al. in that it found Camtasia Studio© to be a more efficient and effective method for recording students’ responses during intervention because it did not require students to type their responses in Microsoft Word<sup>©</sup>.</p>
<p>Next, the results of this study provide support for goal setting and self-management of behavior. It is important to discuss specific parts of the MGSI that may have accounted for change in the students’ disruptive behavior. As mentioned previously, the MGSI lessons were adapted from the SDLMI and included three parts (i.e., set a goal, make a plan to reach the goal, adjust progress toward the goal). Goal-setting theory suggests that when an individual begins the process of setting a goal, there tends to be dissatisfaction with the current condition; therefore, there is motivation to attain the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098300712440452">Locke &amp; Latham, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098300712440452">Schunk (2003)</xref> indicated that “goals are integral components of motivation and learning” (p. 163). As students in this study discussed and set goals during Part 1, disruptive behavior began to decrease, which aligns with goal-setting theory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, goal-setting theory also suggests that moderator variables, such as feedback and self-monitoring, play a key role in behavior change. As students continued to work through the MGSI lessons, they self-monitored their behavior and eventually self-evaluated progress toward their behavior goals. Self-monitoring and self-evaluation align with goal-setting theory and provide possible explanations for the continued decrease in disruptive behavior. The study’s findings are consistent with research on goal-setting theory and the SDLMI as an effective strategy for decreasing problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098300712440452">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098300712440452">Benitez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098300712440452">Palmer &amp; Wehmeyer, 2003</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section32-1098300712440452">
<title>Limitations and Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>Although the results of this study were positive, several limitations and implications for future research should be considered. First, although this study extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098300712440452">Mazzotti et al. (2012)</xref> findings because it included a measure of setting/situation generalization, generalization data were collected only intermittently during this study, and a functional relationship could not be determined between the MGSI and students’ ability to generalize the appropriate classroom behavior to untrained settings. Future research should focus on collecting setting/situation generalization data continuously as a dependent variable across all phases (i.e., baseline, MGSI, maintenance) to be able to determine if a functional relationship exists.</p>
<p>Next, because the MGSI was not implemented in a classroom setting (i.e., small tutoring room between two general education classes), it is difficult to determine how useful and efficient this intervention may be for use in typical classroom settings. Although teachers reported the procedures were reasonable, indicating they would be willing to use the program as a supplement to their instruction, future research should include classroom teachers as implementers of the MGSI. Also, data were not collected on the accuracy of participants’ use of the intervention in the classroom. Future research should include data collection on use of the model in the classroom. Furthermore, to investigate the efficiency of the MGSI as a method for incorporating self-determination into the curriculum, future research should compare the MGSI to traditional teacher-led instruction.</p>
<p>An additional limitation is the practicality of the MGSI. Although the researcher in this study developed the MGSI using a variety of materials (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint, ToonDoo, Google Images) readily available to a classroom teacher, it took approximately 1 to 2 hr to create each lesson. This may not be feasible or practical for classroom teachers because of their limited planning time; therefore, it would be important to develop this as a web-based intervention to provide the MGSI as a ready-to-use tool that can be used to teach the SDLMI.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>There are implications for practice based on findings from this study. First, elementary and middle school general and special education teachers have identified self-determination as an important skill for students to learn, but have also indicated not having the time to incorporate self-determination into daily instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098300712440452">Stang et al., 2009</xref>). Given the results of this study, the MGSI may provide general and special education teachers with an alternative and viable method for teaching self-determination skills using the SDLMI.</p>
<p>Finally, since self-determination has been identified as a predictor of postschool success for secondary students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098300712440452">Test et al., 2009</xref>), it is important for teachers to have a method for teaching self-determination skills to students starting at a young age, so students have strong self-determination skills when they exit high school. This study sought to teach preadolescent students goal-setting skills. As general and special education teachers design instruction to teach self-determination skills to students, MGSI may be a promising intervention. Although the results of this study are promising, this is only the second study that has used CAI to teach the SDLMI to students at risk for, or with, disabilities. Therefore, research is still needed to strengthen its evidence.</p>
