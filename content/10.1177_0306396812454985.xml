<abstract>
<p>The phenomenon of radicals and leftwing political activists recanting earlier allegiances to shift in a rightwards direction has often been commented upon, with explanations that veer from identifying a convergence between extreme-left and extreme-right positions; to wider social and economic changes; to psychological factors intrinsic to each particular individual. One of the most startling examples of such a change in political orientation – and made not once, but on numerous occasions – is that of Eldridge Cleaver, the former Black Panther party leader. What lay behind the startling transitions in Cleaver’s story is here discussed with reference to a psychohistorical framework that can help explain the broader phenomenon of Left-Right political conversion.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, the name of Black Panther firebrand Eldridge Cleaver was synonymous with political radicalism and armed resistance to racism, capitalism and the American state. But, in the 1970s, all this dramatically changed, as Cleaver’s ideology underwent an extraordinary transformation: he re-emerged as a born-again Christian, a Reaganite and an advocate of Blacks’ integration into the political-economic system. His was billed in some quarters as the ‘conversion story of the century’. One bewildered observer had watched Jane Fonda evolve from movie star, to anti-war activist, to aerobics instructor, seen Bob Dylan’s adoption of religion and accepted a former Hollywood actor as an American president. But these were no match for the breathtaking spectacle of witnessing Cleaver, the gun-toting revolutionary, evolve into an advocate of social peace and a believer in the American dream.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396812454985">1</xref></sup> Among his erstwhile friends and allies, reactions to his metamorphosis varied between disbelief and fury.</p>
<p>Isaac Deutscher has observed that, ever since the Russian Narodnik Lev Tikhomirov published <italic>Why I Ceased to Be a Revolutionary</italic> in the late nineteenth century, ‘in every generation, in every decade, the weary and disillusioned, as they withdrew from the fray or changed sides tried to answer this question’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306396812454985">2</xref></sup> Cleaver, too, has attempted to answer this question and, by drawing extensively on his private papers, we get a clearer picture of what happened to this enigmatic but troubled figure than is often presented in existing biographical work and other secondary literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306396812454985">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article challenges common interpretations of Left-Right conversions. The most common, largely structural explanation for such <italic>volte-face</italic> (including Cleaver’s) is that the individuals in question turn away from their radical politics out of despair following political defeat; in this case, defeat of the Black Panthers, in particular, and the end of the 1960s movements in general. An additional explanation plays down the revolution in thinking by the likes of Cleaver, suggesting that people of his ilk were always flawed radicals who displayed considerable consistencies throughout the various phases of their lives – continuities overlooked by the headline-grabbing symbolism of their shifts.</p>
<p>My interpretation of events is quite different. I argue that Cleaver’s behaviour is better understood less in structural terms, in the sense of a changing political landscape to which radicals were forced to adapt, than as a product of a personality and psychology whose most prominent feature was an almost never-ending quest for meaning and identity that rendered him unable to stay committed to any cause. While it is true that Cleaver was a flawed radical, there is no denying the fundamental about-change in his worldview.</p>
<p>The question, as posed by Deutscher above, is an important one:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306396812454985">4</xref></sup> if those who stand for radical political ideals are inevitably bound to renounce these views and become captured by the system they once abhorred, there would seem little hope for radicalism. Understanding the process that Cleaver went through a little better can help us gauge whether or not this is the case, as well as contributing to wider debates about political conversion.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306396812454985">
<title>From ‘Soul on Ice’ to ‘Soul for Hire’?</title>
<p>Eldridge Cleaver is best known as minister of information for the Black Panther party from 1967–1971 and as one of the organisation’s leading members, after founders Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton. Cleaver fought for the emancipation of Black Americans. But he also rejected the capitalist system that he saw as underpinning their oppression, for the Panthers stood for the complete reconstruction of society – socially, politically and economically – along international socialist lines. Even prior to joining the Panthers, Cleaver had made a case for the overthrow of the political-economic system. For the movement for Black freedom, anything less would be mere window-dressing. The Marxist Cleaver thus viewed all society’s ailments as stemming ultimately from political-economic sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306396812454985">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>While many of his Panther colleagues were fixated on the gun, Cleaver wielded the pen with panache. Radicalised during a stint in prison, he became the Panthers’ most charismatic leading member after tasting freedom again in 1966. When his jail writings were compiled in <italic>Soul on Ice</italic>, which sold over 2 million copies, he shot to fame. As number three in the party, his brief was to put his literary gifts to the development of the Panthers’ newspaper and to organise the production of various pamphlets and leaflets for political education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306396812454985">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of Cleaver’s own political education, jail, as has been the case for many revolutionaries, was a university of sorts. Before joining the Panthers in December 1966, he had spent over twelve years in correctional facilities for offences including drug possession, vandalism and assault. From delinquency, Cleaver turned to radical politics, inspired by the writings of Rousseau, Mill, Paine, Voltaire and Marx. He displayed some of the influences of these thinkers when, as part of a creative writing class he undertook in Soledad prison in 1966, he was asked to imagine the world in AD 2000 as if it were fully integrated. The society he foresaw was one in which the capitalist class had been vanquished, Europeans sent back to whence they came, Blacks returned willingly to their homeland in Africa, Native Americans once again controlled their destiny, and Asians ruled their territories unhindered by colonisers. Moreover, this was a world undivided between ‘First’ and ‘Third’ spheres, a world in which every person could access the means of production and all peoples had their views heard by a world government unwilling to interfere with the prerogative of its citizens to travel when and wherever they liked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306396812454985">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Incarceration for Cleaver was also a time during which he experimented with religions after earlier resisting his mother’s attempts to instil faith into him. But, as is discussed below, these were partly pragmatic ventures and, in the case of his dalliance with Islam, his motivations were largely political and economic in keeping with the nature of the work of Black Muslims at the time. In fact, in his later prison writings, he was moving increasingly towards outright atheism. He thus posed the question of how the Johnson administration might react if a majority of Americans and the world’s peoples elected to follow ‘Godless Communism’; would it be prepared to increase the draft and dispatch troops to the street corners of every city in every country around the world and ‘to kill every human being in sight’? He also chided Black Muslims for their obliviousness to the growing tendency among African Americans to eschew all gods. Cleaver noted how Blacks on the plantations futilely prayed for freedom, but only received it after the Civil war, with God ‘nowhere in sight’. Their salvation came from the hard work and dedication of people who fought repression on Earth – waiting for God was ‘pie in the sky’. He even made the incendiary statement that, if God had the audacity to show his face on Earth, He would probably be crucified for His indifference to so much Black exploitation over a period covering almost half a millennium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306396812454985">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historical patterns of inequalities and the exercise of imperial power by the US were thus central concerns for the radical Cleaver. Indeed, he suggested that the Americans, along with the British and the French, had been responsible through their conquests for killing ‘tens of thousands’ of times the number of Jews for whose liquidation the Germans were held to account after the second world war. What America had done abroad it replicated at home, where the persecution of Blacks was so advanced that the accusation of ‘murder’ was invariably levelled only if the victim’s skin happened to be white. Cleaver castigated ‘the real Mr. America’, a society in which social Darwinism and a vicious dog-eat-dog economic system went hand in hand with a political system composed of Machiavellian political parties and a ‘winner takes all’ justice system in which outcomes were determined more often by an advocate’s social connections than by the truth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306396812454985">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>But Cleaver underwent some striking changes to abandon his atheism, overturn his radical political leanings and retract his searing indictments of the American nation. In the mid-1970s, in a move containing obvious parallels with the conversion of Saul to St Paul on the road to Damascus, Cleaver became a ‘Reborn Christian Crusader’. From believing that society’s fault lines were almost entirely political economic, he came to the view that the spiritual realm took pride of place. This was a far cry from his swashbuckling Panther days, when, by his own reckoning, anybody who canvassed the subject of God with him probably would have been shot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306396812454985">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cleaver’s reconfiguring of his whole philosophy to become an admirer of free enterprise and representative democracy was not something from which he shied away. In 1977, a little over a decade after joining the Panthers, he told the 600-strong congregation of the Full Gospel Business Men’s Fellowship that, for him, ‘the epitome of evil was [once] the avaricious businessman. Well, I’ll leave that alone now.’ In explicit, born-again language, Cleaver announced that the ‘person I was has been laid to rest’. In fact, the conservative label with which he was now being tagged genuinely pleased him; at the same time, he was considerably embarrassed about the things he once held sacred. A one-time ardent believer in the necessity of political conflict, this mellower version of Cleaver called upon radicals and conservatives in the US to see in each other not foes, but fellow Americans and children of God. Meanwhile, he was heartened in relation to America’s capacity to change without revolution by the downfall of Richard Nixon. The same man who detested the US political system as a vile cancer on the planet and its people was now to describe America as ‘the freest and most democratic’ country in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306396812454985">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some notable shifts in his thinking occurred in relation to state institutions. The Eldridge who, in 1968, wished that the police be consigned to the ‘garbage can of history’ would, by the 1980s, accept their indispensability to any modern society. In fact, Cleaver had once argued that Blacks should stop killing each other and turn their weapons on the police instead. As well as supporting Republican Ronald Reagan and pushing for a stronger US military, Cleaver even backed the draft. He also said something that he thought he never would: that the US needed a CIA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306396812454985">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it was perhaps his altered attitude to the Republicans that most stood out. As a Panther, Cleaver had been contemptuous of the GOP, laying the blame squarely at its feet for the savage police attacks on protesters at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. By Cleaver’s reading of events, Republican politicians conspired to sabotage the Democrats’ chances of winning that year’s presidential election by wrecking the party’s convention and smearing Democrats with the associated disorder. Cleaver commenced teaching a course in 1968 at the University of California, Berkeley, to the horror of then-governor Ronald Reagan, who feared that his students might be roused by his oratory to go home and slaughter their parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306396812454985">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, when Cleaver returned to the campus in 1982, he came to heap praise on his former nemesis, whom he now regarded as a ‘brother’. The Reagan that Cleaver campaigned for was the same Californian governor towards whom he had previously developed a manic hatred; the identical man he obsessed about and had even made plans to kill. Cleaver had once challenged the politician to a duel. Now, in the early 1980s, he voiced his approval of Reagan’s budget cuts, which might bring some temporary hardship, but would have the longer-term benefit of passing responsibility for social services to the private sector, in the process reducing government spending and generating long-term prosperity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306396812454985">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Much of this was not welcome news at Berkeley, where, in 1982, radicals disrupted a speech of Cleaver’s sponsored by a branch of Rev Sun Myung Moon’s Unification church. In fact, on this occasion, half of the 220 people present were reported to have hissed and booed the convert. One woman, apparently from the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, brandished a sign with the words: ‘Eldridge Cleaver – world record breaking belly crawler.’ Another listener, who regarded the late Malcolm X as more alive than the former minister of information, hurled a pair of shoes and then spilled a cup of water over him, after which Cleaver struck his assailant with a left jab that left him bleeding from the mouth. According to some reports, police were called on to intervene in the fracas – ironic, given Cleaver’s historic enmity towards the forces of law and order.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306396812454985">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sense that Cleaver had performed an unpardonable act of betrayal was not, however, confined to Berkeley. Cleaver’s 1960s close friend and comrade Stew Albert proposed that a jury of his peers try Cleaver for political treason. His former editor at <italic>Ramparts</italic> magazine, Warren Hinckle, disowned his ex-colleague and claimed that almost everyone on the Left had done likewise: ‘They think he’s sold out, gone wacko … The favourite word is “opportunist”.’ At a talk Cleaver gave in 1982, one person from the floor cuttingly suggested that a more appropriate title for his 1978 book, <italic>Soul on Fire</italic>, might be ‘Soul for Hire’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306396812454985">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>But the most vitriol directed at Cleaver was naturally expressed by the Black Panther party, which accused him of conspiring with the FBI to cause ructions within the organisation. It also held him responsible for the murder of Bobby Hutton on the night of the 1968 shootout with police in Oakland. There was no evidence that Cleaver was an FBI agent. Yet his stunning reincarnation might have left his former Panthers so incredulous as to go searching, however far and wide, for explanations. Unsurprisingly, Cleaver himself denied the charge of FBI involvement, but he conceded that what he had done looked to many people like a ‘flip-flop’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306396812454985">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Explanations and themes</title>

<title>An ‘experience of defeat’?</title>
<p>On 6 April 1968, Eldridge Cleaver was involved in a gunfight with police in Oakland, California.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306396812454985">18</xref></sup> At the end of the siege, during which approximately 1,000 shots rang out, three police were injured and fellow Panther Bobby Hutton lay dead. A wounded Cleaver was escorted to prison as a parole violator and later released on a writ of <italic>habeas corpus</italic>, although he was subsequently indicted by a grand jury for charges including assaults with the intent to murder three police officers. Pleading not guilty, he was released on bail. Governor Reagan then led a drive to appeal (successfully) against his release, prompting Cleaver to flee the country to avoid a return to jail. After absconding, he headed for Canada, before moving on to Cuba, only to leave later on bad terms with the Castro regime. He proceeded to Algeria, where he stayed for four years, during which time he helped establish the Panthers’ International Section. It was under its auspices that Cleaver travelled to a range of countries, journeys that would come to play a pivotal role in his political reassessments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306396812454985">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>His departure from American shores represented a turning point, for it was the beginning of a new phase in his life, dominated by the embrace of a host of new causes and ventures. During his seven years in hiding, Cleaver travelled not only to Cuba and Algeria, but also to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland, China, North Korea and North Vietnam. As an explanation for his conversion during this time, he suggested that ‘travel broadens’: his experience abroad taught him that the US had the best the world could offer and that the American dream was ‘dream enough for me’. His overseas sojourn provoked a clash between his individualist instincts and those police states whose regimes were totally anathema to freedom. But it was not just the tyranny of these societies that convinced him of America’s superiority. After inquiring further into the philosophies of Marxism and Leninism, he discovered deep-seated flaws distinct from any faults in their implementation. This was a jolting experience that led him to re-examine the politics to which he had been committed for some years as a Panther and a Marxist. Now, he concluded, revolution was ‘out, we can’t afford that’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306396812454985">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cleaver’s attacks on the despots governing these systems and their flimsy justifications with reference to ‘transient’ phases of dictatorship, after which the state would gradually dissolve, undoubtedly had a familiar ring to them. Deutscher noted some common elements in the testimonies of former communists, who often began by breaking with the party over the bureaucratic corruption of Soviet socialism, but went on to jettison communism entirely. They then set themselves no less than the task of protecting humanity from it. Along similar lines, in his book <italic>The Experience of Defeat</italic>, the Marxist historian Christopher Hill wrote of the English revolution’s defeat in 1660 and its demoralising impact on radicals, many of whom, their spirits broken after the overturning of the fleeting republic, subsequently surrendered to the restored monarchy and abandoned their old beliefs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306396812454985">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Already, Cleaver had endured an ‘experience of defeat’ in the sense of the heavy state repression meted out to the Panthers, which contributed to the effective demise of their organisation. By the early 1970s, the goal of revolution and the abolition of racism – some important reforms notwithstanding – seemed a long way off. But, arguably, Cleaver suffered an even bigger defeat when he saw with his own eyes the Marxism and communism he had espoused steeped in dictatorship, making a mockery of all the things in which he believed. Again, this was a phenomenon common to many disillusioned revolutionaries, going back at least as far as the terror and bloodletting into which the French revolution eventually degenerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0306396812454985">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this sense, Cleaver’s experience was far from unique. The ex-1960s radical Ronald Radosh had also visited Cuba and been appalled by what had greeted him in the form of bogus trade unions, poor working conditions and the degrading treatment of mental health patients. Other former radicals of the same era, Peter Collier and David Horowitz, had similarly been disillusioned by Castro and his regime’s foreign policy machinations in relation to Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. What started out as a promising Third World revolution that unseated a US-backed tyrant had ended in what they judged to be another tinpot dictatorship. The same theme of defeat is repeated in the writings of Tariq Ali, who applies Christopher Hill’s approach to the numerous 1960s radicals who quit revolutionary politics and shifted markedly to the Right after the end of the anti-Vietnam war movement and capitalism’s stabilisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Despite important outcomes from the 1960s movements, including recognition of the legal rights of Blacks, women and gays, the goal of revolutionary change did not materialise: the 1970s ushered in a more conservative political climate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0306396812454985">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The pall of defeat is cast wide over the bigger story of the Panthers, many of whose leading members eventually charted paths a long way from radical politics. Apart from Cleaver, Panther founder Bobby Seale, while still involved in community organising into the twenty-first century, went on to publish his own cookbooks in the 1980s, including <italic>Bar-b-que’n with Bobby</italic>. He also acted as a promoter of the multinational Unilever-owned Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream. Meanwhile, fellow Panther founder Huey P. Newton’s well-known crack cocaine addiction finally got the better of him: he was shot dead in 1989 on his home turf in West Oakland by a drug dealer. The party’s former propaganda minister and organiser of the 1968 Olympics Black Power protests, Harry Edwards, in his later guise as a conservative sociology professor, advocated a clean sweep of the streets of Los Angeles to rid them of criminal Black youth, who, in his opinion, ought to be put behind bars for lengthy spells. Fellow Panther Tony Bryant hijacked a plane to Cuba in 1969, with the intention of swapping the plane for military hardware to be used by the Panthers in the US, only to be jailed by Castro for almost twelve years. He, too, resurfaced as a repentant radical and a rightwing anti-Castro activist based in Miami.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0306396812454985">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Problems and divisions inside the Panthers left Cleaver disillusioned and led him to question the ability of social and political movements to achieve liberation at all. A project that commenced with such promise in 1966 ended in unedifying squabbles, one of which was the public spat between Newton and Cleaver that concluded with their complete severing of all ties. State repression, including persistent harassment by the FBI, was an important contributor to this and, more broadly, was part of the story of defeat that helps explain why Cleaver ended up where he did.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0306396812454985">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>While providing important insights into the waning radicalism of individuals such as Cleaver, the structural explanation has serious weaknesses. For instance, the ‘experience of defeat’ explanation also raises a question as to how 1960s radicals such as Tariq Ali, Chris Harman and Alain Badiou weathered the darker times of the 1980s, 1990s and the first decade of the twenty-first century without losing their anti-capitalist politics. Christopher Hill himself remained an unrepentant radical, despite writing about defeat and living through the political doldrums. Not all radicals throw in the towel, even when all hope appears lost. Put simply, individuals do have the capacity to resist the rightward tide and do not automatically succumb in overwhelming situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0306396812454985">
<title>A flawed radical?</title>
<p>Perhaps one way of explaining why Cleaver, but not other radicals, turned out the way he did is by reference to his flawed radicalism, for it may be that Cleaver’s politics were somehow more amenable than others’ to a rightward shift. Perhaps, across his various phases, there were also significant continuities, obscured by a focus on the visible ruptures in his project. In terms of another renegade, Benito Mussolini, Doriot Pels thought him best viewed from the perspective of the close ideological proximity between socialism and his later fascism. Related to this is Kimball’s dismissal of Cleaver as a serial devotee of ‘fanaticism’ (see below). The positing of a U-shaped political spectrum – where the far Right and far Left eventually cohabit – is often flawed, however, devoid as it frequently is of important historical and ideological analyses of communism <italic>vis-à-vis</italic> fascism. This framework would be less applicable in this case because of the fact that Cleaver never embraced fascism. Moreover, to assert little distance between his different stances would be to ignore the empirically observable breaks he engineered (and which he acknowledged profusely) as well as the outrage and dismay these shifts provoked among his former colleagues and supporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0306396812454985">26</xref></sup> The idea that he did change fundamentally seems, for these reasons, untenable.</p>
<p>One does not, however, have to accept the U-shaped political spectrum thesis to agree that Cleaver’s actions and beliefs as a radical may have prefigured his later politics or that he demonstrated continuities between his various phases. Cleaver was a radical whose flaws, it could be argued, did make it easier for him to both accept the failure of communism as well as accommodate conservatism. One such flaw was his Maoism. In one sentence in <italic>Soul on Ice</italic>, Cleaver paid homage to Mao by professing his desire to become a ‘Mao Mao’ seven times consecutively. His attraction to Maoism was shared by the Panther leadership, which sought to apply aspects of the Chinese ruler’s politics to their own battles. Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale sold Mao’s <italic>Little Red Book</italic> to students from outside the gates of Berkeley, advocating that free speech activists such as Mario Savio take a leaf out of the Red Guards’ book. In the process, the Panther leaders, like some other Maoist radicals in the 1960s, betrayed a one-sided understanding of the Chinese revolution, which, as a peasant-based nationalist insurrection, can be seen in contradistinction to the classical Marxist tradition of proletarian internationalism. As late as 1971, Panther leaders such as Newton were praising the achievements of Mao’s China, where apparently the key necessities of life were abundantly available to all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0306396812454985">27</xref></sup> The Panther leaders also ignored the role played in the cultural revolution of 1966–1976 by the Red Guards, many of whom were bitter enemies of the free speech for which the Berkeley activists were valiantly campaigning.</p>
<p>Relative to the more conservative Black leaders such as Martin Luther King, the Panthers offered a radical and anti-capitalist alternative that appreciated the limits both of Black nationalism and the scope for peaceful change within existing political-economic parameters. Their appearance on the scene in 1966 was thus a lightning rod for both the Black community and the Left. But the attraction to Maoism among Panther leaders was consistent with their, at times, top-down methods, and the militarism and violence associated with Maoism appealed to elements in the Panther leadership, including Cleaver. Initially, at least, Newton was a fervent supporter of Mao’s famous adage that political power emanates from the barrels of firearms. Cleaver himself recalled having learned in the Panthers the transformative power of a single bullet. The emphasis on self-defence through arming themselves stemmed from the perceived need to mount a rearguard action against the violence visited upon Blacks by police – Seale and Newton’s original motivation behind establishing the party. But attempting to combat state violence through such means would always run up against certain limits when confronted with the armed might and centralised organisation of the American state. These limitations were reflected in the distribution of casualties between Panthers and police, heavily skewed in the latter’s favour. Moreover, it was the defeat of such a strategy that provided the political impetus for many radicals, including Cleaver, to look further afield.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0306396812454985">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, though, like many other Maoists, Cleaver was disillusioned when the truth emerged about the real nature of Mao’s China. There were demoralising consequences for Maoist radicals everywhere arising from the machinations there and in Pol Pot’s Cambodia (backed by China), as well as from the eventual war between China and Vietnam over Cambodia. Maoist radicals chastened by these events often shed not only their commitment to Maoism, but also their opposition to capitalism at large. For Cleaver, the nauseating sight of Chairman Mao pressing the flesh with Richard Nixon in 1972 was too much to stomach. Thus, his illusions about Mao led to disillusionment when the latter behaved like the compromised ruler of any other capitalist state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0306396812454985">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Cleaver could only have been disillusioned by his experience in Cuba and the Soviet Union if he had nourished illusions about their socialist qualities in the first instance. He believed initially that the Cuban state under Castro would lend assistance to the struggle for Black power, only to be rudely disabused of this notion once he arrived there. Furthermore, what is odd is the way in which Cleaver had, at first, been greatly impressed with what he observed in Cuba, the Soviet Union and North Korea – the praises of whose ruler Kim Il-sung (the godfather of one of his children) Cleaver had sung loudly – before he cottoned on to their democratic deficits and turned against them. From a rose-tinted perspective, he would flip over to an equally lopsided denunciation of Cuba as an ‘Alcatraz with sugar cane’. Here, Cleaver showed some similarities with cold war renegades, whose lack of critical judgement initially in relation to the Soviet Union left them vulnerable to ‘the god that failed’, after which, as Hobsbawm notes, they simplistically turned what they once considered God into Satan. He admitted that when he set foot on Cuban shores, there were ‘stars in my eyes’, only to see it ultimately as one giant penitentiary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0306396812454985">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cleaver therefore had a tendency to grasp something totally, uncritically and one-sidedly, with little appreciation for nuance and complexity, before moving on to something else. Arguably, he took to Christianity and Republicanism with a similar zeal. Thus, his response to reading Marx and Lenin in jail was akin to: ‘This is it, this is what I’ve been looking for.’ He wanted to emulate the revolutionary dedication of Che Guevara, so: ‘When I looked out, I saw a lot of throats that needed to be slit.’ But, in general, his socialist politics were only vaguely articulated. Despite his undeniable talents as a prose stylist, the core tenets of his ideology were never systematically developed in writing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0306396812454985">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Cleaver’s radical politics helped prise him away from his radicalism, there was also a sense in some quarters that he was always an opportunistic and untrustworthy radical whose loss to the Left could be deemed good riddance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0306396812454985">32</xref></sup> It is certainly true that the radical Eldridge Cleaver was often thuggish, puerile and misogynistic. Cleaver had helped call a ‘Pre-erection Day’ celebration, in which he advocated ‘pussy power’ and alliances with people in the mould of the infamous prohibition-era criminal ‘Machine Gun’ Kelly. He also threatened to assassinate the children of San Francisco’s Democratic mayor, Joseph Alioto, and was alleged to have participated in the torture of another Black Panther member, who consequently required psychiatric treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0306396812454985">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nor was Cleaver’s misogyny any secret. Prior to joining the Panthers in 1966, he was a self-confessed – though contrite – rapist, who excused the crime as a revolutionary act against white women in retribution for centuries of racism. While in prison, he had toyed with various titles for a manuscript, including: ‘Confessions of a rapist’, ‘Journal of a rapist’ and ‘The footprints of the rapist’. The manuscript proceeded to describe a drug dealer who calmly and meticulously executes a rape using a gun and rope to subdue his victim and her partner at a motel, before adding insult to injury by dispossessing them of their valuables. Similar themes occupied Cleaver elsewhere in his prison writings. In an outline for the manuscript that would become <italic>Soul On Ice</italic>, entitled, ‘White woman, black man’, Cleaver wrote that the ‘excruciating and almost universal lust and craving of the American black man for white women corresponds to the sick aversion they have for black women’. Cleaver had even undergone sessions with a prison psychiatrist as a result of a nervous breakdown he suffered in part over his fascination with white women, as he agonised over the guilt he felt about his attraction to them. Some of this encroaches upon the territory of Cleaver’s psychology, which I discuss in more depth below.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0306396812454985">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>But, for now, it is important to recognise Cleaver’s misogyny as a key feature of his radicalism and which was not confined to his pre-Panther criminality. He beat his wife and Panther communications secretary Kathleen Neal, whom he was said to have kept in virtual captivity. Despite claiming to have mended his ways after he became a father, the so-called Christlam church he founded in his post-conversion days espoused deeply sexist ideas. Furthermore, in the early 1980s, Cleaver made statements to the journalist Warren Hinckle indicating his firm belief in corporal punishment for wives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0306396812454985">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was consistency between his different phases, too, in relation to homosexuality, which disgusted him as a radical. Later, as a Conservative and born-again Christian, he issued a statement welcoming into his home the assassin of gay San Francisco politician Harvey Milk. A strong part of his motivation for the design, while in France, of his infamous codpiece pants was the desire to counteract the apparently homosexual fashion designers’ obsession with trousers built to accentuate a man’s buttocks. This was despite suggestions that Cleaver himself had experienced homosexual desires, as well as sexual relations with men in and out of prison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0306396812454985">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cleaver was undoubtedly a flawed radical, who showed some significant consistencies between his different phases. But these flaws are connectable to only some of his later affiliations. Moreover, there were numerous other 1960s radicals who shared the flaws of Maoism and also entertained illusions about Soviet Russia, without following Cleaver into Christianity and conservatism. The unavoidable fact is that radicals in the same movement, sharing very similar politics, often went in completely different directions; some remained trenchant critics of the system, while others settled their differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0306396812454985">
<title>A ‘renegade mentality’?</title>
<p>The question is, therefore, raised as to whether there was something peculiar about Cleaver, unrelated to the political context or to any flaws he may have had as a radical. Aspects of Cleaver’s personality and psychology have already been partly alluded to, and it is to this potential explanation for his peculiar pattern of conversions that we now turn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0306396812454985">37</xref></sup> Concerning Benito Mussolini, Kirkpatrick wrote about how the ‘mentality of a renegade’ possessed <italic>Il Duce</italic>. Megaro also had Mussolini in mind when he pointed to the ‘vainglory, ambition, and intellectual and emotional instability’ that all too often produced ‘the most perfect types of renegades’. This was an insight on which Megaro, alas, did not elaborate. But there is a substantial literature dealing with the impact of psychology on a person’s political behaviour. Attempts to apply this psychohistorical method have included biographical work on key historical figures, including former US president Richard Nixon, whose administration’s brutal actions in Indochina have been partly linked to his mental instability. The method can purportedly help explain seemingly irrational actions on the part of individuals. Perhaps, therefore, Cleaver’s seeming irrationality in condemning today what he insisted on yesterday can be explained by a ‘renegade mentality’. According to Marvin X, Cleaver’s former assistant and the man who introduced him to Newton and Seale in 1966, Cleaver possessed a ‘mercurial personality’ to which all benefactors ultimately fell victim because they were unable to steer him in any direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0306396812454985">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such a view is lent credence by his apparently endless list of affinities. Fellow 1960s radical Jonah Raskin has understandably dismissed Cleaver as a ‘chameleon’ who adopted whatever stance accorded with the changing times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0306396812454985">39</xref></sup> Yet, Cleaver was not that simple, for the extraordinary – and sometimes bizarre – range of enterprises with which he was associated cannot be put down merely to a changing political landscape. Nor can his embrace of Christianity be reduced to a cynical attempt to extract sympathy from the courts in light of the trial awaiting him upon his return to the US in 1975 for his part in the Oakland shootout.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0306396812454985">40</xref></sup> Rather, his being born again (not for the first time, as we shall see) marked the beginning of the spawning of numerous new Cleavers, which, taken together, suggest a deep yearning for meaning and identity embedded in his psychology and which transcended politics or religion.</p>
<p>It was this constant renewal that provoked Kimball to write off Cleaver as a ‘serial extremist’, whose only enduring feature was ‘fanaticism’, noting that he was a born-again Christian, a follower of the Rev Sun Myung Moon, a Mormon, a crack cocaine addict, a designer of pants with codpieces, which Cleaver believed could potentially eradicate indecent exposure as a crime and, not to mention, a Republican. The only running theme in Cleaver’s politics, according to Kimball, was ‘buffoonery’, putting him in league with Mussolini as well as the Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0306396812454985">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although right to draw attention to the eccentricities of Cleaver’s post-Panther life, Kimball did not exhaust the list, which also included selling phallic-shaped ceramic pottery, the creation of a revivalist movement called Eldridge Cleaver Crusades, an attempt to fuse Christianity and Islam into a new church (Christlam), establishing a recycling business, as well as arrests over drug possession and burglary in the late 1980s and early 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0306396812454985">42</xref></sup> In the early 1980s, Cleaver also started to take his horoscopes seriously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0306396812454985">43</xref></sup> Perhaps the strangest of Cleaver’s ideas to elude Kimball was his plot to annex Treasure Island off the coast of San Francisco, so that ‘Captain Cleaver’ could reap its hidden booty. But, more to the point, Kimball’s denunciations of Cleaver as a consistent exponent of ‘fanaticism’ need to be treated critically, for, as Toscano argues, the latter’s destructive, dangerous and negative connotations have all too often been taken for granted when, in fact, fanaticism has been an important, if not indispensable, ingredient of systemic social change. The problem was not so much that Cleaver was a fanatic, but that he so easily and so often discarded his fanaticism for one cause only to replace it with fanaticism for some, very different – and often conflicting – cause, in turn raising questions about his sincerity in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0306396812454985">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just how different was the latest new cause became apparent to the psychedelic drug proponent Timothy Leary, a jail-mate of Cleaver’s at the San Diego federal prison, following the latter’s return from exile. To Leary’s surprise, Cleaver was then in the business of advocating space migration. In fact, Cleaver would later rejoin the former Harvard professor in 1977 at a benefit gig for those who were interested in unlocking the key to immortality and who were willing to preserve human bodies until such time as a key was discovered. The degree to which Cleaver shared this hope for another chance at life, and how such ambitions fitted with his growing piety, remains unclear, but the fact of his participation in this venture suggests some sympathies for it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0306396812454985">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>To this already lengthy compilation of causes and movements in which Cleaver invested over the course of his life, we can add several others. For instance, he was also, prior to his political radicalisation, a Catholic, although he says he became so initially for pragmatic reasons: in a California youth facility at the time, he wished to mix with the Blacks and Mexicans rather than the white Protestants, so he chose the religion on this basis. As we already know, he had been a Muslim while in jail, before jumping ship to follow Malcolm X after disagreements in the Nation of Islam. Prior to becoming a Panther, he also gave serious thought to Judaism, which he situated in the context of going down ‘all the blind alleys … I’ve really tried to find some answers and some solutions.’ Speaking in the late 1970s, Cleaver saw his coming to Christianity as his return ‘back home’, a final resting place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0306396812454985">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>But this was not to be. In fact, the final cause to which Cleaver dedicated himself was nothing less than the future of the planet. We get a strong sense of déjà vu when we read the recollections of Cleaver’s then girlfriend, who remembered that he ‘couldn’t stop talking about it. It was like he had a new purpose, a new direction.’ In some of his final reflections before his death in 1998, he admitted to being perpetually on the hunt for the truth. This led him into various sects and cults, which in turn prompted them, against Cleaver’s wishes, to claim him as one of their own.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0306396812454985">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are parallels here with Arthur Koestler, the Hungarian-born novelist and communist turned ex-communist and contributor to <italic>The God that Failed</italic>. Koestler was lured by a catalogue of causes, movements, cults and cures, including Zionism, Freudianism, eugenics and Lamarckism. He also fell under the influence of Gandhi’s spiritual heir Sri Vinoba Bhave, willingly subjected himself to experiments involving hallucinogens with Timothy Leary and became a believer in extra-sensory perception, to one of whose practitioners, the ‘spoon-bender’ Uri Geller, Koestler lent his enthusiastic support. Like Cleaver, he was also sexually obsessed and deeply misogynistic, not to mention a tormented individual who made numerous attempts on his own life, before finally succeeding in 1983.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0306396812454985">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with Koestler, so Cleaver believed that being reborn was integral to life itself. But the latter went further in asserting that western civilisation in the 1970s was in the midst of a completely new process of ‘re-birth and growth and creativity. In many cases, we often confuse birth pains with death throes. I’m just aware that this is a positive phenomenon that I’m part of.’ He viewed his evolution as the culmination of a long process of learning and searching. Whereas, at the end of this process, he had some semblance of an answer, others were either clueless or simply continued to sit on the fence of life. He estimates that this process commenced when he was 12 years of age, after which he experimented with the full spectrum of philosophies, religions, countries and people: ‘It has been an experience. It has been a search. It’s been an odyssey. It’s been a pilgrimage.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0306396812454985">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Again, there are some striking similarities with Koestler in the sense of his actual enjoyment of the process of rebirth. As Cleaver lamented, ‘I just wish I could be born again every day’. It is worth noting that the sense of finality in these comments, made in the mid-1970s, is misleading, since they preceded Cleaver’s Republicanism and his environmentalism, among other endeavours. Moreover, the sense of renewal had been an enduring theme with him since at least 1965, when he had written in the third person of his arrival at prison as a different Eldridge Cleaver, a man who no longer existed and who was a foreigner to his replacement. This should come as no surprise, Cleaver suggested, for, if a person ‘has been undergoing all kinds of extreme, involved, and unregulated changes, then he ends up not knowing who he is’. But, as we already know, this was not the last occasion on which one Cleaver submitted to another. There was another rebirth just a few years later; on the night of Bobby Hutton’s death in 1968, a different Eldridge Cleaver had met with mortality. In what may have been an unintendedly prescient observation, Cleaver confided in a letter in 1965 to his lawyer Beverly Axelrod, whom he at one point had plans to marry, that he had dreams of becoming a writer. But his problem was that, ‘I can’t stick to a point’. Perhaps this was Cleaver’s more fundamental weakness in politics, in particular, and life, in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0306396812454985">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was perhaps not alone in this among the 1960s radicals burnt out at the end of that tumultuous decade. Jerry Rubin, who had been close to Cleaver at one time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0306396812454985">51</xref></sup> also displayed a seemingly unquenchable thirst for new movements and causes in the 1970s and 1980s. More relevant to the psychohistorical explanation, Rubin also had psychologically driven motivations for his actions and statements. By his own admission, he was addicted to fame and needed ‘attention from the outside, a platform, recognition as an outlet for my energy’. He sought to become famous in order to obtain ‘from the outside what I felt I lacked on the inside’. Rubin’s transition from anti-capitalist radical to self-publicising Yuppie businessman cannot be seen in isolation from his psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0306396812454985">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cleaver stands out, however, as a particularly damaged figure. According to his one-time assistant, Cleaver was obsessed with the male sex organ throughout his whole life – a predilection that repeatedly got him into trouble. He also claims that Cleaver suffered from sexual addiction, as well as an addictive personality more generally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0306396812454985">53</xref></sup> Cleaver’s reported participation in torture, his confession to using rape as a political weapon and his wife-battering indicate a psychologically wounded person, to say the least. As a boy, as well as being ritually beaten by his father, he had the scarring experience of witnessing his father physically abusing his mother, which led the young Cleaver to harbour desires of killing his father. But there were also possibly deep-seated resentments towards his frequently absent mother, which, it has been speculated, may have been a source of the misogyny bedevilling him his whole life.</p>
<p>So disturbed was Cleaver in the 1970s that he was on the verge of suicide. On the night he was about to end it all, while he was living alone on the Mediterranean coast in France in 1975, he had a spiritual experience while staring into the moon. The images of his former radical heroes – Castro, Mao, Marx and Engels – paraded in front of him, before each disappeared in a puff of smoke. Replacing these evaporated idols was an image of Jesus, propelling Cleaver down the path of Christianity and simultaneously saving his life. This raises doubts about what contribution the tyrannical nature of the regimes in the countries he visited made to his split with Marxism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0306396812454985">54</xref></sup> and whether Cleaver was, at the time of this revelation, under the influence of narcotics is not known. But, according to his ex-wife Kathleen, speaking at the time of Cleaver’s death, Eldridge returned to the US, despite his newfound faith, ‘a very unhealthy person, unhealthy mentally, and I don’t think he’s ever quite recovered’. Before setting foot again on US territory, he admitted, his ‘inner restlessness and spiritual emptiness were to reach awful proportions’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0306396812454985">55</xref></sup> This pathos was to haunt Cleaver on and off for the remainder of his life before he succumbed, in 1998, possibly to an affliction related to his cocaine addiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0306396812454985">56</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has discussed Eldridge Cleaver’s startling transformation from a 1960s radical Black Panther leader into a born-again Christian and conservative supporter of the Republicans. That such a transformation took place has never been in doubt; Cleaver has always been frank about being born again. Why and how it happened have been less clear.</p>
<p>By delving into Cleaver’s private papers, we get a clearer sense of the pattern of events. The most common explanation for the conversion of the likes of Cleaver has been that such post-1960s changes were the product of defeat; in Cleaver’s case, the defeat of the Panthers, in particular, and of 1960s revolutionary hopes, in general. Moreover, Cleaver was always a flawed radical, and many of his faults, such as his misogyny, he carried over into his conservative phase.</p>
<p>But there are serious problems with such explanations. His psychology is a highly visible part of his story that helps explain why other defeated and flawed radicals did not follow Cleaver’s path. Other activists, too, had flawed politics as radicals without ending up as Reaganites or born-again Christians. Cleaver’s journey away from radicalism was the product of a personality and psychology that drove him constantly in search of identity and meaning, leaving him unable to remain committed to any one cause. He was not alone in this: numerous other radicals later showed the propensity to dart from one cause or movement to another. This psychohistorical framework can therefore help explain the broader phenomenon of the Left-Right political conversion. Cleaver’s story can partly be understood as the product of historical developments, changes in social and political environments and ideas he held as a radical, but it was his idiosyncratic personality and psychology that saw him adapt to the world in his own very peculiar way.</p>

For example, he describes Cleaver as a ‘convicted rapist’ (p. 21) and, while Cleaver was indeed a serial offender in this regard (see below), he was never convicted of this crime.</citation>
