Septa and recesses were temporarily observed. Some variations in shape were observed; however, only the oval shape persisted. Maxillary sinus hypoplasia was not found, although asymmetry was present in 30% of cases. The ostium was located at the anterior third of the ethmoid infundibulum; its final dimensions were 1.96 mm in length and 0.44 mm in width. The mean length between the ostium to the lamina papyracea and nasolacrimal duct was 1 mm. One case of double maxillary sinus was observed.

<body>
<p>Prenatal development of the maxillary sinus has been researched for more than a century.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599811435883">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435883">2</xref></sup> However, most of the studies were conducted before the advent of modern surgical approaches of the paranasal sinuses. Currently, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a procedure widely performed in adults and children with chronic rhinosinusitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599811435883">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599811435883">4</xref></sup> The surgeon performing this procedure requires an intimate understanding of the normal anatomy and the series of anatomical variants. However, a first and essential step is to achieve the knowledge of the key events in paranasal sinus morphogenesis. This study was undertaken to review the prenatal development of the maxillary sinus with respect to important landmarks, to explain its morphogenesis, and to expand anatomy knowledge for the surgeon who deals with paranasal sinuses, especially in children.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>One hundred human fetuses obtained from the Fetal Collection located at the Department of Embryology, School of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, Mexico, were studied. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León and University Hospital Dr José Eleuterio González. Conceptuses were products of spontaneous abortion, selected with normal external features from the 9th to the 37th week of morphological age and distributed in 6 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599811435883"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). To determine their morphological age, crown-rump length in millimeters was measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599811435883">5</xref></sup> The fetal heads were separated from the bodies and decalcified in 1% nitric acid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599811435883">6</xref></sup> Fetuses from the 9th to the 11th week were cut on the frontal plane at serial sections of 7 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. These sections were examined under light microscopy in search of the initial development of the maxillary sinus. The frozen heads of the fetuses from the 12th to the 37th week were cut in the midsagittal plane and then in the transverse plane at serial sections of 2 mm from the crista galli to the palate. Pieces were observed with a stereomicroscope (Zeiss) equipped with 10× ocular micrometer calibrated by the use of a stage micrometer.</p>

<p>On each side of the cut heads, the maxillary sinus was located, and the following dimensions were recorded in millimeters: the anterior-posterior and mediolateral lengths of the maxillary sinus (APL-MS and MLL-MS) and the anterior-posterior and mediolateral lengths of the maxillary ostium (APL-Os and MLL-Os). In addition, the length between the maxillary ostium and the lamina papyracea (LOs-LP) and between the maxillary ostium and the nasolacrimal duct (LOs-NLD) were measured. Furthermore, ossification of the walls defined as the presence of trabecular bone immediately adjacent to the sinus mucosa, maxillary sinus shape, presence of septa, or recesses and accessory ostia to the maxillary sinus were studied. Because the cuts were in the transverse plane, it was not possible to make a direct measurement of the height of the maxillary sinus, so it was estimated by observing the relationship between the floor of the sinus and the attachment of the inferior turbinate. Variance and simple linear regression analyses were applied to the measurements, and the Pearson correlation coefficient was used to determine sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>To detect possible cases of maxillary sinus hypoplasia (MSH), the maxillary sinus area (MSA) was calculated by multiplying APL-MS by MLL-MS at each individual sinus. Then, in each age group, the mean and standard deviation (SD) were determined. Sinuses with more than −2 SD from the group mean were considered as hypoplastic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811435883">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, an adaptation of the Bolger method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref></sup> was performed: in each fetus, the right and left MSA was compared; in cases where growth was observed asymmetric, the smaller area was divided by the larger, obtaining an area estimate ratio for each fetus. Area estimate ratios ranging from 1.00 to 0.51 were considered normal, and those smaller than 0.50 were considered hypoplastic. All measurements were made by 1 person and repeated twice.</p>

<title>Maxillary sinus anlage</title>
<p>In 9-week-old fetuses, the maxillary sinus was absent. At the 10th week, the mucosa located at the deeper and anterior end of the ethmoid infundibulum, lateral to the primary uncinate process, presented some invaginations toward the surrounding mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). At the 11th week, the fusion of those invaginations originates a single cavity, which represents the maxillary sinus primordium.</p>

<title>Growth, shape, variation</title>
<p>A progressive growth of the APL-MS was observed throughout all ages. At the end of fetal development, the mean was 4.36 mm (SD, 1.09; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811435883"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Two periods of rapid growth were observed, from the 17th to the 20th week and from the 25th to the 28th week; thus, the growth curve acquired a sigmoid aspect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). During the first half of development, the growth of MLL-MS was limited. From the 20th week to the end, this was slightly greater; however, in comparing with APL-MS, it was poor, with a mean of 1.13 mm (SD, 0.28) at the 37th week.</p>

<p>The primordial shape of the maxillary sinus was established since its first stages of development, which would be an oval cavity with smooth walls. From the 12th week, it was possible to observe it as a 3-dimensional structure with a lateral wall, limited by the incipient lamina papyracea; a floor formed by the maxillary bone; a medial wall, in close relation with the attachment of the inferior turbinate; and a roof, in which the ostium was located.</p>
<p>Between the 17th and 28th week, the shape of the maxillary sinus presented some variations as a consequence of the expansion toward the caudal and dorsal directions. However, by the 37th week, only the original oval shape was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). The presence of septa and recesses within the maxillary sinus were observed in 42 fetuses from the 16th to 28th week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>); from the 29th week, these were not observed.</p>

<title>Ossification</title>
<p>The first evidence of ossification was observed at the level of the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus in 16th-week fetuses; by the 20th week, ossification was spread to the anterior wall, between the maxillary sinus and nasolacrimal duct, and by the 21st week to the posterior wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).

<title>Ostium</title>
<p>In all fetuses, the ostium was located on the anterior third of the floor of the ethmoid infundibulum between the uncinate process and the lamina papyracea, being the distinctive feature of the maxillary sinus roof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). Throughout all ages, the APL-Os and the MLL-Os showed a minimal increase, and by the 37th week, the mean was 1.96 mm and 0.44 mm, respectively. In both the LOs-LP and the LOs-NLD, the mean was close to 1 mm throughout all ages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811435883"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Maxillary sinus anlage</title>
<p>The maxillary sinus began its development at the 10th week as some invaginations of the mucosa from the primitive ethmoid infundibulum. This location is not different from the early reports and corroborates the great relation that both structures maintain during fetal life; in fact, at this stage, the maxillary sinus is an extension of the infundibulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). A poorly developed infundibular passage is associated with MSH,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811435883">9</xref></sup> evidencing the importance of considering the maxillary sinus and the ethmoid infundibulum as an anatomic and development unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599811435883">
<title>Growth, shape, and variation</title>
<p>Growth of the maxillary sinus was progressive in length, width, and height; however, the APL-MS was the greatest diameter, representing the axis from which the development was adjusted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). This result is consistent with the fact that during the fetal period, the shape of the cranium primarily elongates because the anteroposterior dimensions increase at a greater rate than the mediolateral or superoinferior dimensions do.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811435883">10</xref></sup> Moreover, it is known that the directional growth pattern of the upper face exhibited a downward and forward growth away from the anterior cranial base.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599811435883">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the 17th to the 20th week, and from the 25th to the 28th week, the APL-MS has an accelerated growth, alternating with periods of slow growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). This behavior has been reported by another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599811435883">12</xref></sup> and coincides with the transient presence of septa, recesses, and various shapes in the maxillary sinus. Interestingly, during childhood, the maxillary sinus also has 2 periods of rapid growth: one between birth and the 3rd year and the other between the 7th and the 12th year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435883">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435883">14</xref></sup> Such findings illustrate how the maxillary sinus, being a small cavity that is part of a whole, is directly affected by the morphogenetic processes of the face and skull, even during childhood.</p>
<p>In 37-week-old fetuses, the mean of the APL-MS was 4.36 mm, which contrasts with the 7 mm reported by other authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435883">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599811435883">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599811435883"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599811435883">17</xref></sup> This discrepancy could be due to ethnic differences between the study populations. Most of the available anatomic studies have been conducted on white populations, whereas our material comes from Hispanics. The existence of ethnic differences in facial anthropometry is a topic widely studied and described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599811435883">7</xref></sup> There is some evidence that Hispanic crania tend to be smaller and more gracile than that of other groups. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599811435883">18</xref></sup>Considering these findings, it is possible that the current anthropometric criteria for the maxillary sinus are not suitable for all ethnic groups, so that the surgeon performing FESS should not dismiss the ethnic group of the patient.</p>
<p>The growth in width was poor because the orbit limited its lateral expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>), to the 37th week, the mean of the MLL-MS was only 1.13 mm. In childhood, with the increase in MLL-MS, the floor of the orbit will become the roof of the maxillary sinus. A consequence of a poor development in width and the predominance in anterior-posterior diameter was the persistence of the oval shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0194599811435883">
<title>Maxillary sinus floor</title>
<p>The level of floor was determined by the growth of its cephalocaudal diameter. Although this parameter was not directly measured, it was possible to establish a pattern of growth through the relation of the floor with the attachment of the inferior turbinate. The floor descended in a constant pattern until it was situated below this point since the 21st week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). This tendency will continue in childhood; between the 9th and the 12th years, the floor of the maxillary sinus is usually level with the floor of the nose and after the descent continues as permanent teeth begin their eruption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599811435883">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599811435883">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Asymmetry</title>
<p>Asymmetry between the maxillary sinuses has attracted the attention of clinicians since radiological studies became available. The reduction in the volume of the maxillary sinus is known as maxillary sinus hypoplasia. Although its origin is unknown, failure of prenatal development has been a major theory; another theory is a poor pneumatization caused by a sinus infection or sinus trauma in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811435883">9</xref></sup> This study would provide an excellent opportunity to determine the existence of MSH since prenatal life. However, we are faced with the challenge of establishing diagnostic criteria for MSH in fetuses because there is no precedent. In adults, most of the authors consider the relationship between the maxillary sinus and neighboring structures as due to the pneumatization of the zygomatic and alveolar process,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599811435883">19</xref></sup> the maximum orbital diameter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599811435883">20</xref></sup> or based on the volume-estimate ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref></sup> In the present study, such structures cannot be used as a landmarks because they are absent or developing, so we have chosen to compare one side with its opposite, as well as to apply a normal distribution model. In adapting the Bolger method, 70% of fetuses had a symmetric MSA or a difference of less than 50% between both sides, while 30% had a hypoplastic sinus (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599811435883"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). Such frequency is too high when compared with the 10.4% reported by Bolger et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref></sup> for adult patients with sinusitis. This method has the advantage of comparing one side with its opposite but does not consider the behavior within a particular age group. On the other hand, no fetus had MSA less than the mean −2 SD. With these results, it is not possible to confirm the presence of hypoplasia in prenatal life. However, it is possible to sustain that in 30% of the fetuses, there was great variability in size from one side to the other. We note the limitations of a cross-sectional study in which prenatal development is only the initial stage of a process that continues until early adulthood; therefore, it would be feasible that the hypoplastic sinuses grow further to reach a normal size. In addition, MSH can be associated with abnormalities of the ethmoid infundibulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599811435883">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599811435883">9</xref></sup> This aspect was not considered in the present work; a study would be necessary in which the morphology and morphometry of the infundibulum should be included. From the 12th to 28th week, 5 fetuses with MSA greater than the mean +2 SD were observed. This happened in the period with greatest growth in length and more variability in shape of the maxillary sinus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>); therefore, it may also correspond to fetuses with advanced development for their age group because in the final weeks, such cases were not present. Unfortunately, studies that include similar measurements in children were not found; however, it is possible that the tendency toward asymmetry persists for at least the first 3 years of life, which correspond to the first period of rapid growth of the maxillary sinus.</p>

<sec id="section15-0194599811435883">
<title>Ossification</title>
<p>The walls of the maxillary sinus presented a progressive and ordered ossification, beginning in the lateral wall and afterward in the anterior and posterior walls; however, ossification of the medial wall was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). This fact correlates with the presence of fontanelles in postnatal life as they appear in areas in which no bone exists and the mucosa of the maxillary sinus and the middle meatus are separated only by fibrous tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435883">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811435883">21</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0194599811435883">
<title>Maxillary sinus ostium</title>
<p>The shape of the ostium was elliptical throughout the entire prenatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>). The final dimensions were 1.96 mm in length and 0.44 mm in width, which represent a slimmer shape upon comparison with the adult ostium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435883">2</xref></sup> In all fetuses, the location of the ostium was at the anterior third of the ethmoid infundibulum, which differs from the adult, in whom the ostium location is referred to as being between the middle and posterior third.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599811435883">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599811435883">22</xref></sup>Although Van Alyea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599811435883">23</xref></sup> reported 9 of 163 adults with ostium in the anterior third, this is a less frequent location. As mentioned, the fetal craniofacial growth is forward and downward, and since the ostium cannot migrate by itself, it is possible that during childhood and adolescence, forward expansion of the infundibulum puts the ostium progressively in a more posterior position. This finding has practical implications for the surgeon as the position of the ostium in young children may be more anterior and inaccessible. In fact, a missed ostium has been reported as a common finding in revision surgery in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599811435883">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The mean distance between the ostium and the nasolacrimal duct has been reported as 9 mm for the adult population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599811435883">25</xref></sup> In the present study, the LOs-LP and LOs-NLD had mean values close to 1 mm throughout the entire prenatal period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599811435883"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). One might expect a greater proximity between these structures during childhood, with values from 1 mm for newborns to reach 9 mm; therefore, when performing the antrostomy and uncinectomy, the margin of error could be lower in children.</p>
<p>No fetus showed accessory ostium; however, 2 holes were observed at the ethmoid infundibulum in a 24-week-old fetus, with almost identical dimensions, each representing the opening of separate cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0194599811435883"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>). These findings are consistent with a case of double maxillary sinus; however, the exact incidence is unknown, and such a variant has been reported in adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599811435883">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599811435883">23</xref></sup> In the present study, the frequency is 1%; if this remains into adulthood, one would expect more cases reported, either as an incidental finding or associated with disease. However, duplication of the maxillary sinus is a rarity. One possible explanation is that during childhood, there is a fusion of both cavities, resulting in a single cavity with 1 ostium. This finding may be an alert to a greater possibility observing 2 ostia during the endoscopic approach in children and especially in younger children.</p>
<p>No difference between the dimensions of the maxillary sinus among male and female fetuses was found, which is in accordance with the fact that sexual dimorphism in human cranial shape becomes clearly visible by the time of puberty and adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599811435883">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, important aspects of the maxillary sinus anatomy are established since prenatal life; their study helps us to understand its development in a conceptual mode and not as a static photograph. This knowledge could help the surgeon be better prepared to face the multiple possibilities that can appear during the endoscopic approaches to the paranasal sinus, especially in children.</p>
