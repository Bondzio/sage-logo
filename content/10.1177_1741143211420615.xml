<abstract>
<p>The higher education sector has increasingly begun to pay more attention to academic leadership. This qualitative study explores how such an investment in a 20-week leadership development program influenced the behaviour of 10 academic staff in the role of program coordinator 6 to 12 months following participation in the program. Otherwise known as program directors or department chairs, academic staff in this role are responsible for coordinating and leading degree courses or programs. Leadership learning and changes in the behaviour of program coordinators was evident, particularly in regard to building influence, communicating more effectively and managing upwards. Improved confidence in their ability to perform the role was a lasting outcome and the use of peer learning and coaching was an important part of the success of the intervention. However, workload factors, succession planning and orientation were seen to be factors that impact on leadership development in this role. The findings suggest that participation in well designed academic leadership programs can result in a lasting transfer of training for program coordinators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The higher education sector has increasingly begun to pay more attention to academic leadership in response to globalization and expansion efforts, calls for accountability, increases in student heterogeneity, an ageing academic workforce and increasing use of technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420615">Bisbee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420615">Scott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>). In many countries, universities also face ongoing pressure to ensure high quality teaching and learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420615">Scott et al., 2008</xref>). Leadership, as a result, has become a critical component of academic administrative positions in higher education over the past decade, which previously focused more on management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143211420615">Bush, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>For universities to respond to the challenges they face, leadership is needed at all levels within the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143211420615">Hotho et al., 2008</xref>). This requires the leadership of learning to shift towards more collective or distributive approaches that reflect the collegial working culture of higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143211420615">McRoy and Gibbs, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>One group of university staff who have a significant role to play in leading high quality teaching and learning outcomes is the program coordinator (PC). In Australia, this position can also be known as course coordinator, program director or department chair and designates academics responsible for a degree course or program. Unfortunately, these individuals often get left out of formal institutional leadership development (LD) initiatives because their role, on the organizational chart, is usually viewed as something between a general academic staff position and head of school/department.</p>
<p>PCs often find themselves in these positions as a result of being competent and qualified senior academics who, by virtue of their accomplishments, advance as developers of university courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1741143211420615">Yielder and Codling, 2004</xref>). Yet, in the creation of these academic leaders, the system has tended to rely upon ‘learning on the job’ in relation to learning and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143211420615">Southwell et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, PCs often find that they are not prepared for the demands of this academic leadership role, particularly with the pressures facing contemporary higher education, even though teaching and learning quality is often measured at the course or degree level. The PCs, therefore, are like ‘king pins’, as they are central to teaching and learning quality equation, and thus there is a need for them to become involved in LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143211420615">Ladyshewsky and Jones, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The challenge for the PCs is that, in addition to having academic credibility they must lead and manage the course team without having any line management authority. Hence, they must build their influence through collegiality and informal relationships. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420615">Hellawell and Hancock (2001</xref>) note that the most collegial relationships in universities occur at the program team level. This emphasis on collegiality, in part, may stem from the often temporary nature of the PC role, which is performed for a period and then relinquished to another course team member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143211420615">Rowley and Sherman, 2003</xref>). With the dynamic of these working relationships at the course level, it is therefore of no surprise that leadership for the PC is a complex and challenging process, as noted below:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It is somewhat obvious why leadership is a problem here. The person who is responsible for providing leadership is not necessarily willing to be a leader, and knows that leadership must be highly collegial or it will be very difficult to return to a faculty. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143211420615">Rowley and Sherman, 2003</xref>:1059)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Leadership for the PC is problematic, therefore, as it does not fit more traditional notions of leadership roles and their implied hierarchy. In spite of a lack of formal authority, and often a reluctance to direct their academic ‘peers’, the PC must still execute leadership to ensure high quality course outcomes. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420615">Gibbs (2006</xref>), if department leaders facilitate a good teaching environment then instructors are more likely to use a student-focused approach, which in turn results in far superior student outcomes due to a deep approach to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420615">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; Prosser and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143211420615">Ramsden et al., 2007</xref>; Trigwell, 1997). It makes sense, therefore, that PCs receive opportunities to develop their leadership capabilities so that they can achieve high quality learning and teaching outcomes within their course in the context of this pressured and changing environment.</p>
<p>Given the complex nature of their leadership role within the university, transformational and transactional leadership capabilities are important for the PC to possess. Transformational leadership is about being inspiring, visionary, and paying close attention to team members’ potential whereas transactional leadership invests in more control oriented systems to gain compliance and to ensure that the team meets its performance targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143211420615">Bass et al., 2003</xref>). In practice, both are needed for effective academic leadership in the PC role. To enhance the leadership of the PC, therefore, programs are needed that support them in this process.</p>
<sec id="section2-1741143211420615">
<title>Theoretical Basis of Leadership Development Programs</title>
<p>There are many recommendations in the literature on how to structure and deliver leadership development programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420615">Preiss and Molina-Ray (2007</xref>), for example, describe a LD framework that focuses on participative management, coaching and employee engagement. Their approach involves providing experience-based learning opportunities to discover how democracy, positive feedback and communication influence leadership. Programs should also provide opportunities for feedback, discussion and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143211420615">Bolden et al., 2008</xref>), information on the person’s leadership capabilities using a leadership competency framework, and a 360-degree review process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420615">Vilkinas and Cartan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420615">2006</xref>), with opportunities for coaching and reflective practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143211420615">Kerka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420615">Ladyshewsky and Varey, 2005</xref>). A 360-degree review is a common LD tool that collects feedback (usually via an anonymous online survey) on the participant’s performance from their colleagues. The participant’s peers, line manager and staff reporting to them provide feedback on the participant’s leadership, hence the 360-degree nature of the survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143211420615">Toegel and Conger, 2003</xref>). Ideally, the program should also be built upon experiential learning principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420615">Kolb, 1984</xref>) and be situated in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420615">Boud, 1999</xref>). In addition, academic LD initiatives should be contextualized to higher education and the local culture of the university in which they are delivered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143211420615">Flavell et al., 2008</xref>) Even differences within disciplines need to be taken into consideration in developing LD initiatives in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420615">Blackmore, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These requirements indicate that LD requires more than mere training. What is required is the opportunity to learn through experience in a supportive culture that allows for growth and change. Furthermore, in his review of academic leadership, Gaither (2004) asserts that experience and observation are critical for learning about leadership. He views LD as a continuous learning experience requiring ample opportunities to practice with ‘the right to fail’ as part of the development process. In the area of academic leadership, emotional intelligence and team building capability are crucial given the shift in higher education from a work culture attuned to individuals to one of cooperation and collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420615">Boud, 1999</xref>). Significantly, in an Australian context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143211420615">Scott et al. (2008</xref>) recommend practice based learning as a LD strategy, finding that PCs expressed a preference for learning on the job, involvement in informal mentoring and coaching, self-guided reading on leadership, and participation in educational leadership seminars that are tailored to their needs. Information on leadership styles and skills, as measured through objective 360-degree review systems, were also preferred.</p>

<sec id="section3-1741143211420615">
<title>Transfer of Training</title>
<p>Despite the careful planning, design and delivery of LD programs, as noted above, the question still exists as to how an institution is able to measure whether the investment of effort produces a return that is of benefit to the institution as well as to the individual. Even with high percentage agreement on LD program evaluations, how does one measure transfer of training to the workplace given the wide range of organizational and individual factors at play? In the field concerned with theorizing and quantifying the value of training and development, transfer of training is a concept used to explore how well individuals transfer learning from development programs to the workplace in a lasting manner.</p>
<p>While evaluations often provide an indication of a program’s quality, they do not usually investigate how well the learning outcomes have been translated to the work context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143211420615">Baldwin and Ford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420615">Cromwell and Kolb, 2004</xref>) as the evaluation is usually done during and at the end of the initiative. If a LD investment is going to be considered successful the learning must be generalized to the work context and maintained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420615">Broad and Newstrom, 1992</xref>). More complex evaluation methods must, therefore, occur many months later. According to the literature, many programs fail to produce lasting practical changes in faculty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420615">Al-Musawi, 2008</xref>). Other research, however, suggests that well designed programs are more likely to have long-term positive results. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143211420615">Chibucos and Green (1989</xref>) report on an evaluation of the American Council on Education Fellows Program, an initiative to train college and university administrators. They found, over the long term, that individuals developed a greater understanding of the complexity of institutional administration as a result of their involvement in their program.</p>
<p>To support transfer of training, so that it is embedded in practice, a range of strategies can be put in to place. One of these is to incorporate social learning support strategies that engage learners with program content over time, in applied ways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420615">Cromwell and Kolb (2004</xref>), for example, found that peer support reinforced the trainee’s use of, and engagement with, program materials while learning on the job. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143211420615">Toegel and Conger (2003</xref>) found that those who demonstrated the most professional growth were those who had positive attitudes about the process and engaged a mentor or coach to support them in the development process. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143211420615">Olivero (1997</xref>) reports on a public sector training program, which was followed by coaching. They found that 8 weeks of coaching increased productivity by 88 per cent whereas training alone only produced benefits of 22 per cent.</p>
<p>Other methods believed to increase the transfer of training involve ‘constructive alignment’ in which program learning outcomes are aligned with assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420615">Biggs, 2003</xref>). Action learning projects, which are embedded in an organization’s daily activities and build upon the concepts covered in academic LD programs, are tools that have been applied successfully to engage academic program directors to transfer learning into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>). Rewards have also been identified as significant incentives in business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>) and although often seen to be insufficient in the higher education sector, they influence to some extent how academics direct their efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420615">Rubeck and Witzke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420615">Webb and Murphy, 1997</xref>). Awarding advanced study credits for completed action learning projects, or including these as outcomes worthy of promotion, may be rewards that are enticing to some academics.</p>
<p>Other incentives that may promote academics to participate in LD programs involve time release from duties or reductions in workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420615">Webb and Murphy, 1997</xref>). Workload issues and time pressures are common work environment factors that influence outcomes and participation in professional development initiatives in the higher education sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143211420615">Trowbridge and Bates, 2008</xref>). The result is that learning cannot be transferred to the workplace because productivity pressures overtake the time needed for reflection and thought in considering how learning from a leadership program may be applied to practice.</p>

<title>Research Aims</title>
<p>Given the arguments presented above in relation to the leadership development needs of the PC, and issues related to transfer of training, the main aim of this research was to explore the transfer of training (Baldwin and Ford, 1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420615">Cromwell and Kolb, 2004</xref>) experience in PCs 6 to 12 months following an academic LD program. A second aim was to explore factors that supported or hindered academic leadership development following delivery of the program. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420615">Kirkpatrick (1996</xref>) described four levels of evaluation of training, which include people’s reaction or feelings towards the program, the learning that they received, the behavioural changes as a result of the training program and the results that are produced. This research focuses predominately on the second and third levels of this model. Namely, what was learnt and how this influenced behavioural change 6 to 12 months following the LD program. Changes in program results, the fourth level of evaluation, were beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section6-1741143211420615">
<title>Research Paradigm</title>
<p>This study adopted a qualitative research method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420615">Creswell, 2003</xref>) as consistent with the aims of the research. Qualitative research uses a naturalistic approach to investigation that seeks to understand phenomena in context-specific settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143211420615">Hoepfl, 1997</xref>), in this case, the PCs and their LD experiences within the context of their work environment 6 to 12 months after completion. With respect to data collection in qualitative research, the investigator does not attempt to manipulate the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143211420615">Patton, 2002</xref>) but rather seeks to understand and interpret it. Nevertheless, the investigator is always a part of the study’s final construction. This is markedly different from quantitative researchers who seek causal determination, prediction and generalization of findings from the data through their statistical manipulations. Qualitative researchers seek instead, illumination, understanding, and extrapolation or transferability to similar situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143211420615">Hoepfl, 1997</xref>). As a result, small sample sizes are utilized in qualitative research because of the large amounts of textual data that are generated during interview processes, the main form of data collection. These small sample sizes are acceptable given that the interpretation and extraction of meaning of the data is the focus, rather than generalizability—by the researcher—to a population.</p>
<p>This qualitative research, as all research, emanates from a philosophical perspective. The perspective for this research is constructivist. Constructivism, as the name suggests, takes a relativist perspective as it sees knowledge as being produced (or constructed) by the individual as it is contingent upon human understanding based on people’s interactions with the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420615">Berger and Luckmann, 1966</xref>). Hence, trying to understand what may be real is relative as the objective and subjective are intrinsically linked. Because of this, the researcher becomes part of the construction of this knowledge as he cannot separate himself completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143211420615">Porta and Keating, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From an epistemological perspective, this study is interpretive and assumes that not all people experience their ‘reality’ in the same manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143211420615">Neuman, 1997</xref>). It is the job of the investigator to interpret and discover meaning in the shared and individual experiences of participants. However, in building theory, one cannot entirely discount what is actually known in the scientific literature. Hence, in interpreting the experiences of participants, what is known may also influence the building of a theory or explanation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1741143211420615">Whiteley (2004</xref>) calls this a grounded research approach. She argues that this approach makes sense, particularly in the business setting, where a substantive and credible body of empirical research can be found. It would be unreasonable to ignore previous research in the formulation of new research. Grounded research, therefore, takes on board advances in knowledge that apply to the context that is under investigation.</p>
<p>In light of this constructivist and interpretive perspective, this study is conducive to a qualitative methodology and therefore employed questioning formats that are consistent with symbolic interactionism. Symbolic interactionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143211420615">Blumer, 1969</xref>) explores the meaning that people attribute to their experiences. The focus of this perspective is that individuals respond towards events in their life based on the meaning these events have for them personally. Hence, the meanings that they create are developed from social interaction and then modified through their own world view and interpretative systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143211420615">Blumer 1969</xref>).</p>

<title>The Leadership Development Program</title>
<p>The participants in this study took part in a 10-module academic leadership program designed for the PCs. This program was put in place to promote, ‘… the enhancement of faculty members’ educational knowledge and skill so that they can make educational contributions that advance the educational program rather than only teaching within it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143211420615">Rubeck and Witzke, 1998</xref>: 32). Each session was delivered face-to-face on a fortnightly basis for 2 hours on campus with accompanying online resources. The use of blended learning strategies (face-to-face instruction with online resources and tools) has been shown to positively influence participants’ attitudes towards learning in professional development programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143211420615">Green and Cifuentes, 2008</xref>). Full details on the development of the course, needs assessment, evaluation and resources can be found online (http://academicleadership.curtin.edu.au/course_coordinator/). Level one evaluation of the LD program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420615">Kirkpatrick, 1996</xref>) reported percentage agreement for overall satisfaction for each module, across the 2 years of the program, of at least 90 per cent.

<p>Informed by the current research, the program incorporated many of the LD frameworks and concepts described in the literature earlier. It was highly collegial, was situated in the context of higher education, included peer coaching and had a 360-degree review process, which was aligned with a well established leadership framework entitled ‘the integrated competing values framework’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143211420615">Quinn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420615">Vilkinas and Cartan, 2006</xref>). The LD program was also contextualized to the PC role in the current environment, with learning scenarios being developed from common challenges and issues confronting the PC. This was critical, to ensure that academics engage with the educational development program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>). Overall, the program’s theory of action was centred around experiential learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420615">Kolb, 1984</xref>). The focus on actual experience, with opportunities for reflection in the seminars and with peer coaching partners, helped to build conclusions which participants could take back and apply in the work setting.</p>
<p>Teaching productivity rewards were provided on completion for participating in the program (which could translate into a grant to be used to further develop their scholarship of teaching). Participants were also encouraged to use the outcomes delivered by the LD program in discussions regarding their performance and promotion. Support by senior management and running the seminars in a prestigious venue also enhanced the significance of the program.</p>
<p>The program dealt with three domains of learning: personal leadership development, conceptual understanding, and skill development. Personal leadership development focused on intrapersonal skills such as emotional intelligence, reflective practice and individualized learning plans. Conceptual understanding focused on learning about key leadership theories and pedagogical concepts in curriculum design and delivery. Skill development focused on specific interpersonal leadership skills such as communication, team building, conflict management, managing upwards and program management skills like program review and evaluation. The program was facilitated by internal specialists in leadership and curriculum design and delivery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143211420615">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>At the time of this research, the LD program had been running for 2 years. The two iterations of the program that the PCs participated in were considered pilots as the program was still undergoing refinement. Participants in this research were drawn purposefully from both pilot cohorts. Hence, some individuals, at the time of this research, had completed their program anywhere from 6 months to 1 year earlier. Ethics approval for this study was received from the university’s ethics committee.</p>
<p>Initially, a familiarization study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1741143211420615">Whiteley and Whiteley, 2005</xref>) was undertaken with three PCs who had participated in the program. They were asked a series of questions relating to their LD program and their experiences. The purpose of this familiarization study was to assist the researchers in framing the questions and testing them with participants within the work setting. Following this familiarization, interview questions were reframed and a larger sample of 10 PCs, who completed the LD program, was approached to participate in this qualitative research. The 10 participants were selected randomly and selection was based on their availability to be interviewed. There were six female and four male PCs with ages ranging from 34 to 56 and a mean age of 47.5. Years of experience as a PC ranged from 1 to 20 with a mean of 6.2. Of the sample, two PCs had 10 and 20 years of experience in the role respectively. The other eight PCs had far less experience ranging from 1 to 7 years. There were seven PCs from health science programs, two from humanities programs and one from engineering and science.</p>
<p>The semi-structured interviews were conducted by two academics with PhD qualifications aligned to the LD program. The primary investigator who facilitated the LD program did not conduct any of the interviews as it was felt that more candid interview responses would be shared by participants through this approach. Interview questions were framed around the transfer of training frameworks of Baldwin and Ford (1988) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420615">Cromwell and Kolb, (2004</xref>) discussed earlier. Hence, questions focused on how each individual participant’s behaviour had changed and what personal insights concerning his or her practice had emerged as a result of the LD program. The questions also explored what parts of the LD program, and associated methodologies, influenced the PCs’ leadership and practice. Lastly, the questions explored perceptions about what work environment factors influenced their LD and practice.</p>
<p>All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using nVivo, a data management software application for the social sciences. The primary investigator interrogated and coded the data using methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1741143211420615">Strauss and Corbin (1990</xref>). Coding moved from initial nVivo coding to open coding. Further analysis involved a re-examination of categories to determine how they were linked in order to map a conceptual framework, a process referred to as axial coding. Constant comparison techniques were used to summarize the text and to identify themes that emanated from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420615">Creswell, 2003</xref>). The researchers were interested in both theory development (new findings emanating from the data) as well as theory confirmation (findings consistent with the literature on leadership development and transfer of training). Areas of commonality were a focus of the interpretation, rather than exploration of outliers or differences. Hence, themes that were identified by at least half of the respondents are explored in more detail and reported in this article.</p>
<p>By considering the ideas and explanations inherent in the data, and seeking agreement with one of the other co-investigators, this process of triangulation increases the trustworthiness or rigour in the data collection process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143211420615">Johnson, 1997</xref>). Hence, the conceptual framework and coding definitions were subjected to review by one of the other co-investigators, a method to enhance credibility. Member checking with two PCs who were interviewed in the research was also undertaken to explore the conceptual map and key findings. A third PC who was approached did not provide any input. Given the high workload demands of the PCs identified in the research, a larger member checking cohort was not solicited. Both validated their experiences strongly against the findings of this research, thus adding further rigour or trustworthiness to the findings.</p>

<sec id="section9-1741143211420615">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were four conceptual categories that could all be linked to a central super category entitled confidence. These conceptual categories were: the leadership program; PC as leader; leadership skill sets; and workplace factors. The first of these mid-level categories (the leadership program) related to factors endemic to the design of the leadership program. The second mid-level category (PC as leader) related to the impact on the individual person as a result of participation in the LD program. The third mid-level category (leadership skill sets) related to workplace factors that influenced the LD experience. A fourth mid-level category (workplace factors) emerged, which identified skills sets that were particularly valued by participants.</p>
<p>Within each of these mid-level categories, two to three sub-categories were identified. Each sub-category was represented by at least 50 per cent of the PCs interviewed in this research as the focus was to identify commonality rather than differences or outliers. The mid-level category and its sub-categories are described in more detail below. Quotations by individuals are separated by these markings ‘//’ to illustrate a range of views and to highlight the most descriptive findings for the category.</p>
<sec id="section10-1741143211420615">
<title>The ‘Leadership Program’</title>
<p>This mid-level category represents dimensions of the leadership development program itself, in particular, how it was structured and delivered. Its sub-categories are explained below.</p>
<sec id="section11-1741143211420615">
<title>Experience in Role</title>
<p>As the leadership program was open to all PCs, they brought a wide range of experience to the program. What became apparent was that individuals experienced the program in different ways, depending upon their experience in the PC role. Those with more experience, as noted in the quotations below, found the program at times not offering them what they wanted because they had already been operating in the role for quite some time.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘one or two of the activities … separating out because … that was old hat to experienced coordinators’ // ‘I’ve done management courses in the past …a bit more depth in that area would have been even more helpful.’ // ‘for those of us who … have a more strategic role to play, just to take us that bit further.’ // ‘…haven’t benefitted from this course as much as I would have done had that course been run say three or four years ago’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It was felt that the LD program was geared more towards those new in the role.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I think it was a level for those who are relatively new to program coordination’ // ‘…was more geared to those who perhaps had less experience in actual coordinator’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What these two sets of quotations indicate is that additional thinking by course developers, needs to be put into place when designing leadership interventions. The amount of experience a PC possesses is an important factor which, must be taken into consideration. Course developers should consider, for example, how to use those PCs with more experience to support PCs with less experience? Further, how might discussions and learning partnerships in the program be structured to tap into this greater experience base as not all participants leave the program with exactly the same outcomes? Interestingly, Al-Musawi (2008) found that participants in a faculty development program designed to enhance pedagogy already possessed a high degree of prior knowledge. He argued that the existing knowledge base of potential participants needs to be considered in program development and recruitment efforts and the quotations above would certainly support this conclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741143211420615">
<title>Buddying</title>
<p>The program also encouraged peer coaching strategies as part of its design. Individuals were requested to form strategic learning alliances with others in the program. This could be through peer coaching or other forms of learning communities. This methodology was supported by participants who invested in this approach, as noted in the quotations below and was an important part of the leadership program.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘…the thing I found fantastic was to sit in a space and hear things and think, yes, I thought that or then to hear other people sharing …’ // ‘I think we learnt quite a lot, not only about one another on a personal level, but just what those very different backgrounds mean within the university setting, and the strengths and limitations of those backgrounds.’ // ‘I quite liked the whole notion of coaching, because again, I think for those of us in these positions, that’s something I don’t think we’ve perhaps all taken enough notice of.’ // ‘… but in talking with him that was interesting finding out more about how he does things’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The quotations above, support the use of social learning systems, or ‘buddying’ as it was referred to in this category, to engage participants with program content. Learning in partnership with their colleagues appeared to boost engagement with the material presented in the program. As noted in the quotations, this strategy provided participants with a person, or group, to unpack their experience against the information in the LD program thus increasing meaning and utility. Program Coordinators were also able to consider their own leadership in different ways, through the lens of their colleagues’ experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143211420615">
<title>Doing Things Differently Across Faculties</title>
<p>The inter-disciplinary nature of the LD program was valued by participants. In one way, it extends the social learning concept by having individuals from a cross-section of the university working and sharing their practice with one another. Individuals found hearing how other PCs implemented their role within their department very useful in terms of framing their own leadership experience. This is described in the quotations that follow.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I enjoyed the interaction with other people just across the University … this was a bit of an eye opener because you can tend to be quite cocooned in a sense … it made me realize that some of the issues that I had weren’t just me then.’ // ‘I actually realized just how well off I was. I also hadn’t realized, perhaps, just how much difficulty some others were having in other schools …’ // ‘It was quite amazing to find that the role of a program coordinator varies …’ // ‘I was quite surprised when I found out what other people were doing. It was refreshing …’ // ‘What was nice was to sit around in the room and realize that you’re not the only one with that exact same issue, … so that was good’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The perspectives of other PCs, as noted in these quotations, appeared to provide participants with a broader perspective on the role of this position within the university context. It helped to confirm practice issues, organizational constraints and other perspectives, which appeared to help PCs understand and ground their role further within the university. This greater understanding of their role, in a broader context, has potential value to the PC in that they can benchmark their own experience and performance against others in similar roles. It may also help them to be more accepting of their situation, and to consider more productive means to address concerns they have about their role within the context of the broader workplace.</p>
<p>Other than these sub-category themes, there were several comments about the delivery of the program, but no clear consensus, and hence these views do not appear on the conceptual map even though most participants made comments in this regard. For example, some individuals liked the fortnightly break between sessions as it provided time for reflection and self-guided study time. Others would have preferred a more intensive delivery due to work pressures. The online resources were well received by participants and they found this valuable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1741143211420615">
<title>Program Coordinator as Leader</title>
<p>This mid-level category represents those individual insights and outcomes PCs received from participating in the program. The sub-category concepts are outlined below.</p>
<sec id="section15-1741143211420615">
<title>360 Leadership Insights</title>
<p>Participants found the 360-degree assessment very insightful. The assessment gave them useful information about their performance and they appreciated receiving feedback from their colleagues. The comment below was quite reflective of what most people felt towards this assessment strategy.<disp-quote>
<p>I found quite helpful the 360 … was really helpful because you got different feedback … to me that was really interesting and really helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For many, the feedback obtained from the 360-degree review was the first time they had ever received any comprehensive feedback from their peers and leaders about their performance and leadership within the role. This had positive motivational effects for the cohort as noted in the above quotation. The positive feedback helped to reinforce good behaviour and the developmental ideas were taken on board as areas for further inquiry or action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1741143211420615">
<title>Impact of Program on Personal Leadership</title>
<p>Overall, Program Coordinators found the LD program provided value, and the quotations illustrated below provide evidence of its impact. The program boosted confidence, provided insights into their practice and skills and made them more self-aware of their leadership style.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… it did give me some confidence that I’d been proceeding along at least a reasonably correct path …’ // ‘… it gives you food for thought and pause for thought as well at times so it was useful, no question …’ // ‘… some of the ways the sessions were presented, I’ve certainly taken some of those ideas away …’ // ‘I think I’ve just become more aware of other leadership styles and how people like things done so I can meet their needs as well as meeting the needs of the students.’// ‘For me it sharpened up a bit of the self reflection about what I do well, what I need to do …’ // ‘… my notions of being a leader as a result of doing the workshop … not a day goes by when I don’t consider the responsibilities of leadership…so the course has made me acutely aware.’ // ‘… my perception of the role of program coordinator—I’m now very aware that it’s a role that can galvanise a group of people …’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What these quotations indicate is that the program, even many months later, had left participants thinking about their leadership and reflecting on their practice. This heightened meta-cognition appears to have aided their further development due to the attention they were now paying to their leadership practices. As an aside, between the first and second pilot, the participants’ perception of the PC role shifted substantially echoing the increased focus on, and reappraisal of, their leadership. For example, in the initial evaluation of the first pilot (carried out at its conclusion) a percentage agreement of 58 per cent was recorded in response to ‘Views on role as PC have changed as a result of the Program’. In the second pilot, 100 per cent agreement was recorded.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1741143211420615">
<title>Leadership Skills Sets</title>
<p>In this mid-level category there were three sub-categories which related to specific modules which were commented upon frequently by the PCs in this research. They are described below.</p>
<sec id="section18-1741143211420615">
<title>Curriculum and Pedagogy</title>
<p>Principles of outcome based education and curriculum reviews were the primary area focus of these modules in the LD program. PCs found these sessions valuable, as noted in the quotations below, as it gave them further information and learning about curriculum mapping, planning, review and delivery.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Yeah, pedagogy is always—not necessarily for people in my position at the front of their minds, but it certainly is increasingly with me’// ‘I was going to say the pedagogy … really helped me.’ // ‘… biggest part for me was the program review because at the time, I was going through a program review …’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most importantly, the pilots coincided with a university-wide review of the curriculum, which introduced a consistent process to ensure the quality of programs. The focus on PCs through the curriculum review, helped emphasize and raise the leadership profile of staff in this role, as noted in the comments above. PCs new to curriculum review found the modules addressing curriculum and pedagogy particularly useful. This suggests that an academic leadership program for PCs pay some attention to pedagogy and curriculum as it appeared to be an important developmental need for the group, and a component of the skill base needed for this position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1741143211420615">
<title>Psychological Profiles of the Team</title>
<p>In this module the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator and facilitating and managing teams were the focus. Individuals learned about different personality types and team facilitation strategies. The quotations noted below illustrated how well these concepts were received by the participants.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘recognising personality types I think whilst was a lot of fun … I thought it was quite useful too’ // ‘psychological testing kind of thing, they were interesting, they were illuminating’ // ‘the psychological approach was fairly novel to me … thinking about how my colleagues going to think about this—how will they react to this?’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This session rated very well in the evaluations completed in the pilots, and these comments suggest that the insights into managing teams and personality differences had a lasting impact on participants’ leadership. In fact, this module was the one module that consistently rated most favourably across the two pilots. Given the collegial culture of universities, and that the PC often has no line management authority, it is no surprise that this module was highly rated. It provided some tools and theoretical perspectives to managing personal relationships, thereby empowering the PC and providing some ‘distance’ from the challenges and tensions inherent in managing one’s peers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1741143211420615">
<title>Connecting Upwards</title>
<p>In this module, building influence and managing upwards were the focus of the session. Networking was also covered. Collectively, these concepts explored how the PC could increase their power base and influence in the political networks of the university, including their relationship with their head of department/school.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… one that I remember that was quite powerful for my thinking was … how to please the boss … that’s not well worded but that was how do you manage up.’ // ‘ … realising that in a coordination role sitting in the middle … so to speak is that I’m now much more aware of when things are asked of me from above.’ // ‘I think it made me realise how much more importance there was in almost translating information from there to there ...’ // ‘I think I’m getting better at viewing it being [the university] and searching for opportunities that are not just about our faculty.’ // ‘… looking back up, rather than always looking down’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These quotations, noted above, illustrate how important this module was for this group of PCs who find themselves in leadership positions where they must use influence to achieve their goals. Akin to the module concerned with managing teams discussed above, this module also rated well at the time of completion. In this module, PCs were able to see how important their role was in supporting their head of program as well as the university’s strategic objectives. This connection with management levels above them was a positive outcome as it made them feel ‘part of the system’, that their role was of strategic importance, and that they, in fact, had the potential to build their influence.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1741143211420615">
<title>Confidence</title>
<p>The impact of the program, at many levels, appeared to fuel the super category called confidence, hence, the mid-level categories are all aligned to this central theme. The design of the program, the impact of the sessions and particular topics, all helped to create this central outcome of the LD program. The following quotations describe the lasting impact the program had on the confidence of the PCs.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘It helped me feel more confident.’ // ‘Since this course I’m much more confident saying, “these are really important issues” … I never would have said that before the workshop.’ // ‘The workshop enabled me to see myself through other eyes … it gave me personally and professionally some confidence that allowed me to see my strengths and weaknesses.’ // ‘… It gives you the confidence to say, ‘ well you actually are part of this process …’ // ‘I’m certainly more confident in that kind of situation than I used to be …’ // ‘… managing or working with people … the course gave me a lot more strength, confidence and I think capacity to do that.’ // ‘… I’m sitting forward and putting my two cents in ….I feel I can do it now whereas before I didn’t.’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To a certain extent, the program helped to formalize the leadership role of the PC in the institution and gave them ‘authority’ to lead. A positive experience in the program, combined with the opportunity of meeting with staff in the same role, appears to have empowered and boosted the confidence of the PCs. Through the sharing of experiences, and the recognition and support provided by the university’s visible show of support for the LD program, these factors were likely contributors to the positive outcomes noted in the quotations concerning confidence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1741143211420615">
<title>Workplace Factors</title>
<p>This mid-level category explored work place factors that influenced leadership development transfer. To maximize outcomes from the LD program, individuals need time to consider their learning and practice, engage with others, and reflect. There were clear impediments that PCs faced in trying to implement these leadership development strategies, which are noted in the quotations below. These clearly point to issues around workload strain and lack of training, orientation and succession planning strategies. These two sub-categories, entitled workload strain and figuring it out for yourself are outlined below.</p>
<sec id="section23-1741143211420615">
<title>Workload Strain</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… the amount of work that being a Coordinator involves … makes it impossible to be a good Coordinator.’ // ‘Coordinators role could be more creative in an intellectual sense but I’m not sure that we’re ever given the opportunity …’ // ‘There is no admin. support at all. None and there’s less and less and there are more things to do.’ // ‘… it’s a question of how long have you got to do all this kind of stuff … We’re under a great workload, strain …’ // ‘… maybe that also reflects just how completely overloaded the working life is’.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These quotations suggest that the role of the PC is becoming more complex and more demanding given increases in accountability and reporting in the higher education sector that have emerged in the past 10 years. It has been argued that the audit culture associated with quality cycles has a negative impact on leadership capacity in higher education by consuming a lot of time, energy and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420615">Collinson and Collinson, 2009</xref>). The comments made by the PCs would certainly align with this conclusion. Accurate role descriptions and work load planning are, therefore, becoming more critical for this cohort to enable them to do their job properly. Concurrently, PCs need time release to engage in appropriate leadership development initiatives. </p>
<p>In addition to the workload strain associated with this role, there was also a strong message regarding how individuals are placed in these positions. There is little orientation or formalized support for novice PCs let alone any sense of succession planning, as noted in the quotations below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1741143211420615">
<title>Figuring it Out for Yourself</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… you pick it up as you go along.’ // ‘it’s been an accelerating process of learning how this place works. It was a struggle to start with …’ // ‘… it did startle me in a way that so many PCs there didn’t seem to know those processes … some of them had been put into positions really without the background …’ // ‘I have been the ‘program coordinator’ for about four years … and have no training whatsoever … I wanted to do that particular course to figure out exactly what is the role of a program-coordinator.’ // ‘I had to seek out how to do different parts of it that weren’t necessarily handed over at the beginning … there’s all these committees and forms and things you’ve go to get through … which aren’t very well set out or explained anywhere.’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These quotations suggest that there is a significant lack of training, orientation or succession planning for these important positions. It was for these reasons, therefore, that the leadership program was developed for these individuals. It also suggests that greater attention needs to be put in to place by management to develop appropriate role descriptions and resources for this position within the organization. Academic programs also have to think about succession planning and handover processes to reduce this issue about ‘figuring it out for yourself’.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In reviewing the four levels of evaluation described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420615">Kirkpatrick (1996</xref>) the LD program appears to have produced some enduring learning outcomes, suggesting that a positive transfer of training had taken place. In examining the second level of evaluation, namely, the learning that they received, PCs noted that they had learned a range of valuable and practical things. They noted that they had learned much more about curriculum and pedagogy, about networking and building influence, and about managing individuals and teams. They also gained confidence from the program, which was a result of the integrated content of the program, its contextualized nature, and the experience of learning alongside others in the same situation. Importantly, they understood how leadership was important for the PC role. Many, did not conceptualize themselves as leaders at the start of the program because of a perceived lack of formal power. The LD program was influential producing this shift in their perspective.</p>
<p>The value of having the Integrated Competing Values Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420615">Vilkinas and Cartan, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420615">2006</xref>) to link their leadership knowledge and theory was extremely helpful, particularly given that most of the PCs in this study did not come from a management science background. It also helped them to look at their leadership learning in the program, and to consider gaps in their competence and capability for further development. The fact that the model was integrated with a sound 360-degree assessment survey, and linked to feedback from their colleagues, it elevated the credibility of the leadership framework and the experience of receiving information about their leadership in the higher education context.</p>
<p>With respect to Kirpatrick’s third level of evaluation, namely, behavioural changes as a result of the training program, evidence was found in a range of areas, which all helped to fuel confidence. For example, PCs reported being able to execute program review practices more effectively, and they took on more active and influential roles in the university and in department/school-based meetings. Furthermore, they thought more strategically about communicating and managing work flow processes within their team and in communications with their head of department/school. This heightened learning could be attributed to the curriculum and pedagogy content of the program, and the communication and building influence material in the program, respectively. </p>
<p>The PCs’ heightened awareness of the importance of collective or distributive approaches to leadership, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143211420615">McRoy and Gibbs (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420615">Hellawell and Hancock (2001</xref>), was also an excellent learning outcome as it is an appropriate leadership behaviour within the context of the collegial working culture in higher education.</p>
<p>With respect to the delivery of the leadership program, the use of peer coaching and the larger group was valuable in helping participants embed their learning and contextualize it to their discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420615">Blackmore, 2007</xref>). Listening to how other PCs worked within their role across the university, how they dealt with similar problems in different faculties, and how they became aware of the shared pressures all PCs faced, was extremely valuable and an important design factor in the success of the LD program. This experiential and reflective approach helped to clarify discipline based practices, thereby promoting shared understanding within the diverse cohort, which has been acknowledged as an important factor in LD programs in the higher education sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420615">Blackmore, 2007</xref>). Course developers should consider these social learning systems in their design and delivery of leadership development programs.</p>
<p>While these learning outcomes are described individually, in reality, they work together to build up the competency and capability of the program coordinator. These outcomes are also the result of having a leadership program that is designed using evidenced based practices such as those described earlier in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143211420615">Bolden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143211420615">Kerka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420615">Ladyshewsky and Varey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143211420615">Preiss and Molina-Ray, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of experiential learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420615">Kolb, 1984</xref>) and social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420615">Bandura, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1741143211420615">Vygotsky, 1986</xref>) as a framework for the program, was influential in achieving the transfer of training outcomes. By developing specific skills in team building, managing upwards and communication for example, these help to build confidence, as it enables the PC to exercise their belief in themself as leader. This occurs through a shift in their self-concept as leader, supported by the peer coaching and examples of others in the program. The opportunities for engagement with their peers, in a highly contextualized program, over the course of 20 weeks supported the learning experience. The success of this intervention should suggest to others that similar evidence-based approaches should be integrated in to future LD initiatives.</p>
<p>What could have been improved, however, as a design factor in the LD program, was cognizance of the varying levels of experience within the group as this had an influence on participant outcomes. For example, group work and peer coaching arrangements could have built in more strategic alliances between those PCs with more experience and those with less experience. This may have elevated the engagement of the more senior PCs as they could have shared their knowledge more directly with less experienced PCs. Given that most PCs reported no formal orientation and training for the role prior to the LD experience, the linkage of less experienced PCs to those PCs with more experience may have elevated program learning outcomes further through the coaching and group interactions. Again, course developers should note the experience base of participants in their leadership development programs and make use of this opportunity where it exists.</p>
<p>Of concern, but of no surprise, were workplace factors that reduced the efficacy and transfer of training outcomes within the PCs. Clearly, the PC role needs further role clarity and planning in the context of the university’s human resource structure. Individuals were very clear that there was no clear succession planning or orientation for these roles, a finding reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143211420615">Southwell et al., 2005</xref>). Yet the PC role is of strategic importance to a program’s quality. As a result, directing new PCs into the LD program early is imperative. As mentioned earlier, using those PCs with more experience in the LD program as mentors or coaches would also help to address the issue of succession planning, particularly given the predicted exit of ‘Baby Boomers’ and the loss of their knowledge from the higher education sector.</p>
<p>Workload strain was another problem raised by these PCs, consistent with what has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143211420615">Stigmar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143211420615">Trowbridge and Bates, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1741143211420615">Webb and Murphy, 1997</xref>), which interferes with their ability to reflect and think critically about how they might further develop their leadership and transfer the training delivered through the program into practice. Yet, it is critical to ongoing leadership development, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143211420615">Vilkinas and Cartan (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1741143211420615">2006</xref>) that those involved in LD need the time to develop their integrator role. The integrator role is about reflective practice and critical thinking about how one executes one’s leadership skill. Academic program directors need dedicated work time allocated to leadership development rather than it being ‘added on’ to an already strained workload.</p>
<p>This study did not address Kirkpatrick’s fourth level of evaluation, namely, the results that are produced on program quality and student learning. Many variables influence the quality of a program and it would be very difficult to measure how the leadership investment in the PC translated into deeper learning outcomes for students in the program. This would require a different experimental design and a longer time frame. As noted earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420615">Gibbs (2006</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420615">Martin et al. (2003</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143211420615">Prosser and Trigwell (1997</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143211420615">Ramsden et al. (2007</xref>) all argue that if department leaders facilitate a good teaching environment through their leadership, then instructors are more likely to use a student-focused approach, which in turn should produce better results and student outcomes. However, in a review of literature on LD and a link to enhanced student learning outcomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143211420615">Southwell and Morgan (2009</xref>) found no studies providing evidence in the higher education literature regarding this fourth level outcome. However, they report that a focus on distributed leadership, and LD initiatives that are sustained and focused around a coherent sense of purpose, may influence staff values and behaviours, which in turn, have an impact in the classroom. This ongoing question of how academic leadership development results in enhanced program quality and student learning is an important question and worthy of further research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This qualitative study provides some evidence that transfer of training in a cohort of PCs who undertook a LD program designed specifically for this role in the higher education sector produces enduring changes in learned behaviour. Important design features of the program were the use of peer learning and coaching strategies. Specific topics were particularly important and were either related to curriculum and pedagogy or in managing others and building influence, important concepts for distributed leadership within this role. Factors that negatively affected the transfer of training were high workloads and a lack of role clarity and succession planning. This study raises some interesting perspectives for universities and academic staff developers charged with LD activities in the higher education sector. Clearly there is a need for leadership development initiatives for this cohort of staff within universities, and senior managers should be directing funds to this strategic initiative. However, careful thought needs to go into the design of such professional development in order to produce successful transfer of training outcomes and benefits for academic programs. The role of the PC itself needs further development and clarity within the university sector, and many of the workload, succession planning and orientation issues need to be addressed. Otherwise, these workplace factors may interfere with successful LD outcomes and result in less than positive outcomes for the PC and the courses they lead.</p>
