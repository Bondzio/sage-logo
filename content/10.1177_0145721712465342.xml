<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate a community-based diabetes education pilot project. The Neighborhood Health Talker project aimed to train and implement cultural health brokers primarily targeting communities of color to improve community members’ diabetes knowledge and diabetes self-management skills. A secondary aim was to establish diabetes resource libraries accessible to communities that normally experience barriers to these resources.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721712465342">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Recruited community members completed 1 week of formal training developed by a multidisciplinary team in Buffalo, NY. The effect of training was evaluated through the use of baseline surveys, a pretest/posttest covering all training content, and daily quizzes evaluating knowledge relevant to each of the five training modules. Trained NHTs then held at least five community conversations in various locations and administered anonymous postconversation surveys to participants. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis techniques were used to summarize test, quiz, and survey results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721712465342">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Twelve women and 1 man completed the training program. Working alone as well as in pairs, each held at least five community conversations reaching over 700 community members of all ages over 3 months and established 8 diabetes resource libraries in the community. All trainees increased their diabetes knowledge and confidence as well as their abilities to perform the tasks of a cultural health broker. Trainees also indicated that the goals they set at training initiation were met.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721712465342">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The training was successful in increasing trainee knowledge and confidence about diabetes prevention and self-management. Participants not only developed proficiency in discussing diabetes, they also made important lifestyle changes that demonstrated their commitment to the cause and the project. Low-cost initiatives like this are easily reproducible in other communities of color and could be modified to meet the needs of other communities as well.</p>

<p>The higher rates of morbidity and mortality among African Americans from chronic diseases such as diabetes can be partially attributed to the lack of access to adequate and appropriate information from health care providers on how to self-manage their illness and the hesitation to ask questions of their health care providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721712465342">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721712465342"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465342">3</xref></sup> Studies have shown that group visits for minority and disadvantaged patients with diabetes result in better diabetes self-management and increased trust in the physician.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721712465342">4</xref></sup> Community Health Worker/Family Health Advocate programs have also improved patients’ ability to control their illness and work collaboratively with their physician to answer questions and address concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465342">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712465342">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721712465342">6</xref></sup> Contributing to the success of these programs is the group dynamic that fosters nonjudgmental support and information sharing among patients with similar disease experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721712465342">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721712465342">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The effectiveness of community health worker programs in linking patients to community resources has been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721712465342">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721712465342"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721712465342"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721712465342"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721712465342">11</xref></sup> Community health workers specializing in diabetes education are a low-cost approach to providing support and information that complements formal diabetes health care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721712465342">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721712465342">13</xref></sup> The Neighborhood Health Talker program was an initiative in which African American members of medically underserved communities received diabetes-specific cultural health broker training (described in the following) developed by the authors to work within their communities to improve access to health information and diabetes self-management skills. Community conversations about diabetes led by Neighborhood Health Talkers in churches, community centers, housing projects, and other places where people gather may promote healthy communities where many people become empowered to support, encourage, and inform their peers and loved ones about how to prevent and manage diabetes.</p>
<p>The project built on the concepts of cultural health brokers and community health workers to create a lay health worker heretofore referred to as a “Neighborhood Health Talker” who speaks with other community members about diabetes and how to self-manage. The term “Neighborhood Health Talker” is designed to brand this health worker initiative with terminology that speaks directly to its targeted African American community of Buffalo, New York. Within this community, traditional word-of-mouth remains the most effective means of communicating critical information.</p>
<p>Cultural brokering is the act of bridging, linking, or mediating between groups or persons of different cultural backgrounds for the purpose of reducing conflict or producing change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721712465342">14</xref></sup> A cultural broker is defined as a go-between, one who advocates on behalf of another individual or group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721712465342">15</xref></sup> A cultural health broker, then, is someone who advocates on behalf of the health of another individual or group by providing information in culturally sensitive ways and mediating between community members and the health care sector. In this project, the cultural health brokers, Neighborhood Health Talkers, reach into their own communities and networks and provide accurate information about accessing health care, talking with their health care providers (who are often culturally very different from themselves), and specifically understanding and managing diabetes. Community health workers, in comparison, are frontline public health workers who fulfill many of the same functions but are often required to complete formal certification and are often paid employees of a health care organization or health department.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465342">16</xref></sup> They most often work with underserved and low-income populations as part of the health care “safety-net,” providing services such as transport to medical appointments, visiting medical providers with patients, and linkage to needed social services, in addition to culturally appropriate information and educational resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721712465342">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>This intervention specifically targets communities at highest risk of diabetes complications: minority, underserved people who are often disenfranchised and disconnected from the health care system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721712465342">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721712465342"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721712465342"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721712465342"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721712465342">21</xref></sup> Similar to community health workers, a Neighborhood Health Talker is from the community to which the message is targeted, therefore may be perceived as a trustworthy source of information about how to prevent and/or self-manage diabetes.</p>
<p>This article presents the evaluation results of the Neighborhood Health Talker community-based diabetes education pilot project. This project aimed to train and implement Neighborhood Health Talkers (NHTs) to improve community members’ knowledge and access to diabetes information and increase the level of diabetes self-management skills. A secondary aim was to establish diabetes resource libraries at various locations (churches, community centers, etc) accessible to communities that normally experience barriers to these resources.</p>
<sec id="section5-0145721712465342">
<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section6-0145721712465342">
<title>Project team</title>
<p>This pilot project was funded by a Legacy Grant from the Bronx Health REACH/New York Center of Excellence to Eliminate Disparity to the Erie Niagara Area Health Education Center (EN AHEC). EN AHEC is part of a statewide AHEC system whose mission is “to enhance access to quality health care and improve health care outcomes by addressing the health workforce needs of medically disadvantaged communities and populations through partnerships between the institutions that train health professionals and the communities that need them most.” The Neighborhood Health Talkers represent a potential new field within health care that improves access to care among disadvantaged communities and contributes to workforce opportunities for members of those communities. The president of EN AHEC (MC) partnered with the evaluation director of the NYS AHEC system (RC), and a local community organizer, reverend, and educator (JR) to develop the curriculum, achieve accreditation through a local college, and implement the pilot program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0145721712465342">
<title>Curriculum development</title>
<p>The project team met regularly in the months leading up to the June 2009 training week to develop a training manual that contained relevant information laid out in an accessible format that could be covered in one week’s time. It included five modules: I: Refining Leadership Skills, II: Cultural Broker Skill Development &amp; Cultural Diversity Awareness, III: Diabetes 101, IV: Health Literacy and the State of Aging and Health in America, and V: Methods of Cultural Health Brokering. The curriculum was approved for Continuing Professional Education credit at Buffalo State College.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0145721712465342">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>Community members were recruited through block clubs, tenant council meetings, a community health center, and a women’s church group. Upon recruitment but prior to acceptance into the training program, potential NHT trainees completed a baseline survey including demographic information (age range, sex, race, ethnicity, highest level and major field of educational study, and current employment/volunteer activity) and a list/description of other types of leadership activities in which they had participated. They were also asked to rank their degree of agreement on a number of statements reflecting some of the responsibilities and skills of a cultural health broker and community leader (eg, “I feel comfortable sharing my opinion and ideas,” “I have a desire to help others,” “I am organized,” “I have a hard time understanding others from different backgrounds,” and “Budgeting time is difficult for me”). Project leaders used these surveys to help guide telephone or face-to-face interviews with NHT candidates as well as to describe the demographics of accepted NHT trainees.</p>
<p>Once enrolled, trainees participated in 4 weeks of NHT training at the Erie Niagara Area Health Education Center. The first week involved formal half-day educational sessions using the accredited curriculum, and the following weeks were committed to conducting and evaluating community conversations in areas of Buffalo primarily inhabited by African Americans and other minority populations. Community conversations are generally preplanned meetings arranged by the trainees with groups at their church, in their neighborhood, at nearby community centers, and so on for the purpose of discussing diabetes prevention and self-management. Trainees received a modest stipend for their time spent in training and community conversations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721712465342">
<title>Training</title>
<p>The training encouraged reflexivity while focusing on leadership skills, cross-cultural communication, diabetes and its treatment, health literacy, as well as how to combine these skills to assist people who have diabetes with learning how to manage their condition and access the health care system more effectively. Training also addressed cultural and environmental barriers to diabetes prevention and self-management, including discussion of circumstances and characteristics common in broken/fractured communities. Methods to overcome these barriers were also discussed and practiced in a classroom as well as field setting. With the help of a marketing agency, the project leaders agreed on a memorable mantra to encourage adherence to the Health Talkers’ messages. “<italic>Listen. Share. Live ‘Diabetes Well’</italic>” is intended to reinforce adherence to diabetes crisis prevention and self-management guidelines as disseminated by the Health Talkers at their neighborhood meetings to encourage those who attend to “pay it forward” (ie, share the information openly with others in the interest of improving chronic diabetes outcomes.)</p>
<p>As part of the NHT curriculum, project leaders designed a pretest/posttest and daily evaluations (quizzes) reflecting the content covered in each module. The format of daily quizzes included questions framed as multiple choice, modified true/false (where if the statement is false, the respondent must modify it to make it true), matching, fill in the blank, and short answer. The pretest/posttest measured knowledge and attitudes about diabetes, self-management, cultural competency, and leadership and also asked respondents to rank their degree of agreement with a number of statements pertaining to leadership skills (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Also on the pretest, respondents provided 2 personal goals of NHT training and at posttest they reflected on whether and how those goals were met (open-ended response). In the posttest, respondents also reflected on the degree (on a scale of 1 = not at all to 3 = very much) to which the training increased their knowledge related to diabetes management and prevention as well as their confidence sharing this information with others. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721712465342">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of the evaluation tools used to assess the effect of training.</p>

<p>After a week of formal training, NHTs were asked to hold at least 5 community conversations in locations of their choice, which tended to be in their neighborhood, workplace, or an organization to which they belonged. Examples include the NHT’s church, block club, community center, and hair salon. NHTs were asked to reach out to these groups to formally schedule a conversation and would then report all upcoming conversations to the project leaders and the other NHTs. They documented the dates, locations, and number of participants at each of their community conversations and wrote brief field notes summarizing the events. They also documented the establishment of at least one resource library in the community and they committed to monitoring and maintaining it. NHTs approached each conversation prepared to cover certain topics but allowed the group to set the pace and determine which topics were the major areas of focus. From there, the NHT allowed the participants to determine the direction of conversation. A post–community conversation survey querying perceived increase in knowledge of diabetes and diabetes self-management and confidence in speaking with health professionals served as a final measure of the NHT’s success in the program as well as the impact on community members participating in the conversations.</p>

<sec id="section10-0145721712465342" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Project leaders collected data in 3 phases using quantitative and qualitative survey methodology. As previously mentioned, potential NHT trainees completed a baseline survey, NHT pre-/post-survey and daily quizzes and community conversation participants completed post-conversation surveys. The State University of New York at Buffalo Social and Behavioral Sciences Institutional Review Board approved the use of the evaluation of this pilot project for research purposes.</p>
<p>Analysis of demographic and evaluation data included descriptive statistics (frequencies and means) and qualitative analysis of open-ended response questions. Qualitative analysis consisted of a content-driven immersion-crystallization approach that involves a systematic iterative process of text interpretation and categorization to establish patterns of significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721712465342">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721712465342">23</xref></sup> The open-ended responses were reviewed and analyzed by the project team (RC, MC, and JR) wherein the team met and communicated through email about the responses to identify and reach agreement about the themes. Interpretive disagreements were discussed and resolved by presenting supportive evidence. Daily quizzes on curriculum content and the knowledge questions on the overall pretest/posttest were scored out of a possible 100% (number correct/number of questions). Frequencies and means were calculated for trainee responses to Likert scale questions on self-perceived leadership-related qualities, pre/post self-ranked confidence in leadership and NHT-related skills, and trainee ranking of the influence of training on diabetes knowledge and confidence in sharing information about diabetes.</p>

<title>Baseline survey</title>
<p>When asked in the initial survey to reflect on statements regarding leadership and people skills, the trainees showed confidence in their possession of a number of leadership characteristics. The strongest attributes of participating trainees were valuing diversity and having the desire to help others. The second strongest attributes were having a love of learning, feeling like they work well with others, and being prepared to experience personal growth. The only positive attribute that everyone did not feel they had to a great or very great extent was “I am organized.”</p>

<title>NHT training pretest/posttest</title>
<p>The average score on the daily quizzes was 82% with a range from 40% to 100%. The pretest/posttest results showed increases in knowledge and self-ranked confidence. Trainee knowledge scores increased from pretest to posttest by about 10 percentage points, which is about a 12% increase in average knowledge among the 11 trainees participating in both pre and post evaluations. Trainees also improved their ranking of their confidence in their abilities to perform many of the roles and tasks of a cultural health broker. On a scale of 1 to 5 (strongly disagree to strongly agree), the average overall ranking pretraining was 4.14 and posttraining was 4.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721712465342">Figure 1</xref>). The most improvement in confidence was in the trainees’ agreement with the statement “I feel like I can clearly explain what diabetes is and how it can be self-managed.”</p>

<p>Trainees were asked to indicate whether their training had increased their knowledge about diabetes as well as how confident they felt sharing information about diabetes. Responding trainees (n = 10) overwhelmingly indicated that training improved their knowledge and confidence very much (3 on a scale of 1-3). Topics addressed by this portion specifically included (1) symptoms of diabetes, (2) risk factors for diabetes, (3) how diabetes is diagnosed, (4) diabetes complications, (5) how to prevent diabetes complications, (6) preventing diabetes, (7) self-management of diabetes, (8) examples of good eating habits, (9) ways to incorporate exercise, and (10) special recommendations regarding pregnancy. Mean ranking for both knowledge and confidence was 2.9 (range, 2.8-3.0) for nearly all topics with the exception of 2.5 and 2.7, respectively, for “special recommendations regarding pregnancy.”</p>
<p>The pre/post survey included an open-ended question asking respondents to list 2 goals for their cultural health broker training. Post training, the trainees were then asked to reflect on the achievement of their goals. Twelve respondents provided 24 goals, which have been grouped into 7 major themes: community education, improve own knowledge/behavior, making care/information accessible, reaching children, encourage preventive behaviors, navigate system, and sustain program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712465342">Table 3</xref>). The most common theme of the reported goals was community education, which was included in 8 of the 24 listed goals (33%). Comments included: “Relay what I’ve learned to others” and to “help educate individuals with diabetes about facets that increase the risk of other conditions due to poor diabetic control.”</p>

<p>Several NHT trainees mentioned the desire to improve their own knowledge and behavior, with comments such as “have a better guide for my own health issues as they arise.” Trainees wanted to make care and information more accessible, as evidenced by comments such as, “To be able to get information to those who are ‘underserved’ in the community and help break down info to something they can understand.” <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145721712465342">Table 3</xref> demonstrates the types of comments categorized into the other major themes. Post training, all trainees indicated they had met their goals during the training and community conversations. Of note, 2 NHT trainees with diabetes indicated they had decreased their A1C—1 trainee noted that she was able to stop taking her medication.</p>
<p>The post-training survey included three additional open-ended questions: What did you like the most? What did you like the least? What would you change about the training? Responses to these questions were analyzed for major themes. In response to “What did you enjoy the most about the training?” trainees provided a variety of comments. The responses were categorized into 4 themes: the information, the other cultural health brokers, the training in general, and the conversations. Comments about the information received included “being able to inform and educate others on diabetes” and “with my knowledge I can share that information about diabetes with my family, friends, and strangers in confidence today.” About the other trainees, 1 woman commented “the talkers and their enthusiasm about learning what to do,” while another said “meeting others that are interested in learning more about diabetes.”</p>
<p>Trainees provided several suggestions for changing the training for future cultural health brokers. Of the 7 themes mentioned, the most common was to have more time in training (30%). One trainee said that “it could be longer and more in depth with explanation of the disease process,” while another commented that “if we have more time for the leadership training we could better communicate with our audience.” Similarly, 2 trainees commented that they would like more hands-on training and interaction.</p>

<title>Community conversations and resource libraries</title>
<p>Once they completed training, NHTs cumulatively established 8 resource libraries throughout a region of Buffalo with a high concentration of African American and low-income residents. Resource libraries were established in 3 churches, a community health center, a community action organization, a neighborhood community center, a drop-in services center, and the Erie Niagara Area Health Education Center program office. Several NHTs worked in pairs while others worked alone. NHTs stocked each resource library regularly with free information about how to prevent and better self-manage diabetes.</p>
<p>Additionally NHTs completed at least 5 community conversations each, amounting to over 50 conversations total reaching more than 700 people in a variety of settings including churches, community centers, housing projects, educational institutions, restaurants, and youth centers. They reached people of all age groups and several race/ethnicities and socioeconomic groups.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A recent review of community health workers (CHW) in diabetes management found that the most prevalent CHW roles are as: educator, case manager, role model/mentor, program facilitator, and advocate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721712465342">24</xref></sup> The primary role of the Neighborhood Health Talker is to serve as a liaison to health resources and as a conversation moderator/facilitator. The primary mission of this pilot project was to provide training to interested community members who would then facilitate confidence building among conversation participants to develop the abilities to access information and talk to their providers. Evaluation results indicate that the training was successful in building these skills. Participants not only developed proficiency in discussing this important issue with their neighbors and peers, they also made important lifestyle changes that demonstrated their commitment to the cause and the project. As a group, the NHTs did not assume the roles of formal educator or mentor. However certain individuals, according to their unique abilities (or shared illness), assumed these roles at times.</p>
<p>In the Neighborhood Health Talker project, prerequisites were loosely defined—with residence in the target community and desire to improve their community’s health as key strengths. The trainees ranged in age, highest educational attainment, occupation, and diabetes diagnosis status. This proved to be a strength to this program as each NHT reached a slightly different audience. There were conversations with elderly community residents at a senior community center, community college students, adolescents in a summer education program, children at an afterschool program, and male leaders of a church.</p>
<p>The Neighborhood Health Talker project was low cost relative to the number of people (over 700) reached by the community conversations. Modest stipends for time spent in training or in conversations were provided to the NHTs biweekly during the project period. The NHTs’ commitment to the project did not end when “off the clock”—they incorporated their roles into their everyday life. One NHT recounted a conversation with her church choir peers about what she was learning during the NHT training. This spontaneous conversation during choir transformed into a diabetes community conversation, where the choir members wanted to know about diabetes, how to prevent it, and how to manage it. This incident exemplifies the ability of this type of program to become quickly integrated into the fiber of a community—perhaps more so than a more formal program initiated through a health care provider or public health entity.</p>
<p>This pilot project has a number of key strengths that contributed to its success. The project team was an interdisciplinary group including a president of an Area Health Education Center (AHEC), a medical anthropologist/evaluator, a reverend who is also an educator and community organizer, and a public relations specialist. Three of these 4 were current or former residents of the target community and all of them have had a sustained commitment to enhancing health and health care access of underserved Buffalo residents. By being embedded in the city and the community, the project team was able to develop an accessible training program for community members. Affiliations with area colleges and universities allowed for adult education certification as well as access to rigorous research support and later national presentation of results.</p>
<p>The Neighborhood Health Talkers’ commitment to the program and embeddedness in their own communities resulted in an unpredicted reach to community residents. Over 700 community residents of all ages were reached by these 13 NHTs over the course of 3 months.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The authors acknowledge that the small sample size of trainees is a limitation. Future efforts to secure funding and reproduce this project with additional community members will be documented and compiled with these results. These pilot data are nonetheless important for both this project’s programmatic design and outcome reporting as well as for others who are attempting similar initiatives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0145721712465342">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Low-cost initiatives like this are easily reproducible in other communities of color and could be modified to meet the needs of other communities as well. Local churches and community organizations could serve as the champions or hubs through which training occurs and resources are acquired. In the long term, promoting diabetes knowledge, self-management, and confidence may contribute to the reduction in the high diabetes morbidity and mortality experienced by African American adults and a growing number of African American children.</p>
