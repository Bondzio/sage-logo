<p>Child neglect is a serious public health concern in the United States and across the world and represents the most common form of maltreatment, with high rates of recidivism and many negative consequences. This special issue presents articles describing research that was funded largely, or in part, by federal agencies who participated in the creation of the Federal Child Neglect Research Consortium. With this as a reference, I believe it is worthwhile to begin with a brief history of the Federal Consortium and to describe the process that led to the creation of the Translational Research on Child Neglect Consortium (TRCNC) to place this work in a historical perspective. In the second part of this introduction, I comment briefly on the five articles included here, pointing out the variety of approaches and designs used to study aspects of the functioning of neglected children and adults. Finally, I take this opportunity to call attention to some of the controversies in the field and offer suggestions for future research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077559513479917">
<title>A Brief History of the Federal Child Neglect Research Consortium</title>
<p>The federal National Institute of Health (NIH) Child Abuse and Neglect Working Group (CANWG) was established in 1997 in response to a directive by the House and Senate appropriation committees. This directive requested that NIH report on current NIH efforts, accomplishments, and future plans for research on child abuse and neglect. Originally composed of representatives from nine NIH agencies, CANWG reviewed the NIH research portfolio and issued a report in 1998 report. Recommendations were based on an analysis of the NIH portfolio at the time as well as recommendations of national meetings and other reports. For example, the 1993 National Research Council (NRC), Institute of Medicine report, “Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect,” that reviewed the state of knowledge about the origins, consequences, treatment, and prevention of child maltreatment was considered. Notably, one of the recommendations from the 1993 NRC report was to make child neglect a high-priority research area. CANWG also considered recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (1998) report “Violence in Families: Assessing Prevention and Treatment Programs,” the 1997 National Institute of Justice Child Abuse and Neglect Interventions Strategic Planning Meeting, and the 1993 National Center for Child Abuse and Neglect-sponsored symposium on chronic neglect.</p>
<p>As a result of CANWG’s work, the NIH increased support for child abuse and neglect and specifically targeted neglect. In March 1999, the NIH announced a special trans-NIH, interdepartmental Request for Applications (RFA OD-99-006), focusing on <italic>Research on Child Neglect</italic> for FY 2000. This initiative encouraged research on the etiology, extent, services, treatment, management, and prevention of child neglect. This RFA was intended to stimulate the development of child neglect research at institutions that might have had strong research programs in other related areas (e.g., child development, injury prevention, developmental neurobiology, child abuse, substance abuse, population research, health services), because few institutions or individual scholars were engaged in research focusing on child neglect at the time. A second goal of this RFA was to bring the expertise of researchers from the fields of child health, education, and juvenile justice into child neglect research and to promote their collaborations with each other and with child neglect and abuse researchers.</p>
<p>Coordinated under the leadership of CANWG, this multidiscipline and transagency RFA was the joint effort of several components of the NIH (Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) as well as the Children’s Bureau of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families, the National Institute of Justice and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention within the Office of Justice Programs at the Department of Justice, and the Office of Special Education Programs, within the Department of Education. These cosponsors pledged over $3 million annually for 5-year grants (committing a total of $15 million in new grant funding).</p>
<p>In 2000, the Federal Child Neglect Research Consortium was created and 15 grants were awarded to fund research in several areas, including psychobiological and health behaviors, services and policy research, and longitudinal studies. Additional grants were awarded under reissues of the RFA, so that the initial group of 15 was expanded. Two earlier special issues of research funded under the Child Neglect RFA were published in this journal (see the November 2004 and June 2005 issues <italic>Child Maltreatment </italic>(http://cmx.sagepub.com/content/9/4.toc and http://cmx.sagepub.com/content/10/2.toc).</p>
<p>Funding for these grants ended in 2005. However, because consortium members recognized the value of participating in the annual meetings of the Federal Consortium, a group of grantees applied for and were successful in obtaining an R13 conference grant. With this funding, the TRCNC was formed to support the activities of the members, continue to foster the development of research on child neglect, and encourage collaboration of researchers and young scholars from multiple disciplines. Annual conferences were held across the country with a different investigator and institution hosting the meetings each year. Young scholars and early career investigators were awarded travel grants to attend these meetings and receive mentoring by more senior colleagues working in the area. With R13 grant funding, a website (TRCNConsortium.com) was also created to communicate information about meetings, young scholar travel awards, and announcements. A list of the original grantees is included on the website. The last meeting of the TRCNC was held in Washington, DC, in the fall of 2012. We are hopeful that there will be some continuation of these efforts in the future.</p>

<title>Articles in this Special Issue</title>
<p>Two special issues of <italic>Child Maltreatment</italic> (2004 and 2005) illustrated the types of early work stemming from Consortium members. This special issue includes new articles by members of the TRCNC that were selected to represent developing areas of child neglect research and to cover a broad range of topics, research designs, geographic areas, time periods, and sample sizes. These articles incorporate not only characteristics of the neglected children but also the roles of biological contributions and the larger contexts in which these children exist. It is hoped that this special issue will stimulate members of the broader research community to consider research on child neglect and, perhaps, to design research to answer some of the questions raised in these five articles and at the end of this introduction.</p>
<p>In the first article entitled “Individual Differences in the Cortisol Responses of Neglected and Comparison Children,” Margaret Sullivan, David Bennett, and Michael Lewis examine stress responsivity in a group of young children, some of whom were neglected and some of whom were not. While the broader field of stress research has been studying the impact of stress on the development of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559513479917">Gunnar, 2000</xref>), researchers in the field of child neglect have just begun to examine how the experience of child neglect translates into and affects development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559513479917">Bruce, Fisher, Pears, &amp; Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559513479917">De Bellis, 2005</xref>). Sullivan and her colleagues found that neglected children showed higher initial cortisol responses, suggesting a heightened hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis reactivity, than nonneglected children, and a steeper decline. However, they also found that the groups did not differ in mean cortisol levels at two time points after the laboratory task, suggesting that greater attention needs to be paid to what neglected children may bring to the laboratory setting and that the meaning of the “baseline” may not be equivalent for children from different backgrounds. It is clear that more work is needed on how neglect gets “under the skin” to affect the development of these children.</p>
<p>The second article by Jody Todd-Manly, Assaf Oshri, Michael Lynch, Margaret Herzog, and Sanne Wortel entitled “Child Neglect and the Development of Externalizing Behavior Problems: Associations with Maternal Drug Dependence and Neighborhood Crime” builds on earlier research by the Rochester group. Using a multimethod, multi-informant, and prospective longitudinal design, Todd-Manly and her colleagues examined the extent to which the severity of childhood neglect up to age 6 in conjunction with maternal drug abuse and neighborhood crime predicted children’s externalizing behaviors at age 9. Although maternal drug dependence was associated with the severity of child neglect, Todd-Manly and her colleagues also found that neighborhood crime played a role in the development of externalizing behavior problems for neglected children. These results extend prior research and move the field ahead by beginning to examine the processes by which early neglect interacts with neighborhood characteristics to predict children’s psychopathology. These findings also illustrate the importance of examining antecedents of child neglect in order to identify risk factors that can be used in prevention and intervention strategies to protect neglected children from manifesting negative consequences and to promote positive adaptation.</p>
<p>The next two articles focus on child neglect and the consequences of neglect but explicitly call attention to the roles of race and ethnicity. In the third article in this special issue entitled “Neglect Subtypes, Race and Poverty: Individual, Family, and Service Characteristics,” Melissa Jonson-Reid, Brett Drake, and Pan Zhou describe research based on a unique data set that includes information from the census bureau, child welfare, welfare, health, justice, and education systems and traces the experiences of a large group of children through these service systems over time. This article focuses on the importance of context and the role of poverty for Black and White neglected children and examines how family and community poverty factors lead to different consequences for Black and White neglected children. Consistent with the studies of community poverty only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559513479917">Drake &amp; Rank, 2009</xref>), Jonson-Reid and her coauthors report that Black children in the child welfare system live in far poorer communities than White children, even when family income is taken into account and that children reported for the same forms of neglect face very different challenges in their community based upon their race. Jonson-Reid and her colleagues conclude that the success of efforts to move evidence-based practices into the field of child welfare will depend on understanding what works with whom.</p>
<p>In the fourth article, “Do the long-term consequences of neglect differ for children of different race and ethnic backgrounds?” Cathy Spatz Widom, Sally Czaja, Helen Wilson, Maureen Allwood, and Preeti Chauhan argue that little is known about the long-term consequences of neglect for children of different races or ethnic backgrounds. Using data from a prospective cohort design study that has been running for almost 30 years, Widom and her colleagues considered three theories (racial invariance, double jeopardy, and resilience) that lead to different hypotheses about the ways in which neglected children might manifest consequences across a broad range of domains of functioning. Their findings provide some support for each of the theories. Furthermore, although there is some evidence to suggest that the way institutions or systems respond to these children may lead to different outcomes across races and ethnic groups, these authors acknowledge that they did not explicitly examine this issue but hope that this work will stimulate other researchers to design research to understand the institutional actions, criteria, and decision making that affects neglected children from different backgrounds. These authors emphasize that their work is only a first step in an examination of potential differential in consequences. For example, they have included results for their small group of Hispanic neglected children to encourage other researchers to address these issues, at the same time, urging caution in interpreting the findings. Finally, Widom and her colleagues conclude that future work needs to examine potential mediators and moderators of some of these relationships. They argue for more research that utilizes multilevel modeling to better understand the contribution of contextual factors and for the field to consider the role of “extra-individual” factors in understanding the developmental trajectories of neglected children.</p>
<p>There are few interventions that have demonstrated efficacy in reducing mental health symptoms for neglected children. One of the <italic>Lancet</italic> four-part series on child maltreatment examined the effectiveness of programs to prevent child maltreatment. In that article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559513479917">MacMillan et al. (2008</xref>, p. 35) concluded that no intervention has yet been shown to be effective in preventing the recurrence of neglect and that only a few interventions for neglected children show promise in improving behavioral outcomes. Building on this gap in knowledge, Heather Taussig, Sara Culhane, Edward Garrido, Michael Knudtson, and Christie Petrenko asked “Does Severity of Physical Neglect Moderate the Impact of an Efficacious Preventive Intervention for Maltreated Children in Foster Care?” Taussig and colleagues argued that most of the programs that address neglect are family focused and do not typically target the social and emotional needs of school-aged youth who have experienced neglect. Here, Taussig and colleagues examined the extent to which physically neglected youth benefited from the Fostering Healthy Futures program, a mentoring and skills program for preadolescent youth in foster care, which has shown benefits on mental health functioning for other foster care youth. In their work, they confronted one of the challenges of conducting research in the field of child neglect—that is, the common cooccurrence of multiple forms of maltreatment experienced by children. Because they were not able to isolate a group of “neglect only” children, Taussig and colleagues examined whether children with more severe physical neglect would show stronger effects of the intervention. Unfortunately, they did not find evidence that the severity of neglect played a role in the impact of the intervention but speculated on why this might be the case. Clearly, interventions to prevent subsequent negative outcomes for neglected children are needed and more efforts to determine what will work for these children who represent the largest component of the millions of cases of child maltreatment each year.</p>

<title>Controversies and Research Needs</title>
<p>This final part of the introduction calls attention to some of the controversies facing the field and the need for research to address some of the issues raised. For example, because of the heavy overlay of poverty in families where neglected children reside, it is commonly assumed (and argued) that it is the poverty that is driving the negative consequences that appear to be associated with neglect, not the neglect per se. Although there has not been much research that has directly examined this issue, one recent article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559513479917">Nikulina, Widom, &amp; Czaja, 2011</xref>) directly tested the contributions of neglect and childhood poverty in predicting long-term outcomes (academic performance, mental health problems, and criminal behavior). Using multilevel modeling, a prospective cohort design, and outcomes assessed in young adulthood, these researchers found that the three childhood characteristics they examined—neglect, family poverty, and neighborhood poverty—each had different effects on long-term development. Childhood neglect and childhood family poverty were important independent contributors to risk for posttraumatic stress disorder, crime, and academic achievement, whereas childhood neighborhood poverty was not. However, these findings clearly showed that childhood neglect has consequences of its own, distinct from poverty. The message is that these findings demonstrate the important contribution of neglect itself, independent of poverty, and that neglect needs to be better understood.</p>
<p>A second controversy is the debate about whether efforts should be focused on “child maltreatment” in general, to take into account the frequent co-occurrence of different forms of maltreatment, or whether the focus should be on specific types or forms of child maltreatment. Two articles in this special issue dealt with this issue by focusing on the severity of neglect, rather than the experience of child neglect only. I hope that all of the articles in this volume will convince scholars in the field that there is value in focusing on specific types of child maltreatment and particularly on neglect. For years, researchers have focused on sexual or physical abuse and have paid little attention to neglect. By “bundling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2a-1077559513479917">Damashek &amp; Chaffin, 2012</xref>) different types of maltreatment into one construct, we are very likely to miss differences in causes or consequences or even success in treatments or interventions. However, this is an empirical question and one that needs to be tested before assuming that the effects of physical or sexual abuse or neglect of a child will have the same consequences over time.</p>
<p>The focus of the two consortia (Federal Child Neglect Consortium and the TRCNC) has been to stimulate more and high-quality research on child neglect. To a large extent, these efforts have succeeded. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1077559513479917">Figure 1</xref> it is apparent that there was a dramatic increase over time in the simple number of publications on child neglect over the six decades from 1959 to 2009. However, this increase was in the number of articles published in medical, not psychological journals. Is this because researchers in psychology are not interested in neglect or because research on neglect is extremely challenging, unless one is working directly in an environment where children are identified as neglected by trained professionals who can provide this information to researchers?</p>

</fig>
<p>There continues to be a critical need to improve the construct validity of measures to assess neglect and to assess type, chronicity, frequency, and perpetrator identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559513479917">McCrory, De Brito, &amp; Viding, 2010</xref>). There is evidence that some maltreated children go on to experience other forms of maltreatment (revictimization) over the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559513479917">Jonson-Reid, Kohl, &amp; Drake, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559513479917">Widom, Czaja, &amp; Dutton, 2008</xref>). Does it make a difference in child outcomes which form of abuse/neglect occurred first and the age at which the abuse/neglect first occurred? Recent research on the age of onset of abuse/neglect suggests that there are different consequences depending on the age of onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559513479917">Kaplow &amp; Widom, 2007</xref>). However, few longitudinal studies have addressed these questions.</p>
<p>Prospective longitudinal designs are needed, ideally beginning before the birth of the child, to assess the consequences of neglect, while providing an opportunity to adjust for social and individual confounding factors as they occur, and to minimize the reliance on recall and the selection of participants on the basis of the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559513479917">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>). Animal analogue studies are also needed, because they provide an opportunity to systematically examine these relationships and to exert tight control over relevant variables. These studies are needed, despite the fact that questions will always remain about the extent to which findings can be generalized and the extent to which the animal analogue “neglect” studies are representative of neglect in humans.</p>
<p>Despite the progress, many unanswered questions remain about the causes and consequences of neglect and the best ways to prevent neglect or to intervene after it has occurred. Are there similarities or differences in the etiology and consequences of childhood neglect across various cultural and ethnic groups? What are the mechanisms whereby childhood neglect leads to short- and long-term consequences? What other factors account for the fact that not all neglected children manifest negative consequences and, according to some studies, appear resilient? How do subcultural differences in normative standards of child neglect affect consequences for children? Are there gender and race/ethnicity differences in the consequences of childhood neglect and what might explain these differences? Given that much research and clinical practice is based on a person’s (client’s) report of his or her childhood experiences, to what extent does the person’s cognitive appraisal of the child’s experience or experience with the events influence outcomes? To what extent does the long-term impact of childhood neglect depend on characteristics of the community or practices of the community and justice and social service systems in which the child lived at the time of the abuse? Finally, what is the role of “extra-individual” factors in understanding the developmental trajectories of maltreated children? It is not new to call for more rigorous research on risk factors, consequences, and interventions for child neglect. But hopefully, the commitment to such work will endure, and the next decade will provide useful insights into these questions that potentially affect the health and well-being of neglected children.</p>
