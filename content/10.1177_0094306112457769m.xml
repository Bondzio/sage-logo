<p>What does it mean to center “social traces” as necessary and elusive, insistent and fragile components of culture, and of the practice of a contemporary sociology? How do we account for the absent presence of “actors sacrificed in the name of war, landscapes emptied in the name of progress, comfort promised in the name of security, and memories refashioned in the name of unity” (p. 9)? Opening with an explicit challenge to the social analyst who relies on empirical counts and accountings that “invisibilize” social traces, <italic>Toward a Sociology of the Trace</italic> gathers up a methodologically diverse range of essays to press the question: “[H]ow to apprehend disappeared social worlds, subjectivities, and experiences that may be outside of the purview of disciplinary knowledge that relies exclusively on empirical forms of knowing” (p. 6)? Collectively, the essays pursue an analytics of culture and power that can render sensible the real effects of im/material processes of memory, fantasy, and attachment in the making and unmaking of worlds. The aim is a politics of knowledge that can archive the sensuous complexities of a social present that is always temporally, affectively entangled with animate and contested histories. This is a timely, thoughtful volume poised to consolidate some of the accumulated challenges to epistemological business-as-usual in sociology, and point toward alternative futures.</p>
<p>The prologue and introduction by co-editors Herman Gray and Macerena Gómez-Barris offer a provocative, politically-engaged articulation of the book’s intellectual project, and its interdisciplinary indebtedness to cultural studies, feminist and queer thought, critical race studies, and poststructuralism. While the partial failures and productive interruptions of these interdisciplines within U.S. sociology need a tracing that this volume does not attempt, it does elaborate the promise of a social science in sustained, cross-border conversations that “critically address power inequalities foremost” (p. 8). Popular memory (and forgetting) of state violence; national geographies of exclusion and belonging within social categories of “citizenship,” “family,” “terrorism,” racialized “masculinity,” or “Leftist” politics; the subjugated knowledges of the prisoner and other marginalized subjects of the nation—these are some of the analytic through lines developed alongside the theme of the “trace.”</p>
<p>Avery Gordon’s stunning book, <italic>Ghostly Matters: Haunting and the Sociological Imagination</italic> (1997), initially posed many of the challenges taken up by a sociology of the trace; her chapter, “The Prisoner’s Curse,” is the opening contribution in Part I of this volume. The essay conjures the ruinous, potent traces of suicide and social death among “illegal enemy alien combatants” at Guantanamo Bay. The prisoner’s curse—the pronouncement to the not-yet-captured of our own social death, the death that we live, and not only inflict, through the social architectures of our own isolation (pp. 45–47)—performs an intimate kinship between those sentenced to oblivion, and those whose attempts to forget always, fatefully, fail. The trace circulates. Gordon’s essay joins with several others in the volume to theorize nuanced, historical economies of violence. Akiko Naono situates Japan’s “endurance doctrine,” or the legal obligation of Japanese citizens to endure sufferings generated by war, as an ongoing class and colonial project selectively refusing calls for redress by <italic>hibakusha</italic>, or atomic bomb survivors. Macarena Gómez-Barris mobilizes Chilean memory politics of the “other” September 11, the 1973 Chilean military coup backed by the United States and the CIA, to interrupt a hegemonic post-September 11 disavowal of U.S. state terror. Sudarat Musikawong’s essay on political violence in Thailand analyzes public commemoration as a contested site of “social haunting,” where the Thai state struggles to promote national unity, and the radical Left forges a politics of loss that ignore traces of the state’s gendered and sexual violence. Rebecca Scott looks at the contradictory place of Appalachian coal mining culture as a human and environmental “national sacrifice zone,” and the site of a “postcoal economy” where popular memories of violent labor struggle become an extracted resource for tourism and economic development.</p>
<p>Curiously, the book lacks a careful elaboration of what the methodological demands might be for researchers trying to work with social traces that leave “few material and social historical registers.” While citing “inscriptions, traces, the audible, the inaudible, cacophonies, incoherences, assemblages, translations, appearances, and hauntings as methodological necessities” (p. 4), few of the essays engage these empirical borderlands, or their epistemological trickiness. Instead, the authors conduct ethnography and discourse analysis, or analyses of literary, legal or cultural texts, via familiar empirical or interpretive techniques. Tanya McNeill’s chapter on “A Nation of Families” is an exception here, offering a critical conceptualization of “affective epistemologies” that link research findings to normative “feelings” about preserving a white, heteropatriarchal fantasy of the family. Affects of belonging (to family, to nation) operate through social scientific research that naturalizes the racial, class, sexual, and moral effects of neoliberal federal policies. A critical sociology, for McNeill, would have to attend to “the entanglement of affect and reason” that knots knowledge-production to the politics of producing public feelings (p. 79).</p>
<p>If the “trace” turns our attention to cultural forms of meaning-making embedded in attachments, identifications, and senses of (be)longing, then how does the book attach to sociology itself? Is there a kind of “cruel optimism” at work here—that is, a hopeful attachment to an object of desire that at the same time cruelly blocks the realization of that desire (as recently, powerfully theorized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306112457769">Lauren Berlant [2011]</xref> whose work is deployed throughout the volume)? What does it mean to long for a sociology of the trace when an analysis of its undisciplined cultural and temporal dynamics might require relinquishing our attachment to a “sociology of,” and confronting instead the loss, and the possibility, of identifying with more radically post-disciplinary knowledge projects, and scenes of intellectual belonging? The question lingers for those of us re-placed and displaced by sociology’s revivified disciplinings today.</p>
