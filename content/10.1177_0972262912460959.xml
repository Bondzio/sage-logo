<p>This book is about judgement and decision making. This book tries to capture many of the most important contributions in the field of judgement and decision making. The back bone or the supporting evidences for this book are the various researches conducted mainly in the field of psychology and decision making. The heart of this book is systems 1 and 2. The interaction of the two systems 1 and 2 is the main theme of his book. The term ‘Systems 1 and 2’ was originally proposed by Psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West. Systems 1 and 2 are two types of cognitive processes. System 1 is executed quickly with little conscious deliberation and System 2 is slower and more reflective. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912460959">Frederick (2005)</xref> introduced cognitive reflection test (CRT) relating it to systems 1 and 2. He also examined the relation between CRT and decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preferences. Later, this book focuses on two species, Econs and Humans. The differentiating factor between Econs and Humans is that Econs live in the land of theory and Humans act in the real world. Further, in this book, the author also discuses about the two selves, the experiencing self, who does the living and the remembering self, which keeps score and makes the choices.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Daniel Kahneman, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0972262912460959">2002</xref> for his pioneering work, developed with Amos Tversky, on decision making. He is Eugene Higgins Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Princeton University and Emeritus Professor of Public Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.</p>
<p>The methodology adopted by the author is amalgamation of his research work and other researchers mainly in the field of judgement and decision making. This book can be said to be a gist of various research works and publications of Kahneman and other researchers mainly in decision-making area.</p>
<p>This book is divided into five parts. Each part comprises of certain chapters. Part 1 on two systems and Part 2 on heuristics and biases have nine chapters each. Part 3 on overconfidence has six chapters. Part 4 on choices has ten chapters and Part 5 on two selves has four chapters.</p>
<p>Kahneman in this book discusses about acronym (WYSIATI) which stands for what you see is all there is. WYSIATI facilitates in getting the coherence and the cognitive ease that causes us to accept a statement as true. Based on the title of the book think fast and slow, it explains why we can think fast, and how we are able to make sense of partial information in a complex world. In overconfidence, considering WYSIATI rule, he suggests that neither the quantity nor the quality of the evidence counts for much in subjective confidence. Further he discusses the term planning fallacy which was coined by Amos Tversky and him. He discusses planning fallacy and role of inside and outside view in optimistic forecasts. The analysis of planning fallacy builds upon a perceptual metaphor of how people view a planned project. An inside or internal view of a task focuses on singular information: specific aspects of the target task that might lead to longer or shorter completion times. An outside or external view of the task focuses on information: how the current task fits into the set of related tasks.</p>
<p>To explain this term he also uses some practical examples. Kahneman also mentions in this book about Bernoulli’s error and the difference of Bernoulli’s model from prospect theory. Stating about prospect theory he points out that in Bernoulli’s model reference point is missing whereas in prospect theory it is not. This book also mentions about blind spots of prospect theory as this theory describes humans guided by the immediate emotional impact of gains and losses, not by long-term prospects of wealth and global utility.</p>
<p>This book is an interesting and easy read for people who have interest in decision-making area. This book is well-built from both practical and theoretical perspective. This book continues with an examination of empirical and conceptual research done in the field of decision making. This book nicely orchestrates most of the research work by Kahneman and other renowned researchers in the field of decision making.</p>
<p>This book is an update or successor to the earlier influential book by Kahneman published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972262912460959">2002</xref> <italic>Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment</italic>. Earlier book focuses more on the heuristics and biases approach to study judgement under uncertainty. This book besides heuristics and biases captures many of the most important contributions and developments in the field of judgement and decision making till date.</p>
<p>Overall, this book can be metaphorically said to be an umbrella under which erudite contribution of most researchers in the field of judgement and decision making can be found.</p>
