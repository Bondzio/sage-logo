<p><italic>Single Women in Popular Culture</italic> is an exemplary, groundbreaking work within the field of feminist media and cultural studies. It employs feminist cultural criticism critically to address major questions related to the hyper-visible positioning of heterosexual women’s singleness within the terrain of popular culture. The subtle unravelling of key discourses on single women draws from a breadth of academic resources as well as introducing the reader to the newly emerging language of singleness (singularity, singlism, matrimania, singlutionary, etc.). Taylor shows how the presentation of women’s singleness in different media sites (including chick lit novels, reality television, soaps, self-help manuals and blogs) represents a discursive formation of single women as problematic. The representations that she unravels also say something of the traditional, postfeminist, neoliberal and feminist concerns current in western society. Furthermore, this interrogation situates singleness in a broader discussion of feminism’s relationship with the media and as such functions to unpick some of the inherent ideological contradictions as well as opportunities that are available in media culture, feminist discourses and to the audience of single women.</p>
<p>This important work hinges on the assumption that popular media narratives are central to the ways in which identities are constituted and experienced and are, therefore, important for feminists investigating the varied ways in which womanhood is constituted. Taylor addresses the increasing media attention on the subject of single women over the past 20 years as a ‘key nodal point in the increasingly complex interaction between feminism and popular culture’ (p. 33). Her attention to media sources (such as <italic>Ally McBeal, Sex and the City, The Bachelors</italic>, etc.) successfully illuminates how constructions of singleness for women within the media say much about expectations of how women perform their gendered identities. Her argument simply put is this: there is a view that the media celebrate singleness and this is not so. In fact singleness is portrayed as a complex, mostly problematic figure that needs to be made un-single. However the potential for celebrating singleness becomes realized when single women themselves begin to establish a collective community of sharing.</p>
<p>Taylor develops her argument by describing how single women continue to be figures of unease, constructed through varying discourses of denigration (as spinsters) and celebration (as singletons). She contextualizes this uneasy positioning of single women within wider ideological debates on third-wave feminist concerns over the cultural hegemony of heterosexuality. She argues that the heteronormative focus on singleness for women emerges as a strategy to rectify or to undo their singleness and as such is politically troublesome for the feminist project. For instance consumption and singleness interlink capitalism and the feminine project. Here Taylor shows how women pay for various resources to help them enhance their value in the marketplace of relationships. Taylor’s discussion brings together issues of wealth, status, agency and feminism as well as challenging readers to cast a critical eye on their own gendered consumption, and, in doing so, implicitly signals a need to consider the consumption practices of less wealthy single women.</p>
<p>Throughout the text the author hints that the intersectional space that single women occupy has the potential to destabilize heteronormative ideals. These hints, however, sit alongside descriptions of postfeminist discussions that suggest that single women should be made un-single. Fortunately, the author does not stop here but goes on to outline women’s self-liberating initiatives. Taylor provides an analysis of blogging as an important media site where women construct a countercultural space that contests couple culture. She thus disrupts any tendency to see single women as victims of fate, surrendering to neoliberal or postfeminist logics and shows that some women choose to publicize counter-narratives. Taylor’s conclusions stirred and summoned me to see new horizons in feminist practices. Despite the tenacity of neoliberal and postfeminist logics, for example, there is some evidence that when some single women are able to control parts of the media, they can disrupt old scripts.</p>
<p>Whilst this excellent book raises some central questions about the positioning of feminism within current media thinking and wider society, it also raises for me some other very important concerns around diversity. Taylor clearly acknowledges in her definition of singleness (p. 30) that her work focuses on young middle-class, never married, sexually active, without children, heterosexual, White women. The text is peppered throughout with acknowledgements of other types of single women differing by race, age, etc., but, to my mind, this has resulted in a sometimes disjointed, distracting and eclectic inclusion. It would have been useful for Taylor to address the important issue of diversity within the scope of her broader aims in order to situate what she clearly sees is an important area of concern, before moving on. This would have provided a more informative reading of her ‘peppered’ insertions on singleness and diversity since she does clearly acknowledge the limits of her research and cannot be expected to cover all the permutations involved in interrogating any social space.</p>
<p>There is a lot of scope for taking forward a consideration of singleness and diversity. For instance Chapter 5 (‘Self-help and the single girl: From salvation to validation’) considers self-help literature as a regulatory resource functioning to discipline women to embrace postfeminist ideals. Yet, there are notable exceptions. Taylor identifies one counter-narrative in her detailed reference to the work of the self-help writer Jeshua Stewart. For Taylor, Stewart’s work is unique for its focus on singleness as an autonomously chosen, actively permanent way of being. According to Taylor, Stewart’s text <italic>The Single Girl’s Manifesta (sic); Living in a Stupendously Superior Single State of Mind</italic> (2005) does not undo singleness but encourages readers to make the most of their single status. There is, however, a crucial contradiction that Taylor does not address. Although Taylor does note that Stewart also buys into neoliberal postfeminist logics through a working assumption that single women are financially independent, she has not analysed as data those sites which espouse postfeminist logics that normalize heterosexual coupling. Stewart presents online discussions on how to secure heterosexual relationships, how to be sexually involved with men and what not to do when on a date. What is also interesting for me as a Black reader is the way that Stewart’s African American identity is noted by Taylor and, although briefly contrasted with another African American author, is simply treated as an example of counter-postfeminism and a platform for introducing the feminist blogging activities that constitute the focus in the chapter that follows. Although to all intents and purposes Taylor’s argument seems credible, her discussion raised a number of issues for me. It would, for example, be useful for me to know something about Stewart’s public discussion of singleness over a specified time period. I would want to ‘see’ her through an ethnicized, gendered lens in spite of Taylor’s view that Stewart does ‘not foreground the way racial difference can delimit how women’s singleness is lived and interpreted’ (p. 174). In the absence of such discussions, the chapter touches on a complex and interesting terrain, but does not capture the shifting, fluid and contradictory nature of Stewart’s work in the media sphere. There would seem to be an opportunity for future investigations to take an intersectional view of authors’ and media presenters’ identities as well as their changing and/or contradictory and complex promotion of singleness.</p>
<p>The final chapter (‘Blogging solo: Women refiguring singleness’) provides an inspiring glimpse into how women utilize the media to construct and promote their personal narratives. It is a strong finale to a well-informed critical journey. One important underlying theme running throughout the book is the positioning of singleness by outsiders. Taylor uses her final chapter to invert this theme by focusing on single women’s blogs. She argues that many women are actively re-crafting their single identities as an aspect of popular feminism. Taylor presents evidence that single women are ‘blogging solo’ as a vibrant defiant opposition to postfeminism and as such creating a space that draws on a ‘series of assumptions, and often specialist discourses consistent with feminism’ (p. 180). Taylor’s conclusions are a judicious and credible rebuke to those voices that continue to disparage critical feminist legacies and presence in western societies.</p>
