<abstract>
<p>Effect of potassium titanate whiskers on the mechanical and tribological properties of glass/epoxy composite systems has been investigated experimentally. Composite laminates were prepared by hand lay-up technique followed by vacuum bagging by varying the percentage of potassium titanate whiskers addition. Mechanical properties of the developed composites were evaluated as per ASTM standards. Tribological tests were conducted under dry sliding conditions on a pin on disc test rig. The tests results indicated that addition of the potassium titanate whiskers has significant effect on the properties of glass/epoxy composites. Density, hardness, stiffness properties, friction coefficient and wear resistance of the composites were found to improve with the potassium titanate whiskers loading. However, strength properties of the glass epoxy composites were found to reduce with whisker content. The mode of failure after the tensile tests and worn surface of some selected samples were studied using scanning electron microscope.</p>

<p>A common processing route followed in the polymer industry is to fabricate the multiphase composites by using various fibers and fillers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413485827">1</xref></sup> By incorporating the supplementary reinforcement such as particulates, whiskers or micro-fibers in to the matrix resin before the impregnation with the traditional fibers such as glass, carbon and aramid, synergistic effect may be achieved in terms of improvement in mechanical, thermal and tribological properties. Among the numerous inorganic fillers, a multi-component ceramic namely, potassium titanate whiskers (PTW, K<sub>2</sub>O·6TiO<sub>2</sub>) have been widely used as a promising reinforcement filler in polymer composites. PTW have several advantages such as excellent mechanical, thermal and chemical properties. One most desirable feature is the low production cost of the PTW itself. This has become a critical factor for commercial application of PTW in composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413485827">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hybridization effect of PTW with the other fibers and particulates in polymer composites has been established by several researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413485827">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413485827"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413485827"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485827"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413485827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413485827">8</xref></sup> Wu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413485827">3</xref></sup> revealed that combined micrometer-sized ceramic fiber and nanometer-sized PTW in automotive brake linings had higher impact strength, friction stability, thermal stability and wear resistance than those with only one type of fiber. Long et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413485827">4</xref></sup> effectively improved the mechanical properties of PP composites by the addition of both ramier fiber (20 wt%) and PTW (10 wt%) after they are properly surface treated. They concluded that among the three surface modifiers, silane coupling agent was relatively good option for surface treatment of the reinforcements. Xie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413485827">5</xref></sup> incorporated PTW (up to 16 wt%) into polyether ether ketone (PEEK)/ polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) composites and observed that both friction coefficient and wear rate decreased with the increase of PTW content. An interesting wear mechanism reported was that embedding of the worn out free whiskers back into composite surface during subsequent sliding on pin-on-disc machine which enhanced the wear resistance. Xie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485827">6</xref></sup> discussed that reinforcement of PTW on PEEK could reduce the stress concentration on the carbon fiber and PEEK matrix interface and thereby reduce the fiber damage/failure. They also mentioned that PTW acted to protect the matrix from fatigue failure during the water lubricated sliding conditions. Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413485827">7</xref></sup> fabricated hybrid phenolic composites based on PTW and aramid fibers and tested for fade and recovery performance. They found that absolute friction effectiveness remained higher in the composites with ≥25 wt% of PTW. Improved performance of PTW-filled polymer composites as a non-metallic friction material has been demonstrated by many researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413485827">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413485827"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413485827">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Literature survey revealed that there are no data available till date on the effect of PTW on glass/epoxy composites. Hence this work aims at studying the outcome of PTW reinforcement on the mechanical and tribological properties of glass/epoxy composites.</p>

<p>Epoxy adhesive resin (LY556) and amino-based hardener (HY951) was supplied by Huntsman Advanced Materials (I) Pvt. Ltd., Bengaluru, India. Bidirectional plain weave E-glass fiber mat of aerial density 212 g/m<sup>2</sup> was obtained from Arun fabrics Bengaluru, India. PTW fillers were purchased from Hangzhou Dayangchem Co. Ltd., Hong Kong, China. Both the glass fibers and the PTW were used as received with no surface modifications for preparing the composites. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of these whiskers is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413485827">Figure 1</xref>. The selected properties (data from the supplier) of these ceramic whiskers are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413485827">Table 1</xref>. These whiskers have tunnel or layered crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413485827">Figure 2</xref>) which are constructed of TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra sharing edges with interlaying cations. Because potassium ions are enclosed and isolated from the environment, they cannot escape from the tunneling structure and decompose the resin material during fabrication. Thus tunneling structure makes these whiskers stable in terms of both chemical and physical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413485827">2</xref></sup>

<p>Initially PTW fillers were pre-dried at 80℃ in a hot air oven for 2 h to remove any moisture present. Then weighed amount of whiskers were slowly introduced into epoxy resin with constant stirring using disc type mechanical stirrer. Hardener (1 part for 10 parts of epoxy) was added to the epoxy whisker mixture as recommended by the manufacturer. This matrix system was then impregnated on 12 plies of glass fabrics in sequence to obtain the desired thickness of composite plates. Entire hand layup was done on a tool plate coated with the wax as a release agent. Then the layup was covered with perforated peel ply, breather cloth and plastic bag. A vacuum level of 600–640 Hg-mm was performed on the layup for 2 h and is allowed to cure at room temperature for 24 h. Post curing of the composite plates was done at 100℃ for 2 h in a hot air oven. Composite laminates so prepared had a dimension of 250 × 250 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup>. The weight percentage of fiber was kept constant at 50% and different laminates were prepared by varying the percentage of PTW fillers. Glass/epoxy composites with this vacuum bagging technology without the whisker was also fabricated for comparison purpose. Composite test coupons for detailed characterization of properties were prepared using the diamond tipped cutter. A schematic illustration of the layup for the composite fabrication is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413485827">Figure 3</xref>.

<p>All mechanical tests were conducted at ambient conditions and as per ASTM standards. Densities of the composites were determined using simple water immersion technique as per standard ASTM: D 792-08. Hardness was observed on M scale using Rockwell hardness tester as per ASTM: D 785-08. Tensile and flexural testing was carried out as per standards ASTM: D 3039-08 and ASTM: D 790-10 respectively at a cross head speed of 2 mm/min and gage length of 50 mm on an Instron machine (JJ Lloyd, London, UK, 1–20 kN). Impact testing was performed on pendulum type Izod machine (Ceast, 25 J maximum) using un-notched specimen as per ASTM: D 256-10.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0731684413485827"><title>Tribological properties</title>
<p>The friction and wear behavior of unfilled and PTW-filled glass/epoxy composites were evaluated on pin on disc machine (Model TR-20 E-PHM-400, DUCOM Bengaluru, India) under dry sliding conditions as per standard ASTM: G 99-05. Wear test samples of 10 × 10 × 3 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413485827">3</xref></sup> was glued to the steel pins and held against the rotating steel disc. Prior to the tests, the composite test surface was successively polished against 400, 600 and 800 grade waterproof abrasive papers and then cleaned with the acetone. The surface roughness of the composite specimen was observed to be 0.4–0.7 µm Ra (Surftest, SJ-301, Mitutoyo Japan make). Steel disc (Diameter 165 mm, thickness 8 mm, material EN31 hardened to 60 HRc, ground to 1.6 µm Ra) surface was also polished with abrasive cloth and cleaned with acetone before each test. Sliding tests were performed under ambient conditions for constant sliding distance of 4.2 km on wear track diameter 120 mm. Normal load considered was 30, 60 and 90 N, and sliding velocity considered was 2.5, 5 and 7.5 m/s, respectively. At the end of each test, worn surface of the test pin was cleaned with acetone to remove any wear debris and dried, then weight loss of the samples were measured using the digital weighing scale (Shimadzu Japan, AY220, 0.1 mg accuracy). One weight loss value reported was an average of two to four samples. Volume loss of the material was determined from the weight loss using the density data of the developed composites. Specific wear rate was then determined as

<sec id="sec9-0731684413485827"><title>Density and hardness</title>
<p>It was observed that PTW show a marginal effect on the density and hardness of the glass/epoxy composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413485827">Figure 4</xref>). Both density and hardness showed an increasing pattern with the PTW content. Inclusion of PTW increase the micro-packing of the fibers in the cured epoxy resin and shows effective synergism. Improvement in the hardness is believed to improve the tribological properties of the composites.

<sec id="sec10-0731684413485827"><title>Tensile properties</title>
<p>Tensile properties of the composite samples are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413485827">Table 3</xref>. It can be seen that tensile strength of the glass/epoxy composites gradually decreases with the increase in the PTW content. A maximum reduction of nearly 11% in the tensile strength is observed in case of EG7.5 composites. These whiskers which are in splinter shape have sharp corner points as observed under SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413485827">Figure 1</xref>) and these act as stress raisers in the epoxy matrix. This leads to the easy propagation of the cracks in the matrix material under tensile loading conditions. Due to this stress raising effect of the whiskers, early failure of the matrix takes place which contributes to the reduction in the tensile strength of the composites. However, being high modulus filler, PTW enhanced the tensile modulus of the base composites. In case of EG7.5 composites, one can see an increase in the tensile modulus of 26% from 4.90 GPa to 6.19 GPa for the hybrid composites. It follows from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413485827">Table 3</xref> that, unfilled glass/epoxy samples represents large plastic deformation with the high strain to break. However, EG7.5 composites behaved in a brittle manner and failed in advance. The presence of PTW as a rigid filler constrained the epoxy matrix and prevented the plastic deformation in the hybrid composites.

<sec id="sec11-0731684413485827"><title>Flexural properties</title>
<p>The trend reported in the flexural properties with the whisker content is in line with tensile properties of the composite specimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413485827">Table 3</xref>). The EG7.5 composites exhibited a lower flexural strength and a higher flexural modulus which is around 14% and 16% respectively when compared to EG0 composites. The ratio of the strengths of the composites in tension and flexure are also widely studied. Bullock<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413485827">11</xref></sup> reported that ultimate flexural strengths (<italic>σ<sub>uf</sub></italic>) are 1.37–1.49 times of ultimate tensile strengths (<italic>σ<sub>ut</sub></italic>) of respective samples. Shivmurthy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413485827">12</xref></sup> studied the effect of graphite on glass/epoxy composites and observed strength ratio 1.07–1.12. The difference in the kind of stresses developed in the composite material during loading will usually make this strength ratio to lie above 1. In flexural loading conditions, the compressive stresses developed in the material tend to close the cracks and flaws, opposite to the crack opening mechanism occurring in the tensile strength situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413485827">13</xref></sup> Hence flexural strengths usually will be greater than tensile strengths of corresponding samples. In the present case, flexural strengths are observed to be 1.10–1.15 times of tensile strengths of the composites when the PTW content was varied from 0 to 7.5 wt% in glass/epoxy composites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0731684413485827"><title>Impact strength</title>
<p>As tensile and flexural strengths, the impact strengths of the PTW-filled glass/epoxy composites also showed declining trend with the PTW content. The EG7.5 composites showed an impact strength which is 18% lesser than that of EG0 composites. Thus PTW being high aspect ratio filler reduced the ability of the glass/epoxy composites to restrain the impact type of load. It is also a general observation, which is reported in the literatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413485827">14</xref></sup> that ceramic fillers usually will not improve the impact strengths of the polymers. Thus the mechanical test results showed that PTW fillers have modified the properties of glass/epoxy composites under different loading conditions. The variations observed in the overall mechanical properties are consistent with the results reported in case of glass/epoxy composites with different ceramic fillers.

These SEM pictures show a variety of different features in different locations. The micrographs reveal the fracture with instant multiple fracture mechanisms. The three important micromechanical level failure mechanisms namely (i) matrix plastic deformation, (ii) fiber breaking and (iii) interface debonding (between fiber and matrix), which are very common in fiber-reinforced composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413485827">18</xref></sup> are also witnessed in the current study. The SEM picture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413485827">Figure 5(a)</xref> clearly illustrates the resin rich area which is unusual fracture morphology observed in the current work. Plastic deformation of the epoxy matrix (river line markings indicated as ‘A’) and fiber matrix debonding (marked as ‘B’) can be observed in case of EG0 specimen.

Note that some attached matrix is still remaining on the long, protruding fibers which indicate the affinity of the binder resin to adhere to the fibers even after fracture. All fibers will not fail at same particular length in the tensile loading direction. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413485827">Figure 5(c)</xref> indicates the failure of the fibers at different lengths. A clean cut on many fibers fractured surface observed at higher magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413485827">Figure 5(d)</xref>) is an indication of brittle failure of the material. Some traces of fiber matrix debonding and fiber pull out can be observed in case of EG7.5 composites. Interface bonding between PTW-filled matrix and glass fibers is not strong as many traces of fiber pull out (marked as ‘D’) can be observed. This may be due to lack of binding resin at the higher filler content. Greater levels of filler loading increase the viscosity of the resin and reduce the wetting of the laminate. Note that the fibers fail at angles to the fracture surface that range from almost perpendicular to very oblique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413485827">Figure 5(b) to (d)</xref>). It is clear that PTW has not shown any considerable effect on the fracture surface morphology.

<p>With regard to the sliding of the polymers against the metallic counterface, friction component resulting from the adhesion equals the product of the real contact area and the shear stress of the softer material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413485827">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413485827">19</xref></sup> It is said that inorganic fillers always increase the abrasive force during the sliding process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413485827">20</xref></sup> Thus PTW fillers have a tendency to contribute to the fricton during the sliding. In the present study it was observed that inclusion of the PTW has improved the elastic modulus of the hybrid composites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413485827">Table 3</xref>). As a result, the real contact area between the composite and the counter disc drops, and this will result in reduced COF. These two competitive effects will determine the final COF of the hybrid composites at any point of time.</p>
<p>In the present investigation, COF values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413485827">Table 4</xref>) in case of EG2.5 composites are found to be lesser than that of EG0 composites, since the reduction in the real contact area is dominant. However, when the PTW content is further increased, the abrasive effect of the ceramic fillers seems to take over and enhance the COF. Such increasing trend in the COF values for the increase in the sliding velocity (2–5 m/s) for constant load in case of SiC modified glass/epoxy composites are presented in Suresha et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485827">17</xref></sup> However, Kishore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413485827">21</xref></sup> have reported a decreasing trend in the COF values when rubber and graphite were used as filler for glass/epoxy composites. This is mainly because the soft fillers such rubber and graphite provide lubricating effect during sliding in opposite to the abrasive effect of ceramic fillers such as SiC and PTW.</p>
<p>It is believed that rolling effect of ceramic particles that act as third body at the interface during the sliding causes the frictional force to decrease. However, rolling friction could not be the mechanism in the present case, as the PTW because of its shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413485827">Figure 1</xref>) has less tendency to roll between the contact surfaces. This contributes to enhance the COF values. One interesting observation made from the current study is that, variation in the COF narrowed down with the increase in the PTW content. The EG7.5 composites exhibited the minimum variation in the COF for the test conditions considered in the study. In other words, a stable COF (0.43–0.45) is observed in case of EG7.5 composites. This might be due to the relative balance between the two competitive effects explained earlier.</p>

<sec id="sec15-0731684413485827"><title>Specific wear rate (W<sub>s</sub>)</title>
<p>The specific wear rates of composites with the applied load and speed are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413485827">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413485827">7</xref>, respectively. It can be seen that compared to EG0 composites, PTW-filled composites showed superior wear resistance with the increase in the normal load and sliding velocity. Specific wear rates were found to decrease with the whisker content and EG7.5 composites exhibited the minimum wear rate among the all other composites. Thus increase in the whisker content had a beneficiary effect on the wear performance of the glass/epoxy composites. These results indicate that combination of PTW and glass fibers resulted in a change in the wear process and improvement in the wear resistance property of the hybrid composites.

<p>A schematic illustration of the possible mechanisms under dry sliding of hybrid composites is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413485827">Figure 8</xref>. Initially the epoxy matrix was ground off and the fiber and whisker were exposed to the counterface. Under the direct contact of the two sliding surfaces, the stresses were transferred from the matrix to the whisker, and thus stress concentration on fibers were greatly reduced due to the presence of the whiskers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485827">6</xref></sup> The direct scrapping of the steel disc with the glass fibers was abated by the protruded PTW and glass fibers were guarded against easy damage and removal. It is likely that exposed whiskers share the portion of the load applied at the interface and the existences of the whiskers around the glass fibers also prevent the abrasive action between the fiber and the counterface during subsequent sliding process. This results in less wear rate of the whisker-filled composite materials. This description is also supported by SEM pictures and will be discussed in the next section.

</fig></p>
<p>It is generally accepted that surface temperature plays an important role in the friction and wear of polymers and its composites and increases at higher loads and speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413485827">22</xref></sup> In the present work also serious heating was observed on the disc surface after wear tests at highest sliding conditions. Wieleba<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413485827">23</xref></sup> through his thermo-vision investigations demonstrated that temperature increases not only on the contact surface of the sliding materials, but also inside the polymer material while PTFE composites were sliding against the steel under dry friction conditions. The lowest amount of wear rate in EG7.5 samples in spite of the high disc temperature may be attributed to the higher PTW content that help in arresting the wear rate because of their excellent thermo-mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413485827">2</xref></sup> Note that the specific wear rate in EG7.5 composites for extreme test condition is found to be only 0.993364 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/Nm, which is reduction of nearly 42% compared to that of EG0 composites.</p>
<p>The friction-induced thermal and mechanical effects results in softening and plastic deformation of the filled epoxy matrix and thereby formation of the thin transfer film on the counterface. Bahadur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413485827">24</xref></sup> revealed that when polymers are modified by fillers, the transfer film formed will greatly influence the tribological behavior. He concluded that wear depends upon the cohesion of transfer film, adhesion of transfer film to the counterface, and the protection of rubbing polymer surface from metal asperities by transfer film. Suresha et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485827">17</xref></sup> and Kishore et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413485827">21</xref></sup> have also indicated that thin film formation tendency of the ceramic filler is the dominant mechanism for improvement in the wear performance of filled glass/epoxy composites. In the present study, PTW particles in composites could have played a positive role in maintaining the transfer layer for a longer period and hence improvement in wear resistance property of the filled composites is observed. The smooth variation in the COF in case of EG7.5 composites is a good indication of friction film stabilization. Being low hardness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413485827">Table 1</xref>) filler, PTW is expected to be less aggressive against the steel disc. Also these whiskers provide a polishing effect on the counterface during sliding due to their mild abrasive behavior. This twin effect of maintaining the transfer film and polishing the counter disc have greatly improved the wear properties of the hybrid composites.</p>
<p>Increase in the sliding speed for given load and distance resulted in increase of the wear rate for all material combinations as expected. However, a decrease in the wear rate with the increase in normal load for given speed and distance is observed in case of all tested specimen. This trend can explain the load-bearing capacity of PTW particles at higher loads. Decrease in the specific wear rate with normal load is also reported by other researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413485827">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413485827">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413485827">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413485827">26</xref></sup> It is reasonable to expect that a higher weight fraction of PTW in epoxy/glass composites might further improve the tribological properties of hybrid composites. Inclusion of PTW beyond 7.5 wt% was not possible under the normal processing conditions as the viscosity of the resin was found to increase drastically at higher filler content and coating on the glass fiber was difficult.</p>

From the SEM pictures presented it is possible to highlight the effect of PTW content on the wear surface features. Debonding and breakage of the glass fibers are observed in EG0 samples. However, glass fibers are well protected in EG7.5 samples indicating the improved wear performance of the composites. Evidences of fiber breakage (marked as ‘L’), some imprints left over after the fiber removal (marked as ‘M’) can be observed in case of EG0 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413485827">Figure 9(a)</xref>). The process of wear of epoxy matrix might have contributed in dislodging these glass fibers. Some evidences of matrix debris spread over the long fibers can be witnessed in EG0 composites. Fiber thinning effect (marked as ‘N’) in the direction of sliding which is associated with the frictional drag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413485827">27</xref></sup> is also observed as a worn out surface feature. Some of these features are also observed in other samples such as EG2.5 and EG5 and are highlighted in SEM pictures. Scattered matrix debris can be observed in SEM pictures of all samples. An inclined type of fracture at some fiber ends can be clearly observed in case of EG0 and EG2.5 samples. With the inclusion of the PTW, less damage of the fibers can be seen and in EG7.5 samples, fibers are less distinctly seen. This indicates the wear resistance property of the EG7.5 composites. These observations corroborate well with the specific wear data presented in the previous section. The fractography of EG5.0 sample exhibits less damage and retention of the long fibers compared to that of EG2.5 samples. This obviously indicates the positive effect of loading PTW contents on wear performance of glass/epoxy composites.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413485827">Figure 9(d)</xref> reveals the masking of the fibers due to the fact that whiskers have come out of the resin during sliding and acted to protect the glass fibers. Breakage of fibers is hardly noticed, less matrix wear in addition. It implies that the PTW proportion was able to reduce the wear of glass/epoxy composites. During testing, entire steel surface was covered with the transfer film and thus hard asperities were away from the composite surface. This transfer film reduced the chances of abrasion of the composite surface during the sliding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413485827">28</xref></sup> As the whiskers were able to take up some portion of the load during sliding, it prevented severe adhesion of the epoxy matrix with counter surface. In the absence of the severe adhesion, the surface fracture was significantly reduced in case of EG7.5 samples and wear properties were found to improve. Thus a smooth worn surface and lower wear rate was observed in case of EG7.5 composites. These observations made in case of EG7.5 composites correspond to experimental findings. Once the whiskers were peeled off from the matrix during sliding, the glass fibers acted to support the remaining epoxy matrix and the loosened whiskers effectively could protect the composite from aggressive counter disk. The complementary role of glass fibers and heat-resistant ceramic whiskers (PTW) could maintain the smooth and durable friction film and reduce the wear rate. The stable COF observed in case of EG7.5 composites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731684413485827">Table 4</xref>) further supports this argument. Thus the synergistic effect of both fiber and the whiskers acted to improve the tribological performance of the composites.</p>
<p>The wear debris formed during sliding interacts with counter surface and also with one another and results in still finer debris. The formation of the finer debris is further facilitated by the increased content of PTW in EG7.5 composites at high load (90 N). High contact stresses developed at high loads have a tendency to break the larger debris. These mechanisms further develop debris on very fine scale. The presence of this wear debris on the test specimen results in surface charging during observations under SEM. This effect is clear in EG7.5 specimen, where loose debris on the worn surface appears as bright spots as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413485827">Figure 9(d)</xref>. The morphological observations made in the present study agree well with that reported in case of ceramic filler modified glass/epoxy composite systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413485827">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413485827">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413485827">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413485827">28</xref></sup></p>
