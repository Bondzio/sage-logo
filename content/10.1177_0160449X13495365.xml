<p>Virginia Doellgast’s <italic>Disintegrating Democracy at Work: Labor Unions and the Future of Good Jobs in the Service Economy</italic> provides a valuable contribution to the field of comparative industrial relations. The book examines the role of unions within modern service workplaces by delving into case study analyses of the telecommunications and call center industries.</p>
<p>Doellgast utilizes solid research methods with closely matched pairs of firms in each industry from both the United States and Germany. She conducted over 300 interviews with managerial employees, union officials, works councils leaders, and frontline workers along with archival analysis to develop her cases. The result is a highly detailed narrative of the changes within these industries and their industrial relations systems and a close look at the workplace practices of the firms in the study.</p>
<p><italic>Disintegrating Democracy</italic> offers an excellent comparison of the U.S. and German political economies and explains the U.S. as a liberal market economy and Germany as a coordinated market economy. Doellgast addresses the key debate within comparative industrial relations, dating all the way back to the 1950s, when industrial relations expert John Dunlop first examined whether industrial relations systems are converging or diverging in nations around the world. This debate has desperately needed rekindling, as the pace of globalization only increases in the 21st century. Doellgast does a superb job of identifying the common contexts within the industries and the unique aspects of the U.S. and German industrial relations systems and how they lead to different employment outcomes.</p>
<p>The book also discusses the regulatory changes, technological innovations, and corporate restructuring that has dramatically altered telecommunications and call center work. The most significant change is the liberalization of markets in both nations, which has led to outsourcing and subsequently a decline in unionization, working conditions, and pay for workers. Doellgast explains how subcontracting has proven problematic for call center workers in both the U.S. and Germany, as employers use the threat of outsourcing to diminish standards for employees. While subcontractors in both countries had the lowest outcomes for workers, German telecommunications and call centers workers overall have fared better than workers in the U.S., primarily because of higher rates of unionization, representation by works councils, and more protective labor laws.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, Doellgast supplements her case studies with survey data from the Global Call Center Project. This allows her to expand her analysis to seven other European nations and Canada. Denmark had the best outcomes for workers, with less inequality and more high-involvement work practices, due to high union density and solidaristic wage structures (p. 202). France also had good outcomes for workers because of formal extension policies upheld by the government that extend collective bargaining agreements in a sector to nonunion workers. All of this well-conducted research leads to the central finding of the book: collective bargaining and institutional supports are critical in determining whether employers pursue a “high road” that includes not only greater employee compensation and better working conditions but also the adoption of high-involvement employment systems.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book for those interested in comparative industrial relations and for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the telecommunications industry and/or U.S. and German employment systems. The case study analysis is somewhat intense and detailed, but Doellgast’s theoretical framework and discussion of the findings offer an engaging read for students, scholars, and practitioners.</p>
