<abstract>
<p>This paper is about love of one’s neighbour near and far given humanity’s division into nations. The primary dialogue partner is Peter Singer and his preference utilitarian approach to moral reasoning wherein the challenge is to count the welfare of individuals impartially, regardless—or, at least, with far less regard than is often given—of divisions into nation-states. The claim is made that, despite the considerable and proper challenges from Singer and other so-called new cosmopolitans, it remains possible and, indeed, necessary at the present time for Christian people to work with an account of nation and nationhood as permitted within divine providence. This claim is cast in terms of traditional Christian teaching about the order of love (L. <italic>ordo amoris</italic>).</p>

<body>
<p>In May 2011, the MacDonald Centre for Theology, Ethics and Public Life at the University of Oxford held a conference entitled <italic>Christian Ethics Engages Peter Singer</italic>. The conference prospectus suggested two goals: a charitable exchange between perspectives that are usually at odds, and the articulation of shared commitments to practical and pastoral ethics. There are many and good reasons why Christian people object to Singer’s preference utilitarianism. Yet, as the conference made plain, there is also a shared concern for those who suffer. Christian people and Singer disagree about much but do not disagree that the cry of the suffering has ethical meaning. A cry is what the Jewish scholar Peter Ochs calls an <italic>indexical sign</italic> according to which we know the world and assess how to act in it: ‘Suffering is that which gives reason to cry out or see that something is amiss.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812444684">1</xref></sup> This paper is an attempt to respond to some questions that arose at the conference about whether and/or how limits (or the absence of limits) to the obligation in Singer’s consequentialism to minimise suffering map against Christian interpretations of the evangelical command to love God and one’s neighbour near and far.</p>
<sec id="section1-0953946812444684">
<title>Humanity in its Division into Nations</title>
<p>More specifically, this paper is about how to love one’s neighbour near and far given humanity’s division into nations; how to conceive theologically of humanity in its division into nations and/or nation-states, and how to get our loves ordered rightly given this <italic>de facto</italic> reality. At issue is the extent to which the priority of our created, common humanity over humanly constructed divisions into nation-states and the cries of neighbours far away requires Christian people to downplay the ethical significance of the nation-state and opt instead for a new form of cosmopolitanism. Singer’s preference utilitarianism cuts across partiality based on culture, history and co-nationality, and requires at least the attempt to regard the suffering of all as equally worthy of relief.</p>
<p>Some of Singer’s most moving descriptions of this type of cosmopolitanism are found in the book in which he tells the life-story of his maternal grandfather David Oppenheim. Born a Jew in Bruenn, now Brno in the Czech Republic, Oppenheim fought in the First World War for the Kaiser, worked as a school-master in Vienna, and died in the concentration camp at Theresienstadt. In reflections at the close of this book, Singer writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Though the world will remain divided into nation-states for the foreseeable future, the development of a global community at many different levels is beginning to make it possible to think in terms of universal human values and the more open, cosmopolitan world that David always favoured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812444684">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His plea is for renewed appreciation of the humane, non-sectarian, non-nationalistic, universal values that were embodied in the greatest writers of ancient and modern times. Having recounted what national partiality and its perversion did to his grandparents, Singer looks for a way of thinking in which the whole world rather than nation-states is the starting point for moral reasoning. He seeks an approach to moral reasoning wherein the challenge is to count the welfare of individuals impartially, regardless—or, at least, with far less regard than is often given—of whether they live nearby or at a distance; what matters more than the ordering of loves according to traditional Christian teaching is to produce the best consequences for the largest number of people.</p>
<p>Mindful of this challenge, the bulk of this paper is given by three sets of issues associated with nation, nationality and the ordering of love:</p>
<list id="list1-0953946812444684" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>whether the nation may be considered by Christian people as a quasi-family or whether Christian people should resist extension of the ‘order of love’ in Aquinas’s <italic>Summa Theologia</italic> II-II, q. 26, for instance, to include political community and co-nationality as a kinship-type of affinity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether Christian people should prefer something like the neo-Kantian principle of proximity as the basis of political community;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>whether, if proximity is preferred as a basis of political community, then whether and/or how to address the so-called new cosmopolitan challenge to count the welfare of individuals impartially regardless of co-citizenship.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Underlying these issues is the ethico-political question of whether the very nature of the post-Westphalian democratic nation-state system makes it unfeasibly difficult to love one’s neighbour and especially one’s distant neighbour appropriately—when globalisation means that every citizen of the world is for the believer the man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (Lk. 10:25-37). My response in this paper is that, despite the considerable and proper challenges from Singer and other so-called new cosmopolitans, it remains possible and, indeed, necessary at the present time for Christian people to work with an account of nation and nationhood as permitted within divine providence. This claim is cast in terms of traditional Christian teaching about the order of love (L. <italic>ordo amoris</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946812444684">
<title>In Christ there is No East nor West</title>
<p>This is not an easy claim to maintain. Nor should it be. A challenge throughout this paper is not to relinquish the paradox of blessing and judgement that runs throughout biblical teaching with respect to the nations. The scattering of humankind into peoples with discrete languages and in confusion over the face of the earth (Gen. 11:8-9) was a punishment for sin. Christian people should never neglect the witness of scripture and tradition that the destiny of all peoples in Christ is supranational and beyond all earthly distinctions. A hymn by John Oxenham that many of my generation sang at school assemblies proclaims:
<disp-quote>
<p>In Christ there is no east nor west</p>
<p>In Him no south or north</p>
<p>But one great fellowship of love</p>
<p>Throughout the whole wide earth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812444684">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This hymn emphasises the inclusiveness and universal scope of the gospel and urges believers to ‘join hands…whate’er your race may be’. Whereas the ethnic community of Judaism called upon Abraham as its father (Matt. 3:9; Lk. 3:8), the church is universal in that it has but one body (1 Cor. 12:12) and is one people (1 Pet. 2:9). So:
<disp-quote>
<p>Who serves my Father as His child</p>
<p>Is surely kin to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such doctrinal affirmations are pivotal in Christian thinking about nations and nationhood. They demand profound indifference at deep spiritual and existential, theological and philosophical levels to the national context(s) into which one is born. Nothing matters more than the orientation of all people and peoples to Christ; the church views the world and all its societies in light of their common destiny in Christ. Yet the eschatological nature of this hope is no reason to downplay present-day questions about Christian attitudes to the democratic nation-state system and whether it facilitates or hinders love of neighbour near and far.</p>
<p>The scope of the paper is limited. I do not consider questions of when a people or nation should be recognised by the international political community as a nation-state. Nor do I get as far as unpacking what might bind a people together in terms of ‘common objects of love’ and shared acknowledgement of the right.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812444684">4</xref></sup> Much more could be said about expressions of love as <italic>caritas</italic> and <italic>cupiditas</italic> and how human love is always at risk of distortion and destructivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812444684">5</xref></sup> I am intensely mindful also that the claim to be advanced about the permissibility of the nation and/or nation-state within divine providence cannot be allowed to rest without attention to why love of one’s nation or homeland should never become a good-in-itself or final end, and why the distinction in Christian tradition between use and enjoyment (L. <italic>uti</italic> and <italic>frui</italic>) with respect to human objects of love remains of vital importance in protecting against love of one’s nation or homeland ever becoming a final end rather than something that enables a person to find joy in the supreme good, which is God. For present purposes, however, the paper is confined to discussion of how Christian people today might think about humanity in its division into nations.</p>
<p>I work broadly within the stream of Western tradition that runs from Augustine to Karl Barth and beyond wherein the existence of the nations is regarded as within a disposition of divine blessing but only in conjunction with work of divine wrath (Gen. 11:1-9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812444684">6</xref></sup> I draw in particular upon Barth’s account of ‘Near and Distant’ neighbours in <italic>Church Dogmatics</italic> III.4, §54 and assume that the plurality of nations, and history of humanity as a world of nations, is not part of salvation history until Genesis 10:
<disp-quote>
<p>the indisputable intention of Genesis 10 is to give an account of the development of the descendants of Noah into a manifold world of nations as divinely ordered for the humanity reconstituted by the deliverance of Noah. This takes place under the sign of the covenant established between God and Noah in Genesis 9:8f.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812444684">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The separation of humanity into peoples and nations is within divine providence ‘as undoubtedly a work of divine wrath, even if with an undertone of grace’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812444684">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, the eschatological vision for the nations of the earth is one of judgment when all peoples and nations will be summoned before the throne of God at the end of time (Ps. 96:10-13; Isa. 2:4; Isa. 25:6; Jer. 25:9; Zech. 8:22; Mic. 4:3). All the peoples, multitudes, tribes, nations and languages of the earth will witness the adulation of the Lamb before the throne of heaven (Rev. 1:7; 17:5).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Look! He is coming with the clouds;</p>
<p>every eye will see him,</p>
<p>even those who pierced him;</p>
<p>and on his account all the tribes (Gr. <italic>phylē</italic>) of the earth will wail.</p>
<p>So it is to be. Amen. (Rev. 1:7)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812444684">9</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This witness to the end times includes reference to the ‘glory’ (Gr. <italic>doxa</italic>) and ‘honour’ (Gr. <italic>timē</italic>) that the kings of the earth will bring into the city (Rev. 21:24). Thus our thinking about earthly nations cannot be entirely negative. The predominant biblical witness is, however, to the existence of nations as a work of divine wrath.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812444684">10</xref></sup> Human beings belong to nations, peoples and nation-states only provisionally, temporarily and in a disposition of judgment. This said, obedience to the evangelical command cannot be abstracted from the time, place and culture in which it encounters us, and so a person cannot view their native language, place, language and historico-cultural context of one’s homeland as only negative in character but must find in these relations what God requires of them:
<disp-quote>
<p>Since God addresses him as the man who exists in these particular relationships to the men of his own and other races, they acquire for him the character of an allotted framework in which he has to express his own distinctive obedience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812444684">11</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A person properly takes up and shares the problems of a nation’s present and also ‘the problems of its future’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812444684">12</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section3-0953946812444684">
<title>What is the Nation-State?</title>
<p>A definition of ‘nation’ has often proved elusive in much theory and international law. It is notoriously difficult to find a United Nations definition of these terms but a UNESCO glossary of migration related terms defines ‘nation-state’ as ‘an area where the cultural boundaries match up with the political boundaries’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812444684">13</xref></sup> Slippage also occurs between ‘nation’ as a group of people who share the same nationality, that is, the same culture, language and heritage, ‘state’ as the legal term for a country or geographical region, and ‘nation-state’ as the legal or political entity where the majority share a common sense of identity and culture. As legal theorist Shirley V. Scott explains, it is possible to have a nation without a state. The political ideal since the French and American revolutions, however, has been broadly that the ‘nation-state’, that is, the idea that every nation (group of people sharing the same nationality) should have its own state (legal or political entity).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812444684">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against this political backdrop, relatively few theorists these days treat ‘the nation’ or nation-state in terms of ethnicity, blood or land, or emphasise the etymological roots of nation (L. <italic>na</italic>- stem of <italic>natio</italic> birth) with its links to ethnicity. The trend in political science is away from the ethnic and cultural consciousness of national populations to the democratic political ideals or imaginings that tie people together. Even the strongest accounts of national identity couched in terms of collective responsibility within particular boundaries of distributive justice, notably David Miller’s advocacy of a strong nation-state, tend to be built around the liberal ideals of equal citizenship, the social rights of citizenship and corresponding duties one to another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812444684">15</xref></sup> Yael Tamir’s theory of liberal nationalism emphasises the values of belonging, culture, shared history, loyalty and solidarity together with the liberal values of liberty and equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812444684">16</xref></sup> There are, of course, many accounts of the rise of the modern nation-state. Benedict Anderson ties the nation-state to a European reaction to breakaway colonies in the Americas; Anthony D. Smith argues that nation-states are constructed on top of older ethnic identities; Elie Kedourie understands the nation-state as Enlightenment doctrine; Adrian Hastings finds the nation-states’s origin in the medieval period and Anthony Giddens ties the nation-state to the gathering up of military power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812444684">17</xref></sup> Ernest Gellner’s thesis is that the modern European bureaucratic state is largely a function of the market economy. His <italic>Nations and Nationalism</italic> has been significant in demonstrating that modern societies are essentially economies serviced by the state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812444684">18</xref></sup> Hence nationalism is a ‘call to difference’ against the homogenisation of economic forces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812444684">19</xref></sup> This is not the place to arbitrate between these claims. Our questioning is more limited and concerns, in the next section, how to respond to colloquial talk about the family of nations and associated flip-side talk of nation as family.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946812444684">
<title>Family of Nations? Nation as Family?</title>
<p>‘The “Family of Nations” is…a fatuous idea, and hackneyed.’ So writes right-wing political theorist and humorist P. J. O’Rourke. ‘The Family of Nations is a terrible kinship group… Let’s give up on the Family of Nations notion and content ourselves merely with living in the “Neighbourhood of Nations”—the bad neighborhood of nations, the slum of nations.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812444684">20</xref></sup> O’Rourke’s observations are made in a chapter on International Relations where he describes foreign policy as the task of keeping ‘the scum of the earth at bay’ and making dictators and terrorist leaders quake with fear. ‘[T]hat’s about it’, he says, except for ‘a spot of free trade’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812444684">21</xref></sup> O’Rourke’s extreme statism is a useful target for easy criticism and yet provokes Christian people to address pointed questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812444684">22</xref></sup> In what follows, I suggest that the idea of <italic>the family of nations</italic> is a possible although contentious element of how Christian people construe the relation between nation-states but that we should accept only a heavily qualified notion of the <italic>nation as family</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812444684">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the idea of <italic>the family of nations</italic>, we may note that many believers speak of God as the Father of all humanity. C. G. Weeramantry, ex-judge of the International Court of Justice, scholar of jurisprudence and recipient of the UNESCO Prize for Peace Education, has written <italic>The Lord’s Prayer: Bridge to a Better World. A Vision for Personal and Global Transformation</italic> in which acknowledgement of God as Father is expounded as the ultimate reason for humankind to live in justice and peace one with another:
<disp-quote>
<p>In terms of Jesus’ teachings these are the Father’s intimate concerns, for what is done for suffering humanity is done for the Father himself. In short, the fatherhood image provides us with an ideal that rises gigantic above all the petty squabbles and ambitions that have bedevilled humanity’s eternal quest for justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946812444684">24</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This wonderful book treats issues of international law within the framework of the Lord’s Prayer. It would be difficult for me to emphasise too strongly how much my heart was warmed upon first reading Weeramantry’s exposition of its legal-political meaning. Some present-day Orthodox scholars are also content to use this language. Archbishop Anastasios writes: ‘All humanity is thus one great, undivided whole and unified whole, the core of whose existence is the living trinitarian God: “One God and father of us all, who is above all and through all and in all” (Eph. 4:6)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946812444684">25</xref></sup> Questions might be raised, however, concerning the extent to which language about Fatherhood of God is appropriate in extra-ecclesial contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946812444684">26</xref></sup> Some evangelical scholarship tends to associate the revelation of God as Father with baptism into Christ. Jesus is Son of the Father by nature; baptised believers are made ‘sons’ through adoption. With this qualification, however, the language of ‘the family of nations’ may be accepted as pointing to the origin of all created beings in God.</p>
<p>More contentious is whether to conceive of nation-states as quasi families. At first glance, it might appear that the Christian does not have a contender in this debate. It is not immediately obvious that the believer has anything of doctrinal significance to say about whether to conceive of one’s co-nationals as quasi-family or bound to oneself by different ties. John Paul II said to the United Nations Organisation (UN) in 1995:
<disp-quote>
<p>people automatically feel that they are members of one great family… But as a result of the concrete historical conditioning of this same nature, they are necessarily bound in a more intense way to particular human groups, beginning with the family and going on to the various groups to which they belong and up to the whole of their ethnic and cultural group, which is called, not by accident, a ‘nation’, from the Latin word ‘<italic>nasci</italic>’: ‘to be born’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946812444684">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>John Paul II recognises the force of ethnic and cultural consciousness, the human need for identity and survival, and casts the discussion in terms of the vital and inevitable tension between universality and particularity. Like John Paul II, many secularist theorists suppose that political connections should be forged amongst those who share some kind of ethnic, historical, cultural or other affinity. John Stuart Mill is often cited to this effect:
<disp-quote>
<p>A portion of mankind may be said to constitute a Nationality if they are united among themselves by common sympathies which do not exist between them and any others—which make them co-operate with each other more willingly than with other people, desire to be under the same government, and desire that it should be government by themselves or a portion of themselves exclusively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946812444684">28</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nation and nationality are defined in terms of common sympathies and the affinities to which they give rise. My concern is that aspects of Christian teaching might be understood to suggest arguments for political community from affinity and the benefits of community such that partiality should be shown to the co-national on the basis of common history, customs, language, hopes for the future, etc., rather than the requirement for all of us within a given society to get along together. Interpretations of the ‘order of love’ based on blood, kinship, ethnicity, language, culture or religion lead too easily to racism and aggressive nationalism. This matters if Christian people are to respond adequately to far-right groups reported (in the daily newspaper as I write) as shouting abuse to London citizens, and to the man of Asian origin who shouted back: ‘I’m as English as you are’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946812444684">29</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section5-0953946812444684">
<title>Aquinas on the ‘Order in Charity’</title>
<p>Consider Aquinas’s teaching about the ‘order in love’ in <italic>ST</italic> II-II, q. 26. Regarding the question of order <italic>per se</italic>, Aquinas teaches that all love tends towards God as to its origin or first cause. Order belongs to reason and to the appetitive powers therefore order belongs to love. With respect to the general principle of order he writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>I answer that, As the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 16), the terms ‘before’ and ‘after’ are used in reference to some principle. Now order implies that certain things are, in some way, before or after. Hence wherever there is a principle, there must needs be also order of some kind. But it has been said above (23, 1; 25, 12) that the love of charity tends to God as to the principle of happiness, on the fellowship of which the friendship of charity is based. Consequently there must needs be some order in things loved out of charity, which order is in reference to the first principle of that love, which is God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946812444684">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ultimate reason for loving is God. The notion of ‘order’, which involves an understanding of what comes ‘before’ and ‘after’, is explained with reference to this ultimate end and to how God has ordered human life. In explication of the nature of this order, Aquinas asks <italic>inter alia</italic> in <italic>ST</italic> II-II, q. 26 whether one should love all neighbours equally or what distinctions should apply. His clear and repeated answer is that an order of charity is included in the divine precept.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946812444684">31</xref></sup> Some people are necessarily nearer to us than others in terms of kinship, affection and <italic>other factors such as being co-nationals</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Moreover there is yet another reason for which, out of charity, we love more those who are more nearly connected with us, since we love them in more ways. For, towards those who are not connected with us we have no other friendship than charity, whereas for those who are connected with us, we have certain other friendships, according to the way in which they are connected. Now since the good on which every other friendship of the virtuous is based, is directed, as to its end, to the good on which charity is based, it follows that charity commands each act of another friendship, even as the art which is about the end commands the art which is about the means. Consequently this very act of loving someone because he is akin or connected with us (L. <italic>vel quia coniunctus</italic>), or because he is a fellow-countryman (L. <italic>et vel concivis</italic>) or for any like reason that is referable to the end of charity, can be commanded by charity, so that, out of charity both eliciting and commanding, we love in more ways those who are more nearly connected with us.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946812444684">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Aquinas’s acceptance of the realities of human existence as entailing proximity to some and not others reflects Aristotle’s treatment of proximity and partiality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946812444684">33</xref></sup> Particular mention is made of fellow citizens within a city state (<italic>concivis</italic>), commonly translated as fellow citizen or fellow countryman. Partiality is to be shown towards one’s fellow citizens because ‘love’ of this kind cannot be shown to all people at once. At issue for our purposes is whether Aquinas’s account of the gradation of primary relations should be read to justify partiality to co-nationals through an extension of love to family and kin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0953946812444684">
<title>Resisting Nationhood as an Order of Creation</title>
<p>My answer is ‘no’. Aquinas’s account of the gradation of primary relations should not be read to justify partiality to co-nationals through an extension of love to family and kin. Reading Aquinas in this way would risk supposing that nationality constitutes some sort of framework or basis within which humanity claims some certainty with respect to how we should live apart from the divine self-revelation in Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946812444684">34</xref></sup> To do so would suggest that humanity’s existence in our various nations equates to an ‘order of creation’ that can be described in terms which suppose that we can access the divine will.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946812444684">35</xref></sup> Consider again the sentence:
<disp-quote>
<p>Consequently this very act of loving someone because he is akin or connected with us (L. <italic>vel quia coniunctus</italic>), or because he is a fellow-countryman (L. <italic>et vel concivis</italic>) or for any like reason that is referable to the end of charity, can be commanded by charity, so that, out of charity both eliciting and commanding, we love in more ways those who are more nearly connected with us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interpretation turns on the meaning of the word ‘or’ (L. <italic>vel</italic>). Used typically to co-ordinate two or more elements in a sentence between which there is an alternative but not necessarily a negation, <italic>vel</italic> could be translated readily as having an inclusive rather than exclusive meaning. According to this reading, one’s fellow citizens would be included in the sequence of love that begins with one’s kin and those otherwise ‘connected with us’ and that extends to one’s citizens. In other contexts, the word <italic>vel</italic> would be used to connect two words denoting the same thing. This in contrast to the word <italic>aut</italic> which might be used to denote an alternative of exclusives, e.g., in an ‘either…or’ construction (<italic>aut</italic>…<italic>aut</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946812444684">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>At issue in translating <italic>Et sic hoc ipsum quod est diligere aliquem quia consanguineus vel quia coniunctus est vel concivis</italic> (‘consequently this very act of loving someone because he is akin or connected with us’) is the degree of conjunction and/or disjunction between kinship or related affinity and wider relations of co-citizenship. I draw attention to the matter because of the risk that Aquinas could be (mis-)read to the effect that co-citizenship is to be conceived consecutively and within the same order of love as kinship relations. This at a time when some recent Thomist scholarship is urging a re-establishment of the ‘order of love’ as a central concern in present-day Catholic ethics. In 1991, Stephen J. Pope argued that, even though Aquinas’s account of the order of charity reflects out-dated Aristotelian biology, it should be read alongside today’s human sociobiology. Pope did not comment especially on love of one’s fellow citizens but argues that it is appropriate to re-establish the ‘order of love’ as a central concern in present-day Catholic ethics. Recent insights into the evolution and natural ordering of altruism provided by behavioural biology can and should, Pope said, act as correctives to certain deficiencies in Christian ethics. Mindful that evolutionary biology gives ample evidence of the ambivalence of human nature and multiplicity of tendencies which incline us towards service to and love for others, Pope suggested that this scholarship warrants fresh appreciation of Thomist traditions of the ordering of love as a corrective to vagueness in some Christian ethics that merely urges love as an act of will or self-sacrifice without spelling out what it might entail in more practical terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946812444684">37</xref></sup> Kinship or and related affinities, implies Pope, are an appropriate basis for inter-personal partiality.</p>
<p>In later publications, Stephen J. Pope is careful to distinguish between some issues in natural law that are diametrically opposed to evolutionary ethics and others that are not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946812444684">38</xref></sup> He does address nationhood or citizenship explicitly. My point is about possible applications of his argumentation and the avoidance of error rather than a critique of his work <italic>per se</italic>. To interpret Aquinas’s account of the gradation of primary relations to justify partiality to co-nationals through an extension of love to family and kin would downplay the predominant biblical witness to the existence of nations as a work of divine wrath, and misconstrue the business of Christian ethics and political theology as that of hastening the day when all nations of the earth will co-exist as one big happy family. Problems of nationalism are likely to present themselves if/when the partiality due to kinship or related affinity is extended to the wider society.</p>

<title>Which Cosmopolitanism?</title>
<p>Mindful, then, that Aquinas’s historico-political context was very different from our own but that, nevertheless, present-day interpretations of Aquinas’s teaching on ‘the order in love’ based on blood, kinship, ethnicity, language, culture or religion, could lead to a problematic accounts of the nation-state, the question is whether to opt for something like the neo-Kantian principle of proximity. I suggest in what follows a rethinking of the question of ‘order in love’ in the more <italic>de facto</italic> politically realist terms of proximity whilst urging reclamation of Augustinian/Thomist teaching on the several modes (L. <italic>pluribus modis</italic>) of love that connect us one to another. In other words, I am arguing for the continuing moral relevance of traditional Christian teaching with respect to the <italic>ordo amoris</italic> albeit with the qualification that the nation-state is not an extension of the relations of family and kin but a political community based on proximity.</p>
<sec id="section8-0953946812444684">
<title>Proximity and Constitutional Patriotism</title>
<p>Of note in this discussion is political philosopher Jeremy Waldron’s exposition of the principle of proximity in both Kantian and Christian terms. As distinct from the principle of affinity, he argues, that of proximity represents the most realistic approach to the theorising of the modern nation ‘in the mixed-up circumstances of the modern world’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946812444684">39</xref></sup> Noting that Thomas Hobbes and Immanuel Kant argue differently that political community is not based on affinity and kinship-type love but on the need for peaceable existence with those to whom one is closest and most likely to fight, Waldron’s account of proximity as the basis for political community emphasises (Kantian) duties owed to people in our vicinity. Drawing upon Kant’s conviction that nation-states should be formed among those who live ‘unavoidably side by side’, he underscores that the point of political community is not to affirm solidarity and quasi-kinship affinity but to prevent the outbreak of murderous conflict.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946812444684">40</xref></sup> I am less interested than Waldron in arguing from Kant and hesitant to read Augustine only through the lens of a particular version of modern liberalism. There is conceptual similarity, however, with Augustine’s recognition of the role of government in restraining sin and its effects and account of a people as ‘bound together by a common agreement as to the objects of their love’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946812444684">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>In broad terms, I find Waldron’s observations convincing about why political community based on proximity rather than affinity accords better with central Christian convictions regarding love of one’s enemy and the possibility of forgiveness. Together, he suggests, neo-Kantians and Christians (or Christian neo-Kantians) can focus on ways of living in political community with people of different ethnicities, cultures, religion, etc., dealing with potential conflicts near-at-hand rather than avoiding them through distance, differentiation and hostility. Drawing upon Jürgen Habermas’s ideal of constitutional patriotism and cosmopolitanism as the best available option for a proximity model of political community mediated only through the rule of law, Waldron claims that the principle of proximity is not anti-cosmopolitan but dialectic in its understanding of what it is to be a global citizen through membership of a particular political community. For present purposes, I accept his urging of proximity rather than affinity as the basis of political community and welcome his refusal to jettison the connection between proximity and cosmopolitanism but keep open the question of what this means for relations between human beings in our division into nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946812444684">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite disagreeing with the vast majority of O’Rourke’s political philosophy, I find a half-truth in his witticism: ‘There’s no such thing as a race and barely such a thing as an ethnic group. If we were dogs, we’d be the same breed… Trouble doesn’t come from Slopes, Kikes, Niggers, Spics or White Capitalist Pigs; it comes from the heart.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946812444684">43</xref></sup> The half-truth has something to do with the fundamental equality of all human persons and our need to find ways of living together within a given vicinity across differences. With Waldron, I accept proximity as the primary basis of political community whilst acknowledging the need to find a path that falls into neither the problematic aspects of modern political liberalism nor the rootlessness of some versions of new cosmopolitanism.</p>

<sec id="section9-0953946812444684">
<title>Responding to ‘Westfailure’</title>
<p>This accepted, the question becomes one of resource-sharing with distant as well as near neighbours, and how to respond to the new cosmopolitans for whom proximity is no basis for partiality. My suggestion in these closing sections is that it remains possible and, indeed, necessary at the present time for Christian people to work with an account of nation and nationhood as permitted within divine providence. This claim is cast in terms of traditional Christian teaching about the order of love (L. <italic>ordo amoris</italic>). This said, I am wary of making Augustine or Aquinas sound like John Rawls or other liberal thinkers, and do not believe that there is any doctrinal bond between Christianity and Westphalian systems of nation-state relations or late-modern, Western practices of democracy. The tightrope we are walking is between assessment of the theories and practices of the nation-state <italic>in Christian perspective</italic> and deriving from Christian tradition theoretical justifications for them. I want to engage in the former but am uneasy about the latter for fear of turning the work of political theology into the promotion of particular modes of governance, or suggesting that Christian ethics has a manifesto or political programme of its own. The matter turns on the question of how best to order one’s loves.</p>
<p>The new cosmopolitan challenge to root ethical standards in global rather than local standards takes different form in diverse neo-Kantian theory. Thomas Pogge is critical of the centrality of the nation in international affairs because proximity as a basis for distributing aid perpetuates severe poverty in nations other than one’s own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946812444684">44</xref></sup> Allen Buchanan offers a principled account of international legal order built around human rights and with a view to bolstering international institutions for the protection of human rights in ways that will inevitably supersede national interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946812444684">45</xref></sup> More important than proximity and popular consent as the basis of state legitimacy is the Natural Duty of Justice—a principle that rests on the even more foundational premises that all persons should be treated with equal concern and respect and that basic human rights should not be violated. Nor is it difficult to find Christian writers with new cosmopolitan sympathies. Jesuit political theologian David Hollenbach argues that the international community can no longer draw sharp distinctions between national and international interests. Environmental degradation, disease transmission, weapons proliferation, etc., all challenge the <italic>de facto</italic> interdependence of nations and demand new responses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946812444684">46</xref></sup> ‘The common humanity of all people is seen as the basis of a worldwide moral community’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946812444684">47</xref></sup> All argue variously for the legitimacy of states and international law to be measured against international standards.</p>
<p>In other words, the Christian ethicist must face squarely enough cosmopolitan challenges concerning the moral failures of Westphalian systems of international relations. At issue is whether globalisation and the inequalities of the post-Westphalian system of nation-states demand the dismantling of the traditional <italic>ordo amoris</italic> in favour of unconditional benevolence towards every creature individually.</p>

<title>Nations, Luck and ‘Order in Love’</title>
<p>So far, I have argued against possible readings of Aquinas’s ‘order of love’ that might tend to problematise notions of national identity as quasi kinship and opted for political community based on proximity rather than affinity. In this final section, I advance three theses derived from readings of Augustine, Aquinas and Barth that might assist Christian thinking and decision-making in these fields. Further work is obviously needed to develop the argument.</p>

<sec id="section11-0953946812444684">
<title>National Identity as ‘a Sort of Lot’</title>
<p>When Augustine posed the question ‘How we are to decide whom to aid?’, he was uncompromising in affirming that kinship and ethnicity matter less than our common humanity:
<disp-quote>
<p>[A]ll men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you. For, suppose that you had a great deal of some commodity, and felt bound to give it away to somebody who had none, and that it could not be given to more than one person; if two persons presented themselves, neither of whom had either from need or relationship a greater claim upon you than the other, you could do nothing fairer than choose by lot to which you would give what could not be given to both. Just so among men: since you cannot consult for the good of them all, you must take the matter as decided for you by a sort of lot, according as each man happens for the time being to be more closely connected with you.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946812444684">48</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the fifth century <sc>ce</sc>, Augustine knew that it was impossible to do good to all equally and drew the conclusion that it would be just as fair to give of one’s limited resources to someone close by than far away; ‘you must take the matter as decided for you by a sort of lot’. Today, our birthplace is just as much a ‘matter of lot’. This does not mean that Christian people can despise any aspect of the network of relations into which they are born.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946812444684">49</xref></sup> Even though national identity is not fixed or unchangeable, even though people learn new languages, change geographical locations, become ‘at home’ in different places, this does not mean that the networks of relation into which a person is born or that they acquire are morally insignificant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946812444684">50</xref></sup> The moral imperatives that arise in these contexts are not impersonal ‘oughts’ that can be abstracted from the vagaries of life amidst which one finds oneself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946812444684">51</xref></sup> Rather, the radical contingency of human existence includes membership of peoples, nations and/or nation-states and is integral to the dignity of human creatureliness.</p>
<p>The Christian cannot despise <italic>prima facie</italic> any aspect of the network of relations into which one is either born or finds oneself ‘as a sort of lot’. A person exists and is a self only in such networks of relation. This is not the same as affirming that membership of a particular people or nation is subject directly to the divine command; ‘for when we speak of home, motherland and people, it is a matter of outlook’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946812444684">52</xref></sup> It leaves us with the question, however, of how to respond to some of the new cosmopolitan challenges concerning proximity as a moral basis for partiality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0953946812444684">
<title>Particular Loves and Universal Benevolence</title>
<p>All things being equal, we might suppose that the <italic>ordo amoris</italic> is relatively uncontentious. The repeated witness in Christian tradition is that one cannot love everyone equally: ‘[A]ll men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do good to all, you are to pay special regard to those who, by the accidents of time, or place, or circumstance, are brought into closer connection with you’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946812444684">53</xref></sup> No individual <italic>can</italic> love everyone equally and so the question becomes how to love appropriately. Justice is about getting our loves ordered rightly. Aquinas writes: ‘out of charity, we love more those who are more nearly connected with us, since we love them in more ways’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946812444684">54</xref></sup> Family, community and co-nationals might be deemed to have a greater claim upon our consideration than those far away simply because those distant from us are in relations of nearness with others who have corresponding responsibilities as ourselves. All things being equal, it is better that I care for an elderly relative nearby and expect those far away to care for their own elderly relatives rather than me try to care for their relative at a distance. Similarly with respect to co-citizens. Well-ordered societies are those in which citizens exercise a politically-mediated duty of care one to another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946812444684">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new cosmopolitan concern is that all things are <italic>not</italic> equal. The Westphalian system—which has been inseparable from its inception from the capitalist market economy security against debt provided by nation-states—is widely recognised as having failed to create fair trading agreements between what the neo-Gramscians call the transnational capitalist class (TCC) and the ‘have-nots’ or social underclasses who already reject the idea that globalisation does anything for them. The Westphalian system has failed to sustain a balance between the need for a growing economy and the resulting environmental damage, and to constrain the gap between rich and poor nation-states around the world, and more besides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946812444684">56</xref></sup> In other words, this system of nation-states makes the command to love one’s neighbour, and especially one’s distant neighbour, unfeasibly difficult, when globalisation means that every citizen of the world is for the believer the man going down from Jerusalem to Jericho (Lk. 10:25-37). The question is whether it is simply wrong to affirm an <italic>ordo amoris</italic> or hierarchical order of partiality when universal benevolence demands more.</p>
<p>In defending the broadly traditional claim that there is properly an order in love, the most important question is whether this is simply a cover for inaction and defence of the status quo. Perhaps. I hope not. The reality is that every person encounters and engages the world from a limited perspective and with finite consequences. To act is to be selective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946812444684">57</xref></sup> The challenge is not to get stuck in a theoretical dilemma between a commitment to those nearby, including co-citizens, and the equality of all human beings that cuts across all other distinctions to place an equal burden of responsibility on all. The challenge is to seek after a more dialectical relation in which to interrelate and intensify the several modes (L. <italic>pluribus modis</italic>) of love that connect human creatures one to another. Either this, or the ethical life is reduced to a form of solipsism in which the agent is accountable ultimately to themselves for their maximising of the reduction of suffering and limits (or not) of the calculus. Love is not a zero-sum game which highlights that giving something to someone necessarily means not giving it to someone else.</p>
<p>I do not want to draw the choice between a commitment to everyone universally and the reality of the other person beside me too sharply. In practical terms, choice is rarely an abstract alternative between a quantitative-based ethic that treats the equality of all persons as a quasi-numerical value versus love of the person nearby me. How we love the person nearby has implications for how we engage the neighbour far away. Peter Singer is undoubtedly correct that money spent on luxury gifts for a relative would achieve more elsewhere. One can obtain the same utility in a poor country more-or-less by spending 10p as you can by spending £1 in the UK. This is not in dispute. The Christian is challenged to consider how they spend or otherwise dispose of every single penny. The challenge is not to set love of one’s immediate neighbour over against love of neighbour far away. To do so fabricates a universality in which the moral responsibility to minimise suffering overall replaces an ontology of love. The result is a potentially unsustainable imperative in which benevolence becomes refracted and arbitrary, tending to delusion, or what Roman Catholic ethicist Robert Spaemann calls ‘an imagined totality of goodness’ in which the self’s relationships with others do not grow deeper and more vibrant but tend towards abstraction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946812444684">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Christianity remains incompatible with preference utilitarian<italic>ism</italic> (as a ‘total’ ethic) because of its view that God ultimately judges the relative morality or immorality of an act. No relation between self and other is unmediated in Christian ethics because judgement rests ultimately with God. Singer’s critique of Christian apathy remains apt in so many ways. Yet the Christian response to suffering is likely to remain deontological in structure (derived ontologically) and applied pragmatically (i.e., after and including an examination of likely consequences)—although only as the second step of a two-step process. Love of one’s distant neighbour is compatible in Christian ethics with a restricted consequentialism in which the optimisation problem is construed within the <italic>ordo amoris</italic>. Conversation between consequentialism and Christian ethics is likely to be most effective when the former settles for shaking the latter out of quietist tendencies, and the latter is provoked by the former into better obedience to the law of love.</p>

<title>Nation-States and Love as Political Virtue</title>
<p>This paper has been about how to get our loves ordered rightly given humanity’s division into nations and why this is unlikely to be achieved by reducing the experience of love to a calculus based on every individual global citizen. I have begun to argue for a more structured response to global poverty than is advocated in some forms of new cosmopolitanism to take more account of the <italic>de facto</italic> reality of birthplace and relationships into which one is born; the order of near and far remains of moral significance even given the new global realities that bring famines in countries other than our own into our living rooms.</p>
<p>In concluding, I am mindful that my reading of Augustine and Aquinas is poised to sound distinctly Rawlsian. John Rawls argues in <italic>The Law of Peoples</italic> that whilst well-ordered peoples have a duty to assist burdened societies it does not follow that the only way, or the best way, to carry out this duty of assistance is by following a principle of global distributive justice to regulate economic and social inequalities among societies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946812444684">59</xref></sup> I am wary in what follows of making Augustine or Aquinas sound like John Rawls, and do not believe that there is any doctrinal bond between Christianity and late-modern, Western practices of democracy. These are issues for another day. In practical terms, however, few readings of either Augustine or Aquinas are apolitical. Christian people engaged actively with these issues must hold together somehow the tension between a dramatic transfer of resources from rich to poor across national borders and the slower process of eradicating poverty via a moral defence of nationhood.</p>
<p>At the least, Christian people might want at their disposal the resources of tradition teaching and, in particular, the moral significance of the structure of the <italic>ordo amoris</italic>, when addressing the deceptively simple question ‘Who is my neighbour?’. As Augustine and Aquinas remind us, love is a political virtue, justice is about ordering loves rightly, and the unity of love of neighbours far and near is found in God. For fear of repeating this too lightly, however, I join with Singer in affirming: ‘ye may know them by their fruit’.</p>

<p>David Miller defends the state’s delivery to its members of ‘bundle of rights, opportunities, and resources to its own members, not to outsiders’. <italic>National Responsibility and Global Justice</italic> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 17. Nationhood gives rise to legitimate attachments that found duties of justice and humanitarian assistance which exceed those of family and friendship and are inherited across generations and can rightfully become the occupants of territory. David Miller, ‘Immigrants, Nations and Citizenship’, <italic>Journal of Political Philosophy</italic> 16.4 (2008), pp. 371-90, esp. p. 381. Miller argues that cosmopolitanism requires a person to give moral priority to compatriots along with the expectation that all persons should do this, i.e., he advocates cosmopolitanism via a moral defence of nationhood.</p>

<p>Wanting to define nationalism in more positive terms than irrational fear of the stranger or a desire for power at the expense of others, Yael Tamir renounces the term ‘nationalism’ in favour of the less pejorative ‘people’ or ‘community’. <italic>Liberal Nationalism</italic> (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995), p. 5. Culture in its widest sense, she says, is what holds a nation together (p. 8). National rights rest on the values that individuals attach to their membership in a nation and so all nations are entitled to equal respect. The liberal concept of distributive justice emerged historically from an amalgamation of liberal, democratic and national ideas.</p>

<p>For Rawls, the responsibilities of the international community are to help a people establish basic institutions for a free, constitutional (democratic) society, the aim being to establish just institutions rather than raise levels of wealth. He places much emphasis on the political culture of a nation and supposes that few societies exist where resources are so scarce that they cannot be organised and governed such that no one starves.
