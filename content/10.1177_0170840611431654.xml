<p>It is certainly true that there is no shortage of books that promise to offer readers an insight into the inner workings of marketing. The basic plot for the genre is premised on the idea that, while the outputs of the marketing system are all too visible, the essential processes and practices that produce them are somehow obscured from view. This genre has no particular political affiliation. It can be applied to shine a light on the concealed realities of an industry where unpleasant truths are hidden behind the bright lights of dazzling commercials, shiny new product innovations and the promise of dreams fulfilled. This tradition is often viewed as a somewhat modern and contemporary phenomenon, a kind of post-ideological activism associated with books such as Klein’s <italic>No Logo</italic>, movements such as the Media Foundation, and movies such as <italic>The Corporation</italic>. The genre does, however, have a much longer tradition that can be mapped alongside and throughout the onset of industrialization and commercialization. Upton Sinclair’s exposé of the Chicago meat-processing industry, <italic>The Jungle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0170840611431654">1906</xref>), and of course Vance Packard’s <italic>The Hidden Persuaders</italic> (1957), both scandalized marketing’s hitherto unseen inner workings, revealing something of a latent social desire to be periodically shocked and horrified in a kind of mass-marketing-denial. The opposite intention is also evident in this genre, that is, to show how marketing ‘really works’, and how great marketing achievements are accomplished. John Quelch’s <italic>In Praise of Marketing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0170840611431654">2009</xref>) alludes to this particular take on the narrative. Quelch concludes with a call for marketers to concentrate more on marketing Marketing, and to highlight the brilliant contribution that it makes but is all too often ‘under the radar’ of everyday discourse.</p>
<p>The outstanding achievement of <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is that is avoids treading either of these well-worn paths. Instead it approaches marketing with an intellectual sensitivity and maturity that is all too rarely applied to the subject. While each of the chapters are stand-alone, in the sense that they are written by scholars from varied and diverse academic communities and in this regard do not speak with what we might term a common message or agenda, there is nevertheless a general and common commitment throughout the book to treat and take marketing seriously. The overall impression that is produced is one of complexity and depth. Marketing is shown as a multifaceted set of practices and institutions which both produce and are produced by particular social, political, economic, technological and ethical conditions. This representation of marketing is close to a macro-marketing approach, as well as the way in which organization studies might be expected approach various dimensions of marketing practices. The various chapters stress in different ways the function of marketing as power, as discourses of legitimation and normalization. Running alongside these representations are views of marketing as a disorganized, inadequate and amorphous set of assemblages. But the practice of <italic>marketing-as-management</italic> remains the central focus of the book. <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is not simply what we might pejoratively term a ‘sociology of marketing’. In fact the book can be read as being structured in terms that are directly and evidently familiar to readers of the standard marketing text. There are, for instance, excellent chapters on the application of the marketing concept, on value creation, on innovation and design, on retailing, on business-to-business marketing, on marketing research, on segmentation, on international marketing and on advertising and consumer behaviour. This synchrony of structure between <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> and the traditional marketing syllabus demonstrates how progressive critique and theoretical innovation in marketing theory can be achieved by applying sociological, cultural and organizational critique to established marketing themes and topics.</p>
<p>Another much welcomed and highly commendable aspect of <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is its refusal to allay its overall contribution to consumer research, which for over two decades has been considered by many to be one of few sustained branches of intellectualism in marketing (macro-marketing being another). As many consumer researchers are painfully aware, this once radical and progressive agenda has for some years now looked less and less compelling and productive, mainly due to the problematic nature of the consumer as a central analytical construct. The various chapters certainly do not present anything approaching a coordinated or common critique of consumer research, but throughout the book there remains a persistent call to reopen and reconsider the consumer in different and more relevant ways. This treatment of consumer research is illustrative of the general high quality of the book, in that is makes space to sensibly and credibly critique and deconstruct the underlying premise and ideology of consumer research while avoiding the regressive temptation to reject or dismiss the movement as being in some way completed or to be moved beyond. It is likely, however, that researchers and writers committed to consumer research, and for whom consumer culture theory offers the most viable critical direction in marketing today, will find <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> difficult to completely incorporate into their zeitgeist. But rather than reviewing <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> with a certain quiet ambivalence, consumer researchers and CCT should instead conceptualize it as one of a range of possible useful templates for reinvigorating and re-enchanting the movement. An implied suggestion from <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is that organization studies should be given greater attention in the development of new marketing theory rather than looking primarily to consumption studies. Most of the chapters focus on organizational processes as foundations of marketing practice in that the roles of both firms and consumers are decentred as units of analysis.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious reccurring theme in <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is that of market-making, and specifically the way that various institutional practices and processes create and reproduce marketing and markets as legitimating forces. The first chapter in the collection, by Don Slater, does this explicitly, which sets the tone for many of the subsequent contributions. Unlike a clichéd account which might be expected to overemphasize unity and purpose in marketing ideology, Slater draws attention the endemic categorical crisis in marketing (theory). Marketing is described as being located in a forever compromised realm between disciplinary boundaries and disciplinary protection. Marketing, in Slater’s account, is the vagabond of both social science and professional practice, in what he terms an ‘impossible’ and ‘monstrous’ position. It is up to the consumer to judge whether such proclamations constitute hyperbole. Slater’s chapter draws on the theoretical movements from actor-network theory and science technology studies, a heritage that is infused throughout many other chapters. This is perhaps most explicit in the fascinating account of retail development by Frank Cochoy, as well Zwick and Ozalp’s discussion on gentrification and Desroches and Marcoux’s chapter on sensuousness.</p>
<p>This issue of ‘market-making’ is also dealt with, but in a more literal sense, in the chapter by Cayla and Penaloza on Indian consumers, the chapter by Cook on childhood and children as consumers, and Brown’s piece on the Black US market, as well as Applbaum’s critique of the marketing concept. What these accounts show, perhaps more than anything else, is that the myth of the free market as some kind of naturally occurring product of social and economic evolution is simply that – a myth. Markets and marketing emerge by design, by expediency, by desperation, by error and often reluctantly, but never ‘by themselves’. The theme of the marketing domain is returned to in several chapters. Perhaps there is something ironic and nostalgic in the seemingly timeless quality of the debate around the containment and expansion of marketing ideology mapped out by Kotler and Levy (1969). The chapter on social marketing by Moor engages with this debate directly.</p>
<p>Another central theme that runs through the book is that of rethinking the consumer. There are several intelligent and progressive discussions on what can be broadly termed ‘consumer labour’ that further problematize the desire for neat and distinct categories of production and consumption, and the role that marketing supposes for itself in mediating between them. Foster’s chapter on value creation tackles this subject directly and Zwick and Ozalp’s piece can be read as a direct application and illustration of some of these issues. Arvidsson and Malossi provide an excellent vocabulary for these types of interventions in their discussion on Italian fashion. This chapter is perhaps the most faithful to orthodox accounts of ideology and capital, especially in terms of framing arguments around freedom and creativity. This approach can also be seen in Moor’s chapter on social marketing.</p>
<p>Cochoy’s chapter on retail design provides an excellent case on how one might begin a consumer research agenda in which the consumer is decentred as a unit of analysis. His insights from <italic>Progressive Grocer</italic> write an alternative consumer research, in which the arrangements of turnstile entry gates, the location of checkout counters, and the demands of the shopping cart (among other things) provide the basis for some form of market-thing-agency. What is also fascinating in Cochoy’s account are the mundane and overlooked technologies and fears that have done much to shape the development of the marketing system. These ‘trivialities’ – the real problem of pilfering and how this is structured in and out of the marketing system, the importance of cellophane, the problem of overcoming the need for cashiers to bend down – have all too often been written out or overlooked in our accounts of marketing ecology in favour of immersed (and reified) consumer experience.</p>
<p>Several of the chapters draw upon research practices to elaborate the workings of the marketing system. The chapter on focus group research by Grandclement and Gaglio provides one of the best investigations into research practice currently available. When read together with Pridmore and Lyon’s discussion on surveillance and Cayla and Penaloza’s analysis of the ‘emerging’ Indian consumer, it is possible to piece together a highly sophisticated and relevant critique of the limitations of research practices and ideals. One thing that comes out of this reading is how the consumer is often designed into the research system, and in very particular ways. Here the performative and constitutive effects of the research industry are able to be viewed, together with the considerable compromises and necessary expediencies that are also part of that reality. The discussion on segmentation by Sunderland and Denny provides an excellent (and often painful) rendition of these challenges. The management of risk and ever-present anxieties surrounding marketing performance and results are shown to continuously infiltrate and subvert the idealized ambitions of research. From a slightly more detached vantage point, it is possible to read into this account a certain marketing comedy unfolding in which the chaos of communication and time constraints contribute to a kind of free fall in slow motion.</p>
<p>Several of the chapters confront issues of technology, science and innovation. As one might anticipate, these accounts expose the political struggles between marketers and other organizational communities and the delicate power games that structure much marketing practice. Desroches and Marcoux provide a superb description of organizational life around innovation and development, and make striking observations about the competing demands of product-based research and marketing research. Applbaum’s chapter is brilliantly insightful on this topic, providing a rather chilling description of the way that pharmaceutical companies have responded to the need to redefine the essential purpose of the industry in terms that are very much market-orientated. The quality of writing and level of analysis of Applbaum’s investigation is outstanding and demonstrates how serious marketing work can be undertaken. What this chapter does more than anything else is call attention to the pressing need to continually return to the core underlying philosophical and ideological basis for marketing as a legitimating programme within modern capitalism. As with many of the chapters in this collection, Applbaum can be read as making a coherent and compelling call for more and better marketing research that engages with the institutional power of marketing as a force that shapes the social landscape. After reading <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> readers will be rewarded by following up with Applbaum’s (2003) <italic>The Marketing Era</italic>, which provides a remarkable and eloquent set of arguments concerning the development of marketing systems.</p>
<p><italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is certainly one of the most important collections on marketing published to date, and sets a standard that others would be well advised to follow. It is perhaps slightly disappointing, not to mention a source of concern, that the tradition of the Business School continues to be poorly organized to produce this type of account, and that it is from the broader social science community that these insights tend to emerge. Zwick and Cayla are to be congratulated on a project that demonstrates the importance of grounding the analysis of marketing within the social sciences, and also that such an approach does not require marketing to be held at some kind of analytical distance. If one needs reassurance that <italic>marketing practice</italic> can be a fertile and rich subject of enquiry then <italic>Inside Marketing</italic> is an excellent place to start.</p>
