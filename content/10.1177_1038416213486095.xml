<abstract>
<p>The current study examines the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction program on participants receiving unemployment benefit payments. A pretest posttest control group design was used. The participants (<italic>N</italic> = 43) were randomly divided into two groups. The experimental group followed the mindfulness-based stress reduction program in a group-setting with a trainer whereas the control group did not receive any training. All the participants received a pre-test and a post-test. Stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale, mindfulness with the Questionnaire on Everyday Experiences, self-efficacy with regard to finding a job with the Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale and motivation was measured with a questionnaire developed by the researchers. The results showed that stress symptoms had reduced and the focus on everyday activities had increased in the experimental group setting. Confidence in being able to find a job also increased. With respect to motivation to go to job interviews, no increase was found between the initial and final measurements for either group.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1038416213486095" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Unemployment in the Netherlands is relatively high (6.6% of labor force) and increases gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1038416213486095">Central Statistical Office, 2012</xref>). The labor market deteriorates concurrently. The number of jobs available to workers has declined sharply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1038416213486095">Central Statistical Office, 2010</xref>) with a consequence that the number of unemployment benefits increased.</p>
<p>Research into the psychological impact of joblessness has clearly indicated that unemployment has negative consequences for the mental well-being of most individuals. Some people cope with the unemployment experience better than others. The effects of unemployment are determined by a complex set of variables that can worsen or reduce its impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1038416213486095">Feather, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Obviously, unemployment has deep implications for those affected. Several empirical studies in the Dutch-speaking regions, for instance, show that most of the unemployed, in addition to financial implications, have problems in physical<italic>,</italic> psychological and social domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1038416213486095">De Waele, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1038416213486095">De Witte &amp; Hooge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1038416213486095">De Witte &amp; Wets, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1038416213486095">Elchardus &amp; Glorieux, 1995</xref>). A review study by De <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1038416213486095">Witte (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213486095">Hannisch’ meta-analysis (1999)</xref> give an overall picture of these problems. Their findings are in line with results of various international studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1038416213486095">Fryer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1038416213486095">Fryer &amp; Payne, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1038416213486095">Warr, 1984</xref>). People without jobs are on average more anxious, pessimistic and depressed than their employed counterparts. Their self-esteem is on average lower, and they have lower scores on life satisfaction and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1038416213486095">Fryer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1038416213486095">Warr, 1984</xref>). In addition, they experience more stress symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213486095">Hannisch, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies demonstrate that psychological well-being of people who become unemployed shows a downward tendency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1038416213486095">De Witte, 2003</xref>). Being excluded from employment may cause psychological discomfort. If unemployment lasts longer than 3 months, there is an increased risk of developing depression symptoms like hopelessness, despair and discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1038416213486095">Blonk, 2006</xref>). Confidence in their own abilities or perceived competence (self-efficacy) in the successful resumption of work drops sharply and appears to be significantly lower in long-term unemployed persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1038416213486095">Van Loo, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From the literature, it becomes clear that people who are unemployed have mental health of poorer quality than those who are absorbed into employment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1038416213486095">McKee-Ryan, Song, Wanberg, and Kinicki (2005)</xref>, for instance, used meta-analysis to study the impact of unemployment on employee well-being across a multitude of empirical studies. Unemployed persons had lower mental and physical well-being than did their working counterparts. The authors’ results strongly suggest that being unemployed has a negative effect on mental health.</p>
<p>Unemployment is viewed as a major social problem that has an impact both on the individual (personal suffering) and on society, since the cost of unemployment benefits are at the expense of the taxpayer. Therefore, both society and people who are excluded from employment will benefit from an effective approach when it comes to reducing the negative psychological effects of unemployment.</p>
<p>The current study focuses on reduction of stress symptoms, increasing motivation and enhancing self-efficacy with the intention of enabling unemployed people to look for new employment by participating and completing a traditional trainer-guided mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training program.</p>
<sec id="sec2-1038416213486095"><title>Theoretical framework: MBSR</title>
<p>A program that helps to reduce symptoms of psychological, physical and psychosomatic nature is MBSR. The program focuses on learning meditation techniques. It is based on a systematic procedure for paying attention to the here-and-now experience to learn to observe. The program includes an intensive eight weekly, two-and-a-half hours sessions (workshops). Besides weekly sessions, participants are expected to do daily homework exercises as well. It is an intensive training that asks participants to draw on their inner resources and natural competence to actively engage in caring for themselves and finding greater equilibrium, ease, and peace of mind. MBSR training aims at participant’s stress reduction and how to make stress level more manageable.</p>
<p>Research has shown that mindfulness-based treatment interventions may be effective for a range of mental and physical health disorders in adult populations. According to a meta-analytic study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213486095">Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, and Walach (2004)</xref>, the MBSR program seemed to be beneficial and effective for groups of people with a wide range of mental and physical complaints. MBSR training brought about a significant reduction in mental complaints and reduced the chance of relapse after depression. This has resulted in a better quality of life and a higher sense of self-efficacy. People that completed the MBSR training also coped more adequately with stress.</p>
<p>More and more researchers are saying that MBSR should not be applied to clinical populations exclusively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1038416213486095">Jacobs and Blustein (2008)</xref>, for instance, are advocates of MBSR into career counseling for the very reason that they expect benefits for a substantial amount of workers who face job uncertainty or who are afraid of being fired. MBSR provides a useful coping skill that can provide a more solid basis for exploratory behavior and decision making. The authors assume that anticipation anxiety will decrease through a focus on the present moment. Findings of a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1038416213486095">Hülsheger, Alberts, Feinholdt, and Lang (2013)</xref> suggest that for employees working in emotionally demanding jobs, mindfulness promotes job satisfaction and helps preventing emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>From the studies listed above, we can observe that MBSR trainings seem to be effective in various domains in both clinical and non-clinical populations. For the current study, the latter is of great importance. Based on previously conducted research and the findings thereof, we expect that the MBSR intervention would have benefits on individuals receiving unemployment benefit payments.</p>
<p>Many unemployed people are faced by a range of mental and physical health complaints. Research shows that the MBSR program can address these disorders properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1038416213486095">Hölzel et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, no empirical research has been conducted to date that examines the effects of MBSR training program on the unemployed. In addition, no research has been conducted so far into other potential benefits such as increased self-efficacy and motivation to take active steps towards finding work.</p>
<p>The present study aims to fill this gap by investigating the effects on stress, mindfulness, motivation and self-efficacy among people receiving unemployment benefit payments after completion of the MBSR course.</p>
<p>Stress in the current study refers to a condition in which the balance of the biophysiological functions in the body is disrupted by excessive physical or mental tension, and puts into action certain defense mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1038416213486095">Movisie, 2010</xref>). The first hypothesis is<disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic></bold> After completing the MBSR training program, people receiving unemployment benefit payments will suffer less from stress symptoms.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Studies in which mindfulness was measured with the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1038416213486095">Lau et al., 2006</xref>), based on the aforementioned definition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213486095">Bishop, Lau, Shapiro, Anderson, and Carlson (2004)</xref>, show a significant improvement both on the components of self-regulation of attention and on curiosity, openness and acceptance after participants had completed the MBSR program (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1038416213486095">Siegel, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1038416213486095">2003</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1038416213486095">Segal, Williams, and Teasdale (2002)</xref> also demonstrate an increased level of mindfulness among participants due to MBSR training. We expect similar effects among the unemployed.<disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic></bold> After completion of the MBSR training program, people receiving unemployment benefit payments will experience to focus more attention to their daily activities (mindfulness).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The conviction that one can successfully execute the behavior required to produce the outcomes is termed self-efficacy by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1038416213486095">Bandura (1997)</xref>. Self-efficacy beliefs determine how people feel, think, motivate themselves and behave. They include cognitive, motivational, affective and selection processes. Two components that influence behavior are important. The outcome expectancy, on the one hand, refers to a person's estimation that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. It is an expectation that behavior leads to a specific result and, on the other hand, self-efficacy that specifically deals with the assessment of a person whether he or she is able to effectively implement the intended behavior to reach the desired result.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy is a general set of expectations that a person possesses, based on past experience, that affect his or her expectations of success in new situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1038416213486095">Sherer et al., 1982</xref>). It refers to the global confidence in one’s coping ability across a wide range of demanding or new situations, whereas specific self-efficacy is tied to specific situations or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1038416213486095">Pajares, 1996</xref>). A positive relationship was found between general and specific self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1038416213486095">Stanley &amp; Murphy, 1997</xref>), i.e., it can be expected that a high degree of general self-efficacy will also have positive effects on more specific domains of behavior. A person who has confidence in his or her ability to have conversations will probably have less difficulty in conducting a job interview than someone less confident in conversation skills.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy is the global confidence a person has to successfully perform a task. Self-efficacy affects performing a task. For example, someone with a low level of self-efficacy is more likely to delay behavior to performing a task, than someone who scores high on this dimension. Levels of self-efficacy also influence the effort involved in performing a task and, consequently, a person’s perseverance. When we relate the aforementioned suppositions to self-efficacy levels of the unemployed, then it is important to strengthen self-efficacy, since this is directly related to confidence in their own abilities to find a job. An unemployed person with a high score on self-efficacy is expected to be stronger involved into action-oriented job search. In addition, a higher degree of persistence is expected (specific self-efficacy). People who hold out the longest and can boost their perseverance to find a job are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Several studies have found positive effects of the MBSR program on self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213486095">Chang et al. (2004)</xref> report that post-intervention levels of stress were significantly lower than pre-intervention levels, while mindfulness self-efficacy and positive states of mind were at significantly higher levels. In a meta-analytic study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213486095">Grossman et al. (2004)</xref> found similar results. Their findings suggest the value of MBSR as an intervention for a broad range of chronic disorders and problems. The authors contend that mindfulness training might enhance general features of coping with distress and disability in everyday life, as well as under more extraordinary conditions of serious disorder or stress. We expect positive effects on self-efficacy outcomes for unemployed people after completion of MBSR training program with regard to finding a new job. The resulting hypothesis is:<disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic></bold> After completing the MBSR training program, people receiving unemployment benefit payments will have a greater confidence in their ability to find a new job.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Expectancy-value theory may provide insight into how unemployment leads to the development of mental complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486095">Feather, 1982</xref>). Within the framework of expectancy-value theory, a person's actions are related to the expectations that the person holds and the subjective values that are associated with alternative instrumental actions and their possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1038416213486095">Feather, 1992</xref>). In accordance with expectancy-value theory, task motivation will increase as it is more likely that the task in question will contribute to satisfying basic needs. Motivation is regulated by the expectation that a given course of behavior will produce certain outcomes and the value of those outcomes, i.e., a person’s motivation is determined by how much he or she values the goal, and whether they expect to succeed. Translated into job loss, this means that the significance of a particular job would depend upon the perceived characteristics of the job itself and the person's needs and values. A job might be seen as attractive because it provides many of the features that are linked to good employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1038416213486095">Warr, 1984</xref>). For instance, a job may grant a safe income, opportunities for skill utilization, variety, clarity, a defined goal structure, contacts with other people and so on. Having no success in finding a job while a person is highly motivated has an unwanted impact on mental well-being. High levels of employment commitment among unemployed people are accompanied by high levels of distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1038416213486095">Paul &amp; Moser, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The MBSR training program teaches the person to remain in the present moment without judging or allowing her- or himself to get carried away with negative emotions related to the past. Although the literature search revealed no studies showing that mindfulness training increases motivation, in our view, MBSR training program may have a great potential as a tool to increase people’s job search motivation and so to combat unemployment. It is hypothesized that:<disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Hypothesis 4:</italic></bold> After completing the MBSR training program, people receiving unemployment benefit payments will be more motivated to apply for a job.</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec4-1038416213486095"><title>Research design</title>
<p>A total of 43 people participated in the current study. A pretest-posttest design with one control group was applied. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: one experimental and one control group. The experimental group participated into a standardized 8-week MBSR training program guided by a trainer. This group came together once a week for two-and-a-half hour sessions. In addition, daily homework exercises should be practiced 6 days a week about 45 min to 1 h. The control group did not receive treatment.</p>
<p>One week before the first session (T1) and one week after the last session of the MBSR training (T2), the two groups were administered 4 questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, Questionnaire Everyday Experiences, Job Seeking Self-efficacy Scale and Motivation Scale). These questionnaires, sent via e-mail, were completed and returned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1038416213486095" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Respondents who participated in the current study received unemployment benefit. They all were eligible to participate in the study. Potential participants were approached by their work coaches attached to the Social Security Agency for Employee Insurance (SSAEI) and asked to participate in the study.</p>
<p>All respondents received a brochure in which the aim of the study was explained. A total of 100 people applied for this study. Before the study started, 40 participants found a new job so they were excluded from participation because they did not belong to the target group any more. The remaining 60 participants were matched by age, sex and education level (Lower Vocational Education or a lower level, Intermediate Vocational Education and Higher Vocational Education or a higher level). Then, they were randomly assigned to the two groups. Each group consisted of 30 people.</p>
<p>Prior to completion of the training, 17 respondents (28%) dropped out, 10 (33%) from the experimental group and 7 (23%) from the control group. Quitting the training was due to finding a new job and some gave up because of private matters. In the end 20 participants (experimental group) completed the training including the pre- and posttests. In total, the sample consists of 43 people who receive unemployment benefit payments, 17 (40%) of them are male and 26 (60%) female. The respondents’ age ranged from 29 to 59 years, with an average age of 46.67 (SD = 8.11); 6 people had a Lower Vocational Education level or even a lower level (14%), 17 people had Intermediate Vocational Education level (40%) and 20 people had Higher Vocational Education level or college (47%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1038416213486095">Table 1</xref> shows the respondents’ distribution by gender, age and education.

<p>A questionnaire was administered within the week before the start of the course and within 1 week after the end of the course. The questionnaire assessed demographics, stress, mindfulness, self-efficacy in finding a job and motivation.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Stress</italic></bold> is measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486095">Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983</xref>). It is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It measures the degree to which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. Moreover, the questions are of a general nature and hence are relatively free of content specific to any sub-population group. The questions in the PSS ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month. In each case, respondents are asked how often they felt a certain way. Examples of items include “In the past month, how often have you felt that things were going your way?” “In the past month, how often have you felt nervous and stressed?” The PSS comprises 14 items and is a Likert-type scale. Its response scale ranges from (0), never, to (4), very often (maximum score is 56). The reliability of this scale as analyzed with Cronbach’s alpha was between .84 in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1038416213486095">Cohen et al., 1983</xref>) and .86 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1038416213486095">Koopman et al., 2000</xref>). In the current study, alphas ranged from .92 (pretest) to .83 (posttest). The scale has acceptable reliability for this kind of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1038416213486095">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>). The PSS is stable over time (test–retest reliability r = .80) and correlates r = .62 with the Daily Stress Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1038416213486095">Machulda, Bergquist, Ito, &amp; Chew, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Mindfulness</italic></bold> is measured with the Everyday Experiences Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1038416213486095">Schroevers, Nyklicek, &amp; Topman, 2008</xref>), a validated Dutch version of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1038416213486095">Brown &amp; Ryan, 2003</xref>). The MAAS is a 15-item scale designed to assess a core characteristic of dispositional mindfulness, i.e., open or receptive awareness of and attention to what is taking place in the present. Participants rated each item on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 6 (1 = Almost always, 6 = Almost never). The maximum score is 90. Examples of items are “I tend to walk quickly to get where I'm going without paying attention to what I experience along the way.” And: “I find myself preoccupied with the future or the past.” The measure takes 10 min or less to complete. The reliability of this scale as analyzed with Cronbach’s alpha was .81 in a reliability and validation study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1038416213486095">Schroevers et al. (2008)</xref>. Coefficients in the current study vary from .85 (pretest) to .88 (posttest).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Self-efficacy</italic></bold> with regard to finding a job is measured with the Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213486095">Barlow, Wright, &amp; Cullen, 2002</xref>). It is a 12-item measure that addresses one's perceived level of confidence in job seeking skills. Job-seeking self-efficacy was defined as the perceived ability to perform the skills involved in seeking employment that are salient to people. The responses are rated on a scale of 1 (no confidence) to 10 (very confident). Maximum score is 120. The reliability of this scale as analyzed with Cronbach’s alpha was .93 in a previous study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1038416213486095">Barlow et al. (2002)</xref>. The current study shows alphas of .90 for the pretest and .95 for the posttest, indicating very good internal consistency of the items. Examples of items include “How confident are you in creating a resume?” and “How confident are you in working within a team?”</p>
<p><bold><italic>Motivation</italic></bold> is measured by a self-developed scale. For this purpose, two components of the expectancy-value theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1038416213486095">Feather, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1038416213486095">1988</xref>) were used as a starting point, i.e., the person’s subjective value whether he or she wants to achieve a certain goal (finding a job) and the expectation that his or her goal will actually be achieved. The motivation scale consists of 6 items, a Likert-type scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The maximum score is 30. The reliability of the scale as analyzed with Cronbach’s alpha was .78 in the current study. Example questions are “Having a job is important to me.” “I expect to be back to work again in one year from now.” A high score means high motivation.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1038416213486095" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>To canvass for potential participants for the MBSR training, we approached the Social Security Agency for Employee Insurance (SSAEI) and asked them to introduce us to people who receive unemployment benefit payments. In our presentation to key figures, we gave a concise description of what the MBSR program is and referred to research that has shown that mindfulness-based treatment interventions may be effective for a range of mental and physical health disorders in adult populations. We also emphasized to SSAEI our expectation that MBSR training could be beneficial to people who are currently unemployed and are considering moving into a new job.</p>
<p>Unemployed people were considered to meet the following requirements in order to participate in the current study: a minimum age of 18 years, good command of the Dutch language, absence of severe psychopathology and being able to travel to the training location.</p>
<p>All participants received unemployment benefit payments and were eligible for the MBSR training in the current study. Participation was on a voluntary basis. At the first meeting, all participants committed themselves to attend all group meetings and to spend at least 45 min to 1 h a day, 6 days a week doing one or more of the exercises and assignments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1038416213486095"><title>The MBSR program</title>
<p>The MBSR program has been described extensively elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). It consisted of 8 weekly group meetings lasting 2.5 h each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). Formal mindfulness training exercises aim at developing the capacity for mindfulness (awareness of present-moment experiences with a compassionate, non-judgmental stance) and include a body scan, mindful yoga and sitting meditation. During the sessions, participants did the following exercises. First, the body scan, meant to get them to pay systematic attention to the whole body and simultaneously perceive sensations in various parts of the body. Second, yoga exercises involving stretching and striking poses to increase awareness of the muscular system. Third, sitting meditation, during which the participant’s attention is drawn to the breath, physical sensations, thoughts and emotions. Emphasis is placed on bringing full awareness to the moment-to-moment experience and a non-harming attitude towards the body. Participants are encouraged to investigate what feels appropriate for themselves and to honor their body's limitations. Later, emphasis is given to open awareness meditation, where the field of awareness is expanded to include anything that appears in consciousness or a simple awareness of one's presence in the here and now. After each session, participants were given relevant handouts containing a description of exercises, a story or a poem. After the first, third and fifth session, the participants were also given a compact disc with the body scan, yoga and sitting meditation exercises. Each session started with a discussion of assignments and experiences of the past week and ended with going through the assignments for the coming week. The guided MBSR training program was taught by a certified mindfulness teacher.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1038416213486095" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study investigated the effects of an MBSR training program on reducing stress, enhancing mindfulness, job finding self-efficacy and motivation among people receiving unemployment benefit payments. To our knowledge, this is the first study about the effectiveness of MBSR interventions for treating unemployed persons.</p>
<p>The MBSR training led to focusing more attention to participants’ daily activities (mindfulness), a decrease in stress symptoms, and a greater confidence in the ability to find a new job. Training did not bring about a stronger motivation to look for a new job.</p>
<p>The occurrence of stress reduction is in line with previous research (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486095">Baer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213486095">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213486095">Grossman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1038416213486095">Miller, Fletcher, &amp; Kabat-Zinn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1038416213486095">Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, &amp; Cordova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1038416213486095">Shapiro, Schwartz, &amp; Bonner, 1998</xref>). A reduction of stress symptoms is very likely to be expected, as the MBSR program was originally developed with an explicit intention of decreasing stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>). Since perceived stress symptoms are decreased in unemployed people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1038416213486095">Hannisch, 1999</xref>), MBSR is a training with benefits for this population.</p>
<p>The current study found that after the training participants focused more attention to daily activities or mindfulness. This is also in accordance with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1038416213486095">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1038416213486095">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1038416213486095">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1038416213486095">Segal et al., 2002</xref>). This result is very plausible, since enhancing mindfulness is a central component of MBSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1038416213486095">Williams, Russell, &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the MBSR training program also enhanced the confidence in participants’ ability to find a new job, significantly. An increased self-efficacy brought about by MBSR was also found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1038416213486095">Chang et al. (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1038416213486095">Cayoun and Freestun (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1038416213486095">Grossman et al. (2004)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1038416213486095">Stanley and Murphy (1997)</xref>. As confidence in job seeking skills is no substantive part of the original MBSR course, this is a noteworthy result.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, completion of MBSR training did not result in an increased motivation to apply for a job. We could not compare our results with previous research, because results of literature searches for publications reporting on studies of mindfulness training and motivation did not yield any relevant papers. The most plausible explanation is a ceiling effect. Participants already scored very high on motivation before training, i.e. the score of the experimental group was 27.15 out of 30, leaving little room for an increase. Another explanation is that motivation did not form a part of the training. The idea of MBSR is to pay attention to one’s present experiences, emotions, thoughts and body sensations, such as breathing in a compassionate way, without passing judgment or reacting; the focus is not on activating future behavior. Motivation largely implies a future-oriented aspect. The ability to conceptualize a plan for the future and be affected by long-term future goals is an important element of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1038416213486095">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1038416213486095">Husman, McCann, &amp; Crowson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1038416213486095">Miller, DeBacker, &amp; Greene, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1038416213486095">Simons, Vansteenkiste, Lens, &amp; Lacante, 2004</xref>). Given that motivation is the process that has to do with initiating, guiding and maintaining goal-oriented behaviors, it is unlikely that MBSR may increase participants’ motivation. It may be formulated as follows: “Perhaps it is fitting that mindfulness, a practice focused on observant contemplation rather than action, is associated with neural activity when an individual is just ‘being’ rather than ‘doing’.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1038416213486095">Way, Creswell, Eisenberger, &amp; Lieberman, 2010</xref>, p. 22).</p>
<p>The question remains why MBSR induced a significant enhancement in job self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1038416213486095">Way et al. (2010)</xref> suggest that the answer must be sought in underlying neurological reason. The more mindful one is, the more activation one has in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the less activation one has in the amygdala. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1038416213486095">Hölzel et al. (2011)</xref> state that participating in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program appears to make measurable changes in brain regions associated with memory, sense of self, empathy and stress. They suggest underlying neurological grounds too.</p>
<p>Several limitations may have influenced the results of the current study. First, the measurements in our study were based on self-reports. Consequently, we do not know the extent to which these self-reports accurately reflect stress, mindfulness, self-efficacy and motivation. Naturally, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution, but there are no indications that these findings solely reflect biased respondent reporting. Combining self-report data with data obtained in a more objective manner is recommended for further research. Second, since the current study did not take into account geographical spread, we need to be cautious when generalizing the results of our study to all people receiving unemployment benefit payments in the country. Third, a substantial number of participants dropped out (28%). This is consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1038416213486095">Baer’s (2003)</xref> meta-study. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1038416213486095">Eysenbach (2005)</xref>, such drop-out rates are typically for interventions. A fourth point is that education level is not proportionally represented in the sample. Half of the participants in the sample had a higher education level. We observe a bias against participants with low education level. This is an impediment to generalizing the results of the current study to the nationwide population of people receiving unemployment benefit payments. The question arises whether MBSR training could also achieve similar results among lower educated people. Fifth, a questionnaire was administered 1 week after the end of the course. Although results showed significant improvements for stress reduction, mindfulness and job seeking self-efficacy following the training, we do not know whether the training will show to have a long-term impact on these measures, resulting in a further improvement reported in a follow-up. To assess the durability of the training effects, it would be necessary to repeat the measurements 3 months after the intervention and after 1 year. In future research, it is useful to examine whether the results are enduring even after longer intervals.</p>
<p>In spite of its limitations, our study has several important strengths. First, the current study ventured into a novel domain, i.e., people receiving unemployment benefit payments. Second, measurement error was contained since the study employed established instruments with known psychometric properties. Reliability analysis shows that the measurements satisfy psychometric standards. In the study, validated metrics were used to measure stress, mindfulness, self-efficacy and motivation, allowing for the comparison of findings with the general population and across studies. Both internal and external validity was guaranteed. Third, we applied an appropriate data-analytic strategy, i.e., repeated measures. Fourth, we adopted a theoretical framework that may help to organize research findings across investigations. Fifth, the observed effects of MBSR training on stress reduction, enhancement of mindfulness and self-efficacy were not only statistically significant but also interesting and meaningful.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, the current study contributed to the knowledge of this particular population with regard to stress, mindfulness and self-efficacy in finding a new job. The findings of the current study extend our knowledge about the role of MBSR in training for unemployed people and possible benefits to take active steps towards finding work.</p>
<p>However, speculations about the practical relevance of the study are premature. This work is only a first step, and future studies are needed in this area. From the results available, a larger randomized comparative trial appears to be warranted.</p>
<p>The current study demonstrates that an MBSR course may improve mindfulness and even job finding self-efficacy significantly in unemployed people. In conclusion, mindfulness training may hold promise in select and challenging populations (unemployed people) and also in effects beyond the immediate goals of the training itself.</p>
