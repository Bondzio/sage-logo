<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Huntington’s disease is a degenerative disease of the basal ganglia that has a major effect on cognition, behaviour and especially mobility over a period of 15–20 years. A passive lifestyle has been suggested to influence symptom onset in patients with Huntington’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512473762">1</xref></sup> but it is unknown whether strategies to encourage more active lifestyles could affect disease progression and symptom management in this degenerative disease.</p>
<p>While there is growing belief that exercise delivered in home and community settings may be functional benefit a number of neurodegenerative diseases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512473762">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512473762">3</xref></sup> it is not clear if, or how, exercise may affect people with Huntington’s disease. Only five publications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512473762">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512473762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512473762"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512473762"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512473762">8</xref></sup> to date have employed exercise interventions in the form of either balance training or a combination of muscle strengthening, stretching and cardiovascular exercise in people with Huntington’s disease. Although suggestive of positive impact, none of these studies used a randomized controlled design and the content (mode and dose) of the interventions were poorly defined, thus limiting any firm conclusions. Indeed, a positive or neutral outcome cannot be assumed. Impaired mitochondrial function in muscle cells in Huntington’s disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512473762">9</xref></sup> along with a case report of a Huntington’s disease marathon runner presenting with myopathy years before the predicted disease onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512473762">10</xref></sup> and also a single report in transgenic mice that prolonged running was associated with an accelerated course and a greater reduction in striatal volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512473762">11</xref></sup> sound a note of caution.</p>
<p>Definitive clinical trials are needed in order to establish the role that exercise interventions may have in the management of Huntington’s disease, but safety and feasibility must be established before such trials can be implemented. The purpose of this study was to employ a randomized, controlled design to explore the safety, feasibility and outcomes of a home-based, low-intensity exercise intervention in a group of people with Huntington’s disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512473762" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Sequential eligible subjects with Huntington’s disease were recruited from the South Wales Huntington’s disease clinic in Cardiff between June 2009 and November 2010 for this study (i.e. consecutive subjects who attended the clinic in this period were screened for eligibility; subjects who were eligible and agreed to participate were recruited). Inclusion criteria were: 1) diagnosis of manifest Huntington’s disease with a positive genetic test; 2) Total Functional Capacity (TFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512473762">12</xref></sup> score of at least three; 3) difficulties with walking and/or balance; 4) maintenance of a stable medication regime for four weeks prior to initiation of the study; and 5) not in receipt of any active non-pharmacological therapy such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy. Participants were excluded if they had a history of coexisting neurological conditions, such as stroke; if they had a medical condition that prevented them from engaging in regular physical activity; or if they had cognitive or behavioural symptoms that would prevent them cooperating with the intervention. All participants gave their written informed consent in accordance with Local Research Ethics Committee permission (09/WSE02/24).</p>
<p>Participants who were enrolled in the study were randomly allocated by telephone to either the intervention or control group. Randomization was performed using a minimization procedure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512473762">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512473762">14</xref></sup> to ensure balance between the groups for categorical variables of age and function. These two factors were treated equally (i.e. both age and disease severity were given the same weighting during the minimization procedure). Age was classified into six categories as follows: 1) less than 30; 2) between 30 and 39; 3) between 40 and 49; 4) between 50 and 59; 5) between 60 and 69; 6) more than 69. Similarly, the Total Functional Capacity scale (TFC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512473762">15</xref></sup> was classified into thee categories: 1) TFC scale scores correspond to stage I (11–13); 2) TFC scale scores correspond to stage II (7–10); 3) TFC scale scores correspond to stage III (3–6).</p>
<p>Participants in the control group were asked to continue as normal (usual care) and they were asked not to change their routine in terms of exercise and physical activity during the period of the study. Participants in the intervention group were asked to perform exercises at home three times a week for eight weeks using an exercise DVD, specifically developed for this purpose (for more details about the DVD and the intervention, the reader is referred to Khalil et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473762">16</xref></sup> and Appendix 1 (available online)). A physiotherapist conducted an initial home visit to ensure correct execution of the exercises. Potential benefits and risks, equipment required and special precautions were discussed. Wherever possible, the carer was instructed in appropriate methods to support the participants. After the first home visit, participants were contacted weekly by telephone by the physiotherapist to monitor their progress. In addition to performing the exercises from the DVD, participants were asked to walk once a week for up to 30 minutes at a light intensity and to take rest breaks if they required. They were instructed in the use of the BORG CR10 Rating of Perceived Exertion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512473762">17</xref></sup> for self-monitoring of exercise intensity. Participants were encouraged to progress their weekly walks by decreasing the number of breaks and increasing the intensity toward a moderate level using the BORG CR10 Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. They were also asked to keep an exercise diary.</p>
<p>Adherence to the exercise programme was determined using exercise diaries, and process evaluation was conducted via structured interviews with each participant at follow up; the process evaluation is reported elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473762">16</xref></sup> Adherence was cross-checked with the carer and with participants during the weekly phone calls and at the time of interviews. In addition, standard procedures for monitoring safety were established whereby events could be classified into serious, related and unrelated.</p>
<p>A range of outcomes were evaluated in all participants at baseline and eight week post intervention. This included measures of gait, balance and strength, functional status, levels of physical activity and health-related quality of life. All assessments were conducted at the Research Centre of Clinical Kinesiology (RCCK), Cardiff University. The examiner was not blinded to group allocation; however standard procedures were used and all tests were based on objective measures or were self-administered. Two of the measures (the Berg Balance Scale and the modified motor scale of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale), which are tests with a subjective component to their ratings and thus potentially affected by examiner bias, were videotaped and rated by a blinded assessor using an established methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512473762">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The battery of clinical outcome measures that were used in this study has been shown to have utility in people with Huntington’s disease and other neurological diseases. However, to date, the reliability of the vast majority of these outcomes has not been evaluated in people with Huntington’s disease. Thus test–re-test reliability and the minimal detectable change (MDC<sub>95</sub>), i.e. the minimal amount of change that can be attributed to an intervention above and beyond natural variability,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512473762">19</xref></sup> was calculated for all the outcome measures prior to the evaluation of the exercise intervention so as to aid in interpretation of the data obtained in this study (Appendix 2, available online, provides information on the reliability data collection, analysis and results.).</p>
<p>To obtain gait measures, gait speed and step time coefficient of variation (CV%) were computed for all participants using the GAITRite system (CIR Systems, Inc., Havertown, PA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512473762">20</xref></sup> Footsteps from ten trials of walking at self-determined pace<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512473762">21</xref></sup> were used in the analysis. The Berg Balance Scale, a 14-item test of static and dynamic balance, was used to assess balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512473762">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512473762">23</xref></sup> (out of a possible score of 56, with higher scores indicating better performance). Dynamic balance and lower extremity strength were further assessed using the 30-second Chair Sit to Stand Test, a test that quantifies the maximum number of sit to stand repetitions that can be performed in 30 seconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512473762">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512473762">25</xref></sup> (higher scores indicate better performance).</p>
<p>The Physical Performance Test provided a measure of functional performance, based on completion of specific tasks and the time for completion of each task (range 0–28; higher score indicates better performance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512473762">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512473762">26</xref></sup> Step total representing long-term community-based walking activity was recorded using the Step Watch Step Activity Monitor (SAM) (Cymatech, Seattle, Washington) worn for seven consecutive 24 hour periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512473762">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512473762">27</xref></sup> The Short Form 36 (SF36; version 1) was also used to evaluate the perceived health-related quality of life and level of participation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512473762">28</xref></sup> The scores from the eight subscales of the Short Form 36, as well as the physical and mental summary components (out of 100 for each subscale with higher scores reflecting better quality of life), were used for data analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to the above outcomes, disease-specific measures were evaluated. The total Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512473762">29</xref></sup> motor score was obtained from clinical records and the modified motor scale of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale (mMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512473762">26</xref></sup> was used to evaluate the effects of the intervention to reflect disease-specific voluntary motor impairment. The modified motor score of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale includes 13 items rated on a 0–4 scale with 4 indicating the most severe impairment.</p>
<p>Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 16 (SPSS, Chicago). Follow-up scores were compared across groups after adjustment for chance differences at baseline using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Assumptions of linearity of the covariate and homogeneity of slopes were assessed before proceeding to inferential analyses. Effect sizes, based on the difference in the change score from base line to follow up, were calculated for each of the outcome measures. To aid data interpretation, scatter plots of individual responses, scores at baseline and the change scores were plotted for all variables in which effect sizes were large (≥1.0).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic, controlled feasibility study of a defined exercise intervention in people with Huntington’s disease. We found that a home-based exercise programme of a low to moderate intensity was safe and feasible, and that most individuals demonstrated good adherence to the programme. The latter is important, as reduced motivation is one of the core features of Huntington’s disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512473762">27</xref></sup> Qualitative data from the intervention group, which is reported elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473762">16</xref></sup> revealed that commitment of the carer and supporting the relationship between the carer and the person with Huntington’s disease were key elements to the success of the programme; the main reason for non-adherence in two participants was related to the commitment of the carer. This implies that finding strategies to maximize the successful engagement of the carers in supporting people with Huntington’s disease in the home setting is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512473762">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the feasibility and safety of the exercise programme, the data presented here demonstrates that this intervention led to changes in a range of measures of motor performance, including gait speed, balance and physical functioning. Given the degenerative nature of Huntington’s disease and the relatively short duration of our physical intervention, these are clearly encouraging findings.</p>
<p>We observed improvements in walking speed and gait variability in the majority of subjects in the intervention group with large effect sizes (≥0.8) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215512473762">Figure 2</xref> and additional figures in Appendix 3 for individual cases). Deficits in walking in Huntington’s disease exist early in the life cycle of the disease;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512473762">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512473762">32</xref></sup> they are associated with higher risk of falls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215512473762">33</xref></sup> as well as more nursing home admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215512473762">34</xref></sup> Regular participation in an exercise programme that has potential to influence walking ability is therefore of great interest.</p>
<p>Significant improvements were also found for all outcomes reflective of balance, function and level of physical activity in the intervention group. The Berg Balance Scale, which evaluates components of both static and dynamic balance, has been found to be useful in predicting the probability of falls in Huntington’s disease, with a score of less than 40 identified as the threshold for risk of falls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512473762">23</xref></sup> In this study, two participants in the intervention group who were below this threshold of risk of falls (i.e. Berg Balance Scale score was less than 40) increased scores on the Berg Balance Scale from below 40 to above 40, corresponding to a change from the ‘at risk of fall’ category to that of ‘low risk for falls’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269215512473762">Figure 3</xref>). Importantly, all the changes in measures of gait, balance and function reported here exceed the minimal detectable change (MDC<sub>95</sub>) values calculated in our preliminary work (Appendix 2).</p>
<p>Six out of 11 participants in the intervention group also improved in the disease-specific motor score (mMS) (see scatter plot in Appendix 2). The analysis of the sub-components of the modified motor scale of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale (mMS) (Appendix 4, available online) suggests that improvements in this scale may be related to improvements specifically in finger tapping and hand-alternate movements, in addition to improvements in gait. These findings may be better understood in the context of the exercise programme. The programme included exercises that focused on movement coordination of the upper limbs. Additionally, the use of the exercise DVD provided demonstrations that were augmented by visual and verbal cues. These cues may have been useful in helping subjects to control their speed of movement;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512473762">6</xref></sup> thus improving muscle timing, which may perhaps explain the improvements seen in these activities.</p>
<p>Although the physical intervention delivered in this study was found to result in improved measures of gait, balance, function and levels of physical activity, there was no significant improvement on quality of life as measured by the Short Form 36. Judging by the magnitude of the improvement on the physical functioning subscale and the physical summary component of the Short Form 36 (i.e. the large effect sizes on these subscales) and the perceptions of the intervention reported by participants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473762">16</xref></sup> we suggest that lack of significance in the Short Form 36 may be related to either the small sample size or the duration of the exercise programme. The effect size of 0.8 that we calculated for the physical functioning subscale (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512473762">Table 2</xref>) suggests that we would have needed 42 participants in total to sufficiently power the study on this variable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215512473762">35</xref></sup> We do however caution that given the nature of this feasibility study, the effect sizes and consequent sample size calculations may well overestimate any effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512473762">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>As this study aimed to evaluate feasibility, it was important to document the rate of recruitment. Only 25 (23.6%) out of the 106 consecutive patient who were seen in the Huntington’s disease clinic were enrolled in the study. In particular, availability of concurrent drug trials made recruitment to the study more difficult (all subjects enrolled in concurrent clinical drug trials were excluded from this study). It is reasonable for people with Huntington’s disease who face a long-term disease to choose a pharmaceutical trial that has potential disease modifying properties, rather than an exercise intervention that may influence function in the short term. In general, it should be remembered that difficulties in recruitment are a common problem in clinical research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215512473762">36</xref></sup> This issue may be of even greater concern when recruiting individuals with Huntington’s disease, taking into consideration disease-specific barriers, such as lack of motivation and the need to obtain support from the carer, which may limit opportunities for participation in clinical research and exercise in this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215512473762">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>This work is not without limitations. We considered it important in the first instance to initially demonstrate feasibility, acceptability and benefit, and future studies should most certainly consider how best to control for the confounders that we acknowledge here.</p>
<p>The sample size was small and the main assessor in this study was not blinded to group allocation. We did take steps to blind as far as possible and limit any assessor bias (for example by employing blinded video-rating and further more by the use of an automated process for determining gait parameters). However, the lack of full blinding may have introduced some observation bias, and it is imperative that future studies employ a fully blinded independent assessor.</p>
<p>There were also some observable differences noted on some of the outcomes at baseline. In small studies such as this, perfect balance is difficult to achieve even when using a balanced randomization method (namely minimization) as we did. Furthermore, the potential of regression toward the mean (RTM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215512473762">38</xref></sup> cannot be discounted, in particular for the modified motor scale of the Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating scale (mMS) where the amount of deterioration in the control group was unusually high given the duration of the study (i.e. eight week). We accounted for these limitations in our analyses by using ANCOVA in line with the CONSORT guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215512473762">39</xref></sup> and have further provided individual response data to aid interpretations of the data. It is clearly important to highlight the potential impact that baseline differences (people with different levels of impairments at baseline may respond differently to the applied intervention) may have on future trial outcomes. Indeed, future studies may need to consider evaluating the effects of exercise interventions according to the stage of the disease to ensure homogeneity of groups at the outset, and further to evaluate how people with Huntington’s disease at different stages respond to exercise interventions. Future work also may need to consider the potential of RTM at the study design stage by including more baseline measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215512473762">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>When reviewing the scatter plots of individual cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512473762">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215512473762">2</xref> and Appendix 3), it was clear that three participants in the control group performed consistently worse on most outcomes at follow up. We believe that the deterioration in the control group is unlikely to be owing to variability of performance but could be artificially inflated owing to the lack of an active control group. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were used for all components of the assessment protocol. Piloting of all assessments, including reviewing verbal instructions and methods of scoring, was undertaken before the commencement of the study. It should be acknowledged, however, that the control group in this study received no formal exercise intervention and had no interaction or instruction from a therapist. Furthermore, the attention, encouragement, family support and motivation, among other incalculable interactions, could have rendered the intervention group to become quite different than the control group.</p>
<p>Certainly, the Hawthorne effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215512473762">40</xref></sup> as a result of increased attention and human interaction during therapy was not controlled in our study. Hence, there is a possibility that participants in the intervention group were more empowered and motivated at the follow-up assessment than the control group. Although the specificity of the results presented in this study argues against a general effect of increased attention, the potential for this cannot be ruled out. It is also difficult to discount a ceiling effect in the control group in this short-term exercise programme. Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease with functional loss that occurs gradually over a 15–20-year period, and the aim of an exercise intervention is to delay or slow the progression of the disease over this time period by maintaining functional independence. It is, therefore, entirely likely that large improvements in function would not be achieved in this degenerative disease; however it is an appropriate achievement if function can be maintained for as long as possible. The fact that those in the intervention group achieved similar performance to those in the control group at the end of the eight week exercise programme (where previously they had been worse) can therefore be seen as a beneficial outcome.</p>
<p>Our adherence data relied on participant’s self report, which has its limitations; there is a possibility that participants may have over-reported their participation. However, the relatively large effect size of the intervention and the specificity of the results suggest that participants’ reports were reliable. Every effort was made by the researchers in this study to confirm the reported participation; adherence was confirmed with the carers (when applicable) and with participants during the weekly phone calls and at the time of the interviews.</p>
<p>The exercise programme evaluated here was of short duration and there was no long-term follow up. In future studies, it will be important to examine whether people with Huntington’s disease continue adhering to an exercise programme after formal input is stopped, and furthermore to evaluate any carry-over effects of a programme. Overall, while the home exercise programme in this study was found to be feasible, the recruited subjects were relatively able and hence these results may only apply to a limited range of people with Huntington’s disease. Furthermore, the vast majority of the enrolled subjects had good support from their carer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512473762">16</xref></sup> hence this intervention might not be appropriate for all people with Huntington’s disease where there is less carer input. Therefore, other methods of exercise delivery that includes direct supervision from a therapist, and in which exercise dose can be accurately documented, needs to be investigated in future work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows the potential for exercise as a therapeutic intervention to improve mobility in people with Huntington’s disease, and provides justification for further efforts to evaluate the effects of exercise in this population. Establishing safety and feasibility in the first instance is essential before large scale definitive trials should be considered. Findings from this exploratory study provide the groundwork for larger scale and more detailed exercise studies in Huntington’s disease. Future work with a larger sample should replicate this study to confirm findings. Indeed, future studies should explore the effects of exercise and physical activity in different contexts and with variations in intensity, duration, as well as mode and type of exercise, as part of the exploratory phase before conducting a definitive randomized controlled trial. Within the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215512473762">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215512473762">42</xref></sup> definitive randomized clinical trials should not be undertaken until a variety of doses of therapy are examined at the exploratory stage, in order to fully refine and define the variables that are evaluated and compared. In future exploratory work, examination of the effects on both motor and non-motor symptoms along with mechanistic evaluations is required, and it also remains to be seen whether other types of physical interventions, such as aerobic exercise, are feasible and can be beneficial in Huntington’s disease without causing undue harm. Aerobic exercise in other neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer’s disease, is suggested to have a positive effect on motor and non-motor symptoms including cognitive functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512473762">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215512473762">43</xref></sup> and may have a protective effect by stimulating brain perfusion and improving neurovascular integrity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215512473762">44</xref></sup> This could be a vital area for investigation in this long-term neurological condition.</p>
