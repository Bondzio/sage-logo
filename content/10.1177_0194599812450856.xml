<abstract>
<p>This article discusses how quality-of-life assessment in patients with head and neck cancer might be weighed against survival and how such assessment might be applied in clinical practice. While survival is understandably considered to be the outcome of primary interest, there are several clinical scenarios in which quality of life can be considered as a primary outcome. Quality-adjusted survival is also an important consideration and needs to be incorporated into the results of treatment. However, quality-of-life assessment has hitherto been virtually only a research tool and not been incorporated into clinical practice. Nowadays, speech pathologists and dietitians are integral to the multidisciplinary team that treats patients with head and neck cancer. The main point of this article is to provide a rationale for the proposition that the health psychologist—who is best able to understand and manage the psychosocial issues—should also be included as one of the team.</p>

<body>
<p>Quality-of-life assessment in head and neck cancer patients carries implications not only for current practice but also for future research and clinical practice in head and neck surgical oncology.</p>
<p>Calman proposed in 1984<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812450856">1</xref></sup> that quality-of-life measures the difference or “the gap” between the hopes and expectations of the individual and that individual’s present experience. Our previous experience forms the basis to a large degree for our individual aspirations, which in turn tends to shape how we perceive our current life circumstances.</p>
<p>Many quality-of-life instruments have been proposed for cancer patients. The Wilson-Cleary model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812450856">2</xref></sup> shows that quality-of-life measures can be categorized as objective, patient-generated, or “external” factors.</p>
<p>The objective measures are effectively physiological variables such as voicing and swallowing that can be readily and reliably measured objectively without a patient response. Patient-generated measures include symptom scores, perceptions of functional status, and general health. Added to this is a global quality-of-life measure. There are also several external variables, such as personality, motivation, values, and preferences that patients carry; issues such as alcoholism; and environmental factors such as social, economic, and psychological support.</p>
<p>Most quality-of-life research reports symptom scores and functional status, and a proportion of such studies also include the integrated global quality of life. Those that do not have a global measure use a summative score of symptom scales and functional status measures. Difficulties arise when one tries to make assumptions regarding the relative relationship between various quality-of-life domains and measures.</p>
<p>There is no consistent, simple linear relationship between any measure and the overall (global) quality-of-life score that patients generate. For this reason, it is really most appropriate to capture not only global quality-of-life scores but also specific measures. These latter items include symptom scores, psychological and social functioning, and other domains that are deemed relevant to the disease and the patient population being studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812450856">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is a large body of literature published relating to quality of life in head and neck cancer patients. The number of articles that include both terms <italic>head and neck neoplasms</italic> and <italic>quality of life</italic> has increased exponentially over the past 20 years. It has become effectively impossible for an individual to be cognizant of and up to date with all of this information, with multiple new articles appearing every week.</p>
<p>Quality-of-life assessment in cancer is said to be critical to optimal patient care, comprehensive evaluation of treatment alternatives, and the development of informed rehabilitation and patient education. A recent survey of Belgian otolaryngologists found that 100% of clinicians agreed that quality of life needed to be considered when deciding treatment, and 95% believed that their clinical management influences the patient’s quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812450856">3</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0194599812450856">
<title>Use of Quality-of-Life Measures</title>
<p>Surveys show that only a minority of head and neck oncologists are currently measuring the quality of life in their patients with head and neck cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812450856">4</xref></sup> Moreover, most of the quality-of-life measures that are being recorded are for quality-of-life research rather than routine clinical practice.</p>
<p>If in fact patients’ quality of life is so important, and if there is so much information available, why are not all clinicians measuring it?</p>
<p>Perhaps information obtained by quality-of-life questionnaires is not well understood by clinicians and therefore not considered useful in clinical practice. Moreover, quality-of-life assessment is often perceived to be intrusive or time-consuming, although there is evidence that filling in a quality-of-life questionnaire while waiting to see the doctor has a distinct advantage for the patient. Another issue is that quality-of-life assessment is not a component of a clinician’s core business. Of course, the highest priority for an oncologist when treating a cancer patient is to achieve the best possible survival outcome for the patient. This is also the patients’ perception, as 90% of patients rated “cure” in the top 3 priorities at the time of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812450856">5</xref></sup> Therefore, both clinicians and patients consider survival as the principal issue when treating a life-threatening condition such as cancer of the head and neck.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0194599812450856">
<title>Quality of Life as a Priority</title>
<p>While one accepts the primacy of survival as an outcome, there are situations in which quality of life can be a priority. For example, in palliative care, patients have a terminal disease and survival time is not normally the principal or primary outcome; rather, it is the quality of the survival that is important to the patient. At the other end of the cancer management spectrum, patients who have a very high likelihood of cure will not have survival as the priority because—irrespective of treatment regimen—effectively all patients might expect to be cured. T1 glottic cancer is one such condition in which 95% of patients are cured whether they receive surgery or radiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450856">6</xref></sup> Under these circumstances, quality-of-life issues such as voice quality, posttreatment morbidity, and social and psychological functioning become more important. Other factors may also supervene, such as patient preference, doctor preference, and both the direct and hidden cost of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812450856">6</xref></sup> A third scenario is where different treatments provide equivalent survival outcomes but rather different functional outcomes. Early oral cancer that is treated by surgery is a good example. The treatment options after primary excision may include primary closure, local flaps, regional flaps, or even free vascularized pedicle flaps. Each of these defect repairs carries quality-of-life implications, which then may become the prime consideration for the patient and the surgeon, knowing that the tumor itself will have been appropriately resected, irrespective of the repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812450856">
<title>Counterintuitive Outcomes</title>
<p>It is paradoxical that patients with head and neck cancer report better global health-related quality of life at 1 and 2 years after treatment than that recorded at diagnosis, despite the fact that patients’ physical functioning and symptom scores are worse after treatment. This may be a form of response shift, generated from a change—or recalibration—in patients’ internal standards, perhaps as a function of euphoria of early survival. Disease-free survival, at least in the early years, is likely to be regarded by the patients as an acceptable compromise—or tradeoff—for the symptoms that they carry as a consequence of treatment.</p>
<p>A second unexpected outcome relates to long-term quality of life. It is now apparent that there is a significant deterioration in global quality-of-life scores 10 years after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812450856">7</xref></sup> This latter score is substantially below the baseline quality of life at the time of diagnosis. This also may represent a response shift, wherein patients’ retrospective assessment of their earlier baseline quality of life has been subject to recalibration, given that after 10 years, the threat of the cancer has dissipated but the symptom effects from treatment have persisted. The deterioration is more an expression of time since treatment than a factor of age, because at any particular point in time, age is not correlated with the quality-of-life score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812450856">7</xref></sup> although the possibility of increased comorbidity with time cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>A third observation is that different cultures will report different quality-of-life scores despite the fact that the patients are matched for age, gender, tumor, site and stage, and time since treatment. This seems to reflect the Calman perception of the “gap.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812450856">1</xref></sup> Some cultures will have greater expectations than others. Those in whom the gap is greater will have a poorer global quality of life as there are likely to be personal values and preferences that prevail. Such social and cultural factors are often subtle and not readily apparent or measured by a standard questionnaire.</p>
<p>Therefore, patient-generated data support the notion that quality of life is a function of expectations among patients. It is also apparent that survival is not the only issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0194599812450856">
<title>Quality-Adjusted Survival</title>
<p>The quality-adjusted life-year is a measure of disease burden that includes both the quality and the quantity of life lived. The possibility of combining quantity and quality of life in a single index is based on the idea that the quality of life can be quantified by applying the concept of utility. Within health care, the greater the preference for a particular health state, the greater the utility associated with it. Utilities of health states are generally expressed on a numerical scale ranging from 0 to 1, in which 0 represents the state “dead” and 1 a state lived in “perfect health.” Unpublished data from Auckland shows an average time tradeoff life utility score of 0.87 with 10% of patients recording a life utility of 0.5. This latter can be interpreted as indicating that for every 10 years of survival in their current health status, the patients with a utility of 0.5 would be prepared to sacrifice 5 years in return for a better life status.</p>
<p>There is an observed and consistent correlation between global quality of life at 6 or 12 months after treatment and subsequent survivorship, which has been well documented in several studies in different cultures and on different continents in the past 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812450856">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812450856" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Even though quality-of-life observations have been made mainly on patients who are part of research activities rather than from routine clinical practice, it seems that we should be measuring quality-of-life scores more frequently, and we should probably be trying to improve patients’ quality of life after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812450856">9</xref></sup> This would enable an at-risk patient to be identified.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Control Network through their Distress Management Guidelines states that “psychological distress should be recognised, monitored, documented and promptly treated at all stages of cancer.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812450856">9</xref></sup> In fact, the issue of unmet supportive care needs is important. A recent study of cancer patients showed that about 50% of patients expressed unmet needs at the time of diagnosis and again at 6 months after treatment. Seven of the top 10 unmet needs were psychological in nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812450856">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>So who should manage patients’ supportive care needs? Head and neck surgical oncologists routinely use allied health workers in the person of dietitians and speech pathologists to assist in nutritional and voice/swallowing rehabilitation. Logically, therefore, a health psychologist should be employed to assist in the management of psychological distress. Use of quality-of-life assessment as a routine outcome measure is poorly developed in the practice of head and neck oncology, so psychosocial intervention as a part of treatment is also poorly developed.</p>
<p>While there is little literature examining this, there is a clear need for a health psychologist to be part of the multidisciplinary team. Research has reported results of psychosocial intervention on the quality of life in patients with cancer of the head and neck, but further work needs to be done. If we can identify means of improving patients’ quality of life, it is possible that patients’ survivorship will also improve.</p>
