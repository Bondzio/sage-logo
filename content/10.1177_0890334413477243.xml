<abstract>
<p>Exclusive breastfeeding has been linked to many positive health outcomes, yet its widespread adoption as the primary mode of providing nutrition to infants remains challenging. The most common reported reason for early breastfeeding cessation is perception of inadequate milk production. To augment breast milk production, a substantial number of women turn to herbal galactogogues despite the limited scientific evidence of their efficacy and safety. We conducted a systematic review of published literature to evaluate the efficacy of herbal galactogogues. PubMed was searched from inception to October 2012 using an iterative search process that proceeded from broad categories to specific herbs. Manuscript references were also reviewed. Only experimental studies with objective outcome measures were included. Six trials met our search criteria. Using an adapted version of the CONSORT checklist, each trial was evaluated for potential sources of bias in design and reporting. Shatavari, torbangun, fenugreek, milk thistle, and a Japanese herbal medication were the 5 herbal preparations studied. Five trials found an increase in breast milk production. Several limitations exist that affect the validity of the trial results, including small sample size, insufficient randomization methods, poorly defined eligibility criteria, use of poly-herbal interventions, and variable breastfeeding practices among enrolled subjects. Given the insufficiency of evidence from these trials, no recommendation is made for the use of herbs as galactogogues. Well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials that address the above limitations are necessary to generate a body of evidence as a basis for recommendations regarding herbal galactogogues.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Breast milk has long been accepted as the gold standard of infant nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413477243">1</xref></sup> Although breast milk has been linked to many positive health outcomes, widespread adoption of exclusive breastfeeding as the primary mode of providing nutrition to young infants has been challenging. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care, in the United States, the exclusive breastfeeding rate for infants under 6 months is 16.3%, and 24.6% of breastfed infants received formula before 2 days of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413477243">2</xref></sup> Worldwide, maternal perception of insufficient milk production is the most common reason reported by mothers for early cessation of breastfeeding; reported prevalence is between 30% and 80%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413477243">3</xref></sup> For those mothers in whom milk production has declined and is not responding to nonpharmacologic measures, the use of galactogogues is often considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413477243">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Galactogogues are substances thought to assist in the initiation, continuation, or augmentation of breast milk production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413477243">5</xref></sup> They include pharmaceutical agents and herbal supplements. Recently, the Cochrane Collaboration published a review of pharmaceutical galactogogues given to mothers of preterm hospitalized infants. Two trials of domperidone met the review criteria, and meta-analysis showed a modest increase in expressed breast milk volume of 99.49 mL/day (95% confidence interval [CI], –1.94-201) in mothers of preterm infants given domperidone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413477243">6</xref></sup> As an alternative to pharmaceutical agents, many clinicians recommend the use of herbs to improve milk output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413477243">7</xref></sup> In the United States, it is estimated that 15% of breastfeeding women use herbal galactogogues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413477243">8</xref></sup> whereas in a Norwegian study, this estimate is 43%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413477243">9</xref></sup> Although some evidence exists regarding pharmaceutical drug–herb interactions, there is limited evidence explaining the mechanism of action of herbs as galactogogues. Given the recency and depth of the Cochrane review and the common practice of using herbal galactogogues as an alternative to pharmaceutical agents, we sought to evaluate available evidence regarding the efficacy of herbal interventions in increasing breast milk production.</p>

<title>Search Methodology</title>
<p>Because our goal was to assess <italic>efficacy</italic>, we limited our review to published manuscripts with an experimental design that had an objective outcome measure of breast milk production. The search procedure to identify eligible manuscripts was conducted in 3 steps. First, PubMed was searched from inception to October 2012 using the keywords “galactogogues” or “galactagogues” or “lactogogues” or “lactagogues” (no field restriction), limited to humans and the English language. The search returned 28 articles, 2 of which were randomized controlled trials (RCT) of pharmacologic galactogogues, 15 were reviews, 1 was a practice guideline, 2 were case reports, and the rest were articles that were either observational, survey, or commentary in nature. From these 28 articles, 16 different herbal galactogogues were identified: shatavari, torbangun, fenugreek, fennel, milk thistle, chasteberry, goat’s rue, anise, blackseed, caraway, coriander, dill, alfalfa, blessed thistle, nettle, and red clover.</p>
<p>Next, we searched PubMed using each of the herbal galactogogues (no field restriction), limited to humans and the English language, and following the search criteria: [common name of the herb] OR [Latin name of the herb] AND (lactation OR breast OR milk OR breastfeed). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334413477243">Appendix A</xref> shows a summary of the search results on each herbal galactogogue.</p>
<p>Of the 16 different herbs initially identified, only 7 herbs had articles directly related to the topic of lactation or breastfeeding. As a final search procedure, we reviewed references of these manuscripts. Combining the 3 searches conducted on these 7 herbal galactogogues and the manual search of associated references resulted in a total of 63 articles. Of the 63 articles, only 6 were RCTs. Further review of the references cited by the 6 RCTs did not yield additional experimental studies. The RCTs were reviewed for study design characteristics as well as proposed mechanism of lactogenesis. The proposed mechanism and primary study outcomes for each trial are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413477243">Table 1</xref>. Each trial was also evaluated for potential sources of bias in design and reporting, using an adapted version of the CONSORT checklist as a guide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413477243">10</xref></sup> The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0890334413477243">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Women with uncomplicated term delivery and who reported lactational inadequacy during 14-90 days postpartum were recruited for this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study of shatavari. Lactation inadequacy was defined either as inability to regain infant’s birth weight at 15 days of life, or infant weight gain less than 15 g per day, or mother supplementing greater than 250 mL per day of milk 4 weeks after birth. All mothers diagnosed with lactation inadequacy were advised to exclusively breastfeed and were instructed on proper position and frequency of feeds, as well as maintenance of adequate rest and nutrition. Sixty-four mothers were enrolled and randomized 1:1 into treatment and placebo arms, and 11 mothers failed to complete the trial. The mothers were randomized to receive either 2 teaspoons twice daily of a 100-g mixture containing 15% shatavari by weight for 4 weeks (n = 32), or a physically indistinguishable placebo mixture (n = 32). Adherence was not explicitly reported, although the authors reported that 26 mothers in the treatment arm and 23 mothers in the placebo arm offered supplementary feeding during the study.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was change in serum prolactin level. Additional outcomes were infant weight gain and change in volume and frequency of supplementary feedings. Maternal characteristics at baseline were comparable. Median prolactin level after treatment was 25 ng/mL for the treatment arm and 38 ng/mL for the placebo arm. Although no results of statistical significance testing are reported, these levels were deemed comparable by the researchers. Infant weight gain after therapy for the treatment arm was 30 g/d versus 26 g/d for the placebo arm. These levels were reported as comparable. The researchers concluded that shatavari did not have any effect on milk production.</p>

<p>Women in North Sumatra, Indonesia aged 20-40 years in their last trimester of pregnancy, who were generally healthy and planned to exclusively breastfeed their infants for a minimum of 4 months, were recruited to this parallel randomized trial of torbangun leaves (<italic>Coleus amboinicus Lour</italic>). Women were eligible if they delivered a healthy term infant weighing at least 2.5 kg. Starting on the second postpartum day, 75 subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 into 3 arms: 150 g per day of torbangun leaves served as soup 6 days a week (n = 25); 1 capsule containing fenugreek seeds 3 times per day (n = 25); or 1 sugar-coated Moloco+B12 tablet 3 times per day (n = 25) for 30 days. The amount of fenugreek in each capsule was not reported. The women were followed for an additional 30 days after the initial 30-day supplementation period. Twenty-three subjects from the torbangun group, 22 subjects from the fenugreek group, and 22 subjects from the Moloco+B12 group completed the 2-month study period. Medication count was used to measure adherence for those randomized to the fenugreek capsule group and the Moloco+B12 tablet group; delivery staff checked daily whether mothers in the torbangun group consumed the soup. Blinding of subjects was not achieved, and insufficient information was reported to assess blinding of researchers.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was change in the volume and nutritional quality of breast milk. The difference between pre- and postfeeding weight of the infant in grams was used to calculate milk volume, which was then converted into milliliters using the conversion factor 0.983 mL/g to adjust for breast milk density. There were no significant differences among the 3 groups at baseline. On day 28, the mean breast milk volume for the torbangun group, the fenugreek group, and the Moloco+B12 group was 479 mL (65% increase from baseline), 400 mL (20% increase), and 385 mL (10% increase), respectively. The percent increase for the torbangun group was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Data collected on days 42 and 56 showed that the percent increase in milk volume for the torbangun group remained higher than that of the other 2 groups. The researchers concluded that torbangun leaves enhanced milk production, and the galactogogue effect was sustained even after the supplementation period.</p>

<p>Lactating mothers aged 20-40 years, with an infant younger than 6 months, were enrolled at a single hospital in Kolkata, India in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm trial of shatavari. At least 1 of the following symptoms was present: deficient lactation, pain in breasts during feeding, poor appetite, any anxiety disorder, or an infant that cries just after feeding. Deficient lactation was not defined. Sixty subjects were randomized 1:1 into treatment and placebo arms: 1 capsule 3 times daily containing shatavari root powder for 30 days (60 mg/kg of body weight; n = 30), or 1 capsule 3 times daily containing rice powder as placebo (n = 30) for 30 days (same dosing formula as the treatment group). Those assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignments. Subjects were examined weekly and advised during the study period to avoid contraceptives and steroid-containing drugs and to follow normal feeding technique and schedule.</p>
<p>The primary outcome was percent change in serum prolactin level from baseline to after treatment (actual prolactin levels not reported). Additional outcomes included change in mother’s and infant’s weight, maternal satisfaction with lactation, and maternal satisfaction with the infant’s well-being and happiness.

<p>Healthy mothers from a maternity unit in Ankara, Turkey were enrolled in this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study. To be eligible, the women had healthy term infants, were willing to exclusively breastfeed, and agreed to use a specific breast pump on postpartum day 3. One lactation consultant nurse educated the women on proper positioning, latch-on, and breastfeeding techniques. Sixty-six subjects were enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 into treatment, placebo, and control arms. Mothers in the treatment group (n = 22) were instructed to consume daily a minimum of 3 cups of a commercially available herbal tea (Still tea, Humana) containing 100 mg of fenugreek and other ingredients. The placebo group (n = 22) was prescribed an apple tea daily in the same amount as the treatment group. The fenugreek tea and apple tea were the same color and form. The duration of the intervention was not reported. The control group (n = 22) received routine advice without any specific recommendation. One person randomized the mothers to treatment arms and assessed adherence with tea intake, and 2 other persons blinded to the study collected outcome data. All mothers completed the study.</p>
<p>The outcomes were mean breast milk volume, maximum weight loss as a percentage of birth weight, and days until birth weight was regained. Each breast was pumped consecutively for 15 minutes using the same model of an electric breast pump to measure breast milk volume. Baseline maternal characteristics were comparable in the 3 groups. The mean breast milk volume for the treatment group, the placebo group, and the control group was 73.2 mL, 38.8 mL, and 31.1 mL, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05).

Three of the trials explicitly stated including only term infants as subjects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413477243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413477243">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413477243">27</xref></sup> whereas the Ushiroyama et al study stated including women who had spontaneous labor pain followed by normal delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413477243">28</xref></sup> This information was not reported in the Gupta and Shaw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413477243">15</xref></sup> and Di Pierro et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413477243">25</xref></sup> studies. For those assessing serum prolactin levels, the timing of intervention initiation varied, which is an important consideration given that the role and level of prolactin depend upon the stage of lactation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413477243">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three trials used serum prolactin level as primary outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413477243">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413477243">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413477243">28</xref></sup> Multiple studies have shown that there is poor correlation between serum prolactin level and milk production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413477243">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413477243">30</xref></sup>; thus, studies that rely on this measure alone do not provide usable evidence of galactogogue activity. Four trials measured breast milk volume or change in infant weight as primary outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413477243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413477243">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413477243">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413477243">28</xref></sup> However, only 2 trials explicitly described how breast milk volume was measured, and whether it included milk from breast expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413477243">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413477243">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The trials also used different units of measurement, making comparison of the magnitude of effects difficult. Given the paucity and lack of standardization of experimental studies on herbal galactogogues, it is recommended that future studies include lactation inadequacy as an explicitly defined eligibility criteria and that the timing and duration of intervention be considered to yield clinically significant findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413477243">6</xref></sup> Additionally, future studies should use the same, multiple outcome measures and units of measurement to enable comparison and extension into a generalizable finding.</p>
<p>Outside the review of the trials and biologic plausibility of herbs as galactogogues, there are other limitations to the study of herbal galactogogues. We found variable terminology regarding substances thought to enhance milk production. The use of multiple terminologies makes it difficult to synthesize and pool information necessary to make a consensus on the safety and efficacy of herbal products in increasing breast milk production.</p>
<p>Difficulty in interpreting studies on herbal galactogogues also arises from the lack of attention given to ensuring that enrolled subjects adhere to the same practices throughout lactation. It is requisite in studies of galactogogues that the subjects be comparable, not only on their baseline demographic data but also in their breastfeeding practices, such as whether they are exclusively breastfeeding or supplementing, whether they are feeding or expressing at similar frequencies, and whether they received the same advice on supportive measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413477243">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413477243">11</xref></sup> If mothers in the study have different breastfeeding practices, these differences may confound or modify the association observed. The intervention product may not be the only contributing factor to the presence or absence of galactogogue activity of the product.</p>
<p>Three other reviews were published recently on the topic of galactogogues. Zapantis et al reviewed the prevalence and types of herbs used as galactogogues without systematic assessment of validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334413477243">24</xref></sup> Budzynska et al conducted a systematic review to determine the safety and efficacy of herb use during lactation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334413477243">31</xref></sup> but studies reviewed included surveys and nonexperimental designs and did not include a critical review of validity. Forinash et al reviewed the efficacy of galactogogues (pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical) in the breastfeeding mother,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334413477243">32</xref></sup> and although the review included studies with experimental designs, a systematic assessment of validity was not performed. Our review differs from these manuscripts in that we focused on evaluating the efficacy of herbal galactogogues; thus, we included only published manuscripts with an experimental design that had an objective outcome measure of breast milk production. Given that the available published data on the use of herbs as galactogogues are predominantly based on case reports or anecdotal evidence, we deemed it more important to highlight the areas of concern regarding the design and reporting of the presently limited experimental studies on herbal galactogogues and make recommendations to guide future studies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Currently, the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine does not have recommendations for the use of herbs as galactogogues. Four herbs (shatavari, torbangun, fenugreek, and milk thistle) with potential as galactogogues were reviewed in this article. However, the trials assessing these potential galactogogues had several limitations that decreased the validity of their results. Given the insufficiency of evidence from these trials, no recommendation is made for the use of herbs as galactogogues. Well-designed and well-conducted clinical trials that address the limitations are needed to generate evidence for recommendations regarding the use of herbs as galactogogues. More importantly, before the assessment of clinical efficacy, studies must first provide evidence for the mechanism of action of herbs as galactogogues and their safety through phytochemical and pharmacokinetic assays. This information will lead to a greater understanding of the herbs’ composition, breakdown into active and inactive forms, and bioavailability after ingestion. Any attempt at conducting trials without this a priori information is futile and will add little value to the expansion of our current knowledge. Given the widespread use of herbs among lactating women today, establishing a strong evidence base for herbal galactogogues to guide recommendations is a public health concern.</p>
