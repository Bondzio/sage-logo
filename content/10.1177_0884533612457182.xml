<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death among adults in the United States as 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women will develop cancer sometime in their lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612457182">1</xref></sup> The good news is that the number of cancer survivors (1 in 20 adults in the United States) continues to increase due to early detection, diagnosis, advancements in treatment, and follow-up care. With our aging population, the likelihood of caring for a cancer survivor is increasingly common for all healthcare practitioners. The bad news is that many practitioners are not familiar with the lingering consequences related to the disease and/or treatments—which can be experienced for up to 3–5 years following completion of treatment(s) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612457182">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, many survivors are left to fill in the gaps to unanswered questions, such as, “What do I do now?” and “How do I prevent a recurrence?” A consensus report, “From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Translation,” published by the Institute of Medicine, that we should be aware of recommends that each cancer survivor receive a cancer survivorship plan. In addition to a detailed history of the individual’s oncology medical history, the reports recommends that the plan should also include tips for living a healthy lifestyle and preventing a recurrence as well as contacts for psychological and social services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612457182">2</xref></sup> Many patients with head and neck cancer rely on their feeding tubes for life—although we may be addressing their calorie and protein needs, are we also discussing how the camaraderie that surrounds mealtime or going out to dinner with friends will change?</p>

<p>All patients are considered cancer survivors starting on the day of diagnosis. As stated by Rock and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457182">3</xref></sup> the cancer survivor progresses through a continuum characterized by 3 phases: (1) active treatment(s) and recovery, (2) life after recovery, and (3) facing advanced cancer and end of life. Patients look to clinicians for not only the best medical care but also advice—“What would you do if you were me?” However, many times the information is delivered in a very clinical, matter-of-fact manner. As clinicians, it is our role to provide not only evidence-based care but also care that is compassionate, respectful, and patient centered. Nutrition challenges can arise in any stage of the cancer survivorship continuum. Early recognition and intervention can prevent significant deterioration in nutrition status and quality of life. This issue of <italic>Nutrition in Clinical Practice</italic> (<italic>NCP</italic>) is devoted to cancer, and the invited reviews provide vital information from the experts in the field that can be used for both personal health as well as advice to share with your patients in all settings.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence is accumulating that shows that obesity, lack of physical activity, and diet are factors commonly cited that are associated with an increased risk for many types of cancer. Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cancers of the esophagus, pancreas, kidney, colon and rectum, breast (postmenopausal women), endometrium, gallbladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and thyroid; risk may be increased up to 40% for esophageal and endometrial cancers due to obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457182">4</xref></sup> Aggressive prostate cancer has also been linked to obesity. According to the National Cancer Institute, if the current trends in obesity continue, an additional 500,000 new cancer cases will be diagnosed by 2030 due to obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457182">4</xref></sup> Moreover, obesity is associated with poorer outcomes related to some cancers, including breast cancer in postmenopausal women, as well as colon and rectal cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612457182">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this issue, Thomson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457182">5</xref></sup> provides a timely and extensive review of lifestyle factors that affect breast cancer risk and recurrence. The number of women diagnosed with breast cancer is significant, and breast cancer survivors are active in seeking treatment for self-care and risk reduction. Obesity and physical inactivity not only affect breast cancer risk and recurrence in postmenopausal women, but these characteristics are also associated with a poorer prognosis for breast cancer survivors in general. Moreover as discussed by Thomson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457182">5</xref></sup> cancer survivors, including breast cancer survivors, are at an increased risk for other chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Although these survivors are unlikely to require nutrition support modalities such as enteral and parenteral nutrition therapies, breast cancer survivors are in need of nutrition interventions such as lifestyle counseling to promote weight loss, physical activity, and healthy eating to prevent not only cancer but also overall disease risk reduction. Weight management counseling is particularly critical for breast cancer survivors as many women will be overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. Following diagnosis, weight gain is common. Therefore, weight maintenance should be encouraged for all women undergoing treatment with manageable goals set for weight maintenance/loss along with physical activity posttreatment. Thomson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612457182">5</xref></sup> provides an update on the controversy surrounding consumption of soy foods and breast cancer with data from the recent Life After Cancer Epidemiologic Study (LACE) study showing a 52% reduction in postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen and consuming soy-type foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612457182">6</xref></sup> In addition to evaluation of foods consumed, alcohol intake should also be scrutinized as evidence continues to mount that only 3 alcoholic beverages consumed per week may increase the risk for breast cancer recurrence by 35%, particularly for postmenopausal overweight women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612457182">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Colon cancer is the third most common type of cancer diagnosed in U.S. adults. Vargas and Thompson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457182">8</xref></sup> provide an in-depth review of the pro- and antitumor risk modifiers. Chief protumor modifiers include the consumption of red and processed meats. In their 2007 and 2011 recommendations for nutrition, the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) recommend for cancer risk reduction consumption of a plant-based diet with red meat intake limited to 18 ounces/wk and avoidance of processed meats all together.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612457182">9</xref></sup> Similar to dietary factors associated with breast cancer risk, alcohol intake is also linked with risk for colon cancer. The AICR/WCRF 2011 Continuous Update Report for colorectal cancer cites alcohol as a convincing factor for colon cancer for men, with evidence for women rated as “a probable cause.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612457182">10</xref></sup> Vargas and Thompson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612457182">8</xref></sup> further discuss additional nutrients, fiber, calcium, selenium, and vitamin D that are associated with antitumor properties as related to colon cancer. When considered in the context of the typical American diet—high in red and processed meat, low in calcium, fiber, fruits, and vegetables—one can see why colon cancer is a leading cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>In 2009, consumers in the United States spent $33.9 billion on complementary and alternative therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612457182">11</xref></sup> Although many consumers take a variety of dietary supplements, such as vitamins E and C, β-carotene, and selenium, at therapeutic doses for their antioxidant and potential anticarcinogenic benefits, evidence is growing that dietary supplements do not provide any additional benefits for reducing the risk of cancer and in fact may increase the risk of some cancers. Most recently, the SELECT (Selenium and Vitamin E Trial Cancer Prevention Trial) trial, which studied oral supplementation with selenium (200 mcg/d), vitamin E (400 IU/d of all rac-α-tocopheryl acetate), or both nutrients combined vs placebo in healthy men, found that dietary supplementation with vitamin E significantly increased the risk for prostate cancer in the healthy participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612457182">12</xref></sup> In the vitamin E group, 620 participants developed prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17%; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.004–1.36, <italic>P</italic> = .008) while 575 participants in the selenium group did (HR, 1.09; 99% CI, 0.89–1.22, <italic>P</italic> = .46) vs 529 participants in the placebo group. Interestingly, in the combo group, 555 participants developed prostate cancer (HR, 1.05; 99% CI, 0.89–1.22, <italic>P</italic> = .46). Indeed, the American Institute for Cancer Research, in its lifestyle recommendations, highlights the importance of consuming food over supplements to obtain nutrients. In this issue of <italic>NCP</italic>, Miller and Snyder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457182">13</xref></sup> provide a systematic review of the literature regarding the role of phytonutrients in chemoprevention, which continues to unfold. Unfortunately, cancer survivors are bombarded with advice from well-meaning family and friends about “super foods” that may cure their cancer. In their systematic review of the literature, Miller and Snyder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612457182">13</xref></sup> describe the current evidence regarding potential benefits and potential adverse effects related to phytonutrients and cancer risk. This evidence further supports the AICR/WCRF recommendation for avoiding dietary supplements in favor of consuming real food to obtain nutrients.</p>
<p>Cancer can have a profound impact on nutrition status, functional ability, and quality of life. Unintentional weight loss prior to the initiation of treatment is common and is an independent predictor of reduced survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612457182">14</xref></sup> In fact, significant weight loss leads to cancer cachexia, a detrimental consequence that results in declines in physical functioning, reduced tolerance to treatment, and increased risk for treatment-related toxicities as well as reduced survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612457182">15</xref></sup> In 2011, a framework was developed to characterize and define cancer cachexia: “a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass with or without loss of fat that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutrition support and leads to progressive functional impairment.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612457182">15</xref></sup> In their consensus statement, the authors concluded that a severity scale for cancer cachexia requires further development but state that cancer cachexia can be described as having 3 stages: precachexia, cachexia, and refractory cachexia. Since this may not be a steady downward trajectory for all patients, as patients may enter the spectrum at any given point, nutrition screening is essential for identifying individuals who may benefit from early nutrition assessment and intervention to reverse nutrition deficiencies and prevent further deterioration. Available evidence reflects that nutrition interventions can result in successfully reversing deficiencies and improving clinical outcomes, including improvements in tolerance to treatment, physical functioning, and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612457182">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612457182"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612457182">18</xref></sup> In a recent 2012 meta-analysis, Baldwin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612457182">18</xref></sup> found that nutrition counseling and use of oral nutrition supplements resulted in statistically significant improvements in oral intake and body weight. This is important as weight loss is traditionally used as a surrogate marker for nutrition status in this patient population. In fact, weight loss is graded by most oncologists using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines, which categorize weight loss at 3 cutoff points: 5%, 10%, and 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612457182">19</xref></sup> However, these classifications arbitrarily focus on body weight instead of lean body mass. Thus, in addition to assessing body weight, clinicians should observe for nutrition-related findings that may reflect wasting (eg, temporal wasting, loss of periorbital fat pads) when conducting a physical exam. Although computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies are modalities that can evaluate lean body mass, expense limits their use for such application. However, hand-grip measurements, easily obtained with a hand dynamometer, are an inexpensive and noninvasive technology any clinician can use for measuring muscle strength—subsequent measurements can be used to assess for changes in muscle mass. In fact, hand-grip strength has been shown to predict morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612457182">20</xref></sup> It is also important to identify patients who may be in the refractory cachexia phase for whom interventions are less likely to successfully reverse malnutrition, with attention instead given to relieving disease/treatment-related symptoms to improve functional status and quality of life.</p>
<p>In the article by Tsai,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612457182">21</xref></sup> the importance of lean body mass and the adverse role that sarcopenia plays in the oncology population are described. Sarcopenia enhances the risk for mortality in the oncology population. Importantly, as further discussed by Tsai,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612457182">21</xref></sup> cancer survivors with sarcopenia obesity appear to be prone to treatment-related toxicities more so than patients without sarcopenia obesity, leading to less treatment efficacy related to delays in treatment or reductions in doses. The presence of sarcopenia may also be associated with a lesser time to tumor progression in comparison to nonsarcopenic patients. As previously discussed, physical activity may be critical to surviving cancer. Tsai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612457182">21</xref></sup> adds to this discussion by reviewing the role of physical activity and weight resistance training in maintaining lean body mass and functional status. Other interventions currently under investigation for maintaining lean body mass or reversing losses include testosterone supplementation as well as oral nutrition supplements, such as whey protein, β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate, and ω-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>Surgery is one of the oldest forms of treating cancer. Perioperative nutrition support has been recommended for repleting malnourished cancer patients, with reported favorable benefits continuing to grow. In their thorough discussion on the topic, Huhmann and August<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612457182">22</xref></sup> summarize the evidence related to when to use perioperative nutrition support and what type of formulation(s) may be associated with deriving benefits. On the basis of the current data available, the authors recommend that implementation of perioperative nutrition support therapies be reserved for moderately to severely malnourished patients with cancer or for patients at high risk of not receiving adequate oral nutrition for 7–14 days postoperatively. The authors also discuss the use of immune-enhancing formulations with enteral support therapies. As stated in their article, several meta-analyses have provided support for their use in this patient population. Included in these meta-analyses is the review by Marik and Zaloga,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612457182">23</xref></sup> who concluded that enteral supplements with immune-enhancing nutrients such as fish oils and arginine should be used for all high-risk surgical patients to derive observed benefits such as a reduced risk for infectious and wound complications as well as a reduction in hospital length of stay, particularly when consumed perioperatively.</p>
<p>The importance of early identification of patients who may benefit from nutrition interventions is a resounding topic in this issue of <italic>NCP</italic>. Huhmann and August<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612457182">22</xref></sup> also stipulate that all cancer patients should receive a comprehensive nutrition assessment, pointing out that the use of validated tools is key, and recommend that clinicians should consider using the Patient-Generated Subjective Assessment (PG-SGA) tool. This tool obtains data regarding the patient’s assessment of food intake and functional status along with asking about the presence of nutrition-related impact symptoms (eg, anorexia, early satiety, nausea) that the patient may be experiencing. The remainder of the tool is then completed by the clinician, providing additional information that ultimately is summarized to determine if the patient is well nourished, moderately malnourished, or severely malnourished. This subjective global assessment provides a comprehensive picture of not only the patient’s nutrition status but also the effects of treatment that are affecting nutrition status and functional status—targets for improving quality of life.</p>
<p>In addition to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation are common treatment modalities employed to eradicate the cancer. Ringo and Chen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612457182">24</xref></sup> share a case study regarding a patient who developed sinusoidal obstructive syndrome after an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. As the patient’s clinical status deteriorated, practitioners caring for the patient encountered a variety of challenges with providing adequate nutrition support. This case study reflects the ability to provide enteral nutrition support even in the face of the most challenging of clinical circumstances.</p>
<p>As previously noted, the second phase in the cancer survivorship continuum is “living after recovery.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457182">3</xref></sup> Many cancer survivors are highly motivated to fill gaps in knowledge to exert some control over cancer risk reduction, including seeking information about what changes in lifestyle maybe helpful. In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund, together with the American Institute for Cancer Research, conducted a systematic review of the literature with a subsequent extensive publication (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aicr.org">www.aicr.org</ext-link>) summarizing the evidence for risk reduction through lifestyle for most cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612457182">25</xref></sup> In addition, the American Cancer Society (ACS) just released its 2012 Nutrition and Physical Activity Guidelines for cancer survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612457182">3</xref></sup> Together, these recommendations provide clinicians with evidence-based strategies to combat cancer as well as provide consumers with their own arsenal in this battle. These important guidelines provide comprehensive information regarding specific nutrients and food, use of dietary supplements, and goals to achieve regarding body weight and physical activity. The importance of completing a comprehensive nutrition assessment for cancer survivors undergoing active treatment is also highlighted in the 2012 ACS report.</p>
<p>In conclusion, cancer patients encounter nutrition challenges at many stops along the survivorship continuum. Clinicians must play detective to elicit information regarding nutrition intake and nutrition support therapies as many patients are reticent to report problems. Improving your knowledge and skills in the provision of oncology nutrition can help cancer patients maintain or improve not only their nutrition status but also functional status and quality of life. Follow-up is critical to do so. Furthermore, it is hoped that this issue of <italic>NCP</italic> will serve as a “call to action” to get all healthcare providers involved in translating the latest evidence available for chemoprevention and risk reduction through nutrition and lifestyle strategies. With the recent affirmation of the “Affordable Care Act,” prevention has moved into the limelight, and clinicians should take the opportunity to provide these needed services. In addition, this issue of <italic>NCP</italic> does not touch up the economic, work-related, spiritual, or psychosocial issues of cancer survivors, and they should not be forgotten. Along with nutrition therapies, these issues are related to functional ability and quality of life. To avoid cancer survivors being “lost in translation,” we need to ensure that cancer survivors receive a survivorship plan beginning at the time of diagnosis, continuing throughout the recovery and the living phases that allows cancer survivors to achieve positive outcomes and quality of life.</p>
