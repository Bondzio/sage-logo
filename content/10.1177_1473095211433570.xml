<abstract>
<p>Although planning researchers and practitioners may see planning theory as interesting, its utility for addressing ‘real’ planning practice remains moot. A model is proposed that draws on Bourdieu’s concept of habitus that collapses both the agency/structure problematic and the theory/practice divide. This model draws on the socio-developmentalism of Vygotsky and the philosophical insights of Wittgenstein that are brought together to understand innovation for sustainability in a master-planned community. This is not a one-to-one borrowing of theory from another discipline to shed light on planning processes, but a response to a particular planning problem that draws on multiple conceptual frameworks. The propositions of the model include, first, that practices are embodied social structures that <italic>aconsciously</italic> define ‘the way things are done around here’; second, that existing practices prime our responses to change; and third, that agency is a bid to either extend or defend one’s practices. The implications for planning professionals and researchers are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Planning theory, in its various manifestations is said to be of little use to planning practitioners (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095211433570">Campbell and Marshall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473095211433570">Sanyal, 2002</xref>). One reason for this so-called theory/practice divide is that there has been a proliferation of theories proposed to understand planning processes and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095211433570">Allmendinger, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095211433570">2002b</xref>). The crux of this ‘disconnect’ between theory and what practitioners do is the failure of academics to develop theories that provide a useful analysis of the planning system which can inform change (e.g. change that leads to more democratic processes or environmentally sustainable outcomes) and are of real use to practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095211433570">Hillier, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To be useful, planning theory needs to address power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg, 2004</xref>). But, where is power located and who wields it – how does change happen? Does power reside in the agency of the practitioners engaged in planning outcomes or is the ability to effect change determined by the structures and systems in which they work? In the social sciences these questions are framed by the structure/agency problematic; that is, the question of whether human activity is determined by social structures, such as class, gender and ethnicity, or whether behaviour is a function of agents who have the free will to choose what they will do. For planners this problematic poses the subsequent question, ‘Do we matter?’ That is to say, are the laws, procedures and norms of development so powerful that they make planners’ decisions a foregone conclusion, or are planners able to use their decision-making powers to ensure better outcomes? Who or what are the determinants of urban form and can these, whatever they are, be used to bring about greater environmental sustainability and democracy? How can the gulf between science and politics be bridged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095211433570">Blowers et al., 2007</xref>)?</p>
<p>Recent research into the development of a tool for improving the environmental sustainability of building materials at a master-planned community ‘sustainability showcase’ in Melbourne Australia, explored the nexus between public policy change, innovation and everyday human practices. It argues that a hitherto under- or un-theorized, determinant of innovation for environmental sustainability is <italic>practice</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095211433570">Binder, 2008</xref>). A new model of practice was developed, a model of recursive cultural adaptation (hereafter referred to as the model) which proposes that practice:</p>
<list id="list1-1473095211433570" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>is the embodiment of social structures;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>is the aconscious ‘way things are done around here’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>forms the bedrock for agency, which is the pursuit, or defence, of practice;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>that the modification of a practice is, by definition, an innovation or change.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This article explores planning theory from the perspective of the model. The model proposes a resolution of the structure/agency problematic and the theory/practice divide. This is done by building on Pierre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211433570">Bourdieu’s (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095211433570">1990)</xref> theorizing of practice, in particular his concept of <italic>habitus</italic> which proposes that people’s unconscious dispositions are the expression of social structures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095211433570">Howe and Langdon (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473095211433570">Moulaert and Cabaret (2006)</xref> argue that a Bourdieusian approach can provide planning researchers with new tools that will allow for an understanding of the nature and outcomes of planning practices – insight into the power structures in which they are enmeshed. While habitus has been criticized for being deterministic, it will be argued that this need not be the case and that motivation and agency can be derived from habitus.</p>
<p>The model resolves these problems regarding the nature and motivation of agency by viewing practice as an evolutionary process. This requires understanding the mechanism by which practices are instilled in the body, the role that they play and that, while they establish rules for behaviour, they are not deterministic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1473095211433570">Sharrock and Dennis, 2008</xref>). In fact, practices are the springboard for agency – they are valued, protected and, if fostered, potentially extendable.</p>
<p>Before explaining the model, I will define what I mean by theory and briefly explore four current trends in planning theory. I will then examine the strengths and weaknesses of Bourdieu’s theory of habitus. The case for an evolutionary understanding of practice is then developed by considering the cultural-historical psychology of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473095211433570">Vygotsky (1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095211433570">1998)</xref> and a Wittgensteinian understanding of the step-wise nature of rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1473095211433570">Sharrock and Dennis, 2008</xref>). The case study is presented, followed by an analysis of the implications of the model for planning practice. The elements of the model, habitus/practice, social learning and the nature of rules are then described and discussed. Through this discussion, the theory/practice divide and the nature of agency and human motivation are explored. Finally, the implications for planning, progressive change and for research are discussed.</p>

<title>The ‘problem’ of theory</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1473095211433570">Popper (1966)</xref> consigns the so-called ‘grand’ theories such as Marxism, Freudianism and modernism ‘to the dustbin of history’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1473095211433570">Skinner, 1985</xref>: 5). He is alarmed by what he argues are totalizing and totalitarian conceptual frameworks that threaten liberal democracy. Similar critiques, drawing on the liberation movements of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, reject the objectifying gaze of ‘science’, calling for an end to the subjugation of women, queers, ‘racial’ minorities and the environment. ‘Science’ as a generator of certainty – ‘objective truth’ – is reconceived as being subject to the vagaries of power and relativistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095211433570">Aronowitz, 1988</xref>). This schism led to the ‘science wars’, examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg (2001)</xref>, who argues that natural science theory is radically different from social science theory. This difference is so great that social science theory, such as planning theory, is not really theoretical because of its inability to have the same sort of power as, for example, Newtonian physics. His argument is that natural sciences are context-independent because they produce knowledge that is cumulative and crucially offers explanations and predictions. Similar laws or rules, he argues, are impossible or unlikely to be found by the social sciences because their subject – human actions – is context-dependent. His response to this problem is to redefine the role of the social sciences to create what he calls, borrowing from Aristotle, <italic>phronesis</italic> – a reflexive, value-driven enquiry into specific cases rather than attempting to generate generalities or laws of human behaviour.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg (2001)</xref> marshals several arguments to support his thesis. Space prohibits a thorough engagement with them here; however, it is possible to address his central assumption regarding the ontology of learning and, by inference, his conception of human nature. This is critical, not only because it informs a particular construction of human agency, but also because it underpins many of the other arguments that he makes. He says:
<disp-quote>
<p>The argument in the following chapters is based only on a single property of the (Dreyfus) model, and this property is convincingly established in its original form; namely the qualitative jump from the model’s first three stages to the last two stages, that is, from rule-based, context-independent to experience-based, situational behaviour. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">2001</xref>: 22)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Dreyfus model proposes that learning progresses from novices dealing with context-independent rules through four more levels that culminate (sometimes) in experts who intuitively act in context-dependent ways. The argument hinges on the nature and role of rules and, crucially, posits a didactic abstract engagement with ‘the’ rules while a novice. Flyvbjerg argues ‘(d)uring instruction the novice learns what various objective facts and characteristics of the situation are relevant for the performance of the skill’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">2001</xref>: 11). The problem with this proposition is that it assumes that one needs to learn a rule prior to starting out on the path of mastering the task. Flyvbjerg illustrates the point with the example of learning to drive a car:
<disp-quote>
<p>The student driver learns facts about speed, shifting gears, and he or she learns the rule that when the speed exceeds a certain level, you must shift gears. Both the fact (speed) and the rule (gear shift at a certain speed) are independent of the concrete situation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">2001</xref>: 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In practice, no such a priori rule-learning happens. The attentive proto-driver, perhaps as a 2- or 3-year-old, watches her mother driving, hears the sound of the motor changing, feels the changing momentum of the car during the gear changes and sees the relationship between her mother’s body and the car’s controls – how she uses her feet and hands. Thus, the proto-driver has a context for the development of the rules regarding gear-changing before such a rule might be conceptualized – her sensual engagement with the car and her mother provide a foundation for the rule before she can verbalize or generalize it. To conceive of abstraction as the starting place for learning does what Flyvbjerg seeks to undo – places rationality at the heart of practice, even if it is the starting rather than the endpoint as posited by theories that invoke <italic>homo economicus</italic>, that is, human actors rationally evaluating opportunities in a bid to maximize their benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095211433570">Felin and Foss, 2008</xref>). <italic>Homo economicus</italic> fails to account for the role of the whole person in behaviour, their sensual experience of and engagement with their environment – their embodied emotional and habitual selves – and the way these three aspects are interdependent. The importance of addressing these other aspects of behaviour will be discussed below.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1473095211433570">Vygotsky (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473095211433570">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095211433570">1998)</xref> argues that learning and development take place relationally. He called this relationship the zone of proximal development (ZPD). This space arises when the ‘student’ has a need to learn and there is a ‘teacher’ present to provide the ‘lesson’. As such, learning is not context-independent, there is always a context – the relationship defined by learner and teacher. Furthermore, both the learner and teacher are necessary to engender a zone of proximal development. Moreover, this is not necessarily a didactic relationship. Experience of the world and culture ‘teaches’ much that is not formally codified yet predisposes us to act in particular ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211433570">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). Flyvbjerg relies on the supposed distinction between early rationalistic context-independent and intuitive more-developed context-dependent behaviour to assert that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Existing research provides no evidence that intuition and judgement can be externalized into rules and explanations, which, if followed, led to the same result as intuitive behaviour. Such externalisation is possible only for analytical rationality, that is, for those skills which characterize the lower levels in the learning process. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">2001</xref>: 21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Flyvbjerg extrapolates from this proposition to conclude that theorizing context-dependent phenomenon, like human behaviour, is simply not possible. For him, theory, by definition, is necessarily context-independent – generalizable – and as already noted, powerful. It is in his conception of the power of the natural sciences that he makes a further critical error. He argues that this power is a function of the knowledge that is produced – context-independent theory. This reifies theory by proposing that it operates at a meta-phenomenological level, rather than conceiving it as a tool developed to understand <italic>particular</italic> phenomenon. The natural sciences are not more powerful than the social sciences because of a difference in the understandings that can be generated but because of the differences in how the subjects behave and can be used. At the heart of this difference is the nature of causality. To cause an effect is by definition power. The objects of the natural sciences tend to be more receptive to experimentation and <italic>use</italic> than those studied by the social sciences. Humans do not respond as billiard balls do – acting with mathematical precision to the forces applied to them. Humans have agency – they react and are political. The generalizations that can be drawn regarding the behaviour of particular substances is a function of the malleability of the substances rather than some fundamental and unavoidable ontological problem. The so-called ‘problem’ of the social sciences is political and, importantly, the natural sciences are also not immune to political forces. Natural sciences that create knowledge and technologies that capitalism finds <italic>useful</italic> will be successful. However, if you are a climate scientist, your theory may not be so welcomed. Similarly, the social sciences that produce useful theory that legitimates capitalist exploitation through, for example, neoliberalism or objectivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1473095211433570">Rand, 1963</xref>), will be valorized. However, unpalatable theory and insights that run counter to prevailing exploitative practices will be derided and marginalized. No scientific theory is universal. Theories are, nevertheless, all useful, at least for a time, regardless of whether they are context-dependent or -independent. Indeed, to talk of context-independence is to forget that natural sciences’ rules and theories are derived from an empirical engagement with reality – they are simply the conceptual codification of materials that behave in regular ways.</p>
<p>What I am suggesting here is that there is nothing special about ‘theory’ – the ‘problems’ that it faces are the same as those present when there is any proposed change of existing practice. To conceive of theory as the <italic>means</italic> by which change happens and, if it fails, to then condemn it is to maintain the Cartesian mind/body split. Rather than conceiving of theory as being the product of an idealized mind struggling to overcome the limitations of perception, ideas are tools for understanding and extending practice. Locating theory at the level of practice explains why different practices engender different theories, even when the same ‘object’ is being considered – the practices and theories of a Papua New Guinea highlander towards a pig are incommensurate with those of an orthodox Jew, irrespective of its ‘nature’. It is the <italic>use</italic> of the pig, the practices that it is enmeshed within, that define the theories that make it <italic>sensible</italic>. It also explains why ideas and theories may come and go while positivist practices remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg, 2004</xref>) – they are useful.</p>
<p>The practices that exist do so because they usefully moderate and define the relationship between humans and their socio-physical environment – they are adaptations that allow us, through the actions they engender, to <italic>fit</italic> our environments. In the same way, our beliefs, ideas and theories are cognitive constructions that allow us to make sense of our relationship with the environment – they determine how we respond, describe and make intelligible our practices with respect to it. Inconsistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg (2001)</xref>, I contend that social science theory is useful. However, critical to the development of a powerful social science theory is grounding the ideas in the practices of people.</p>
<p>Practice, thus, is the substrate on which theory is built. As such the ‘problem’ of planning theory is related to understanding and explaining the nature of planning practice. The model builds on Bourdieu’s theory of practice by proposing that agency is either a defence of existing practice or an attempt to extend it. However, before discussing the model, it is important to critically engage with current trends in planning theory to demonstrate why some have claimed that its utility is debatable (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473095211433570">Sanyal, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1473095211433570">
<title>Trends in planning theory and its ‘problems’</title>
<p>There are several trends in contemporary planning theory. I briefly consider four: (1) communicative planning theory; (2) what can be called ‘the ethical turn’; (3) neo-Freudianism; and (4) the political-economy inspired ‘Just City’ movement – each of which has its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<sec id="section4-1473095211433570">
<title>Communicative planning theory</title>
<p>Communicative planning theory (CPT) draws on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095211433570">Habermas (1984)</xref> and has a procedural focus that seeks to give voice to all of the ‘stakeholders’ in planning processes, so that:
<disp-quote>
<p>through learning how to collaborate, a richer and more broadly based understanding and awareness of locality relations and conflicts can develop, through which collective approaches to resolving conflicts may emerge. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095211433570">Healey, 1999</xref>: 116)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>CPT has been criticized for being utopian, oblivious to context and for not providing strategies that allow effective change in planning policies and outcomes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095211433570">Howe and Langdon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095211433570">Huxley and Yiftachel, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, implicit in the programme proposed by CPT is the idea that planning problems can be ‘rationally’ dealt with by ‘reasonable’ people. However, by focusing on the rational and deliberate aspects of behaviour, the implicit and emotional sides of self are ignored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473095211433570">Schön (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211433570">Bourdieu (1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095211433570">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095211433570">Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992</xref>) argue that practice is underpinned by tacit knowledge. Schön calls this ‘knowing-in-action’ and Bourdieu developed the concept of habitus to account for the way people act without conscious deliberation. CPT takes no account of this part of behaviour – the path-dependency of and emotional commitment to, everyday activity. As such, CPT is not grounded in the everyday practice of planners and this often leads to criticisms that amount to what ‘should’ be done. This has led to some to consider the role of values and ethics in planning decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211433570">Friedmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1473095211433570">Neuman, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1473095211433570">
<title>Ethical planning theory</title>
<p>Akin to CPT are the ideas informed by the ‘ethical turn’ that, for example, posits that planning theory is potentially useful if it can provide guidance to practitioners through: (1) ‘a deeply considered humanist philosophy’ that provides the ethical framework to steer the profession; (2) an orientation to the need for adaptive planning practices; and (3) being open to theory from other disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211433570">Friedmann, 2008</xref>). However, such a didactic, rationalist, values-driven understanding of theory construes individuals, once ‘properly’ educated, as being able to negotiate the contradictions and tensions within planning processes. This idealizes the role of ‘theory’, implicitly proposing that if we could just get ‘it’ (i.e. theory) right, then all would be resolved. Yet, ‘right’ is elusive: ‘the jury on what sort of planning we should have, and how much “knowledge” (and even what sort of knowledge) is necessary for good planning, is, I’m afraid, still out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095211433570">Friedmann, 2008</xref>: 251).</p>
<p>To counter the problem of what specific knowledge might be needed, making values normative has been suggested:
<disp-quote>
<p>A theory that incorporates sustainability in its widest reading, including equity and inclusive democratic participation, <italic>as normative precepts</italic>, and that incorporates the spatial facet of practice, would yield a revitalized theory that we can legitimately call good urban planning theory. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1473095211433570">Neuman, 2005</xref>: 140, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, if sustainability was a matter of course, that is normative, by being either embodied or systemic, one is left to wonder what the purpose of ‘good’ planning theory would be. It seems that this version of ‘normativity’, like Friedmann’s three characteristics, is another call for ethics to drive practice, an approach that similarly places the individual at the centre of the problem/solution. These propositions boil down to the need to instil in the individual conceptual systems, in this case ethical values, which can be deployed to determine planning processes and decisions. However, framing the ‘problem’ as being one of ethics, begs the question, are planners ethically bankrupt or deficient? Research into planners’ experiences in the UK, unsurprisingly reports ‘that ethical considerations are not merely a matter of academic conjecture but practical everyday concern’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095211433570">Campbell and Marshall, 1998</xref>: 126). Furthermore, Campbell and Marshall argue, this ‘everyday concern’ is a function of the constraints brought about by the political economy of Britain.</p>
<p>Hence, ethically focused propositions emphasize the role of the individual while leaving the nature of normativity and the role of the state under-theorized. Further, they propose that the ‘solution’ is to instil the ‘right’ (i.e. the proponents’) values. Yet, even if one assumes that practitioners can be better armed with ethical or other cognitive systems, psychological investigations show that values are only related to behaviour in specific circumstances (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095211433570">Karremans, 2006</xref>). The reason for this is that, at least in part, values do not account for the role that human emotions and habits play in determining behaviour. It is these aspects, in particular the role of affect in planning, that Lacanian neo-Freudian theorizing seeks to address.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1473095211433570">
<title>Neo-Freudian theory</title>
<p>Lacanian theory has been used to consider the subjectivities affecting planning processes, drawing attention to the role of emotions, desires, and ‘irrationalities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095211433570">Gunder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211433570">Gunder and Hillier, 2004</xref>). Gunder and Hillier propose resolutions to human motivation, the taking on of identities like ‘planner’, the inherent inability to account for the desires of all of the ‘stakeholders’ in a planning proposal and the need to attend to the latent or implicit. Furthermore, they argue that examining the discourses that occur during planning processes allows understanding of these procedures, thereby facilitating an appreciation of, for example, the relationship between social structures and agency.</p>
<p>Space prohibits a thorough engagement with Lacan’s extensive work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095211433570">Lacan, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095211433570">2006</xref>). However, two of its shortfalls include, first, theorizing the individual in Cartesian dualistic terms – splitting the mind and the body into separate realms – and, second, proposing a third realm, the <italic>real</italic>, which is unknowable, yet has a defining role in human experience. The real is the place where the ‘unknowables’ of human agency and social structure exist beyond the ken of language and imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095211433570">Hillier and Gunder, 2005</xref>: 1051). As a result, they are the subjects of fantasies that are designed to manage the disquiet that individuals experience from a ‘universal lack’ in the symbolic.</p>
<p>Lacanian theorizing, such as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211433570">Gunder and Hillier (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095211433570">Gunder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095211433570">Hillier and Gunder, 2005</xref>), while a fascinating rendering of the possible subjectivities of planning processes, fails to shed light on its objectivities, like the state, regulation and capitalist exploitation. In keeping with its Freudian roots, such theorizing is pessimistic because it treats humans as fundamentally and unavoidably bereft due to the psychic scars caused by their separation from their mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095211433570">Hillier and Gunder, 2005</xref>). Moreover, psychoanalytic theories, such as Lacan’s, invert the performative nature of identity and internalize it and, in doing so, naturalize or culturally fix identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095211433570">Butler, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Lacanian theory proposes that conflict is inevitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095211433570">Gunder and Hillier, 2004</xref>). As a result, planners who strive for consensus do so in the face of a naturalized and, hence, irreconcilable struggle between people with differing desires. However, the source of these differences escapes this framework. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095211433570">Gunder (2011)</xref> tracks the relationship between ideology and the media but fails to theorize differences in ideological positions. Genuine compromise, win–win scenarios or ‘ethically correct’ decisions are fantasies rather than potentialities. Moreover, the classic political question ‘What is to be done?’ is rendered a folly. Lacanian theory neuters the political because, by theorizing ‘unknowables’, like the ‘lack’ and the ‘real’, it does not foreground the social structures that determine possible action. As such, it does not suggest a way forward to ensure better planning outcomes. It is this question that preoccupies dialectical approaches that focus on questions of social power such as Just City proponents.</p>

<p>Political economists who are interested in planning, following in the footsteps of radical activists like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095211433570">Jane Jacobs (1961)</xref>, respond to the question ‘What is to be done?’ by drawing on the Marxist dictum that change comes through struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095211433570">Fainstein, 2000</xref>). The task, then, is not to focus on policy or professional reforms but on ‘progressives’, especially those in communities resisting development, to help them develop the power necessary to overturn a proposal. However, the forces to be mobilized are not the working class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1473095211433570">Marx and Engels, 1967 [1848]</xref>) but the middle class supported by Just City theorists to create:

<p>To summarize, contemporary planning theories provide insights into particular aspects of planning practices and outcomes. Some do this through having their shortfalls exposed while others identify particular features that might be necessary for a more comprehensive account of planning. These features include addressing the effect of affect – the way that behaviour is not simply dictated by rationality or rational argument; the emotional and habitual aspects of self must be accounted for. Furthermore, we need to build on the understanding provided by Bourdieu regarding the relationship between behaviour and networks of power such as the state, class, gender and so on. Moreover, we need theory that is predictive and powerful – obviously, though, such a theory would be relational – it would need to be systemic rather than linear in its epistemology. These issues are addressed in the next section that presents the model.</p>

<title>Underpinning the model of recursive cultural adaptation</title>
<p>The model rejects the idea that the answer to planning ‘problems’ is ethical or psychological. Although the need for social movements to effect change is accepted, tried and failed political strategies seem doomed. Approaching the problem of theory from a governance perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095211433570">Healey (2009)</xref> explores the relationship between planning and the Pragmatists, a 19th-century philosophical movement, headed by Charles Peirce, John Dewey and William James. However, Healey’s review misses a critical insight provided by the ‘father’ of modern psychology, William James, regarding the role of habit. He argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe that we are subject to the law of habit in consequence of the fact that we have bodies. The plasticity of the living matter of our nervous system, in short, is the reason why we do a thing with difficulty the first time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any consciousness at all. Our nervous systems have (in Dr. Carpenter’s words) grown to the way in which they have been exercised, just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.</p>
<p><italic>Ninety-nine hundredths or, possibly, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and habitual</italic>, from our rising in the morning to our lying down each night. Our dressing and undressing, our eating and drinking, our greetings and partings, our hat-railings and giving way for ladies to precede, nay, even most of the forms of our common speech, are things of a type so fixed by repetition as almost to be classed as reflex actions. To each sort of impression we have an automatic, ready-made response. My very words to you now are an example of what I mean; for having already lectured upon habit and printed a chapter about it in a book, and read the latter when in print, I find my tongue inevitably falling into its old phrases and repeating almost literally what I said before. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095211433570">James, 1925</xref>: 42–3, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Habit is central for understanding the nature of practice. Much of what humans do is automatic and, according to James, is radically social, yet mainstream academia, such as sociology, has ‘forgotten’ its earlier consideration of habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095211433570">Camic, 1986</xref>), as has economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1473095211433570">Waller, 1988</xref>). However, the concept is undergoing resurgence. For example, since the late 1990s the role of habit has been considered by such diverse fields as economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095211433570">Díaz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095211433570">Hodgson, 2010</xref>), environmental behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095211433570">Gregory and Leo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095211433570">Knussen and Yule, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095211433570">Matthies et al., 2002</xref>), health education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095211433570">Aarts et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095211433570">Kremers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473095211433570">Saba and Di Natale, 1998</xref>), information systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095211433570">Cheung and Limayem, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095211433570">Liao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095211433570">Limayem and Hirt, 2003</xref>), media studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095211433570">LaRose et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095211433570">Rosenstein and Grant, 1997</xref>), organizational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095211433570">Cohen, 2007</xref>), medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1473095211433570">Reach, 2005</xref>), neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095211433570">Everitt and Robbins, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1473095211433570">Yin and Knowlton, 2006</xref>) and political science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095211433570">Gerber et al., 2003</xref>). If James is correct in identifying the centrality of habit, its effect needs to be taken into account whenever human behaviour is considered. Planning theorists, too, have failed to theorize a Jamesian account of how habit determines action. No current planning theory addresses this problem. As such, we need a theory that accounts for the whole of human experience, not just a part of it in the form of ethics (cognition) or psychosexual development (emotions).</p>
<p>James’s view on the role of habit is akin to that of Bourdieu’s theorizing of habitus, that unconscious practices – our predispositions – are deployed in everyday life. However, as noted above, habitus has been criticized for being deterministic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473095211433570">Jenkins, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1473095211433570">Mouzelis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1473095211433570">Swingewood, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095211433570">Szwartz, 1997</xref>). To overcome this determinism we need to adequately theorize agency – to understand how and why people are motivated to act.</p>
<p>Bourdieu primarily addresses agency/motivation through a ‘dog-eat-dog’ struggle for cultural capital – the rewards managed within the field in which particular practices take place. For example, he argues that academics compete for cultural capital by, among other things, the acquisition of titles, honours and fellowships, and the kudos afforded by publication in prestigious journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095211433570">Bourdieu, 1988</xref>). As a result, individuals who <italic>play the game well</italic> are rewarded for their ability to beat their competitors. This is an economistic conception – cultural capital is attained and used ‘as a resource (that is, a form of wealth) which yields power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095211433570">Calhoun, 1993</xref>: 69). Furthermore, individuals are locked in a battle for it and, thus, are ‘prisoners of the structures of domination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095211433570">Callinicos, 1999</xref>: 295).</p>
<p>The model resolves the question of agency by considering the means by which practice is instilled in the body and its use. It does this by utilizing Vygotsky’s concepts of the ZPD and his proposition that individuals are active learners in partnership with ‘teachers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473095211433570">1</xref></sup> This, in conjunction with Wittgenstein’s proposal that rule-following, such as that implied in the notion of habitus, is not path-dependent but contingent on context, locates actors within particular frameworks that allow for the pursuit or rejection of proposed changes. Each of these elements of the model is now discussed in turn.</p>
<sec id="section9-1473095211433570">
<title>The conditions necessary for the acquisition of habitus/practices</title>
<p>Practices are ‘taught’/transmitted by those who are ‘qualified’, that is, practised experts who, through the example of their own lives/practices, ‘teach’ individuals everything necessary for ‘survival’, ranging from what to eat and where to sleep, what is safe and what is not, to what to wear, value, aspire to and deride. They structure experience and reproduce themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095211433570">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>). Habitus and habit individuate through the reproduction of the practices that define, for example, class, gender and ethnicity. As such, practices reproduce inherent inequalities and, as will be argued below, the effect of practice is hidden from consciousness unless it is problematized.</p>
<p>As already discussed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1473095211433570">Vygotsky (1965</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473095211433570">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095211433570">1998)</xref> argues that the transmission of practice is a relational phenomenon – a ZPD arises when both the ‘learner’ and ‘teacher’ are actively engaged. Learning and development is additive, scaffold-like. Not only do earlier ‘lessons’ underpin later ones but they also orient the ZPD, prefiguring and setting up the possible next step(s). Thus, practice is historically situated and specifically oriented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1473095211433570">
<title>The role of practice</title>
<p>The model proposes that individuals acquire practices because they need to survive and fit in. Practices are adaptations to one’s socio-physical niche that allow for basic needs to be met as well as being the means by which cooperation is possible – they allow humans to be social animals. ‘Wants’, ‘desires’ and ‘goals’ are secondary individualized motivations that are underpinned by socially derived practices that have already been acquired. However, the motivation underlying practice-acquisition is not simply to be able to perform an activity to achieve a specific end. Rather, alongside their initial utility, practices can take on a variety of additional uses and meanings and these provide additional motivation for their acquisition. For example, driving a car allows the independent movement from place to place. However, in some cultures, driving signifies freedom, independence and the expression of status and wealth – ‘necessities’ in stratified societies. These meanings give driving its changing cultural-economic utility. For example, in Hollywood the hybrid electric-petrol Toyota Prius, like the Hummer, muscled in on the territory previously occupied by sports cars and limousines. Regardless of any intrinsic merit, these cars were made ‘cool’ because role models, such as movie stars and celebrities, drove them. As such, these meanings are not fixed nor do they reside within the objects themselves. Furthermore, meanings are produced to legitimate practice; they are political.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1473095211433570">
<title>The utility of practice: Escaping determinism and determining reality</title>
<p>The model proposes that practices are adaptive. They allow us to ‘use’ the world in which we find ourselves and they survive because of their utility. This is defined as the fit(ness) of a relationship expressed in a practice – the lived expression of the organism/niche. This relationship between the organism and its niche is the key to understanding any ‘why’ of practice.</p>
<p>For example, as a result of the ‘Enlightenment’, the previously dominant practice/theory of religion became eroded by the emergence of empiricism and by more individualistic religious frameworks because, I would argue, the latter provided a better fit with capitalist exploitation. Furthermore, we have bourgeois theories – neoliberalism, individualism, etc. – because they ‘explain’, or more accurately legitimate the economic reality created by capitalism. Practices are adaptations that fit the particular conditions that people find themselves in. Moreover, practices are the means by which culture ‘uses’ us. We are constructed as, for example, workers, single mothers or substance abusers. Thus, the roles we occupy are defined by our practices that we habitually inhabit, day in and day out. We are socially constructed and our practices are determining. Yet practices are not completely determinate. They are not concrete rules from which there can be no deviation.</p>
<p>A Wittgensteinian analysis of the nature of rules shows that they are step-wise, the knowing what to do next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1473095211433570">Sharrock and Dennis, 2008</xref>). However, ‘next’ is conditional. A condition is the state of the socio-physical relationships at the time – the context in which a particular practice and its associated tasks occur. If the next step is ‘safe’, that is, in keeping with the usual flow of the practice, then we aconsciously take it. If, however, there is a change in the context and something is ‘new’, then we attentively engage with the change, checking whether it needs to be accounted for or ignored – this is one of the primary roles of consciousness. Habits allow for the routine enacting of complex tasks while consciousness allows for learning and attentiveness as necessary. Thus, practices allow us to respond to changes in context. Practices allow us to act while thinking, considering and planning. Moreover, they allow us to respond to changes in context. This is a fundamental aspect of the system – <italic>practice affords agency</italic>. Our practices allow us to be in, and respond to, a world in flux rather than having to concentrate on the <italic>minutiae</italic> and cacophony of everyday experience. Practices enable responsiveness and, because they are cultural rather than genetic adaptations, to ensure that they are transmitted, they are valued.</p>
<p>The inculcation of practices requires an investment of time and effort; it is not easy to learn, we have to concentrate and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095211433570">James, 1890</xref>). As a result, we naturally value them once they are acquired. Furthermore, we rely on practices and feel safe in the knowledge that we do not need to attend to what we are doing. Thus, being an expert in a particular practice and ‘knowing’ what to do next creates faith in our abilities. Without this faith, we would be paralysed by doubt. As planners or researchers we ‘know’ that the things we do (i.e. our practices) are ‘correct’ in the same manner that a ‘believer’ has faith in the existence of God – we may create rationalities that legitimate practice but the faith that underpins them operates at a different level – habitus provides a <italic>feel for the game</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095211433570">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>). We also defend our valued, faithful practices. Change and innovation takes place against this background of defended practice. We are all wedded to ‘this is the way things are done around here’, the ‘here’ being the field(s) in which we ‘play’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095211433570">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>). This natural defence of practice is the source of territorial conflict when countervailing practices struggle for dominance.</p>
<p>An ecological understanding of practice being an adaptation to a socio-physical niche makes Bourdieu’s economism as the competition for cultural capital redundant as the driver of practice. This is not to say that competition for cultural capital does not occur, it is the practico-logical behaviour necessary for the maintenance of social and cultural stratification. However, the more parsimonious account of practice-as-adaptation means that we can understand why there are people who do not aspire to reach the heights of their profession by seeking cultural capital and why fields such as domesticity exist without it. The acquisition of cultural capital is but one set of practices that allow a person to ‘fit’ a field. Fit does not demand competition; rather, it is ‘the way things are done around here’. A competitive system, such as capitalism, creates a competitive habitus that is currently manifest as rampant consumerism and over-consumption. The problem is not one of people being ‘naturally greedy’; social structures create consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1473095211433570">Marx, 1904</xref>). Thus, a future epoch, in which social structures facilitate a democratic and environmentally sustainable existence and where ‘supply’ and ‘demand’ are in balance, is possible.</p>

<title>The nature of change</title>
<p>Practices are constant. They are normative – people will be trained to do things tomorrow as they were done yesterday. Planning proposals can be conceived of as sites of potential contradiction – confluences of interests, for example, those of capitalism, the state, aesthetics, and the health and wellbeing of a community are bought to bear. Most planning proposals are designed to modify particular contexts which, understandably, are valued by the local denizens because these are the fields on which their habitus relies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095211433570">Huxley, 2002</xref>). Each habitus, for example that of planners, orients people in a particular way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1473095211433570">Searle and Byrne, 2002</xref>). These contradictions are ‘resolved’ by those most powerfully placed in the design and development phase of the planning process. However, this process is fundamentally governed by the relationships defined by capitalism. The development ‘game’ is biased towards particular outcomes that, by and large, unsurprisingly, more often than not, lead to development. A pre-existing hierarchy of fields and their concomitant habituses, which are enacted by people who ‘know’ that their practices are ‘right’, determines the outcomes. Thus, unless a proposal is challenged, it will be conceived, evaluated, planned, approved and resolved as a matter of course, because that’s the way things are done around here. However, because of the systemic contradictions embedded within planning processes, there is always the potential for crisis when one or more of the fields attempts to redefine the game (e.g. the state, by changing a policy framework, or a community, galvanized by a proposal, fights against change). Crisis and contradictions are key opportunities for challenging undemocratic or unsustainable practices and, hopefully, changing them. They create potential zones of proximal development, providing an opportunity for change.</p>
<p>There are three ways of responding to a change, depending on how an existing practice manages a change in context. First, we can use our existing mastery to manage the situation. We rely on existing practice and ‘get by’ and simply refuse to change. Under such circumstances the perception of the shift in relationships is exogenous – this engenders externalizing the change – it is <italic>their</italic> fault. Under these circumstances path-dependency is maintained – <italic>I’m all right, thanks</italic>.</p>
<p>The second type of response occurs when our practice falls short. In this situation the change is beyond our practised expertise, but the gap is small. This is where step-wise change can happen. The proposed change is one that is in keeping with existing practice and allows for improvement. When a change requires the development of an existing practice, a person is likely to engage with the challenge. Under these circumstances, the practice is modified recursively. This is the idea of building a better mouse-trap. Furthermore, as the system is relational – all of the parts are interdependent – the ‘doing it better’ may be sought rather than being simply a response to an externality. Thus, we may pursue or willingly adapt to perceived better solutions to existing practices. Although practices are inherently conservative in that they are valued, they are also potentially dynamic, open to doing ‘it’ better.</p>
<p>The third response to a challenge to existing practice arises when the social conditions are such that our practices are totally inadequate. Under such circumstances, our existing practices, because they are valued, will be defended. Thus, the natural response to such a situation is to defend one’s existing practices and try to modify the situation so that they can continue to be used.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the inadequacy of a practice necessarily means a defensive response. Although defensiveness is likely, the possibility also exists for a leap of faith that leads to learning a new practice. The conditions necessary for such a change are those present when there is a crisis of such magnitude that the defence of practice is not possible. However, we cannot know in advance that the proposed new practices will work. As such, their acquisition demands a quantum leap, a jump into the unknown. Hence, under these circumstances, propositions for change can only be suggestive, in that they may or may not lead to new practices being adopted.</p>
<p>To summarize, existing practices may be defended or, under certain circumstances, modified or abandoned. Moreover, in cases where there has been an agreement for radical change, if new practices do not replace old ones relatively rapidly, the old ones will re-establish themselves because they already have ‘proven’ value. Life demands that we ‘go on’ and, if a new practice is not useful, we will revert to the ‘valuable’ old one. Practice, thus, can be modified recursively to produce a cultural adaptation, but any proposal’s success depends on the relationship between it and existing practice. Values, as secondary constructs (built upon practice), are not the key to change – practices are.</p>
<p>As noted above, all planning proposals are potential sites of conflict because the practices of the state, developers, the planning professions and the community are unlikely to coincide. As such, they are potential situations in which change might occur. Each field has the potential to destabilize the status quo (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095211433570">Huxley, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, because multiple interests are affected by the change, there will be a variety of responses. These dynamics were explored in a recent case study.</p>

<title>Developing a tool for selecting more sustainable building materials</title>
<p>The model was tested in a recent article and showed that it could account for the innovation process that occurred in the development of a tool, the Eco-selector, which was designed to help builders select more sustainable building materials in a ‘sustainable’ master-planned community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095211433570">Binder, 2008</xref>). Specifically, the research identified three critical sets of habitus that affected the development of the tool. First, that of the organization that commissioned the project, the Victorian government’s land development agency, then known as the Urban and Regional Land Corporation (URLC), renamed VicUrban as a result of an amalgamation with the Melbourne Docklands Authority, was crucial. The URLC set out to create a new benchmark for master-planned communities on several fronts, including environmental sustainability. The corporation saw its mission as leading the industry via innovation. Second, the Centre for Design (CfD) at RMIT University was commissioned on a shoe-string budget to research and deliver the Eco-selector. The CfD’s habitus can be described as research-driven didactic environmentalism. Consistent with this habitus, they saw their role as creating a tool for change by researching what were the best materials currently available so that they could provide builders with this information and, thereby, ‘educate’ them. Thus, both the CfD and the URLC, although having different habituses, specifically those of a land developer and of a university-based environmental research unit, both sought to extend an over-arching habitus of environmental sustainability into the volume housing sector. The third habitus, which was initially unrelated to the Eco-selector planning and design process, was that of the Victorian timber industry. Their products, although normally specified by builders, were prohibited by the Eco-selector tool.</p>
<p>Starting with the first of the three habituses, that of the URLC, the articulation of a vision was a crucial first step in the processes of attempting to transform the existing practices used to plan, design and build master-planned communities. It is noteworthy that this exercise was also a pre-existing practice within the URLC – according to the URLC, its Roxburgh Park Estate (in Melbourne, Australia), at the time nearing completion, had also been a benchmark that was responsible for a wave of innovation across the industry. Once it was clear that Aurora was not going to be run of the mill, the consultants brought together by the project management team quickly drew up an extensive list of features for the estate. However the initial clarity of the vision for Aurora would not be maintained.</p>
<p>The amalgamation of the URLC and the Melbourne Docklands Authority, creating VicUrban in 2003, happened while Aurora and the Eco-selector were being planned and designed. This saw new practices brought to bear on the project. The new CEO, the ex-head of the Melbourne Docklands Authority, subscribed to the managerial nostrum: ‘If I can measure it, I can manage it.’ The tool was transformed from an educational booklet to a planning requirement with specific numeric targets. In this, more or less points were awarded for selecting particular products and deducted for using ‘bad’ products, especially rainforest timbers. This created the potential for a conflict with the CfD. Their habitus, as noted above, is educational. Furthermore, it was understood within the CfD that such scoring mechanisms were not necessarily sound from a methodological perspective – there is no rationale for applying an arithmetic function to nominal data. Nevertheless, this issue would not be a ‘deal breaker’ for the CfD, which complied with the requirements of VicUrban. The dominance of VicUrban’s habitus over that of the CfD resulted in a third habitus having an effect on the tool – that of the Victorian timber industry, who, through their representative, the Victorian Association of Forest Industries (VAFI), labelled the Eco-selector ‘regulation by stealth’, perceiving it as a direct attack on the practices of their members engaged in the extraction of native hardwood timbers. As a result, VAFI used multiple strategies against VicUrban and the CfD in a bid to have their members products included. This proved to be nominally successful and may have also contributed to the tool’s eventual demise.</p>
<p>As a result of VAFI’s actions, the CfD and VicUrban were forced into defensive postures to protect their earlier acts of agency in designing the Eco-selector. Nevertheless, of those whose behaviour was the target of the Eco-selector – the builders – some happily amended their procedures to conform to the new tool, whereas others found the shift away from ‘business as usual’ too great and left the project. As of January 2010 only four of the eight original builders remained at Aurora.</p>
<p>The example of the development of Aurora and Eco-selector as an attempt to innovate for environmental sustainability shows the social and political nature of change. These innovations were not driven by a gifted and powerful entrepreneur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095211433570">Schumpeter, 1934</xref>). Rather, like-minded agents from a variety of organizations came together due to the opportunity <italic>afforded</italic> by the ULRC. The key agents worked against constraints and sought to create opportunities – they passionately engaged with the tasks at hand rather than simply going about their business as usual; neither were they primarily concerned with the ‘bottom line’. This, however, was a concern of the ‘developers’, a faction within VicUrban whose differing habitus created tensions and contributed to some features being dropped from Aurora.</p>
<p>The idea of developing a tool to help builders choose better products might seem mundane. Yet this example, by tracking the habitus and agency of those involved, highlights the multiple forces at play. There is the agency of the creators and detractors of the Eco-selector. Some pursued an extension of their practice, that is, environmental sustainability, others resisted a perceived threat to theirs, specifically, the timber industry. This is set against the background of organizational opportunities for change, initially the vision and later the constraints imposed by a change in management style. The regulatory frameworks of the state were called on with regard to both, through VAFI lobbying the Department of Primary Industries to defend practice and, via VicUrban’s Statute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1473095211433570">Victorian Urban Development Authority Act, 2003</xref>), to legitimate change for environmentally sustainable design. Thus capitalism enabled the exploitation of the land in the name of development and the state sought to both protect the environment and legitimate its exploitation. Hence, the state is shown to foster potentially contradictory practices – it is not a coherent ‘thing’. The examples show that practice is a key to understanding change – how the pursuit of new practices and the defence of old ones accounts for the agency of the individuals and positions and policies of the organizations involved. The organizations provided a context that afforded particular opportunities to act which were pursued by passionate individuals. In <italic>practice</italic> we see the expression of capitalism, the organizational structures that constrain and afford, as well the agency of those individuals who strive and resist change. As such, practice collapses the agency/structure problematic. In fact, the full range of human experience is present.</p>
<p>Thus, the holistic consideration provided by the model can, in all likelihood, provide planning researchers and planners with new insights into planning. Furthermore, if the change process for innovation in planning and delivery of sustainable urban design is as universal as the model suggests (i.e. an adaptive mechanism), then it likely to be of use to planning.</p>

<title>Practice-based planning theory: A programme for investigation and change</title>
<p>Changing a practice is inescapably political. While business as usual occurs ‘under the radar’, changes for greater environmental sustainability or democracy necessarily challenge unsustainable and oppressive practices. While some academics may wish to deny or ignore the implied politics of their ‘findings’, nevertheless, the fulcrum of change is the practices that they are intentionally or inadvertently critiquing.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the model, the following can be concluded regarding the planning theories discussed above. The success of discursive strategies will depend on whether the discussants’ practices are fostered or hindered. If there are unresolved countervailing practices ‘around the table’ then agreement is impossible. Regarding the ‘problem’ of ethics and values: all practices self-legitimate – we all value what we do. The ethical turn puts the ‘cart before the horse’ – it assumes that values change practice, while the model suggests the opposite is true. Furthermore, attempting to instil values that are contrary to practice can only create dissonance. Such a strategy may be useful for setting up the conditions for change (i.e. a zone of proximal development) but, unless the new values equate with actual practice, then they will not have an effect – they, at best, become ‘a good idea but …’. Neo-Freudian analysis at best sees half of the problem. Subjective experience is a function of practice. What is hidden (i.e. the lack) is not the result of psychic scaring, but the aconsciousness derived from mastery. It is necessary to ‘forget’ lessons learnt, or they would constantly overload our consciousness. The problem is that some lessons learnt (i.e. schema and habitus) perpetuate practices that are no longer adaptive, be they interpersonal, economic or ecological. Regarding ‘Just City’ theory, although such theory is social in its orientation, the role of aconsciousness remains unengaged with and, as such, their position tends towards the ethical by focusing on ‘justice’ to create a more humane capitalism, that addresses ‘equity, democracy, and diversity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095211433570">Fainstein, 2010</xref>: 5). This approach, however, does not address the problems of everyday life that, because of capitalism, are systemic. Fainstein, noting the limits of her analysis writes: ‘To the objection that a humane capitalism is an oxymoron, I have no answer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095211433570">2010</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Practices are thoroughly materialistic. They mediate and construct the physical, cultural and psychological aspects of life. As such, they are units of analyses that encapsulate the various aspects of the theories briefly critiqued.</p>
<p>The holism of the model has the potential to bring the various aspects of planning practice into the analytical frame. The case study of Aurora and the Eco-selector illustrates how the change of practice has historical, institutional, practical and motivational characteristics. There is no reason to expect <italic>planning practice</italic> to be exempt from this analytical framework. The model suggests a response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095211433570">Flyvbjerg’s (2001)</xref> critique of the social sciences: that we can develop adequate and potentially powerful transformational strategies based on holistic analytical tools, such as the model. This means that we need to develop multifaceted and possibly multidisciplinary approaches to enquiry. Moreover, we must recognize the inherent political reality of change agendas.</p>
<p>We need practice-based strategies that expose and reconcile real differences and agendas. We need to build alliances around progressive visions that focus on practical solutions to particular problems. We need to move from an accusatory ‘That practice is unsustainable’ to ‘Here is the means by which that process can be modified or superseded to achieve environmental sustainability or democracy.’ Practice is both the problem and the solution. Furthermore, by focusing on the concrete conditions of planning processes and practices, we can transcend the popular idea that propositions made by academics are ‘unrealistic’ because they do not address ‘real world’ constraints. The criticism that planning theory is reified or removed from the ‘real world’ is legitimate but not insoluble.</p>
<p>Our theories, our understandings of the world, cannot be separated from our practice-based co-construction of it and ourselves as individuals. Rather, theories are the inevitable outcome of practice. Planning theory seeks to destabilize the hegemony/reality of planning processes. This is its <italic>Realpolitik</italic>. The problem, however, is that academics tend to use and contest theory at the level of ideas rather than practices. This reifies ideas, elevating them above the material conditions of life. Such theorizing is impotent – a gesture. We need to realize that ideas are used to envision and legitimate particular ‘realities’ and that we need to expose these language games to reveal the politics that they mask. Bourdieu’s concept of habitus/practice is the building block for this. It provides a real understanding of the theory/practice divide.</p>
<p>However, the concept of habitus/practices is not sufficient, in and of itself. What we need to understand is why and how practices develop, and how they change. The model described in this article does this by drawing on the theorizing of Vygotsky and insights of Wittgenstein. Furthermore, it demonstrates that, although most behaviour resulting from habitus/practice is automatic, humans have the capacity for agency when required by the circumstances in which they find themselves. Thus, agency is an expression of from habitus/practice. As a result, the model provides a real way forward. What both academics and planners need to do is to reflexively engage with the habitus/practice of the discipline and how this automatically reproduces social structures. When this is understood, a programme for sustainable and democratic change can be created. Theorizing practice in this way locates the social positions of those involved in planning, and makes sense of the decisions and desires of the participants, not as the choices of free agents (i.e. <italic>homo economicus</italic>), but as socially located and defined agents seeking to defend or extend their practices (i.e. <italic>homo utilitas</italic>). Furthermore, it resolves the structure/agency problematic and unifies the so-called disparate worlds of academic theorizing and professional practice.</p>

<p>The term ‘teachers’ does not refer to a deliberate didactic relationship. Practices can be learnt from anyone or anything that we have a relationship with. We ‘learn’ practices from our primary caregivers. However, potentially these can be learnt from any other person. Furthermore, we learn from inanimate objects by experiencing them. We ‘know’ about mass, space and the other attributes of our material worlds without necessarily needing a human teacher to explain.</p>
