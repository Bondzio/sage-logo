<p>The essence of Ruper Wegerif’s book is summed up in the summary of Chapter 1: Is it really possible to teach thinking? Wegerif argues (p. 1):<disp-quote>
<p>Thinking is not a neat set of procedures that can be taught and learnt easily, it is much more like a way of relating to others and to the world. The child who is both open and questioning when introduced to another person is likely to be both open and questioning when introduced to a new idea. This means that it is certainly possible to teach thinking but only by modelling a thoughtful way of being in the world: listening to children, for example, questioning them and reflecting on and even learning from what they say. Unfortunately teaching thinking turns out to be not at all easy because in order to teach thinking we first have to be thinkers.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The book is based on practical experience in classrooms and the writer proceeds to examine the qualities of interactive, purposeful classroom talk; the essential characteristics of collaborative, creative discovery and play; and the need for children to be encouraged to reason with evidence, and to argue critically.</p>
<p>The text abounds with suggestions for ‘thinking tools’ that allow children to show clearly the processes of their thinking – the tools organizing and crystallizing their thoughts. Importantly, the book explores a range of tools within the field of information and communication technology – the new aspect of the curriculum to promote media literacy alongside language, mathematics and science.</p>
<p>Rupert Wegerif concludes with his vision for education in the future (p. 129):<disp-quote>
<p>Education for thinking is also education for responsibility; both by taking responsibility and for being able to respond with wisdom when challenged. Teaching for thinking and creativity is not just about helping young people to be happy and successful in their futures, it is also about participating in shaping that future and making the world just that little bit better than it might have been otherwise.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This book is a very useful one for all educators – supplying well-supported reasons for engaging in thinking dialogues with children, as well as providing both the theory and ideas for classroom practice.</p>
