<abstract>
<p>Hydatid disease of bone is rare. It remains asymptomatic over a long period. It is usually detected after a pathological fracture or secondary infection or following the onset of compressive myelopathy in cases of vertebral lesions. Secondary infection of hydatid disease of bone could be difficult to treat. The authors present a case of chronic osteomyelitis of the proximal aspect of the left femur in a 37-year-old male patient secondary to hydatid disease of bone. It was treated by aggressive debridement, gentamycin beads, and bone graft to fill the defect. No recurrence of the hydatid lesion or infection was detected after 2 years. This case showed that in addition to aggressive debridement, gentamycin beads may be valuable in eradicating the infection in such a case.</p>

<p>Hydatid cyst disease is a parasitic disease caused by a cestode known as echinococci. <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> is the most common cause of hydatid disease in man.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612451748">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612451748"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612451748">3</xref></sup> Dogs, foxes, and other carnivores are the definitive hosts. When ingested by intermediate hosts such as man, sheep, or cattle, the larvae enter the portal circulation. The larvae eventually reach the liver, where most of them are trapped. Sometimes, larvae reach the lungs and other areas of the body and form cysts.</p>
<p>In humans, hydatid disease involves the liver in approximately 75% of cases, the lung in 15%, and other anatomic locations in 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612451748">4</xref></sup> The frequency of osseous involvement in hydatid disease is 0.5% to 4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612451748">5</xref></sup> It is most commonly seen in the spine and pelvis, followed by the femur, tibia, humerus, skull, and ribs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612451748">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612451748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612451748"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612451748"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612451748">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 37-year-old male patient was presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of purulent discharge from a sinus in the posterolateral aspect of the proximal left thigh. The patient mentioned that he had this active discharge for the last 17 years. He had to change dressing 2 to 3 times daily. The patient history dates back when he was 20 years old, where he was complaining of pain and swelling of the left thigh. Radiological and laboratory studies at that time revealed that he had hydatid disease of bone in the proximal aspect of the left femur. No other hydatid lesion was found in other organs. The patient underwent multiple surgical interventions to treat it but they were unsuccessful. After that he started to have purulent discharge from the posterolateral aspect of the proximal left thigh. Multiple trials of surgical debridement were done but they failed to cure the infection and the patient started to have persistent purulent discharge for 17 years prior to his outpatient visit.</p>
<p>On examination, there was a scar in the posterolateral aspect of the proximal left thigh around the greater trochanter area and there was active purulent discharge from a sinus near the scar. Atrophy of the surrounding muscles was evident. Radiological studies including x-rays, computed tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging were done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612451748">Figure 1</xref>). They showed a cavity below the greater trochanter with sclerotic margins. No hydatid lesions was detected by ultrasound of the liver. Laboratory results were as follows: erythrocyte sedimentation rate 42 mL/h, white blood cells 7.800/µL, hemoglobin 13.2, and C-reactive protein was negative. The patient was admitted to hospital for surgery and intravenous antibiotics.</p>

</fig>
<p>Surgical treatment was divided into 3 stages. The first stage involved excision of the sinus tract, debridement of all infected and necrotic tissues, and irrigation of the cavity with hypertonic saline. Then gentamycin beads were inserted in the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612451748">Figure 2</xref>). The wound was closed in layers. The patient stayed in hospital for 1 week for intravenous antibiotics. After that the patient was discharged from hospital on oral antibiotics and mebendazole. No organisms were detected from samples sent for culture, and biopsy showed the laminated membrane of the cystic wall.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1534734612451748-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>After 1 month the patient was readmitted for the second stage, which involved removal of the first chain of gentamycin beads, debridement of any residual unhealthy looking tissue, and obtaining biopsy samples. Then a second chain of gentamycin beads was inserted. The patient stayed in hospital for 1 week for intravenous antibiotics. Then he was discharged from hospital on oral antibiotics and mebendazole. Biopsy at this time revealed no evidence of hydatid disease.</p>
<p>After 1 month, the patient was readmitted again for the third stage. At this stage, the definitive treatment was done. It included removal of gentamycin beads, burring and drilling of walls of the cavity, and bone grafting. Bone graft used was autograft obtained from iliac crest in combination with Cortoss (which is a bone augmentation material from Orthovita, Inc, Malvern, PA). The patient was discharged home after 1 week.</p>
<p>The patient was doing well after surgery and no complication was encountered. The purulent discharge stopped immediately after the first stage. At the last follow-up 2 years after surgery, the patient was doing well and satisfied. No clinical or radiological recurrence of the infection occurred for the last 2 years. X-rays showed good resolution of bone lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612451748">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The strong structure of osseous tissue limits the growth of the hydatid cyst, which spreads along medullary and trabecular channels. The hydatid cyst lies dormant in the bone for as long as 40 years and most skeletal hydatid cyst cases have been adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612451748">9</xref></sup> Hydatid disease of bone remains asymptomatic over a long period. It is usually detected after a pathological fracture or secondary infection or following the onset of compressive myelopathy in cases of vertebral lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612451748">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common radiological manifestation of skeletal hydatid disease is a lucent expansile lesion with cortical thinning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612451748">11</xref></sup> Giant cell tumors, solitary bone cysts, aneurysmal bone cysts, fibrous dysplasia, bone metastasis, neurofibromatosis, and tuberculosis of the bone should be considered in the differential diagnosis of osseous hydatid disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612451748">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radiologic and serologic findings can generally help establish the diagnosis of hydatid disease. The definitive diagnosis can usually be made by histopathological examination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612451748">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most authors stated that hydatidosis should be considered as a locally malignant tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612451748">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612451748"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612451748">15</xref></sup> Ideally, the treatment should be performed by wide excision of all affected tissue with a shell of healthy tissue, but this is not possible in every bone, such as the femur or pelvis. Surgical excision and curettage are the basic approach for osseous hydatid disease. Only macroscopic cysts can be extracted with surgical excision and curettage. The surgical area might be irrigated with chemical agents in an attempt to kill scoleces (formalin, 0.5% silver nitrate, hypersaturated saline solution, 0.9% saline solution at high temperature). Mebendazole and albendazole can be combined with surgical treatment, which is more efficient than surgery alone.</p>
<p>Hydatid disease can recur at any time. Therefore, long-term follow-up using serological tests, radiographs, and bone scintigraphy should be used periodically to ensure that the disease has not recurred.</p>
<p>Chronic osteomyelitis due to secondary infection of hydatid disease of bone could be difficult to eradicate. We believe that aggressive debridement of the lesion, hypertonic saline irrigation, and gentamycin beads can help eradicate hydatid and treat the secondary infection.</p>
