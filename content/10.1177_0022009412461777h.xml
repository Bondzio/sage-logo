<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777h"><title>Michael Sutton, <italic>France and the Construction of Europe, 1944–2007: The Geopolitical Imperative</italic>, Oxford, Berghahn Books, 2007; xiv + 366 pp.; £42.50 hbk; ISBN 9781845453930</title>
<p>Michael Sutton's admirable book is a very comprehensive and very well researched history of France's European policy since 1944, including economic aspects. Going actually beyond its title, this volume covers most major aspects of French foreign policy, in a precise as well as readable way. This makes the book useful for students, but also for professional historians and the general public.</p>
<p>The main thrust of the book is that France's European policy has been above all about security, both with regard to Germany (mooring it to Europe) and the USSR. Hence the divide between supporters of an integrated Europe and supporters of a ‘Europe of the States’ (Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet and the Fourth Republic on one side, de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic on the other) appears to have been less of a chasm than felt at the time. There has been a certain kind of continuity and consistency from the 1950s to Nicolas Sarkozy's handling, after his election as President, of the consequences of the failed European referendum in 2005.</p>
<p>Another essential insight (and not universally shared) is that for Paris the political and economic aspects of its European agenda were not in concurrence or even separated but rather mingled to form an integrated policy. (Thankfully the author separates the account of both aspects, for clarity’s sake; indeed, discussion of the economy is particularly clear and informed and contributes much to the value of the book.)</p>
<p>But Sutton offers other important insights. These include a discussion of the difficult concept of supranationalism, for Monnet more akin to a technocratic system of efficient cooperation than to true federal integration (45), and the observation that as soon as 1950 de Gaulle publicly presented the concept of European interstate cooperation, which he was to implement after 1958 (69–70). Sutton also offers the very important although much disputed view that for de Gaulle after 1958 there was no contradiction between his Atlantic policy (that NATO should be reformed around a Franco–British–American directorate) and his European policy. Both sustained each other, the linchpin being the special Franco-German relationship. France’s leadership of Western Europe would give Paris more weight in Washington, and its role at the top of the Atlantic Alliance would give France the necessary clout to bring the Five to accept French leadership (88–9).</p>
<p>Sutton also points out the failure of the Fouchet Plan for a political and strategic Union among the Six (a highly geopolitical scheme indeed, in de Gaulle's view) and the wish to keep Great-Britain out (the Nassau conference being more a welcome pretext than a direct cause), which led de Gaulle to the Elysée Treaty of January 1963 with Germany. On that point I beg to differ with the author as I tend to believe that this new departure did not mean a real change of policy and that de Gaulle considered the Elysée Treaty to be a stepping stone towards a future new version of the Fouchet Plan (98–9). In any case the overall concept remained, even after de Gaulle became more and more disillusioned with Germany after 1964 and particularly when Germany appeared to tout too much its economic and monetary power during the franc crisis in the autumn of 1968. That is why de Gaulle, at the beginning of 1969, had reconciled himself to the idea of letting Great Britain in and restarting with her something that had failed with Germany. The ‘Soames affair’ blocked that development for a while, but Pompidou finally solved the problem by accepting the British application to the EEC. He was much more true to the essence of Gaullism, as sometimes understood in his time, and his contribution to the new process of European Political Cooperation (EPC) after 1970 was not a breach with his predecessor. I agree with the author on this, and I would describe EPC as a ‘Fouchet Plan light’ (185).</p>
<p>But for many reasons the whole concept of a French-led Western Europe began to unravel in the 1970s. Some of those reasons, having to do with the Cold War, détente and German <italic>Ostpolitik</italic>, could not be addressed fully in the scope of this book. One aspect that could have been highlighted more is the fact that as soon as Great Britain joined the EEC, it began, with the enthusiastic support of the Benelux countries and the FRG, to reorient the Community towards a much more ‘free trade’ tariff policy and away from that European economic identity the French had had in mind since 1950. Nevertheless, as Sutton shows, the crux was France's failure to keep up with the Deutsche Mark, the dependence of French economy on the monetary policy of the <italic>Bundesbank</italic>, and the desperate efforts in 1979 to regain control of the situation through the European Monetary System. This finally led, due to Paris’s dissatisfaction with that system and the shock of German reunification, to Maastricht and the Euro. The pages devoted to these issues are most important and exceptionally clear. We learn, for example, of the important role played by Raymond Barre (prime minister under President Giscard d'Estaing) in modernizing the French economy and trying to escape from the crucifixion of France on the D-Mark through the high interest rates of the <italic>Bundesbank</italic> (145–6).</p>
<p>The author holds the view – quite rightly, I think – that in foreign matters President Mitterrand was quite attuned to the major mantras of the Fifth Republic: he wanted to achieve a Europe with its own foreign policy and defence but largely failed, as exemplified by the poor European performance in the Balkans, and because, contrary to his expectations, NATO survived the end of the Cold War (297). His successor Jacques Chirac tried to solve the conundrum of French European strategy by accepting the fact that any European defence system could be accepted by the other partners only as a pillar inside NATO, thus putting to rest an issue that had dogged French geostrategic efforts since de Gaulle. France's return to NATO's integrated command structure in 2008 under President Sarkozy, in order to make possible a European defence component inside NATO, might seem to close a cycle opened under the Fourth Republic.</p>
<p>Evidently France was a major beneficiary of the Cold War, and all parameters of French foreign policy were deeply modified after the end of the Cold War and German reunification. That is one of the reasons why this book provides the reader with the satisfactory feeling of having understood a coherent chapter of history, from 1944 to the beginning of a new century. The pendulum might swing back somewhat in future historiography. After all, there was and still is a difference of inspiration between the French ‘Europeans’, envisioning a new kind of Europe, and those who, certainly sincerely, still try to frame their European policies in the Westphalian order. The story of Euratom, eviscerated by the French through, in my view, a short-sighted understanding of French independence, or of the Common Agricultural Policy, where Paris rammed through a system with considerable benefits to France in the short and middle term but which, in the long term, is probably impossible to sustain and politically (<italic>vide</italic> Germany) costly, are good cases in point.</p>
