<abstract>
<p>An existing model for the dynamic analysis of the piston motion in an internal combustion engine has been modified to incorporate a simpler representation of the piston–cylinder interaction, and to represent the main and big-end bearings as lubricated rather than dry journal bearings. The results demonstrate that the differences in calculated bearing forces and output torques are negligible, indicating that the simple dry journal bearing model is sufficient, but show that the modelling of the interaction between piston and cylinder is considerably improved.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211417228"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>A large number of two-dimensional, lumped-mass models of the basic mechanism of an internal combustion engine have been developed. Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211417228">1</xref></bold>] produced a model which was ‘driven’ by applying a gas load to the piston crown and balancing this with a brake load applied to the output shaft. Cho <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211417228">2</xref></bold>] produced a similar model, also modelling the piston as having contact points at the top and bottom of the skirt, and Ruggiero and Senatore [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211417228">3</xref></bold>] extended these two models to include surface waviness. Both Cho and Ruggiero concluded that the lumped-mass systems correlated well with experimental data. Briaris [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417228">4</xref></bold>], with a detailed examination of the way the lubrication film modified the secondary movement of the piston, showed that the presence of the lubrication film greatly modified the behaviour of the piston and the distribution of the load imposed on the piston, as reported by McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>]. The present investigation builds on this recent study and investigates whether introducing a hydrodynamic component into the bearing models would alter the bearing loads. To facilitate this, the original mathematical model (shown in Appendix 2) has been modified and two new models of the single- and four-cylinder engines have been created. A detailed review of piston lubrication and its effects on piston secondary motion, and additional details of the original engine model, can be found in McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211417228"><title>2 BEARING MODEL</title>
<p>The previous engine models of Briaris [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417228">4</xref></bold>] and McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>] assumed that the journal bearings had only elastic contact (i.e. they were non-lubricated), with zero clearance between the two parts of the bearing. In order to assess whether this is an acceptable simplification, a new bearing model has been constructed which includes squeeze film terms and a radial clearance in all the bearings. The engine model also includes a new method of modelling the contact between the piston skirt and the cylinder wall. This new piston skirt model is a very much simplified version of Briaris's finite-difference model, and includes a new squeeze film term as well as retaining the original elastic contact model.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211417228"><title>2.1 Journal bearing</title>
<p>The journal bearing is capable of carrying the load imposed without metal-to-metal contact due to the presence of the hydrodynamic forces generated by the relative rotational velocity of the two halves of the bearing, forming a hydrodynamic wedge, and the relative radial velocity of the two halves of the bearing, forming a squeeze film. It has been argued by Cameron [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417228">6</xref></bold>] that, in the case of the internal combustion engine, the squeeze film term dominates and the hydrodynamic wedge term can usually be ignored. For a wide bearing, the reactive load being generated by the squeeze film term will be

where <italic>W</italic> is the load carried per unit width, <italic>v</italic> the relative radial velocity, <italic>h</italic> the minimum radial clearance in the direction of <italic>v</italic>, and <italic>k</italic> and <italic>n</italic> the constants which have to be determined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211417228"><title>2.2 Equivalent radius of curvature</title>
<p>As the journal bearing consists of two conforming surfaces, the relative radius of curvature is given by
<disp-formula id="disp-formula2-0954406211417228"><label>(2)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-eq2.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> is the convex surface of the shaft (i.e. the journal) and <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> the concave surface of the housing, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211417228">Fig. 1</xref>. In this case, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>c</italic>, where <italic>c</italic> is the radial clearance. As <italic>c</italic> ≪ <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, the equivalent radius of curvature can be shown to be
<disp-formula id="disp-formula3-0954406211417228"><label>(3)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-eq3.tif"/></disp-formula>
For the piston and the big-end and main bearings used in the mathematical model of the engine, the equivalent radii of curvature are 2, 1.25, and 1.5 km, respectively, and the contact length of each bearing is less than 60 mm. This suggests that, as a first approximation, the bearings can each be considered as two flat plates, as the deviation from the flat is less than 0.2 µm. In the manner of Cameron [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417228">6</xref></bold>], for wide bearings the constants <italic>n</italic> and <italic>k</italic> would be <italic>n</italic> = 3 and

where <italic>B</italic> is the length of the bearing, μ the dynamic viscosity of the oil, and <italic>w</italic> the width of the bearing. The value of <italic>k</italic>, using the dimensions of the bearings under consideration, is in the region of (2 → 8) ×  10<sup>−9</sup>, and this range of values was used in the mathematical model of the engine.

<sec id="sec5-0954406211417228"><title>2.3 Piston skirt forces</title>
<p>The piston skirt has been divided into 32 identical pads, each occupying an angle of ±45° either side of the centre, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211417228">Fig. 2</xref>. This number of pads was chosen because no noticeable difference was detected in the results when the number of pads was increased from 16 to 32. The force acting on each of the pads could arise from both elastic and hydrodynamic forces and is determined as follows.

<p>Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211417228">Fig. 11</xref>(a) in Appendix 2, the gap between the piston skirt and the cylinder wall at pad <italic>YP</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is given by

<italic>S</italic> is a correction factor, suggested by Cameron [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211417228">6</xref></bold>], to compensate for the side leakage that will result from the pads not being classed as wide. This leakage will give rise to a reduced load-bearing capacity. <italic>S</italic> also compensates for the fact that the approach velocity is not uniform, the average approach velocity being 90 per cent of the maximum. For the case under consideration, it is obvious that pads at the top of the piston, next to the piston rings, will differ from the pads at the bottom of the piston skirt. The range of correction factors given by Cameron unfortunately does not cover the case in question due to the shape of the pads, and it was decided that pads close to the piston rings could be considered as wide and have a correction factor of 1, and from the middle of the skirt to the bottom of the skirt, the correction factor would reduce to 0.25. This correction factor is based on the distribution of pressure calculated by Briaris [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211417228">4</xref></bold>] using a finite-difference model of the gap between the piston skirt and the cylinder wall

<sec id="sec6-0954406211417228"><title>2.4 Journal bearing forces</title>
<p>If the radial clearance between the two parts of a journal bearing is <italic>c</italic>, then the centre of the shaft can move anywhere within a clearance circle of radius <italic>c</italic> without making contact with the housing. Any movement outside of the clearance circle would result in the elastic contact between the two parts of the bearing. Assuming no contact is made, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211417228">Fig. 3</xref> shows that the position of the centre A of the shaft, relative to the centre O of the housing, is given by

and the angle OAB is given by

The distance AB to the clearance circle, in the direction of the relative velocity of the component parts of the bearing, is given by

where <italic>D</italic><sub>3</sub> is a constant, calculated in a manner similar to <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>.

<p>These equations are used to calculate the forces being carried by the big-end bearing and the main bearings. It is assumed that there will be insufficient oil in the gudgeon pin bearing for the load to be carried by any oil present and the elastic contact model is preserved.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211417228"><title>2.5 Four-cylinder model</title>
<p>The changes to the single-cylinder engine model described above have also been made to the four-cylinder model, which comprises four separate single-cylinder models connected by the torsion in the crankshaft, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211417228">Fig. 4</xref>. The angular arrangement of the crank is 0°, 180°, 180°, and 0°, and the firing order is 1, 3, 2, 4, where the numbering begins at the front of the engine. The primary motion of the pistons is determined, as for the single-cylinder model, by the gas pressure in the cylinders rather than by an assumed steady rotation of the crank, using the pressure traces presented in McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>]. However, with four firing strokes per two engine revolutions for the four-cylinder model instead of the one firing stroke for the single-cylinder model, the two models may be expected to show slightly different dynamic behaviours.
<fig id="fig4-0954406211417228" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of the four-cylinder engine</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As the crankshaft is supported by bearings between each crank, and the length of the crankshaft between each crank is small compared with the diameter of the main bearings, it is assumed that the bending deflection is sufficiently small to be ignored. For the same reason, it was decided that the shear deflection could also be ignored.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec8-0954406211417228"><title>3 RESULTS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417228">Figure 5</xref> shows the secondary movement of the centre of mass of the piston throughout one complete engine cycle at a speed of 4000 r/min, calculated for the models for single- and four-cylinder engines, in a direction normal to the travel of the piston, there being only elastic contact present (i.e. the original model). Positive translations correspond to displacements of the piston towards the thrust side of the cylinder, which in the model detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211417228">Fig. 11</xref> in Appendix 2 is the right-hand side, in the positive <italic>x</italic> direction. The exhaust stroke of the engine is between crank angles 0° and 180°, the induction stroke is between 180° and 360°, compression takes place between 360° and 540°, and the expansion stroke is between 540° and 720°. It can clearly be seen that during the exhaust, induction, and compression strokes, the piston moves from one side of the bore to the other, whereas in the expansion stroke the gas load keeps the piston firmly pressed against the thrust side of the cylinder. It is also seen that there is very little difference between the traces for the single- and four-cylinder models.
<fig id="fig5-0954406211417228" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Secondary movement of piston in <italic>x</italic> direction with elastic contact</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417228">Figure 6</xref> shows the magnitude of the loads on the top and bottom pads on the right-hand (thrust) side of the piston throughout the engine cycle. These pads bear the sideways loads produced when the piston makes contact with the cylinder wall. Anti-clockwise rotation of the piston about the gudgeon pin causes the lower pad to contact the cylinder wall first, and conversely clockwise rotation causes the top pad to make contact first. Transient loads can be seen during the second half of the exhaust, induction, and compression strokes, when the piston displacement is in the positive <italic>x</italic> direction. For the expansion stroke, between 540° and 720°, the two traces show sustained loads of the order of 250 and 500 N on the top and bottom pads, respectively, consistent with the piston being held against the thrust side by the gas pressure.
<fig id="fig6-0954406211417228" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Loads being carried by the top and bottom right-hand pads of the piston skirt of the single-cylinder engine with elastic contact</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417228">Figure 7</xref> shows the secondary movement of the piston when the model includes a squeeze film term. It can be seen that some evidence of the motion shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417228">Fig. 5</xref> is still present, but the movement is now restricted to a range of approximately 0–6 µm, all in a positive direction. Also, there is now a noticeable difference between the traces for the single- and four-cylinder models, because with four firing strokes per two engine revolutions, the speed of the four-cylinder engine remains more nearly constant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417228">Figure 7</xref> compares well with the results published by McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>] and would suggest that the much simplified model of the interaction between piston and bore can be justified as an alternative to the previous model.
<fig id="fig7-0954406211417228" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Secondary movement of piston in <italic>x</italic> direction with lubricated contact</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211417228-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417228">Figure 8</xref> shows the load being carried by the 32 piston pads on the thrust side during a complete engine cycle. It can be seen that the load pattern is similar to the pattern of lateral translations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417228">Fig. 5</xref>, and that the maximum load of approximately 55 N occurs at a point which is close to the position of the gudgeon pin. This value is consistent with the peak pressure of 0.42 MPa previously calculated by McFadden and Turnbull [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211417228">5</xref></bold>] for lubricated contact between the piston and cylinder wall during the expansion stroke and would therefore appear to justify the use of a modest number of pads rather than the much larger number of elements used previously at great computational expense. The maximum load with lubrication is however much lower than the loads on the top and bottom pads with no lubrication shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417228">Fig. 6</xref>.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417228">Figure 9</xref> shows the load being carried by the main bearings of a single-cylinder engine for a complete engine cycle. It can be seen that there is virtually no difference between the trace for the previous elastic contact model and the new squeeze film model, and this is to be expected as the same load has to be carried in both cases. This result is repeated for the big-end bearing and it would suggest that there is no need to over-complicate the design of the models for the big-end and main bearings.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417228">Figure 10</xref> shows the torque being carried by the crankshaft between cylinder 4 and the output flywheel for the dry and lubricated models. It is seen that there is very little difference between the two traces and this is also the case when a comparison is made between the torques being carried by the crankshaft between the other cylinders. The very small difference that can be seen is due entirely to the vibration between the component parts of the non-lubricated model, which is not evident in the lubricated model.

<p>Further simulations at a speed ranging from 2000 to 6000 r/min have confirmed the findings of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417228">Figs 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417228">10</xref>, namely that there is very little difference between the big-end forces and crankshaft torques for the previous elastic contact model and the new squeeze film model, but details of these simulations are not included here because of limitations on journal space.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954406211417228"><title>4 DISCUSSION</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211417228">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211417228">10</xref> clearly show that the loads being carried by the big-end bearings and the torques being carried by the crankshaft are, for all intents and purposes, identical for the lubricated and non-lubricated models. Thus, there appears to be no advantage in modelling the journal bearings as lubricated from the viewpoint of accuracy, and future work can instead be focused on exploring for a range of operating conditions the effects of skirt geometry on piston secondary motion. In fact, there is a distinct advantage in modelling the bearings as non-lubricated when it comes to the computation time. To run the four-cylinder models for six complete engine cycles (the time for the results to become repeatable), 6.8 s are required for the non-lubricated model and 21.3 min for the lubricated model.</p>
<p>While there is no benefit in modelling the journal bearings as lubricated, the non-lubricated and lubricated models of the piston skirt displayed considerable differences, as is clear from the secondary translations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211417228">Figs 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211417228">7</xref>. Furthermore, it would appear that increasing the number of pads from 2 to 32 and going from dry contact to lubricated contact gives a much clearer picture of the way the piston skirt is loaded, as indicated by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211417228">Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211417228">8</xref>. It is suggested therefore that a good compromise would be to have a mixture of lubricated and non-lubricated bearing surfaces.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the results presented here are simulations only, and have not at this stage been confirmed by experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406211417228"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>An existing model for the dynamic analysis of the motion of the pistons in an internal combustion engine has been modified by replacing a relatively complicated finite-difference calculation of the interaction between the piston skirt and the cylinder wall with a simpler calculation which also includes a squeeze film term. The new model also allows the main and big-end bearings to be modelled as lubricated journal bearings rather than dry bearings, but the results have shown that the differences in calculated bearing forces and output torques are negligible, thus confirming that the simple dry model previously adopted is sufficient. However, modelling the piston skirt with some degree of lubrication and increasing the number of pads used to model the skirt give a better representation of the loads on the skirt.</p>
