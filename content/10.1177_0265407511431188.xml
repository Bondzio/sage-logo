<abstract>
<p>This study examines how care recipient impairment and family conflict affect adult children caregivers’ stress. A particular focus is on how the gender of the adult child moderates the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress. Based on a nationally representative sample of 861 adult child caregivers, structural equation modeling indicates that family conflict mediates the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress. In addition, gender plays a key moderator role; that is, the relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict is stronger for caregiving sons than for caregiving daughters. Overall, however, adult sons and daughters experience the stress process similarly.</p>

<p>The family system is important to caregivers’ wellbeing. Existing studies suggest that family relations can be a source of support by providing help for primary caregivers and sharing some portion of care responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265407511431188">Davey &amp; Szinovacz, 2007</xref>). However, when families do not support primary caregivers or care recipients appropriately, or when they disagree with primary caregivers over decisions related to providing care, the family can become a source of stress for caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407511431188">Ingersoll-Dayton, Neal, Ha &amp; Hammer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265407511431188">Lashewicz &amp; Keating, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that family disagreements and conflicts exacerbate caregiver strain and negatively impact caregivers’ health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431188">Scharlach, Li &amp; Dalvi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431188">Semple, 1992</xref>). A small body of literature has indicated that the occurrence of family conflict varies according to the caregiver’s relationship to a care recipient and by the caregiver’s gender. For example, adult child caregivers experience more family conflict than do care-giving spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431188">Semple, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407511431188">Weitzman, Chee &amp; Levkoff, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, women are more likely to experience family conflict in the course of their caregiving than are men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431188">Semple, 1992</xref>). The focus of this paper is on family conflict over caregiving and its impact on adult child caregivers’ stress.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why adult child caregivers experience more family conflict than do spousal caregivers. One is that adult children regard their caregiving responsibilities for their parents as something beyond their primary responsibilities of caring for their own children or spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265407511431188">Raschick &amp; Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004</xref>). In addition, spousal caregivers may accept their caregiving role more easily than adult child caregivers since that role is normatively expected of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265407511431188">Allen, Goldscheider, &amp; Ciambrone, 1999</xref>; Raschick &amp; Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004). Finally, adult children are more likely to expect help in caring for parents, especially from their own siblings and spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265407511431188">Merrill, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>), which may lead to more family conflict.</p>
<p>When focusing on family conflict over caregiving, it is also important to take into account the role played by gender. Previous research found that daughters more frequently provided routine assistance with personal care and assumed more responsibilities overall in caregiving than did sons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431188">Horowitz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265407511431188">Stoller, Forster &amp; Duniho, 1992</xref>). Moreover, daughters are less likely to receive support from their spouses than are sons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431188">Henz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265407511431188">Horowitz, 1985</xref>). Because daughters tend to take on more caregiving responsibilities than do sons, they may be the ones who are in a position to seek assistance when they need help from families more than the sons. The daughters may ask other family members, especially siblings, to become more involved in caregiving and may have to negotiate with them in terms of the distribution of caregiving work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431188">Hequembourg &amp; Brallier, 2005</xref>). These requests for assistance and the necessity of negotiating the delegation of caregiving responsibilities may result in disagreements and dissonance among family members.</p>
<p>In sum, when adult children provide care to a frail parent, they are at risk for experiencing disagreement and conflict with other family members. In an attempt to further explore these issues, we examine a model that investigates the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and stress while considering the gender and family composition (i.e. the existence of siblings or a spouse) of adult child caregivers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0265407511431188">
<title>Conceptual framework</title>
<p>This study utilizes the stress process model, which incorporates the influence of contextual and intervening factors on the relationship between primary stressors and their outcomes. When the stress process model is applied to caregiving situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431188">Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, &amp; Skaff, 1990</xref>), the key constructs are: the caregiving context, primary stressors, secondary stressors, and potential mediators. Scharlach and his colleagues (2006) used the stress process model developed by Pearlin and his colleagues (1990) to examine how the impact of the caregiving situation on the primary caregiver is mediated by family conflict. Scharlach and his colleagues found that the primary stressor of care recipients’ mental impairment affected caregiver strain only indirectly through the secondary stressor of family conflict.</p>
<p>The present study builds upon the basic framework of the model formulated by Scharlach and his colleagues (2006) that conceptualized family conflict as a secondary stressor for caregivers. The model for our study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265407511431188">Figure 1</xref>
) adds to that of Scharlach and his colleagues in four key ways. First, our study focuses specifically on adult child caregivers, who are known to experience more family conflict than other family caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407511431188">Peisah, Brodaty, &amp; Quadrio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407511431188">Weitzman et al., 1999</xref>), while Scharlach et al. studied the general population of caregivers. In addition, Scharlach and his colleagues’ study examined only the effects of the mental impairment of care recipients on family conflict. Our study expands on their model by also examining the influence of care recipients’ functional dependency. The third distinctive contribution of our study is its emphasis on the gender of the primary caregiver. The study by Scharlach and his colleagues included the gender of the primary caregiver as a control variable and found that it had little influence on family conflict. In contrast, others have suggested that the gender of the primary caregiver is a key factor in understanding the dissonance and disagreement over parental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431188">Connidis &amp; Kemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431188">Hequembourg &amp; Brallier, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>). Specifically, our study explores the moderating effect of the gender of the primary caregiver on the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress. Moreover, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431188">Pearlin et al. (1990)</xref>, contextual variables, such as caregiver gender, affect not only each of the stressors and health outcomes but also the relationships among primary and secondary stressors and health outcomes. Thus, the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress may vary depending on the role of gender. Last, our study includes family composition characteristics as contextual variables in the stress process and adds them to the conceptual model as exogenous variables. The family composition characteristics were not examined in Scharlach et al.’s model although such characteristics (i.e. having siblings and spouses) may increase the potential for family conflict among adult children caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431188">Henz, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0265407511431188">
<title>Care recipient impairment and family conflict</title>
<p>A care recipient’s impairment can affect all family members − including primary caregivers, less involved caregivers and even other family members who do not provide care − by triggering negative emotions among the members of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265407511431188">Amirkhanyan &amp; Wolf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431188">Deimling, Smerglia, &amp; Schaefer, 2001</xref>). Due to their responsibilities, primary caregivers may spend less time with other family members and experience changes in the quality of their relationships with other family members, while family members who are less involved in caring for a frail parent may feel guilty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265407511431188">Ingersoll-Dayton et al., 2003</xref>). Several studies demonstrate that a care recipient’s need for care requires the family to adapt to caregiving conditions and leads to changes in family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431188">Deimling et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265407511431188">Lieberman &amp; Fisher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431188">Mitrani et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The effect of care recipient impairment on family conflict may vary with the gender of the primary caregiver. Since daughters, more than sons, provide more domestic assistance and more personal care, both routine and time-consuming activities, daughters generally become more involved in the care of frail parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407511431188">Campbell &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431188">Hequembourg &amp; Brallier, 2005</xref>). This unequal involvement in caregiving work may cause daughters to attempt to more equitably distribute care responsibilities and to negotiate the distribution of caregiving among families, which may result in family conflicts. We hypothesize a stronger relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict for daughters than for sons.</p>

<title>Care recipient impairment and caregiver stress</title>
<p>Previous research indicates that two aspects of care recipient impairment are related to caregiver stress: their mental impairment and their physical impairment. With respect to mental impairment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265407511431188">Ingersoll-Dayton and Raschick (2004)</xref> found that caregivers experienced more stress when care recipients had higher levels of cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. Several studies have demonstrated that mental impairment and problem behaviors of care recipients are powerful predictors of caregivers’ depression and care-giving burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265407511431188">Li, Seltzer &amp; Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265407511431188">Savundranayagam, Hummert, &amp; Montgomery, 2005</xref>). Similarly, the physical impairment of care recipients also influences the level of caregiver stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431188">Pinquart &amp; Sörensen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265407511431188">Starrels, Ingersoll-Dayton, Dowler, &amp; Neal, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431188">Pinquart and Sörensen (2004)</xref> also found that the physical impairment of care recipients had a negative effect on caregivers’ mental health.</p>
<p>Depending on the gender of the primary caregiver, the impact of care recipient impairment on caregiver stress may differ. Starrels and her colleagues (1997) found that the association between care recipients’ impairment and their caregivers’ stress was stronger for caregiving daughters than for caregiving sons. A parent’s increasing need for care is likely to have a stronger influence on the stress of caregiving daughters than that of caregiving sons due to variations in the type and amount of caregiving work performed by daughters and sons. In general, daughters provide the type of personal and home-based care to parents that requires continuous effort, such as making meals, cleaning, and bathing, while it is more characteristic for caregiving sons to conduct occasional and indirect types of caregiving, such as yard work and financial management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265407511431188">Campbell &amp; Martin-Matthews, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265407511431188">Hequembourg &amp; Brallier, 2005</xref>). Thus, when a parent’s impairment becomes severe and he or she needs more assistance, the increase in the amount of caring work may differ by its type and may have a differential impact on caregiver stress across gender. We hypothesize that there will be a stronger relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress for daughters than for sons.</p>

<sec id="section4-0265407511431188">
<title>Family conflict and caregiver stress</title>
<p>Poor family functioning contributes to a high level of caregiver strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265407511431188">Heru, Ryan, &amp; Iqbal, 2004</xref>) and caregiver distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265407511431188">Mitrani et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, family conflict, one of the secondary stressors in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431188">Pearlin et al.’s (1990)</xref> stress process model, may undermine a caregiver’s psychological and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>). Family conflict is related to caregiver depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265407511431188">Smerglia &amp; Deimling, 1997</xref>) and caregiver strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431188">Scharlach et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to gender differences in the relationship between family conflict and caregiver stress, a meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431188">Tamres, Janicki and Helgeson (2002)</xref> showed that men may be more likely than women to use avoidant or withdrawal behaviors as coping strategies in response to stressors in interpersonal situations. Women, in contrast, are more likely than men to utilize a variety of coping strategies, such as problem-focused strategies and to express their feelings to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431188">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>). These findings suggest that when families are involved in providing care for older parents, sons may be more likely to try to avoid family conflict in the face of disagreements. Since daughters are more likely to use active coping skills, such as seeking social support from others and using problem-focused strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431188">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>), they may experience fewer difficulties in dealing with intra-familial problems. Therefore, the impact of family conflict on caregiver stress may differ by caregiver gender because of different coping styles. Although our study does not include a specific measurement of coping styles, the literature on gender differences in coping strategies points to the likelihood that family conflict has a stronger effect on caregiver stress for sons than for daughters. We hypothesize that family conflict will influence caregiver stress more for sons than for daughters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0265407511431188">
<title>Family composition as a context for family conflict</title>
<p>Family composition is important in caregiving situations because it influences division of caregiving work within families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265407511431188">Keith, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265407511431188">Ganong, Coleman, &amp; Rothrauff, 2009</xref>). Studies have found that family composition (i.e. the existence of siblings and spouses) is related to family disagreement and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407511431188">Suitor &amp; Pillemer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407511431188">Weitzman et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>For adult children caregivers, there is more potential for family conflict over the provision of parental care between siblings than between any other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265407511431188">Peisah, Brodaty, &amp; Quadrio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431188">Semple, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407511431188">Weitzman et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge and Wallhagen (1991)</xref> found that 65% of adult child caregivers experienced conflict with siblings over caring for parents. One source of conflict among siblings is the lack of guiding principles about how caregiving responsibilities should be distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431188">Connidis &amp; Kemp, 2008</xref>). When parents need care, adult children must seek ways to provide support to their frail parents and to make decisions about caregiving. It is uncommon, however, to have explicit family norms and standards that guide those decisions. This ambiguity may result in different expectations among siblings that can create conflict as siblings attempt to negotiate caregiving responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431188">Connidis &amp; Kemp, 2008</xref>). Ideally, when adult children have multiple brothers and sisters, they can benefit from sharing caregiving responsibilities with each other; however, when some of these siblings do not share in parent care, there is the potential for greater family conflict.</p>
<p>Many adult children caregivers also experience conflict over parent care with their own spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>). Strawbridge and Wallhagen’s study (1991) found that 20% of adult child caregivers experienced conflict with their spouses. Adult children’s caregiving responsibilities for their parents create the possibilities of conflict between caregivers and their spouses. Parental care responsibilities take caregivers’ time away from their spouses and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407511431188">Merrill, 1997</xref>) and decrease marital happiness among couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265407511431188">Bookwala, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407511431188">Suitor and Pillemer (1994)</xref> found that husbands did not provide emotional support to caregiving wives because the husbands viewed caregiving as interfering with the women’s performance in other traditional family roles. The lack of support from spouses decreases marital satisfaction among caregivers and their spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265407511431188">Suitor &amp; Pillemer, 1994</xref>), which may affect spousal conflict over parent care. In addition, when adult children are involved in caregiving, their spouses tend to be involved in providing care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431188">Henz, 2009</xref>). In particular, sons’ involvement in parental care leads to daughters-in-law taking direct responsibilities for caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265407511431188">Henz, 2009</xref>). Although help from spouses can be a resource for caregivers, it can also be a source of conflict. Such conflict may arise when the caregiver’s spouse is reluctant to provide care for a parent-in-law or does not agree with the caregiver’s decisions related to care. We hypothesize that family composition factors (i.e. having siblings and having a spouse) will be associated with care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress.</p>
<sec id="section6-0265407511431188">
<title>Hypotheses</title>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>This study was based on the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) collected in 2004, in which the respondents were Medicare enrollees aged 65 or over. Data were collected from multiple sources including care recipients and caregivers. We used information from the 1923 primary caregivers who participated in the Caregiver Survey, which was supplemental to the 2004 NLTCS. In this supplement, the focus was on the primary caregivers who helped, without compensation, the sample care recipients living in community settings. In addition, the household information collected from care recipients was utilized to determine whether or not a primary caregiver had a sibling.</p>
<p>Since this study focuses on adult child caregivers, our subsample of primary caregivers consisted of 861 adult children caregivers in the 2004 Caregiver Survey, including 605 daughters (70%) and 256 sons (30%). Most of the respondents were non-Hispanic White (86%), and 14% were non-Whites, including non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Asian, and other. Regarding educational background, slightly less than half the participants did not have any education beyond high school or had not finished high school (32% and 12%, respectively<italic>),</italic> 31% attended college without receiving a degree or had an associate degree, and a quarter of the recipients had a bachelor’s degree or more advanced degree (15% and 10%, respectively). In terms of sibling relationships, 81% had one or more siblings and 19% were only children. With respect to caregivers’ marital status, 55% had a spouse or a spousal equivalent partner while 45% did not have a spouse or a partner. With regard to living arrangements, 47% of the respondents lived with their care recipient.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-0265407511431188">
<title>Care recipients’ impairment</title>
<p>The care recipients’ impairment was measured by three indicators including their activities of daily living (ADL) score, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) score, and problem behaviors. The source of this information was the Caregiver Survey. ADL and IADL scores were based on the number of areas in which a care receiver needed a caregiver’s assistance, ranging from 0 to 6 and from 0 to 10, respectively. The variable measuring problem behaviors associated with a care recipient’s mental impairment consisted of fifteen items representing care recipients’ disruptive behaviors, such as keeping a caregiver up at night, repeating questions, dressing inappropriately, hiding belongings and forgetting about them, crying easily, swearing, and becoming suspicious. The problem behaviors were measured by asking caregivers how many days, in the past week, they had to deal with these problem behaviors. The frequency of each behavior was assessed by a four-point Likert scale from 1 (no days in the past week) to 4 (five or more days over the past week). The scores were summed across the 15 problem behaviors resulting in an index that ranged from 15 to 60.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0265407511431188">
<title>Family conflict</title>
<p>Family conflict was defined as “overt interpersonal disagreement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265407511431188">Semple, 1992</xref>). The measurement of family conflict included six items of family disagreement about a care receiver or a caregiver, which were derived from the Caregiver Survey. The questions were: “How much disagreement have you had with anyone in your family because they don’t do their share in caring for [a care recipient]?”, “… because they don’t show enough respect for [a care recipient]”, “…because they lack patience with [a care recipient]?”, “… because they don’t give you enough help?”, “…because they don’t show enough appreciation of your work as a caregiver?” and “…because they give you unwanted advice?” The six items were assessed using a four-point scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (quite a bit).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0265407511431188">
<title>Caregiver stress</title>
<p>Caregiver stress, also from the Caregiver Survey, was measured by three indicators with a five-point Likert scale that focused on emotional, physical, and financial dimensions (1 = not at all, 5= very much). The questions were: “How emotionally stressful would you say that caring for [a care recipient] is for you?”, “How much of a physical strain would you say that caring for [a care recipient] is for you?”, and “How much of a financial hardship would you say that caring for [a care recipient] is for you?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0265407511431188">
<title>Family composition</title>
<p>As contextual variables, the characteristics of family composition included caregivers’ marital status and the existence of siblings in order to control for possible effects of the contextual variables on the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265407511431188">Henz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>). Caregivers’ marital status, from the Caregiver Survey, was scored dichotomously (0 = having no spouse/partner 1 = having a spouse/partner). The existence of siblings among caregivers was derived from the household information collected from their care-receiving older parents and was also scored dichotomously (0 = having no siblings, 1 = having one or more siblings).</p>

<sec id="section14-0265407511431188">
<title>Analysis strategy</title>
<p>The analysis plan for the present study consisted of several steps. First, we conducted descriptive analyses of the study variables and estimated correlations among the variables. Then we examined the relationships among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress by using a two-step approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407511431188">Bollen, 1989</xref>). In the first step, we tested a measurement model on the association between the observed variables and the latent constructs. In the second step, we conducted structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.5. In this step, we tested for mediation by determining whether the indirect pathway was significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265407511431188">Bollen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265407511431188">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, &amp; Sheets, 2002</xref>). In our case, we sought to determine whether family conflict mediated the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress. Finally, we investigated the moderating effects of caregiver gender by conducting subgroup analyses that we describe in greater detail in the Results section.</p>
<p>We employed Weighted Least Square (WLS) estimation because the data consisted of 13 discrete observed variables which do not satisfy the assumption of multivariate normality of observed variables. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) were used to assess model fit because the chi-square statistic is more likely to be significant when a sample size is either larger than 200 or smaller than 100, thus resulting in the rejection of an acceptable model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265407511431188">Hair, Anderson, Tatham, &amp; Black, 1998</xref>).</p>

 presents descriptive statistics and correlations among all variables included in the study. The correlations among the observed variables supported our construction of the latent variables. Most of the correlations were in the expected direction. Care recipient impairment, especially problem behaviors, was related to greater family conflict and higher levels of stress. In addition, family conflict was significantly correlated to caregivers’ emotional distress.</p>

<title>Testing the overall conceptual model</title>
<p>The measurement model includes the three latent constructs used in our analysis, including care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress. Factor loadings for the latent constructs are statistically significant (ranging from λ = .71 to λ = .98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The measurement model fit the data well (<italic>χ</italic>2 (df = 51, <italic>N</italic> = 861) = 143.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, RMSEA = .046, CFI = 0.99). We then tested the overall conceptual model that included the latent constructs and the contextual variables. The fit indices indicate that the model is acceptable (<italic>χ</italic>2 (df = 69, <italic>N</italic> = 861) = 173.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, RMSEA = .042, CFI = 0.99).</p>
<p>The findings revealing the relationships among the variables in the model are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0265407511431188">Figure 2</xref>
. They show that as care recipients’ impairment becomes more severe, adult child caregivers experience more family conflict (β = .43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and greater stress (β = .56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, as adult child caregivers experience more family conflict, they experience greater stress (β = .31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The indirect effect of care recipient impairment on caregiver stress through family conflict is also statistically significant (β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; not shown). Thus, the care recipients’ impairment has a direct effect on caregiver stress as well as an indirect effect that is mediated by family conflict.</p>

However, being married is not significantly related to family conflict and caregiver stress (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05), nor is the existence of siblings associated with caregiver stress (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>For caregiving sons, care recipient impairment is related to more family conflict (β = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and increased caregiver stress (β = .56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The indirect effect of care recipient impairment on caregiver stress that is mediated by family conflict is significant (β = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; not shown). With respect to contextual variables, having one or more siblings is associated with greater care recipient impairment (γ = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and higher family conflict (γ = .21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). However, caregiver stress is not significantly related to having siblings (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). Having a spouse is not significantly associated with care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress for sons (<italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>In order to determine which paths in the structural model significantly differed by gender, we conducted the chi-square test of significance. That is, after each of the paths among care recipient impairment, family conflict, and caregiver stress was first constrained to be equal, these constrained models were compared to the model that allowed the paths to vary as a function of gender. If the model without the constraints fits better than the models that constrained the relationships among the latent constructs, there is an interaction effect as a function of gender. The results reveal that one of the paths is significantly different between caregiving sons and caregiving daughters; that is, for the relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict (<italic>Δχ<sup>2</sup>
</italic> (df = 1) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, not shown). These findings indicate that the relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict is significantly stronger for caregiving sons (β = .49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) than for caregiving daughters (β = .37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study examined the mediating role of family conflict in the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress for adult child caregivers. For the most part, the study’s findings support the conceptual model developed by Scharlach and his colleagues (2006) and are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265407511431188">Deimling et al., 2001</xref>). In our study, family conflict significantly mediated the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress after controlling for possible effects of family composition factors. Our findings support the interpretation that, when older parents need care, there may be different understandings of impairment and care among families, and adult children and other family members may have different ideas of the quality and the amount of care that should be provided to frail parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265407511431188">Pearlin et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265407511431188">Merrill, 1997</xref>). Due to these differences, the primary caregiver and other family members may disagree over the ways to care for frail parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265407511431188">Connidis &amp; Kemp, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>), which, in turn, may lead to family conflict.</p>
<p>The one set of findings that is different from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265407511431188">Scharlach et al. (2006)</xref> pertains to the mediating role of family conflict in the link between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress for adult child caregivers. While their study found that care recipients’ mental impairment had only an indirect effect on caregiver strain, the results of the present study indicate that care recipient impairment also has a direct effect on caregiver stress. By including functional dependency (e.g. ADL and IADL) as well as mental impairment in the analytic model and by using a nationally representative dataset, our study obtains somewhat different results from those of Scharlach and his colleagues concerning the role of conflict, suggesting that additional mechanisms may explain the impact of care recipient impairment on caregiver stress.</p>
<p>Our first hypothesis concerning gender differences in the relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict was not supported by the data. While we found that caregivers’ gender had an important moderating effect on the relationship between care recipient impairment and family conflict, the gender effect was the opposite of what we expected. That is, when adult children caregivers’ parents become more dependent and need more care, there is a sharper increase in family conflict for sons than for daughters.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this unexpected finding. One stems from different caregiving patterns between sons and daughters when trying to address a frail parent’s needs. When a parent’s dependency increases, daughters are more likely than sons to respond to their parent’s needs by extending their caregiving work hours, which may lead them not to ask other family members to become involved in caregiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265407511431188">Stoller, 1983</xref>). Sons are also more likely to view themselves as supervising parental care, and thus more often delegate the actual provision of care to someone else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0265407511431188">Thompson, 2002</xref>), especially female relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265407511431188">Stoller, 1990</xref>). Therefore, since sons are more likely to ask for help from other family members than are daughters, there are more possibilities for sons to experience conflict over the distribution of caring work during this process of negotiation. Another possible explanation stems from gendered assumptions about caregiving roles. Since caregiving for older parents has been defined as ‘women’s work’, sons’ caregiving for older parents is often viewed as non-normative. Because sons may have few role models for male caregiving, they may be less familiar with skills related to negotiation and coordination of caregiving work, such as verbalizing problems related to care and arranging help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265407511431188">Harris, 2002</xref>). If sons are not familiar with such caregiving skills, they are at risk for experiencing family conflict over caregiving. Although our study did not measure whether or not there are gender differences in asking for help from other family members or in coordinating caregiving work among family members, our findings concerning the existence of gender differences suggest that further investigation into such caregiving skills would be a fruitful way of understanding the relationship between caregiver gender and family conflict.</p>
<p>Our second hypothesis concerning the moderating impact of gender on the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress was not supported. That is, there was no gender difference in the relationship between care recipient impairment and caregiver stress. This finding may be related to the nature of our study sample, which consisted of sons and daughters who were primary caregivers of older parents. As care-receiving parents’ impairment becomes more severe, the changes in caregiving work, which are closely related to caregiver stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265407511431188">Pinquart &amp; Sörenson, 2004</xref>), may not differ among sons and daughters because they are primary caregivers who have already assumed major responsibilities for providing routine assistance to their parents, including both personal and instrumental help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265407511431188">Chumbler, Grimm, Cody, &amp; Beck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265407511431188">Gonzalez-Salvador, Arango, Lyketsos, &amp; Barba, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265407511431188">Harris, 1998</xref>). As primary caregivers, adult children, regardless of their gender, may experience a similar degree of care-giving stress as their parents’ level of impairment increases.</p>
<p>The third hypothesis related to gender differences in the relationship between family conflict and caregiver stress was also not confirmed by the study data. We found no gender differences in the relationship between family conflict and caregiver stress. Our results concerning lack of gender differences indicate that when the family network experiences conflict over caregiving, the spillover to caregiver stress is equally strong for sons and daughters who are primary caregivers. It may be that our original rationale was at fault for why sons would experience more stress than daughters due to family conflict. We earlier conjectured that due to men’s use of avoidant and withdrawal forms of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431188">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>) they would be more negatively impacted by family conflict than would women. While such gender differences have been found within the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265407511431188">Tamres et al., 2002</xref>), perhaps these differences do not occur for those who are caregivers. It may be that caregivers experience a more limited range of coping strategies, so gender differences are less prominent. To further address this issue, it would be useful for future research to examine gender-related coping strategies with family conflict about caregiving.</p>
<p>Finally, our fourth hypothesis concerning the influence of family composition factors was partially supported. Specifically, family composition factors were significantly associated with care recipient impairment and family conflict, but not with caregiver stress. Of particular interest within this constellation of findings is the distinctive role of siblings in family conflict as compared to the role of spouses. As expected, having siblings is related to family conflict for both caregiving daughters and sons. This finding, which is consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0265407511431188">Weitzman et al., 1999</xref>), shows that siblings can be a source of stress by increasing family conflict over caregiving, regardless of the gender of the primary caregivers. However, having a spouse is not associated with family conflict for either caregiving daughters or caregiving sons. This result suggests that caregivers’ spouses may not be a major source of family conflict. Although some studies indicate that adult children caregivers experience conflict with their spouses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265407511431188">Strawbridge &amp; Wallhagen, 1991</xref>), other studies report that spouses provide emotional or practical support and help caregivers to cope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265407511431188">Campbell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265407511431188">Litvin, Albert, Brody, &amp; Hoffman, 1995</xref>). These mixed findings concerning the ways in which spouses impact caregiving may help account for our lack of significant effects.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study examined the role of gender in relation to family conflict and caregiver stress for adult children. We found that as parents’ impairment increases, adult sons experience more family conflict than do caregiving daughters. However, the relationship between their parents’ impairment and their own caregiving stress is similar for caregiving sons and daughters as is the relationship between family conflict and caregiver stress. Taken together, our study suggests that there are more similarities than differences in the ways in which sons and daughters experience the stress process when they are primary caregivers.</p>

<title>Study limitations and implications for future research</title>
<p>Our study’s contributions to understanding the impact of gender on family conflict among adult child caregivers notwithstanding, several limitations of this study should be noted. First, the present study is based on cross-sectional data, which is not effective in ascertaining the causal relationship between family conflict and caregiver stress in the long term. It is possible that the hypothesized causal relationships could be bidirectional; that is, caregiver stress and family conflict may influence one another. Future research that uses longitudinal data on family conflict and caregiver stress would be helpful to enhance our understanding of the complexity of these relationships. Second, the survey provided no detailed information about actual support and help from other family members or their views on caring for older parents. This information may be fruitful in articulating how care recipient impairment results in family conflict and stress and why there are gender differences in the association between care recipient impairment and family conflict. Third, no information was provided in the survey about the role of care-receiving parents with respect to family conflict. When adult children are caregivers, the participation of older parents in decisions related to care is critical in diminishing family conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265407511431188">Matthews, 2002</xref>). Thus, future research needs to include information about the role of care recipients and other family members in family discord and caregiver stress. Finally, we need to attend to additional contextual factors when exploring the stress process for adult child caregivers. Further information is needed about how issues such as the demands of employment and the support of adult children’s children play a role in this stress process.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, findings from the present research demonstrate the impact of family conflict on caregiver stress and indicate the need for family intervention to alleviate the stress of adult child caregivers. Additionally, our study highlights the importance of taking into account the gender of primary caregivers when attempting to understand the nature of family conflict experienced by adult child caregivers. Research that further explores some of the issues that emerged from the present study will help shed light on this important aspect of family relationships in later life.</p>
