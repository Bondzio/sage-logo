<title>The National Institute for Health and Welfare in Finland (THL)</title>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) is a research and development institute under the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.</p>
<p>The institute works to promote the well-being and health of the population, to prevent diseases and social problems, and to develop social and health services. It is the statutory statistical authority in health and welfare and maintains a strong knowledge base within its own field of operation. THL is also responsible for the application of this knowledge.</p>
<p>The institute has a wide range of tools to carry out its responsibilities: research, follow up and evaluation, development, expert influence, official tasks, and international cooperation. It serves the scientific community, actors in the field, and decision makers in central government and municipalities, as well as serving the broader society.</p>
<p>The institute started operating on 1 January 2009, after the merger of the National Public Health Institute (KTL) and the national Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES).</p>
<p>The institute’s functions are:</p>

<title>Dissertation: A child ’s early growth is connected with good health in adulthood</title>
<p>Early growth may provide protection against the development of risk factors related to type 2 diabetes as well as to sugar and fat metabolism disorders, or metabolic syndrome.</p>
<p>According to the dissertation study of Minna Salonen, MSc (Health Care), of the National Institute for Health and Welfare, early growth seems to influence physical exercise activity and physical fitness as well.</p>
<p>According to the study, approximately one-fifth of overweight persons with a body mass index of 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more were found to be metabolically healthy. These so-called metabolically healthy adults were of sturdier build in childhood and grew faster than comparable adults who met the criteria for metabolic syndrome.</p>

<title>Dissertation: The fear of stigmatisation related to the use of mental health services persists</title>
<p>In his dissertation study, Esa Aromaa, MPolSc, found that a great deal of stigmatisation continues to be associated with mental disorders. Those who have had personal experiences with depression are more tolerant than others of people who suffer from mental problems and their attitude towards drugs used to treat depression is more positive. On the other hand, they are also more pessimistic about recovery from depression. Aromaa studied stigmatising attitudes related to mental disorders and their impact on the use of mental health services by people suffering from depression.</p>
<p>According to the dissertation, people suffering from mental disorders were assigned many negative characteristics. They were often regarded as weak and unpredictable, and talking to them was seen as difficult. People suffering from mental disorders for their part feared that a disclosure of their problems would lead to a loss of friends and discrimination in the workplace or in connection with health services.</p>

<title>THL’s global scientific impact highest among Finnish research organisations</title>
<p>The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has been found to be the highest ranked Finnish research institution in terms of global scientific impact in a comprehensive international comparison of 3042 universities and research-focused organisations carried out by Scimago Lab.</p>
<p>The SIR World Report 2011 is based on bibliometric indicator data for the period 2005–09. It does not take into account other criteria for measuring scientific accomplishment, such as science awards.</p>
<p>In terms of the global scientific impact, THL was ranked 142 among all the institutions studied, while it was ranked 75 in the world according to the SIR Excellence Rate (top 10% papers most referred to in its own field), being the highest ranked in Finland for both criteria.</p>
