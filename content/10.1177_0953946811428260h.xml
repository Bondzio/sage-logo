<p>Peter Scott’s <italic>A Political Theology of Nature</italic> (Cambridge, 2003) put forward a bold proposal by which, as Scott states in the introduction to this latest collection, he has consistently stood. In that work, Scott argued for the mutual irreducibility and necessary interrelation, in any ‘theology of nature’, of God, humanity and nature. Humanity was not to be interpreted simply as a part of nature; theology was not to be conducted as a discussion about ‘God-and-the-human’ (p. 6) in which nature appears merely as background or as stable object for manipulation. Moreover, God, humanity and nature were all to be understood as <italic>social</italic>—and human life with nature, therefore, as <italic>political</italic> life. In this collection of essays, the first book in SCM’s Revisioning Ethics series, Scott develops the implications for anthropology and ethics of this key theological move.</p>
<p>The closely allied concepts of the ‘postnatural’ and the ‘anti-human’, which are central to Scott’s project, have descriptive, critical and constructive force. This is set out most clearly in the second chapter, ‘The End of Nature and the Last Human?’ Descriptively, ‘postnatural’ and ‘anti-human’ name the situation—which, Scott acknowledges, is not new, but is recognised with particular clarity and force in late modernity—in which humanity and nature are mutually entangled, such that the human cannot be understood apart from nature, and the boundaries between the natural and the ‘artificial’ cannot be drawn with clarity. Scott’s discussions of GM foods and of the contemporary urban environment, in the final section of the book, give some particularly clear examples of mixtures of the natural and the artificial. Critically, talking about the ‘postnatural’ and the ‘antihuman’ calls forth the recognition that claims about the natural and the human are always political, and invites the theoretical and practical critique of hegemonic appeals to (for example) an unambiguous ‘natural order’. Beyond this, constructively, ‘postnatural’ and ‘anti-human’ name theological, ecclesial and ethical projects that discern and live out the vocation of humanity-with-nature before God.</p>
<p>Scott was and is, as he acknowledges, ‘swimming against the theological tide’ (p. 2) in several respects—most notably, in his recognition of technology as a key area of theological and ethical reflection, and in his refusal to swing from Christian theology’s historical anthropocentrism straight to a ‘biocentrism’ or ‘ecocentrism’ that focuses on the unity of humanity and nature. Scott often sounds too human-focused and too hi-tech to be an ecotheologian—and this is precisely his intention. The final essay—a dense but rewarding piece on the ‘urban ecology’ of Manchester—displays and enacts his commitment to thinking from <italic>where we are</italic>, amid the multiple technological ‘entanglements’ of the human and the non-human. Scott repeatedly refuses to indulge in nostalgia for better, or other, comprehensive orderings of the world; he calls instead for constructive and critical engagement with particular manifestations of the postnatural condition. His continued use of the term ‘nature’ rather than ‘creation’—another potentially controversial move within environmental theology and ethics—signals his resistance to the idea that we can reach back from within the fallen world to grasp the order of creation established by God. On the other hand, and equally importantly, he joins with theological critiques of modern faith in the power of technology to redeem us from the limits of nature, from the suffering we find within nature, or from the consequences of sinful patterns of human action.</p>
<p>As may be apparent, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a key dialogue partner in this enterprise, not only because of his careful delineation of ‘nature’ as the object of God’s preservation (not equated with creation), but also because of his affirmation of humanity’s thorough ‘worldliness’. Scott’s first chapter sets out what he takes to be a necessary extension and modification of Bonhoeffer’s later ethics (of natural life and the ‘mandates’) in a more ecological direction—moving decisively beyond the preference for hierarchical ordering reflected both in the mandates and in at least some of Bonhoeffer’s accounts of relationships between humanity and nature. What is taken forward from Bonhoeffer is, above all, the summons to responsible action, within fallen nature, towards the relative good for which God determines fallen nature.</p>
<p>As he works out what that responsible action might look like in the current situation, Scott makes frequent and striking use of language and concepts associated with modern political thought. Indeed, this reappropriation of political concepts is arguably one of his major contributions to a theological ethics of ‘nature’, and one that becomes much more apparent with the collection of disparate essays into a single volume. Scott asks about the character of postnatural ‘citizenship’, about ‘postnatural right’ as a rereading of natural right, about possible instances of class solidarity between human and nonhuman animals, and about how ‘the human represents the non-human in governing’ (p. 75).</p>
<p>The politicization of the relationship between humanity and nature, like the terms ‘postnatural’ and ‘anti-human’, has descriptive, critical and constructive aspects. Scott sees that decisions about humanity’s relations to nature <italic>are</italic> in any case political, and that human ‘government’ affects the nonhuman (his discussions of GM crops, and—more briefly—of anthropogenic climate change, are good examples). He also, however, wants to critique portrayals of ‘nature’ as pre- or extra-political, because they tend to posit a human realm of action that is separable from nature. And, beyond this again, he repeatedly puts forward the idea that Christian communities could develop better and counter-cultural ways of representing nature, of being postnatural citizens, or of enacting their solidarity with the nonhuman.</p>
<p>Christians, Scott argues, affirm the <italic>sociality</italic> of human and natural life, life that images the triune God. They are thus bound to understand themselves as ‘citizens’, living in and through their relations to others—not tempted, for example, to reduce themselves to individual and apolitical ‘consumers’. They are called, moreover, to live sacrificially and in solidarity with the weak. In a postnatural context, they seek not only human power over nature, but the shared good of humanity-with-nature. In perhaps the book’s most striking image, he describes Christian communities entering into the ‘rioting action’ of the Spirit of God (p. 178)—political and social action that joyfully interrupts a hegemonic order and generates new possibilities for life together.</p>
<p>In the sections of the book most directly concerned with ethics, the critical dimension of Scott’s work often comes through more clearly, and is voiced more powerfully, than his constructive proposals. This is hardly surprising in work that engages realistically with the contemporary condition of humanity-with-nature, particularly its political dimensions—there is, we could all agree, plenty to criticise. It is also not surprising from a theologian who has reflected at length elsewhere on the theological task of anti-idolatry. Many of his chapters end with theologically-formed negative judgements on particular contemporary phenomena, and with calls to theological and ecclesial resistance. Without dissenting from any of the specific judgements, the reader might ask for more ‘worked examples’ of relatively <italic>good</italic> ongoing enactments of postnatural life before God. To pick up on the image of Christian participation in the Holy Spirit’s interruptive ‘rioting action’, we might perhaps ask what life is supposed to look like in between riots. However, it is easy to find good reasons why Scott might resist such a request. After all, a theology and a Church that starts in the ‘middle’ (an idea that Scott takes from Bonhoeffer, but which clearly also recalls Dante) is also always ‘on the way’; it has not reached a vantage-point from which it can survey and affirm its achievements.</p>
<p>This collection reconfirms Scott’s importance as a distinctive, challenging and profound thinker at the intersections of theological anthropology, political theology and ethics. It deserves to be widely read and discussed, not only by those with a particular interest in environmental ethics or the ethics of technology, but by anyone reflecting theologically on human responsibility and political agency.</p>
