<abstract>
<p>I explored the ways in which Korean international students’ spouses perceived and coped with the challenges associated with the adaptation process. I used in-depth interviews to examine how they dealt with life challenges, barriers, and coping strategies associated with acculturative stress. Three themes were identified: challenging life experiences and barriers as immigrants, the experience of emotional and psychological distress and stress, and new identified family structures. Two coping strategies used with acculturative stress were addressed: the recognition of personal strength and involvement in meaningful activities. I found that purposeful and meaningful activities associated with volunteerism, as well as cultural values and beliefs, played important roles in coping with stress. Further investigation into the role of meaningful activities for immigrants is necessary to have a better understanding of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The number of international students in the United States has been significantly increasing over the last 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311431442">Constantine, Okazaki, &amp; Utsey, 2004</xref>). In 2008–2009, 671,616 international students attended U.S. institutions, which was almost an 8% increase from the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311431442">Institute of International Education, 2009</xref>). The leading nations of origin for these international students were India (103,260), China (96,235), South Korea (75,065), Japan (29,264), and Taiwan (28,065). The economic impact of the international students and their dependents contributed approximately $17.8 billion to the United States economy during the 2008–2009 academic year (Institute of International Education).</p>
<p>Previous research has mainly focused on adaptation difficulties associated with acculturation among international students, such as acculturative stress, adjustment problems, and the underutilization of health care services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311431442">Heggins &amp; Jackson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311431442">Li &amp; Stodolska, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311431442">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311431442">Ong, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311431442">Root, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1049732311431442">Thorstensson, 2001</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311431442">Mordkowitz and Ginsburg (1986)</xref>, academic success was the main goal of Asian international students’ lives, which causes stress related to academic achievement and an adjustment to campus life. Thorstensson examined the main stressors related to adjustment problems and identified that Asian international students experienced difficulties of language barriers, cultural differences, and an adaptation to a foreign academic environment. In addition, there is a lack of ethnic and cultural understandings between Asian international and domestic students. For example, domestic students develop a stereotype of Asian international students that describes them as shy, reserved, and lacking social skills (Heggins &amp; Jackson).</p>
<p>Researchers have examined the relationship between the acculturation process and health of Asian international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311431442">Constantine et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311431442">Mori, 2000</xref>). The adjustment difficulties faced by these students often result in psychological problems, such as symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311431442">Choi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311431442">Oh, Koeske, &amp; Sales, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049732311431442">Shin, 1994</xref>). In spite of negative psychological symptoms, Asian international students seldom seek professional help and health care services offered by the university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311431442">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311431442">Ong, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311431442">Root, 1985</xref>). In addition, these individuals do not utilize useful community resources because they fear rejection or humiliation because of language barriers or behavioral differences based on cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311431442">Mio, Barker-Hackett, &amp; Tumambing, 2006</xref>). Thus, some researchers have recommended that these students utilize the health care programs offered by their institutions or the community, and develop multicultural competence or second-culture acquisition to adapt to new cultural values and beliefs during the acculturation and adaptation processes (Mori; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311431442">Noh &amp; Kaspar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311431442">Poyrazli &amp; Grahame, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Most international students prefer their spouses and/or children to accompany them when they relocate to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311431442">Institute of International Education, 2009</xref>). Although the students are here for a specific purpose, their family members are not and, as such, believe differently about immigration. The spouses of an international student experience serious adaptation difficulties such as language barriers, gender role, cultural and ethnic differences, and limited social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311431442">Cho, Lee, &amp; Jezewski, 2005</xref>). In addition, the spouses might have limited opportunities to interact with others of different ethnic groups, which can cause limited social networks and the lack of opportunities to learn new cultures. Thus, it can be argued that challenges associated with the adaptation process can negatively affect the perception of health and well-being among the spouses of international students. Unfortunately, little is known about how the spouses of international students deal with their own adjustment and adaptation problems, and cope with resultant stress.</p>

<title>Acculturation and Acculturative Stress</title>
<p>Acculturation refers to the process of acquiring new cultures (e.g., values, beliefs, and language), culture-specific behaviors (e.g., music, dress, food, and sport), and attitudes through interactions with individuals in a hosting country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311431442">Berry, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311431442">Berry, Trimble, &amp; Olmedo, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311431442">Gibson, 2001</xref>). Researchers have described the acculturation process as a multifaceted and continuous process associated with the degree of the acquisition of the new cultural characteristics (e.g., values, beliefs, and practices), behaviors, thinking patterns, and self-identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311431442">Chirkov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732311431442">Rudmin, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732311431442">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that psychological and sociocultural adaptations are the main determinants of positive outcomes as they are associated with acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311431442">Ataca &amp; Berry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049732311431442">Searle &amp; Ward, 1990</xref>). Psychological adaptation encompasses psychological distress, moods, confidence with regard to adjustments, and acceptance of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732311431442">Sam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1049732311431442">Ying &amp; Han, 2006</xref>). Sociocultural adaptation is based on one’s ability to interact with others having different cultural backgrounds and acquire culturally appropriate behaviors and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311431442">Furnham &amp; Bochner, 1982</xref>). Much research provides evidence that immigrants experience some difficulties of psychological and sociocultural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311431442">Berry, Poortinga, Segall, &amp; Dasen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311431442">Mui, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311431442">2001</xref>). This adaptation process creates undesirable or traumatic life experiences, such as limited social networks, a lack of social support, cultural and ethnic conflicts, and communication problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311431442">Berry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311431442">Mio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049732311431442">Stodolska, 1998</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311431442">Mio et al. (2006)</xref> suggested that a mutual change process between the host and immigrants generates negative consequences, such as misunderstandings, intergroup anxiety, and contact avoidance.</p>
<p>Research has shown that aspects of the adaptation process contribute to Asian immigrants’ physiological stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311431442">Padilla, Wagatsuma, &amp; Lindholm, 1985</xref>), life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1049732311431442">Wong-Rieger &amp; Quintana, 1987</xref>), subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732311431442">Ying, 1995</xref>), family harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311431442">Lee, Choe, Kim, &amp; Ngo, 2000</xref>), and mental health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311431442">Atkinson, Lowe, &amp; Matthews, 1995</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311431442">Lai (2004)</xref> showed the prevalence of depressive symptoms among older Chinese immigrants, and found that the participants reported higher levels of depressive symptoms when compared to other aging ethnic groups. Lai also found that differences in cultural values and beliefs were the main predictors of depressive symptoms. Lai’s findings indicate that acculturative stress is negatively associated with health and psychological well-being among older East Asian immigrants. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049732311431442">Sodowsky and Lai (1997)</xref> examined an association between cultural adjustment difficulties and acculturative stress among Asian immigrants. They found that Asian immigrants experienced distressing emotions and acculturative stress as a result of the cultural adjustment process. In another article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311431442">Mio et al. (2006)</xref> showed that Asian immigrants experience negative health conditions and high levels of stress because they often have a low level of behavioral acculturation and a strong adherence to traditional Asian cultural values.</p>

<title>Characteristics of Asian Immigrant Women</title>
<p>Researchers have explored the effects of immigration on dependents in the university setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311431442">Bennett (2002)</xref> tested the effects of electronic communication on the culture shock of the spouses of international students. The findings demonstrated that cultural differences and miscommunications with others were negatively associated with psychological distress, including social isolation and loneliness. Bennett also provided evidence that the use of electronic communication helped to reduce levels of isolation and loneliness. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049732311431442">Shim and Schwartz (2007)</xref> examined the relationship between an individual’s degree of acculturation and his or her adjustment. Their findings implied that the longer a spouse lived in the United States, the less likely he or she was to experience adjustment problems. In a recent article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311431442">Cho and colleagues (2005)</xref> stated that wives of Korean students faced challenges such as a lack of social support, economic hardships, parenting burdens, language barriers, a lack of transportation, racial discrimination, acculturation, and limited self-achievement.</p>
<p>Some researchers have addressed the cultural issues associated with the gender role that has led to the adjustment problems Korean immigrant women experience. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311431442">Kim and Rew (1994)</xref>, Korean immigrant women have a greater risk of depression because they are required to fulfill multiple roles associated with traditional Asian cultures, which stem from Confucianism values that typically place men higher in the family hierarchy and designate them as the economic providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311431442">Das &amp; Kemp, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1049732311431442">Sue, 1996</xref>). Women are expected to sacrifice to support their husbands and children, while being constrained by cultural obligations making it difficult for them to pursue their own identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311431442">Keum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311431442">Kim, 1998</xref>). Even though a few researchers have examined the acculturation process of Korean immigrant women and the social and psychological distress they experience because of their roles in Asian cultures (Keum; Kim; Kim &amp; Rew; Sue), no previous research has directly explored the acculturation stress of immigrants who are Korean international students’ spouses, nor how they cope with this stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311431442">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>I aimed to examine how international students’ spouses perceive and cope with the challenges of acculturation. I had two main reasons for selecting the spouses of Korean international students. First, Korean immigrant women are one of the largest immigrant groups in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311431442">Lee, 2007</xref>), and have a higher number of adaptation problems and psychological concerns than other Asian immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311431442">Choi, Miller, &amp; Wilbur, 2009</xref>). Second, as an immigrant myself, I have observed many life challenges and barriers faced by Korean immigrant women.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311431442" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In this study I employed semistructured interviews. This type of in-depth interview is an open-ended, discovery-oriented method well suited to describing and probing individuals’ interpretations of their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311431442">Crabtree &amp; Miller, 1999</xref>). I aimed to capture the themes associated with their life experiences as they relate to immigration. As such, I focused on describing and interpreting the experiences and mechanisms used related to stress coping strategies.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732311431442">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>I used the purposeful criterion-based sampling strategies identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732311431442">Strauss and Corbin (1998)</xref> to capture the characteristics of acculturative stress and coping. The criteria for the participants were that they (a) had a legal visa status, (b) had been in the United States for at least 1 year, (c) were spouses of Korean international students, and (d) had not worked or studied in the United States prior to this immigration period. I recruited the participants with the cooperation of Korean communities in the northwestern portion of the United States. I put flyers on notice boards at Korean community centers (e.g., churches), and was subsequently contacted by 12 individuals via email. Next, I sent an email to the prospective participants briefly describing the study and its purpose, the confidentiality necessary on the part of the participants, the time frame of the study, and my contact information. All of the women who contacted me volunteered to participate in the study; they ranged in age from 26 to 38 years, and the average length of time since their immigration was 38 months. Each participant had received her bachelor’s degree before entering the United States and had a professional career in Korea prior to immigration. Four of the participants had young children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732311431442">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The semistructured interviews used were designed to obtain information about the participants’ knowledge, feelings, and experiences associated with immigration, as well as their coping strategies and perceptions of any changes related to acculturation that might have taken place as a result of their immigration. Because of previous recommendations by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311431442">Horstman, Aldiss, Richardson, &amp; Gibson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311431442">Matsudaira, 2003</xref>), I used this method to allow the participants to express their life experiences related to immigration. I conducted face-to-face interviews individually with all participants.</p>
<p>A professional English-Korean translator translated the interview questions, following the guidelines recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431442">Brislin (1980)</xref>. Two native Korean graduate students fluent in both languages did separate English back-translations. Any discrepancies that emerged between the translations were discussed until a consensus translation was reached. Each interview lasted between 50 and 90 minutes and occurred in a conference room located on the campus of the university. All of the participants signed a letter of consent containing the study’s objectives, expected degree of participation, a guarantee of confidentiality and anonymity of the data, and permission to record and transcribe the interviews. The university ethics board approved these procedures. With their written permission, I audio-taped the interviews with the participants.</p>
<p>At the end of the interview, the participants completed a demographic survey on which they were asked their ages, educational backgrounds, ethnicity, and length of stay. Immediately following each interview, I recorded field notes, which included personal insights and observed emotional changes, behaviors, communication skills, and environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1049732311431442">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The field notes helped me to demonstrate knowledge of resources and aid memory, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311431442">Belgrave, Zablotsky, and Guadagno (2002)</xref>. To keep the data confidential, each participant was assigned a pseudonym.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732311431442">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>A thematic analysis was used to explore the participants’ understanding of the phenomenon so that I could “increase their accuracy or sensitivity in understanding and interpreting observations and interviews about people, events, and situations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311431442">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>, p. 5). The five steps of data collection and analysis presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311431442">Creswell (2009)</xref> were used in this article: (a) generate raw data (e.g., transcriptions, field notes), (b) organize and prepare the data for analysis, (c) read through the data, (d) code the data, and (e) interpret the themes and their meanings.</p>
<p>After completing the first draft of the transcripts, I sent it to a professional English–Korean translator. A month later, I received and reviewed the draft to verify the accuracy of the translations. Next, I organized and prepared the data for analysis. After that, I read the transcripts repeatedly to fully comprehend and interpret the participants’ statements and experiences. Then, the open coding scheme for each transcription was developed and compared across the participants to determine similar patterns of experiences. Next, I interpreted and verified the themes and identified the core themes. To clarify the audio transcriptions and my interpretations of the participants’ understandings and experiences, the participants were contacted on the telephone to provide an opportunity for clarification and elaboration on behalf of both the researcher and participants. These member checks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311431442">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>) included sharing initial impressions and analysis with the participant for verification of accuracy. Any discrepancies that emerged between the interpretations of the themes and the participants’ experiences were discussed with the participants. The participants approved all of the data and analyses. Data collection and data analysis were conducted concurrently, allowing me to modify interview guidelines and incorporate emerging themes for subsequent in-depth interviews. Nevertheless, data analysis continued after data collection concluded.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732311431442" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>After analyzing the participants’ personal narratives, I identified three common themes related to acculturation: (a) challenging life experiences and barriers as immigrants, (b) the experience of emotional and psychological distress and stress, and (c) new identified family structures. The following strategies used to cope with acculturative stress were addressed: (a) the recognition of personal strength, and (b) involvement in meaningful activities.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732311431442">
<title>Challenging Life Experiences and Barriers</title>
<p>The challenging life experiences and barriers faced by immigrants were the most distinctive themes that emerged from the data. Three subthemes associated with life challenges and barriers were also identified: (a) language barriers, (b) limited social supports and networks, and (c) cultural differences. These subthemes were closely related to the acculturation process and adaptation problems.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732311431442">
<title>Language barriers</title>
<p>Language barriers were the most salient issue among the participants. All of the participants thought that they had communication problems with native English speakers, which negatively affected most aspects of their daily lives. Jung, who was 29 years old and had lived in the United States for 6 years, mentioned that she was afraid to speak except for “Hello” and “Nice to meet you” because her poor English skills made her “feel shy and more reserved.” She said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was outgoing and liked to talk to others in Korea. Even when I talked to a new person, I easily became friends with them and thought that I had good social skills. However, it was a big challenge for me to make new friends here because of limited English proficiency. I felt that I became more shy and reserved. It is really stressful to me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of their inability or limited capacity to speak in English, some of the participants believed that they were completely dependent on their husbands. Twenty-seven-year-old Lee, who had lived in the United States for a year, believed that she had to rely heavily on her husband for communication with others. She stated, “In Korea, I was confident and independent, but right now I feel incompetent because I cannot do anything without my husband.” Oh, who was 31 years old and had one child, described herself as also feeling incompetent: “In Korea, I was confident and independent, but right now, I feel incompetent because I could not do many things without my husband’s help because of language issues.” These issues caused psychological stress and distress, as evidenced by statements such as “I felt useless and empty”; “It was so stressful and sometimes I felt helpless”; and “It was an emotional breakdown for me, and made me stressful.”</p>
<p>Even though the participants practiced their English and interacted with other Asian immigrants who spoke English, they still found it difficult to make friends with native speakers. Sujin, who had lived in the United States for 7 years, believed that the most stressful portion of her acculturation process was attempting to make American friends, a process that took her 3 years. Similarly, Cho, who was 38 years old, stated that she had an emotional breakdown when others ignored her because of her English, and that she “wanted to take them to Korea and let them have a similar experience to see how they felt being ignored.” The other participants reported similar stories.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049732311431442">
<title>Lack of social support and social networks</title>
<p>The participants’ immigration caused them to have a limited social network with their peers, communities, and society. Because some of the participants thought they lacked support from their peers, they were hesitant to reveal their personal life stories and issues because they were afraid of becoming the subjects of malicious gossip. According to Seo,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In Korea, I had family, relatives, and friends. I could easily meet with them and have a great time. Here, I am only involved with the Korean church members and, sometimes, I have a desire to make new friends and participate in new types of enjoyable activities, but feel that I am very limited in my interactions with non-Koreans.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Career restrictions also resulted in limited social networks and support. Chung, who was an art therapist in Korea, was unable to work because of her visa status. As such, she experienced a low level of self-achievement and a high level of isolation from society, which made her depressed and lonely. She stated, “My husband will get a PhD next year and accomplish his dream, but I will get nothing here. It makes me feel empty and lonely.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311431442">
<title>Cultural differences</title>
<p>The participants believed that they were more collectivistic and interdependent than their American counterparts. For example, according to 32-year-old Han,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have never eaten by myself in a public place. When I ate out with my family at a restaurant, I was surprised to see many people eating alone. I thought that they were extremely isolated and had no friends at all. My thoughts were wrong. My husband let me know that it is part of their culture. It was a culture shock.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Acknowledging different cultural perspectives is an important step in reducing misperceptions based on cultural differences. Another example can be found in a story told by Oh:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I visited my obstetrician, she frequently said, “You need to build your self-esteem and confidence.” I did not realize why she regarded me as having low self-esteem, so I asked her. She said that it was my lack of eye contact. In Korea, I used to avoid eye contact whenever I talked to someone in authority, such as teachers, doctors, and older adults, to show a level of respect. After that, it sounds funny, but I practiced keeping direct eye contact with others.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In terms of verbal communication with others, some of the participants were more comfortable bowing to each other than shaking hands. Jang, who was 26 years old, said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was very confused as to how to behave when I met and talked to Asian Americans. They looked like Asians, but were totally different. . . . A year ago, I bowed to them and shared much unfamiliar food with them. As time goes on, I have learned how to greet and interact with them. Sometimes, I am neither Korean nor American.</p>

<sec id="section14-1049732311431442">
<title>The Experience of Emotional and Psychological Distress and Stress</title>
<p>Experiencing the psychological distress associated with the acculturation and adaption processes was another salient theme that emerged from the data. The analysis of the in-depth interview data revealed two subthemes: negative emotions and the underutilization of mental health care services.</p>
<sec id="section15-1049732311431442">
<title>Negative emotions</title>
<p>The participants stated that their exposure to new cultures created undesirable and stressful experiences, and led to symptoms of depression such as loneliness, isolation, and anxiety. They used similar expressions, such as, “I felt so depressed because I had to deal with so many challenging things”; “Because of the language, I felt isolated from the Americans”; “Whenever I interacted with the Americans, I felt anxious”; and “Ethnic and cultural differences made me distant from others.” In addition, they had strong attachments to their previous jobs and desired to develop their careers. However, their visa restrictions prevented them from pursing career opportunities. Cho was anxious and experienced depression because of the visa restrictions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was an elementary school teacher in Korea and always happy and energetic. I loved teaching and interacting with the kids. . . . Here, I could not work, as the law does not allow international wives to get part- or full-time jobs. It is irrational to me as I am a human being and could potentially live here for a long time. To get a job, my husband would need to get a job first and then change our visa status. It is very complicated. So, the fact that I could not work made me depressed and anxious.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A lack of social relationships was another factor that created negative emotions among the participants. Jung noted, “I had many friends, family, and relatives in Korea. . . . Since moving here, it is very challenging and difficult to make good friends, which makes me lonely and depressed.” In the context of community service, some of the participants reported feeling socially isolated when they engaged in activities. They found it challenging to access community resources and be a part of community activities. Chung said, “Language and cultural differences are the main reasons for this feeling,” and, “In spite of participating in a training session offered by the YMCA [Young Men’s Christian Association], it was a big challenge to establish a sense of friendships with others because of the language barriers.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732311431442">
<title>Underutilization of mental health care services</title>
<p>Despite experiencing psychological distress and stress, most of the participants believed that they underutilized mental health care services and did not seek treatment for their psychological problems. Han thought that she did not seek help when she experienced psychological distress and mild depression because she was not familiar with the health care system, and found it challenging to explain her symptoms in detail. Other participants believed that their cultural values negatively affected their utilization of the mental health care programs offered by institutions and the community. They mentioned that they resisted utilizing mental health care services because of the stigma associated with mental illness and mental health care services. Sujin stated that she did not see a doctor for “the treatment of my depression symptoms because it would hurt our family’s reputation” and, as such, using such services would be her “last resort.” An analysis of the in-depth interviews revealed a lack of understanding of the purpose behind the mental health services and the acceptance of its use within American culture, as well as severe cultural differences between American and Korean cultures in this area. Cho said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have never imagined that I would seek professional help from doctors or therapists for my loneliness and depression symptoms because it was unacceptable to my family’s reputation. Even my husband did not encourage me to seek professional help because it would have harmed our family’s relationships, and I do not want to be perceived as crazy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the participants were willing to avoid utilizing mental health care services and, instead, found alternative ways to deal with their psychological concerns.</p>
<p>Language barriers were also associated with the underutilization of health care services among the participants. Seo described her experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>After giving birth, I suffered from severe depression and participated in a support group for women in the same situation. . . . I could not share my experiences and feelings with them because it was a big deal to express my feelings in English. . . . I did not return after the first meeting.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Seo’s experience made her feel “emotionally and physically disconnected” from the group, and she believed that if she were a native speaker, she might have been treated in a different way.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732311431442">
<title>New Identified Family Structures</title>
<p>New identified family structures associated with acculturation were another salient theme that emerged from the data. The analysis of the in-depth interview data revealed that the participants established new family structures, such as embracing a new family environment and creating conflicts with their children. Some of the participants thought that their new social environments created a lack of social interactions with their husbands. They mentioned that since their immigration, their husbands’ support had been limited because they faced numerous challenges related to their careers and studies, and did not spend as much time with their family. For example, Kim, who had two children and had lived in the United States for 8 years, stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My husband was always supportive of me while in Korea. The situation changed because he is facing a lot of challenges regarding his studies and work. It is a reality check, and I know that I should understand the current situation even though I hate it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Oh stated, “My husband has been very busy with his dissertation and spends most of his time at his office doing his work. Even on weekends, he goes to the office.”</p>
<p>Some of the participants who had young children thought that their children had easily adapted to the Western culture and embraced new cultural values and beliefs. These were not always congruent with their traditional cultures, and sometimes generated conflicts because of the differences between the values of the parents and the newly adopted values of the children. In addition, communication caused conflict between the participants and their children. According to Cho,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When my two kids went to middle school and high school, they seldom spoke in Korean. Even when they communicated with me, they complained that I could not speak English very well, and it seemed to me that there was a void between us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the negative consequences of immigration, some of the participants believed that as a result of the adaptation process, they were more independent and tended to adapt to a new gender role. For example, Bang, who had lived in the United States for 10 years, said,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was always totally self-sacrificing, soft-spoken, and submissive to my husband while in Korea. That was the natural role as a wife. I always cooked for my husband . . . and took on household responsibilities as well. . . . I felt that I was more Americanized and more independent. As life goes, I shared our household responsibilities with my husband and became less of a traditional Korean woman.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She also mentioned that she wanted to participate in various activities outside of the home. Since their immigration, the participants faced several challenges associated with their family structures. Some of the participants experienced limited social interactions with their husbands and children because of their new family environment and language barriers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732311431442">
<title>Recognition of Personal Strength</title>
<p>In spite of the numerous challenges faced by the participants, the use of personal strength emerged as a salient theme with regard to coping with stress. Based on the participants’ life stories, two subthemes were identified: recapturing personal strength and developing cross-group friendships.</p>
<sec id="section19-1049732311431442">
<title>Recapturing personal strength</title>
<p>All of the participants developed ways by which to recapture or develop their own personal strength, which helped them to relieve their stress and enhanced their sense of accomplishment and self-esteem. They gained an understanding of their personal, unique abilities, as well as a sense of success and achievement, which led to a reduction in stress. For example, Lee talked about her talent for art:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I have always had a passion for art. I did not have a chance to work with art when I was a kid, but then I started getting into drawing, painting, and sculpture. It is really fun and exciting to me, and I do it on a daily basis. I am pretty good at drawing and creating new artwork. Working on artwork makes me feel so proud and happy. . . . I found another side of myself while working on my art. . . . This work definitely helps me to feel less stress, as I feel like I have accomplished something.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lee believed that if she had not moved to America, she might not have become so involved with her art. She felt that her art provided her a much-needed stress reliever. Jung discovered her ability and passion to play the violin. After she immigrated with her husband, she looked for something that she could learn that might relieve her stress. She said, “Playing the violin is one of the important things that brings me happiness, and totally functions as a stress reliever.” In addition, she gained a sense of achievement and improved self-confidence through this pastime. Her ability to perform Christian songs at church made her proud, and helped to improve her confidence.</p>
<p>Some of the participants thrived psychologically as a result of the adaptation process. They thought that in spite of the negative life experiences caused by their acculturation, they now understood the “bigger picture in my life,” felt “much stronger mentally,” “developed solid perseverance,” and “experienced positive psychological changes.” For example, according to Sujin,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For the first few years after immigrating, I had a difficult time making new friends and adapting to a new society, but, after a while, I realized that I am a strong woman and needed to get over the negative things, and then began experiencing positive psychological changes in my life. . . . Negative experiences that I felt as an immigrant were not always bad. This situation made me see a bigger picture in my life, and I became much stronger in many ways.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, Lee learned how to persevere through the adaptation process:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was stuck with so many challenges and obstacles in understanding the different cultures and interacting with people who have different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Sometimes, I experienced racial discrimination at restaurants because of my ethnicity and language barriers. Whenever I faced a challenge associated with my English or ethnicity, I told myself that they just made me stronger and, eventually, I began persevering.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Based on their experiences, the participants formed and developed their own strengths and interests through meaningful engagements as a way of coping with stress. By using their talents and interests the participants experienced improved self-esteem and achievement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732311431442">
<title>Developing cross-group friendship</title>
<p>Some of the participants made friends with individuals who were culturally and ethnically different from them. Through these interracial contacts, they became more open-minded and aware of cultural differences and similarities. For example, Lee took a free English program offered by the community, and said that many of the students were from different countries:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>All of us were very different, yet we had cultural similarities. I enjoyed talking to them and getting to know them better. This world is new to me, and I have never thought that I’d have friends from different countries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the participants held negative, stereotypical beliefs about certain groups prior to their personal interracial contacts; however, through positive interracial contacts, they modified their attitudes toward these groups. For example, Cho formed negative stereotypes about certain groups of people from watching movies before she came to the United States. She and her husband decided to avoid these groups of people. However, after meeting her husband’s friends from different cultures, she realized that she had stereotyped them unfairly:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The interesting thing was that one of their wives was also learning the violin. In spite of the language problems, we easily became good friends. Sometimes, we practice together. She teaches me English and I teach her the violin, because I am better than her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interactions with new people provided opportunities for the participants to establish friendships with other ethnic groups. Cross-group friendships functioned as a source of social support and helped to relieve stress.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732311431442">
<title>Engagement in Meaningful Activities</title>
<p>Being engaged in meaningful activities was another salient theme that appeared from the results as a method by which the participants coped. All of the participants were involved in meaningful activities that helped with the creation of their social networks and, thus, alleviated their negative emotions. Two subthemes that emerged during the in-depth analysis were volunteerism and involvement with activities associated with the Korean culture.</p>
<sec id="section22-1049732311431442">
<title>Volunteerism</title>
<p>The majority of the participants were involved with different types of volunteer activities, which they credited with creating happiness and satisfaction in their lives. Two of the participants had musical talents and volunteered to provide music lessons to children at their church. Jung believed that while teaching, her stress went away and she became happy. In addition, their teaching experiences allowed them to expand their social networks. Oh remarked that she became good friends with one of her student’s parents, which not only allowed her to expand her social network, but also helped her to improve her English.</p>
<p>Many of the participants believed that the social networks they gained through their meaningful engagements enhanced their sense of belonging and acceptance and helped them to develop companionship and friendship—which further helped to reduce their stress. Han volunteered to be a Sunday school teacher’s assistant. This position allowed her to interact with many American church members, expand her social network, and find meaning in her life. She also volunteered to teach children at her church how to paint, draw, and sculpt. She remarked,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing the kids every Sunday. Teaching them about the arts and interacting with them are big parts of my responsibilities, and I feel that their parents and I have become close. I am so proud of what I am doing here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Engaging in meaningful activities has played an important role in her life and expanded her social network. Some of the participants were involved in various volunteer activities offered by local rehabilitation and senior centers. They used similar expressions, such as “made new friends,” “met different people,” and “relieved my stress by doing this” to describe their experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1049732311431442">
<title>Involvement with activities associated with the Korean culture</title>
<p>Some of the respondents participated in and developed activities associated with the Korea culture—such as Korean holiday ceremonies, food events, and language classes—as a source through which to cope with stress and create a connection to their community. Cho volunteered to teach Korean language classes. She was excited because her students were “willing to learn how to speak, write, and listen the way I did. Teaching the Korean language makes me proud of myself and provides me with another opportunity to interact with Americans.” Chung, who was also teaching Korean language classes, stated that teaching her students about the Korean culture, customs, and language allowed her to feel rewarded</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>because I sense the progress that they have made. It is one of the most amazing feelings to me, and the fundamental thing to blow my stress away. Some of the students are Americans studying Asian cultures and languages. They are very interested in learning the Korean language. . . . We have close and intimate relationships, and they are very supportive of what I am doing. It feels so good and I am proud of myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the participants stated that they enjoyed inviting people to Korean holiday ceremonies and food festivals. For example, Oh stated that during the first year of the Korean food festival, only a few people showed up. However, after 3 years, “We greeted over 100 guests and it was a successful event. It seems that they were interested in Korean food and how to cook it.” Seo mentioned that performing a traditional Korean ceremony at every holiday allowed her to convey valuable knowledge about the Korean culture to others. Such activities allowed the participants to become a part of their communities and, as one participant stated, “I do not feel that I am a stranger here any more.” In addition, the participants thought that such activities allowed them to continually build relationships and friendships through culturally meaningful activities and enjoyable interactions with other people.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>I explored the life experiences and challenges associated with immigration and examined the coping resources for dealing with acculturative stress among the spouses of Korean international students. The thematic analysis provided rich examples of the life experiences and challenges that these individuals faced, and identified three salient themes: (a) challenging life experiences and barriers as immigrants, (b) the experience of emotional and psychological distress and stress, and (c) new identified family structures. In addition, I identified two salient themes that functioned as resources for coping with stress: recognition of personal strength and involvement in meaningful activities.</p>
<p>The findings of this study extend the previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311431442">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311431442">Kim &amp; Rew, 1994</xref>) indicating that the spouses of Korean international students face stressors such as language barriers and restricted career development and gender roles based on cultural differences. In particular, communication problems because of limited English proficiency caused undesirable experiences such as dependency on their husbands, restrictions on activities, and language discrimination. In addition to that, their visa status prevented participants from pursing their careers and engaging in a variety of job-related activities. It seems that the spouses of international students are expected to fulfill the traditional role of having complete responsibility for household tasks. Thus, stressors related to the adaptation process negatively affect the perception of psychological well-being among international students’ spouses.</p>
<p>Whereas the empirical literature on the adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311431442">Atkinson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311431442">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311431442">Padilla et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1049732311431442">Ying, 1995</xref>) is focused extensively on psychological distress and help-seeking patterns among Asian American immigrants, I focused on the life challenges and psychological problems that Korean students’ spouses experienced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311431442">Berry and Ataca (2007)</xref> stated that “acculturation inevitably brings social and psychological problems” (p. 674). In this article I have demonstrated that Korean spouses faced numerous challenges and barriers on a daily basis (e.g., language barriers, limited social networks, and cultural differences), which negatively impacted their social and psychological distress and stress (e.g., created depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social isolation).</p>
<p>In addition, much previous research examined the association between the degree of acculturation and cultural adjustment for Asian immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311431442">Kim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311431442">Kim &amp; Choi, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311431442">Mui &amp; Kang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311431442">Pak, 2006</xref>). The researchers in these studies found that Asian immigrants tended to adhere to traditional Asian cultures (e.g., family hierarchy, gender roles, and interdependence), which led to low acculturation and negative psychological symptoms (e.g., depression and social isolation). This finding expands the idea that the traditional Korean culture strongly influenced the life patterns and behaviors among the spouses of Korean international students. Thus, it can be argued that immigrant women tend to maintain their cultural values and beliefs, which result in low acculturation and adjustment difficulties.</p>
<p>Despite the negative consequences of the adaptation process, the Korean international students’ spouses reported an underutilization of mental health care services because of their cultural perspectives on mental and psychological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311431442">Ringel, 2005</xref>). In this study, they reported that they did not seek professional help with regard to health care and mental health care because of a lack of resources and because of the cultural differences in the perceptions of mental illness. In addition, they mentioned that mental illness was seen as a stigma and disgrace to the entire family in Asian society. Because of this social stigma, they were reluctant to admit having psychological challenges and, therefore, refused to seek professional help.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049732311431442">Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi (2000)</xref>, individuals have the strengths and assets to buffer against stress and prevent both mental and physical illness. They identified and amplified positive human qualities as coping resources, such as courage, optimism, emotional intelligence, resilience, capacity for pleasure, and a sense of purpose. Examples of these strengths can serve as crucial psychological resources for individuals confronted by challenging or stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1049732311431442">Taylor, Kemeny, Reed, Bower, &amp; Gruenewald, 2000</xref>). In the current study, spouses of Korean international students created and developed their own strengths and qualities (e.g., perseverance, capacity for pleasure, purpose, optimism, and ability to thrive psychologically) to develop their own strategies by which to enhance their social and psychological health and capacity (e.g., volunteerism and engagement in meaningful activities). This indicates that positive emotions and qualities serve as important resources for coping with acculturative stress among spouses of Korean international students.</p>
<p>Meaningful activities played an important role in facilitating positive emotion and qualities. A large amount of empirical evidence documents the value of meaningful activity participation on an individual’s life, satisfaction, and health. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311431442">Chun and Lee (2008)</xref> mentioned that individuals facing stressful life events reported experiencing positive psychological changes after using their strengths. The current study demonstrated that engagement in meaningful activities facilitated a sense of confidence and achievement, the discovery of new possibilities with regard to life and psychological strengths, and the development of an individual’s own strength. Engagement in meaningful activities enabled the participants to stop focusing on their social and psychological problems and, instead, experience increased enjoyment and decreased acculturative stress. The meaningful activities provided the spouses of Korean international students with opportunities to develop cross-group friendships and enhance positive emotions, which resulted in stress reduction.</p>
<p>One interesting finding is that spouses of Korean international students created culturally meaningful activities (e.g., cultural events and language classes) associated with their own cultural values and beliefs as a way of coping with stress. Culturally meaningful activities helped these individuals to find meaning and happiness in their lives. Only a few studies have demonstrated that immigrants create and develop culturally meaningful activities as a way of coping with stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311431442">Iwasaki &amp; Bartlett, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049732311431442">Stack &amp; Iwasaki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1049732311431442">Stodolska &amp; Livengood, 2006</xref>). For example, within a study of Aboriginal individuals with diabetes, Iwasaki and Bartlett found that these individuals coped with stressors related to diabetes and racial discrimination by participating in culturally appropriate forms of leisure, such as native arts, Aboriginal dance, music, and spiritual activities. In a similar way, the findings in the current study indicate that meaningful engagement in activities that had Korean cultural values provided opportunities to rebuild social relationships and relieve stress related to the acculturation process.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding was that spouses of Korean international students expressed negative stereotypes and attitudes toward a specific group of people. Previous research has shown that contact with individuals who are racially or ethnically different yields negative feelings such as anxiety and prejudice, and creates a context for conflict (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311431442">Lieberson, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311431442">Olzak, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732311431442">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049732311431442">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049732311431442">Stephan, Ybarra, &amp; Bachman, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049732311431442">Stephan and Stephan (1985)</xref> argued that when two groups of people from different races and ethnicities are in contact, a certain level of anxiety called <italic>intergroup anxiety</italic> might be produced, and a certain level of anxiety and uncertainty develops and forms negative stereotypes and prejudices. However, based on the responses of some of the participants in my study, such negative stereotypes can be reversed through participation in meaningful activities. Participation in these activities can promote positive interracial interactions, reduce barriers that might inhibit meaningful communication, and create feelings of belonging and connectedness.</p>
<p>A couple of limitations exist in relation to this study. The participants were self-selected. I did not use random sampling, and intentionally selected spouses of Korean international students. Future research is needed to explore how Korean immigrants experience life challenges and stress related to acculturation and how they cope with acculturative stress. Based on the findings, gender differences appear to be related to the acculturation and adaptation processes. It would be helpful for future researchers to explore the association between acculturation and gender differences.</p>
<p>The participants settled in a small college town, and geographical location can affect life challenges and personal experiences. It might be helpful if future research included a more diverse sample of spouses who live in urban areas (they might have more opportunities to interact with other ethnic groups, and facilitate adaptation). The relationships between Korean women immigrants and their children is another important topic because of the existence of cultural conflicts within families. Future research is needed to explore the relationship between women immigrants and their children as associated with acculturation. In addition, I did not aim to generalize my findings to all international spouses. Future research is needed to build on the knowledge gained from this article by exploring the experiences of various immigrant groups and capturing the role of meaningful activities among them.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>In this study I used a qualitative research approach to explore the views of nondominant groups who tend to have less power and be more disadvantaged than dominant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311431442">Bowleg, Huang, Brooks, Black, &amp; Burkholder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311431442">Deaux &amp; Stewart, 2001</xref>). The study resulted in rich and extensive personal narratives about the life experiences and challenges associated with adaptation to a new culture, coping strategies, and meaningful activities. The findings have a number of implications for clinical practice, as well as provisions for the creation of recreation programs in leisure settings.</p>
<p>In terms of the underutilization of health care services among spouses of Korean international students, I suggest the importance of health care professionals’ cultural competence as a bridge by which to integrate knowledge about the Korean culture and understanding of cultural differences into the acculturative process. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1049732311431442">Sue and Sue (2003)</xref>, health care professionals should be aware of their own cultural backgrounds and experiences as well as those of their clients to become successful in providing services to clients who come from backgrounds different from their own. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311431442">Kim and Van Puymbroeck (2011)</xref> suggested that therapists should develop a positive therapeutic relationship, with an understanding of cultural differences, focus on group identity and family involvement, and create a positive atmosphere in which East Asian clients can openly discuss their problems. Thus, it is important that health care professionals provide health-related education for immigrants so they can facilitate effective counseling programs and professional services.</p>
<p>There are many other culturally meaningful activities, such as certain types of dance (e.g., belly dancing, Flamenco, and Salsa), martial arts (e.g., Taekwondo, Tai-chi, and Judo), and relaxation techniques (e.g., yoga and Pilates). These activities can provide rich opportunities for immigrants to interact with members of other ethnic groups and develop cross-group friendships. Through participation in culturally meaningful activities, participants can find previously unobserved similarities between their cultures and the cultures of the other participants. Positive cross-cultural contacts and interactions can be valuable results from participation in culturally meaningful activities, which lead to the development of meaningful relationships and friendships.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>During the adaptation process, immigrants experience numerous challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, cultural conflicts, and new social norms. This adaptation process appears to be critical for Asian women immigrants’ psychological well-being and mental health. According to recent studies, acculturative stress and difficult adaptation processes have been associated with higher levels of domestic violence and depressive symptoms among Korean women immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311431442">Choi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311431442">Lee, 2007</xref>). This indicates that stress associated with the adaptation process affects Asian women immigrants’ lives in diverse and negative ways. Thus, it is imperative to create and provide effective coping resources for Asian women immigrants’ health and well-being.</p>
<p>One important strategy is to create and develop a variety of activities (e.g., volunteering activities and culturally meaningful activities) for Asian women immigrants. In this study, participation in meaningful activities served as an important facilitator by which to reduce the number of challenges and obstacles that spouses of Korean international students experienced. Involvement in meaningful activities provides a context in which Korean women immigrants can contribute to interpersonal development via connections with others. This can help expand their social networks and create a better understanding of their peers, who might come from culturally and ethnically diverse groups.</p>
