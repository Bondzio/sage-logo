<abstract>
<p>Impaired risk recognition has been suggested to be associated with the risk for revictimization and the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Moreover, risk behavior has been linked to high sensation seeking, which may also increase the probability of revictimization. A newly designed behavioral experiment with five audiotaped risk scenarios was used to investigate risk recognition in revictimized, single-victimized, and nontraumatized individuals with and without PTSD. Moreover, the potential role of sensation seeking in revictimization, and PTSD as well as its relation to risk recognition was explored. Revictimized, single-victimized, and nontraumatized individuals did not differ with regard to general risk recognition. However, delayed risk recognition was found for the revictimized group when arousal ratings were considered. No differences in sensation seeking were found between the three groups; only the nontraumatized group showed lower boredom susceptibility relative to the revictimized group. Delayed risk recognition was associated with high sensation seeking. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms significantly predicted exit levels of risk scenarios. Findings are discussed against the background of previous research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Only a minority of people experiencing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, an accident, or an assault, develop a full-blown posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512449647">Ehlers, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512449647">Maercker, 2003</xref>). To explain this finding, a number of empirical studies have investigated possible risk factors promoting the development and maintenance of PTSD. Among other important factors, a link between the number of experienced trauma throughout life and the development of PTSD has been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512449647">Brewin, Andrews, &amp; Valentine, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145445512449647">Ozer, Best, Lipsey, &amp; Weiss, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, a <italic>dose–effect</italic> relationship—referring to a growing risk for the development of PTSD with the increasing number of experienced trauma—has been postulated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512449647">Mollica et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145445512449647">Neuner et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, the question arises: What factors put people at risk for repeated victimization?</p>
<p>A number of studies found that victims of sexual trauma show delayed risk recognition in threatening situations that involve sexual assault putting individuals at higher risk for future victimization, that is, revictimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo, Marx, &amp; Sloan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson, Calhoun, &amp; Bernat, 1999</xref>). These studies deployed an audiotaped date-rape vignette developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512449647">Marx and Gross (1995)</xref>. In this experiment, participants listen to a hypothetical interaction between a man and a woman that culminates in a date rape. While listening to the scenario, participants are asked to indicate when the man has “gone too far” (i.e., recognize that the woman was in danger of being sexually assaulted). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson and colleagues (1999)</xref> used this date-rape vignette in a sample of college women with varying victimization histories. They found that women with multiple sexual victimization histories took significantly longer than single-victimized and nonvictimized women to recognize risk. Moreover, greater PTSD-related arousal was associated with enhanced risk recognition, possibly increasing selective attention and enhancing response to threat-relevant stimuli, therewith potentially buffering women against revictimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>). Yet, this effect may be due to avoidance behavior as Wilson’s study only used trauma-congruent material. Further studies also support the link between poorer risk recognition skills and revictimization: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512449647">Marx, Calhoun, Wilson, and Meyerson (2001)</xref> used a prospective design to evaluate a sexual revictimization treatment intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo and colleagues (2005)</xref> observed that victimized compared with nontraumatized individuals displayed an impaired recognition of sexual threat cues and also decreases in autonomic reactivity (i.e., heart rate). The authors concluded that an altered physiological response to threat cues may be related to the inability to identify and react to sexually threatening situations.</p>
<p>Contrary to the findings described above, other studies have found no delay in risk recognition but argue that victims of sexual assault are more likely to engage in unassertive behavioral responses to sexual assault situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512449647">Breitenbecher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512449647">Messmann-Moore &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512449647">Breitenbecher (1999)</xref> found that sexually victimized women showed different behavioral responses to a potential sexual assault using videotaped dating situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512449647">Messmann-Moore and Brown (2006)</xref> reported ratings of discomfort and victimization history to be unrelated to risk recognition using written vignettes. However, they found that women reporting to leave a sexual assault situation at a later point were more likely to be victimized during an 8-month follow-up period. Hence, their behavioral responses to threat cues seemed to be impaired. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0145445512449647">Yeater and O’Donohue (2002)</xref> showed that single-victimized women took longer to be trained to recognize risk in written vignettes than revictimized women. A further study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512449647">Elwood, Williams, Olatunji, and Lohr (2007)</xref> examined victims and nonvictims of interpersonal trauma with high and low PTSD symptoms using complex, ambiguous visual social stimuli. They found that people with PTSD inappropriately label positive situations as threatening. This is in line with the cognitive model of PTSD by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512449647">Ehlers and Clark (2000)</xref>, which argues that PTSD develops and persists when the trauma is processed in a way that a sense of serious, current threat is maintained even after the event is terminated (for empirical evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512449647">Fairbrother &amp; Rachman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0145445512449647">Steil &amp; Ehlers, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>One additional factor that may be linked with risk recognition, and thus, impact on future victimization and the (potential) development and maintenance of PTSD is sensation seeking. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512449647">Zuckerman (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, Kolin, Price, and Zoob (1964)</xref>, sensation seeking is a personality characteristic or behavioral disposition defined as “the seeking of varied, novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences, and the willingness to take physical, social, legal, and financial risks for the sake of such experiences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>, p.27). Sensation seeking is expressed in various kinds of risk-taking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145445512449647">Raithel, 2004</xref>). A number of studies have found a positive relationship between sensation seeking and risk behavior, such as risky driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512449647">Burns &amp; Wilde, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512449647">Dahlen, Martin, Ragan, &amp; Kuhlman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512449647">Jonah, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512449647">Jonah, Thiessen, &amp; Au-Yeung, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145445512449647">Schwebel, Ball et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512449647">Schwebel, Severson, Ball, &amp; Rizzo, 2006</xref>), drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>), and shop lifting or climbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512449647">Hansen &amp; Breivik, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512449647">Lepp and Gibson (2008)</xref> investigated the relationship of risk perception and sensation seeking with regard to tourism behavior and found no difference in risk perception between high and low sensation seekers, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512449647">Ajcardi and Therme (2008)</xref> suggested that Thrill and Adventure Seeking (among other factors) is involved in the cognitive appraisal of risk. Although findings of previous studies support the link between risk behavior and sensation seeking, it is yet unclear whether sensation seeking may be linked with impairment of risk recognition in the potentially traumatic event of interpersonal violence.</p>
<p>Discrepancies in findings call for further investigations and may be due to a number of factors: heterogeneous methodology (e.g., written, audiotaped, visual stimuli, or self-report measures for risk recognition; different definitions of victimization) and study design (e.g., prospective, cross-sectional). Furthermore, it is unclear whether the postulated impairment of risk recognition also applies to risk situations other than sexual; for example, that victims of sexual assault show impaired risk recognition in future risk situations in road traffic. Similarly, it is unknown whether findings of impaired risk recognition are extendable to trauma populations other than sexual violence, that is, victims of physical violence. Moreover, as empirical findings have shown an association of risky behavior and sensation seeking, it is unclear whether this may be linked to impaired recognition of risk.</p>
<p>Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the role of risk recognition in victims of repeated or single interpersonal trauma (physical or sexual) with and without PTSD symptoms, as well as nonvictims. In addition, we aimed to examine the potential link between risk recognition and sensation seeking behavior. First, based on the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson and colleagues (1999)</xref>, we hypothesized that the revictimized group shows delayed risk recognition compared with the single-victimized and nontraumatized group in a newly designed behavioral experiment. This experiment includes different interpersonal and noninterpersonal risk situations. Second, we hypothesized that the revictimized group shows higher sensation seeking than the single-victimized and nontraumatized group. Third, we hypothesized a positive relationship between impaired risk recognition and high sensation seeking. As a fourth aim of the study, we planned to test whether risk recognition and sensation seeking, respectively, can be predicted by PTSD symptoms.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Fifty-seven victims of interpersonal trauma were recruited by means of advertising or via contacts of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. All traumatic events fulfilled the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512449647">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) trauma Criteria A1 and A2, referring to (A1) “the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others” and (A2) “the person’s response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512449647">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>, p. 467). For the present study, participants who had experienced more than one traumatic event of the trauma categories from the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512449647">Foa, Cashman, Jaycox, &amp; Perry, 1997</xref>; for a description of the modified version see section titled “Assessment of Psychopathology”) were classified as “revictimized,” whereas participants who had experienced one traumatic event of the PDS trauma categories were classified as “single victimized.” Based on this classification, 32 participants were revictimized and 25 were single victimized. According to the PTSD section of the Structured Clinical Interview for <italic>DSM-IV</italic> Axis I Disorders (SCID-I; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0145445512449647">Wittchen, Wunderlich, Gruschwitz, &amp; Zaudig, 1997</xref>), 21 victims of interpersonal trauma were diagnosed with and 36 without PTSD. In addition, 25 nontraumatized controls with no lifetime traumatic event (as verified by the trauma checklist of the PDS) or psychiatric disorder were recruited via an established subject pool and word of mouth advertisement. Participants with neurological disorders, lifetime psychotic symptoms, and substance dependence were generally excluded from the study. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145445512449647">Sheehan et al., 1998</xref>) was used to assess exclusion criteria and comorbid disorders and to verify healthy status in nontraumatized controls. Finally, a multiple-choice vocabulary test (Mehrfachwahl–Wortschatz Intelligenztest [MWT-B]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512449647">Lehrl, 1995</xref>) was employed to estimate verbal intelligence in participants. All participants were informed that the study aimed at investigating the effects of trauma experience and about the confrontation with trauma-related audiotapes. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Board Hamburg (Approval Number: 2838).</p>

<p>The German version of the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512449647">Ehlers, Steil, Winter, &amp; Foa, 1996</xref>) was used for group assignment according to trauma victimization status and to assess current PTSD symptom severity. The Trauma Checklist of the PDS was modified to assess whether participants had experienced the trauma of one PDS category at more than one occasion, that is, had been revictimized. Reliability for the German version of the PDS is considered excellent with α = .94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512449647">Griesel, Wessa, &amp; Flor, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512449647">Hamilton, 1960</xref>) was used for the assessment of current depressive symptom severity, which has shown satisfactory psychometric qualities (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512449647">Hunsley &amp; Mash, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0145445512449647">
<title>Assessment of risk recognition</title>
<p>For the assessment of risk recognition, a new behavioral experiment was designed based on the audiotaped vignette by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512449647">Marx and Gross (1995)</xref>. Participants were seated in front of a computer (with a blank screen to avoid distraction) while listening to five different audiotaped risk situations. They were instructed to listen carefully to each story via the speakers and to imagine themselves to take part in the story. Their task was to indicate, by pressing the Enter key on the keyboard, once they thought the story became too threatening or they wanted to leave the situation. They were told that once they pressed the key, they would nonetheless listen to the end of each story. This was done to prevent that participants might refrain from pressing the key because they were curious to hear the end of each story and to reduce the role of avoidance behavior. Although a number of previous studies used only a sexual scenario (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512449647">Marx &amp; Soler-Baillo, 2005</xref>), for the present study the following five different risk scenarios, including interpersonal and noninterpersonal trauma material, were developed: traffic accident, household accident, assault, ferry journey, and evening at the pub. Each scenario consisted of five gradually increasing risk levels (from 0 = <italic>introduction, no risk</italic> to 4 = <italic>negative/neutral ending or high risk/no risk</italic>, respectively) with a total duration of approximately 3.5 min for each scenario. Three scenarios (traffic accident, household accident, and assault) had a negative ending and two scenarios (evening at the pub and ferry journey) had a neutral ending. The order of presentation was pseudorandomized, that is, neutral scenarios were always presented in first and third positions, but the order of all other scenarios was varied. The pseudorandomization and placement of a neutral scenario at the beginning of the presentation were used to ensure that participants would not display any socially desired or demand behavior, or show a biased response. We did not want to give the participants any cue about what constitutes “appropriate” behavior. Participants had the opportunity to experience that not all scenarios had a negative ending and that one may also react too fast. Different versions were used for male and female participants, so that the gender of the protagonist in each risk scenario matched that of the participant. This was done to enhance personal involvement and to balance differences between participants on the level of personal identification. Risk recognition was assessed by means of decision latency, that is, the length of time needed by participants to indicate when a scenario became too threatening or they wanted to leave the situation. This primary dependent measure was developed by Marx and Gross. Latencies were recorded in seconds using a stopwatch and also converted into one of the five previously fixed risk levels (= “exit level”) to allow comparison of the different scenarios varying in duration (from 192 to 225 s) and accounting for the content of each sequence.</p>
<p>To assess differences in material, all participants completed the paper-and-pencil Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512449647">Lang, 1985</xref>) after the presentation of each risk scenario. The SAM is a culture- and language-free measurement assessing arousal and emotional valence/pleasure on a 9-point rating scale. For the valence dimension, it ranges from a smiling, happy figure (1 = <italic>very positive</italic>) to a frowning, unhappy figure (9 = <italic>very negative</italic>); for the arousal dimension, the figure ranges from a relaxed, sleepy figure (1 = <italic>calm, unaroused</italic>) to an excited, wide-eyed Manikin (9 = <italic>very aroused</italic>). Previous studies suggest that the SAM is a valid measure of emotional response, reliably covarying with physiological reactions linked with emotional response (such as heart rate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512449647">Bradley, Greenwald, Petry, &amp; Lang, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512449647">Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, &amp; Hamm, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Sensation seeking</title>
<p>The self-rating Sensation Seeking Scale–Form V (SSS-V; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0145445512449647">Zuckerman et al., 1964</xref>) was used to examine sensation seeking in participants. The SSS-V assesses individual differences in stimulation and arousal needs, introducing a total sensation seeking score. The questionnaire consists of 40 items with a dichotic answer format, divided into four subscales: Thrill and Adventure Seeking, Disinhibition, Experience Seeking, and Boredom Susceptibility. Previous studies support the four-factor structure of the questionnaire and have shown that the SSS-V yields good internal consistency (Cronbach’s αs &gt; .75; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512449647">Roberti, Storch, &amp; Bravata, 2003</xref>). The convergent validity with related constructs is satisfactory: The Impulsive Sensation Seeking subscale of the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire correlates with the SSS-V subscales between <italic>r =</italic> .43 and .61 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145445512449647">Roberti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, &amp; Kraft, 1993</xref>).</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At the beginning, sociodemographic information (e.g., age, gender, education) and details on the traumatic event (e.g., date of trauma, injuries) were inquired in a standardized interview. If participants had experienced more than one interpersonal trauma, the most threatening trauma was explored and marked as the index trauma. The SCID interview was then used in traumatized participants to assess for PTSD diagnosis. Subsequently, psychopathology was assessed (e.g., MINI, HDRS, PDS). Thereafter, participants were presented the five audiotaped scenarios of the behavioral risk recognition experiment and asked to fill in the SAM after listening to each story. Following the presentation of all five stories, participants were asked about the degree of identification with the story characters on a 10-point scale (from 0= <italic>none at all</italic> to 10= <italic>very good</italic>) and whether any intrusions had occurred while listening to the story.</p>
<p>Subsequent to the risk experiment, participants were asked to complete a vocabulary test to estimate verbal intelligence (MWT-B; Lehrl, 1995a). Finally, the questionnaire on sensation seeking behavior (SSS-V) and other tasks reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512449647">Jelinek et al., 2010</xref>) was deployed.</p>

Furthermore, the revictimized and single-victimized group neither differed on the PDS total and subscores nor with regard to the type of interpersonal index trauma (sexual, physical, or both). The three groups also did not differ with regard to their level of identification with the risk scenarios. However, the revictimized and single-victimized group scored significantly higher on the HDRS total score than the nontraumatized healthy controls (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145445512449647">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the influence of the idiosyncratic nature of the material and to overcome the possible limited manipulation effectiveness, a further analysis was carried out, which investigated risk recognition (i.e., exit level) depending on the level of arousal between the three groups. For this, two groups of Risk Scenarios—high-arousal scenarios (≥4) versus low-arousal scenarios (≤3)—were formed based on a median split of the SAM-rating to ensure equal sample distribution. A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with Group (revictimized, single-victimized, and nontraumatized) as between-subject factor and Risk Scenario, high arousal (≥4) versus low arousal (≤3), as within-subject factor. Exit Level served as a dependent variable. As expected, Exit Level differed depending on the arousal level of Risk Scenarios, <italic>F</italic>(1, 61) = 104.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <inline-formula id="inline-formula8-0145445512449647">

<p>Furthermore, to consider the effects of PTSD symptoms on risk recognition beyond other variables, including sociodemographic factors, arousal, valence, sensation seeking, and depressive symptoms, we conducted a linear regression analysis. Exit Level served as dependent variable. The first block comprised sociodemographic variables (age, verbal intelligence); the second block valence and arousal ratings (SAM scores), sensation seeking (SSS-V total score), and depressive symptoms (HDRS score); and the third block included PTSD symptoms (PDS total score). The results of the intercorrelations and regression analyses are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512449647">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512449647">3</xref>, respectively. In line with the third hypothesis, significant correlations were found for risk recognition with sensation seeking and also with valence and depressive symptoms (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512449647">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, as can be seen from the significant beta coefficients and Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0145445512449647">Table 3</xref>, PTSD symptoms significantly contributed to the explanation of variance in risk recognition beyond the other variables.

<p>Univariate ANOVA was deployed to test for differences on the SSS-V total score and individual subscales of the SSS-V (Thrill and Adventure Seeking, Disinhibition, Experience Seeking, Boredom Susceptibility) between the groups (revictimized, single victimized, and nontraumatized).

<p>Furthermore, we conducted a linear regression analysis to consider the effect of PTSD symptoms on sensation seeking (SSS-V total score) beyond other variables, including sociodemographic variables, valence, arousal, risk recognition, and depressive symptoms. Sensation seeking served as a dependent variable. The first block comprised sociodemographic variables (age, verbal intelligence); the second block comprised valence and arousal ratings (SAM scores), risk recognition (Exit Level), and depressive symptoms (HDRS score); and the third block included PTSD symptoms (PDS total score). The results of the intercorrelations and regression analysis are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145445512449647">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145445512449647">4</xref>, respectively. Significant correlations were found for sensation seeking with age, arousal, and—as described above—risk recognition. As can been seen from the beta coefficients and Δ<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0145445512449647">Table 4</xref>, PTSD symptoms did not significantly contribute to the explanation of variance in sensation seeking beyond the other variables.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the role of risk recognition and sensation seeking in victims of single and repeated interpersonal trauma, and nontraumatized controls using a newly designed behavioral experiment and a well-established questionnaire. Moreover, it was examined whether PTSD symptoms predict risk recognition and sensation seeking, respectively.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis—that risk recognition is delayed in revictimized individuals compared with single-victimized and nontraumatized individuals—was not supported. No difference in risk recognition between the revictimized, single-victimized, and nontraumatized group was found in the general analysis. These findings are not in line with previous research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512449647">Marx et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512449647">Marx &amp; Soler-Baillo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>) reporting delayed risk recognition in revictimized individuals in comparison with nonvictimized and single-victimized individuals. A possible explanation for the lack of group differences in this general analysis of risk recognition may be the individual emotional impact of the material on participants. The material covered five different stories ranging from a car accident to an assault. Each story may have affected participants differently. To account for these interindividual differences, a further analysis was conducted differentiating between high- and low-arousing scenarios (according to the SAM ratings of participants). In this additional analysis, a delay in risk recognition was found for the revictimized group relative to the nontraumatized group and at the trend level relative to the single-victimized group. However, differences in risk recognition between the groups did not change between risk scenarios. If it is presumed that previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512449647">Marx et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>) used arousing or exciting scenarios, these studies as well as the current study may hint at a deficit in risk recognition in revictimized individuals when taking the arousal of material into account. Another possible explanation for increased response latencies in revictimized individuals is that the confrontation with trauma-related material, that is risk situations, may cause individuals to “freeze,” referring to the inability to respond or leave risky situation (Hagenaars, van Minnen, Holmes, Brewin, &amp; Hoogduin, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512449647">Holmes, Brewin, &amp; Hennessy, 2004</xref>). This explanation could also be linked to the finding of decreased heart rate found in other studies investigating risk recognition of sexual threat cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, this result may then contradict findings of other studies reporting no relationship between sexual victimization and risk recognition in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512449647">Breitenbecher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512449647">Messmann-Moore &amp; Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145445512449647">Naugle, 2000</xref>). However, it is questionable whether such inferences are applicable, as these studies yield methodological differences. These studies used written vignettes and did not include a behavioral forced choice response. Written material may not be as arousing as audiotaped material, and a behavioral response may parallel a real-life event more than a verbal response.</p>
<p>With regard to our fourth aim to test the effect of PTSD symptoms on risk recognition, we found that PTSD symptom severity explained unique variance in risk recognition, in addition to depressive symptoms and sensation seeking. Therewith, our results do not support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson et al.’s (1999)</xref> finding that greater PTSD symptoms are associated with enhanced risk recognition. Hence, we found no evidence for a buffering effect against revictimization or avoidance behavior (of trauma-relevant stimuli). Contrarily, this finding may also argue for a possible freeze reaction preventing people with PTSD symptoms to react in potentially threatening situations (Hagenaars et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512449647">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Against the background of the varying findings described above, differentiations with regard to the deployed methodology need to be made. The present study extended <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512449647">Marx and Gross’s (1995)</xref> experiment using only a single sexual victimization vignette by including different types of high risk and neutral (control) scenarios, and thus, allowing the assessment of risk recognition in interpersonal and noninterpersonal trauma situations. Furthermore, complementing previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512449647">Elwood et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512449647">Marx &amp; Soler-Baillo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0145445512449647">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>), we did not restrain the investigation of risk recognition to one type of trauma but included several interpersonal trauma as a source of revictimization. Until now, research has only considered risk recognition in sexual revictimization but not other types of interpersonal trauma. Our results showed that there were no specific differences in risk recognition between different types of (high) risk scenarios and across victims of sexual or physical trauma. Future studies could more specifically investigate the interaction of risk scenarios congruent and incongruent with the victim’s traumatic experience. Moreover, research is needed to examine risk recognition in victims of noninterpersonal trauma (e.g., traffic accidents).</p>
<p>The second hypothesis—that the revictimized, single-victimized, and nontraumatized group, respectively, would differ with regard to sensation seeking—was not supported. The three groups did not differ in the total score of the SSS-V. Only lower Boredom Susceptibility (Subscale 4 of the SSS-V) was found for the nontraumatized group relative to the revictimized group and at the trend level to the single-victimized group. One possible explanation for this may be related to the finding of decreased heart rate in sexually revictimized individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0145445512449647">Soler-Baillo et al., 2005</xref>), in the way that revictimized individuals have an increased need for stimulation. Hence, they may more easily experience or are susceptible to boredom, repetition, or habituation. Our results oppose previous findings that sensation seeking is associated with high-risk behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512449647">Dahlen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145445512449647">Schwebel et al., 2006</xref>) and the hypothesis that it may also be linked with revictimization. We further investigated whether PTSD symptoms predicted sensation seeking. However, no association emerged. Age, arousal ratings, and risk recognition on the other hand did contribute significantly to the explanation of overall sensation seeking. Our results support previous findings that high sensation seeking is associated with younger age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 2004</xref>) and findings of lower levels of anxiety in high sensation seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The third hypothesis—predicting a positive relationship between delayed risk recognition and higher sensation seeking—was supported. To our knowledge, it is a novel attempt to investigate the link between sensation seeking and risk recognition. Our finding supports previous studies that found a positive relationship between sensation seeking and risk-taking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512449647">Hansen &amp; Breivik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0145445512449647">Zuckerman, 1994</xref>). Consequently, the question arises whether our finding of a positive association between high sensation seeking and delayed exit of risk scenarios displays a deficit in risk recognition or whether risk is consciously accepted for the sake of sensation seeking.</p>
<p>Despite novel and positive approaches of this study, a number of limitations need to be addressed. First, as a consequence of the cross-sectional design, it cannot be differentiated whether a distortion in risk recognition results from victimization or already existed prior to the trauma. The deployment of a prospective design in future studies is important to shed light on the interaction between risk recognition, revictimization, and PTSD. Second, the operationalization of the assessment of risk recognition needs to be addressed. Although a number of empirical studies have used audiotaped risk stimuli, the degree to which the response to exit the risk scenarios is predictive of actual risk recognition remains unclear. Audio stimuli question participants about the point at which they perceive threat, whereas in a real-life threatening situation such prompts for potential victims do not occur. Moreover, the deployed risk scenarios may not be as “realistic” or arousing to parallel real-life risk situations. It needs to be mentioned, however, that the level of identification with the scenarios did not influence exit levels. Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that the presence of the experimenter during the presentation of the risk scenarios may have influenced the participant’s response. However, a large influence is highly unlikely as the experimenter was seated behind and out of sight of the participants. Further research is also needed to investigate the differentiation between delayed risk recognition or acceptance of risk for the sake of sensation. Finally, if indications of impaired risk recognition are to be supported by future studies, interventions for the prevention of victimization and training for victims of interpersonal trauma to reduce the risk of future victimization are needed. For example, these could address the identification of risky situations, increase sensitivity to threat cues, and teach adaptive behavioral coping responses.</p>
