<abstract>
<p>How African American girls cope and excel amidst the discriminations and inequities they experience within U.S. educational systems has not been widely discussed in the body of research about African Americans’ schooling experiences. In this study, the researchers examined the applicability of Ogbu’s cultural–ecological theory to the self-described school experiences of eight high-achieving African American high school girls. Using an inductive analysis of interviews, focus groups, journal, and field notes, this article draws attention to the role that school policies and practices, caring adults play, and how the participants’ negotiated academic and racial identities contributed to their academic success.</p>

<p>Research suggests there is a disparity between how girls and boys are treated in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427739">American Association of Women, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0042085911427739">Sadker &amp; Zittleman, 2009</xref>). Widely held is the belief that course placement and the quality of classroom instruction do not adequately prepare them for today’s competitive job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427739">American Association of University Women, 1998</xref>). For African American girls, dually marginalized by their race and gender, this situation is exacerbated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911427739">Archer-Banks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427739">Morris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0042085911427739">Rollock, 2007</xref>). As research has shown, the notion of racial and gender parity is an elusive phenomenon for African American girls within U.S. schools. Typically, schools place greater emphasis on African American girls’ social behaviors than on non-African American girls by insisting that the latter demonstrate mainstream-appropriate social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427739">Morris, 2005</xref>). Often, African American girls are chastised by school personnel for “being loud” or for attitudes that are incongruous with teachers’ expectations of femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>). African American girls, typically candid and independent, are often stereotyped as troublemakers rather than leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911427739">American Association of University Women, 1998</xref>). Likewise, African American girls’ portrayal in the media have in many ways affected how they are perceived and interacted with by school personnel and society in general.</p>
<p>Despite notable gains in educational achievement and attainment, African American girls still lag behind their White counterparts at all levels of the education. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0042085911427739">U.S. Department of Education (2003)</xref> reports that the dropout rate among girls ages 16- to 24-years-old is 7.7%, whereas African American girls experienced a rate of 8.8%, followed by Asian/Pacific Islanders (6.4%), Whites (4.5%). Hispanics girls, however, had a much higher rate of 18%. In regards to high school status completion rates among 18- to 24-year-olds, in the same period, the completion rate for girls was 90.6%, whereas it was 94.6% for Whites, 92.7 % for Asians/Pacific Islanders, 88.7% for African Americas, and 77.6% for Hispanics. In both causes, there is a notable disparity between African American girls and their White counterparts.</p>
<p>Educational statistics among postsecondary students shows even larger disparities between African American girls and Whites. Using statistics maintained by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911427739">American Council on Education (2008)</xref> of the 57.7% of girls enrolled in college during 2006-2007 school year, Whites had the highest enrollment rate at 59.3% followed by African Americans at 13.5%, Hispanics 10.5%, and Asians/Pacific Islanders 6%. During the same period, girls earned 57.5% of the baccalaureate degrees awarded. Whites were at the top with 66.9% followed by African American (10%), Hispanics (6%), and Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders (6.3%). The above mentioned figures highlight the gap in educational achievement and attainment among African American girls compared with White counterparts.</p>
<p>The lack of parity between the educational achievement and attainment of African American and White is well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427739">Butler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427739">Kao &amp; Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085911427739">Ogbu, 2004</xref>). As researchers seek ways to reduce this disparity, many have examined some of the factors that contribute to this dilemma primarily by studying the experiences of African American girls who have not excelled. However, what is lacking from the knowledge base are studies of high-achieving high school African American girls, and how such variables as gender racial, and academic identity contribute to their schooling experiences.</p>
<sec id="section1-0042085911427739">
<title>Race, Gender, and School Experiences</title>
<p>Race and gender play significant roles in how students are positioned within the school environment. Schooling experiences of African American boys and girls differ considerably from Whites. Researchers have identified several disparities that African American students encounter at the secondary level, including course placement, discipline, and college preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911427739">Chavous, Rivas-Drake, Smalls, Griffin, &amp; Cogburn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085911427739">Garibaldi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427739">Morris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427739">Oakes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0042085911427739">Roderick, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0042085911427739">Sellers &amp; Shelton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0042085911427739">West-Olatunji, Baker, &amp; Brooks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0042085911427739">Zirkel, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085911427739">2005</xref>). African American girls must negotiate both racial and gender discrimination, as well as, bias among school personnel to succeed in school. For example, African American girls (a) are cited more frequently for dress-code violations, (b) receive more discipline referrals than their White peers, (c) are disciplined more frequently for talking back to teachers in class, and (d) receive more suspensions than their White, Latina, and Asian peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085911427739">Chavous et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427739">Morris, 2005</xref>; Smith, 1999). School personnel often view African American girls who are “loud” as displaying “social backwardness, and a general lack of appropriate values and taste” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085911427739">Cousins, 1999</xref>, p. 308). As they are viewed as “inadequately feminine,” school personnel spend more time correcting their speech and dress patterns, and less time promoting their academic skills.</p>
<p>Course placement is another area where schools reproduce society’s discriminatory practices. The stratified nature of the school environment creates tracks that propel or cripple African Americans’ chances of participating in various majors, or gaining access to certain postsecondary institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0042085911427739">Oakes (2005)</xref> points out that schools place Whites and Asians into advanced and college preparatory tracks, while disproportionately placing African Americans and Latinos in lower tracks. To this end, African American students are typically excluded from advanced placement (AP), college preparatory, and science technology, engineer, and mathematics (STEM) academic tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911427739">Ansalone, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911427739">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911427739">Atwater, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085911427739">Kao &amp; Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085911427739">Kao &amp; Tienda, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042085911427739">Moore, Henfield, &amp; Owens, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911427739">Norman, Ault, Bentz, &amp; Meskimen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042085911427739">West-Olatunji et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0042085911427739">West-Olatunji et al. (2008)</xref> remind us that African American girls are positioned outside of science and mathematics courses as early as elementary school. Contributing to these inequitable practices are school counselors who fail to provide African American girls with the information and opportunities they need to participate in these classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0042085911427739">Shure, West-Olatunji, &amp; Lewis, 2008</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard (2005)</xref> found that the unequal treatment of African American girls by counselors potentially affected their chances of being admitted to college. In this study, African America girls reported that several school counselors (a) discouraged them from enrolling in advanced-level courses, (b) consistently gave them information for trade school and 2-year colleges, and (c) discouraged them from applying to notable colleges.</p>

<sec id="section2-0042085911427739">
<title>Racial and Academic Identities</title>
<p>Research suggests that African American students’ beliefs about self and race are closely related to (a) their educational and social development, (b) their perceptions regarding the value of education, and (c) to their current realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042085911427739">Wright, Weekes, &amp; McGlaughlin, 1999</xref>). Therefore, some African American students may “reject the forms of knowledge available within schools and embrace alternative forms of knowledge available within their communities” (p. 297) that appears more relevant and easier to apply. African American students who “recognize inequities in economic and social mobility for their group” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085911427739">Chavous et al., 2003</xref>, p. 1077) and who find education useless for their goals and aspirations, demonstrate less engagement and effort in school. Conversely, African Americans who demonstrate confidence in their cognitive abilities and see school as relevant to achieving their goals and aspirations may become adept at navigating these iniquities to attain academic excellence.</p>
<p>The notion of oppositionality that Ogbu and Fordham postulate based on their study of Capitol High is not applicable to all African American high schoolers. Also, it cannot serve as an explanation for their academic excellence. First, the identity of a group is not a monolithic construct. Although educational researchers tend to conceptualize the behavior of Hispanics or African Americans with descriptions of persons-in-settings, this may not be the way that the students reference themselves or are referenced by peers. As Murrell claims, “the idea that a racial category connotes ascribable characteristics of individuals in the category is logically and empirically unsupportable” (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085911427739">Tillman, 2009</xref>, p. 94). There are sociocultural constructions of self including racial identity which are developed through interactions with others, including teachers and peers and via personal experiences. The notion that identity is an all-or-none proposition negates the situation-by-situation evaluations of self-worth that students experience daily through their interactions with others in schools (Murrell as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085911427739">Tillman, 2009</xref>, p. 95). Thus, notions of academic identity are continuously reshaped by one’s positionality in classrooms. Curricular materials, teachers, and classroom interactions influence the opportunities that students have to engage proactively in sociocultural discourses and to maintain the “integrity of their social identity” (Murrell as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085911427739">Tillman, 2009</xref>, p. 95). Thus, the development of identity is continuously evolving.</p>
<p>Educational researchers and educators need to recognize that racially stigmatizing contexts and instructional practices within schools that result in learning gaps and distinctly different learning opportunities are really what beset African American students. The notion that there is an achievement gap is really a failure to recognize the aforementioned. Academic performance and success comes to those students who buy into the ethos and ideals intrinsic to the school’s culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911427739">Berry III, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study that focused on teachers’ responsiveness to a selected group of African American middle-school students, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0042085911427739">Scott (2009)</xref> found that teachers emphasized the dissemination of analytical and logical information. This method of teaching was contraindicated for students who preferred personal and relational learning experiences. The instructional focus coupled with teachers’ demeaning and punitive actions resulted in disengagement and students returning the intimidation that they had experienced. Scott’s study offers an enlightening portrait of the disconnection that occurred among some of the school’s best teachers’ efforts to teach this group of African American students. The findings also exemplify what happens when a type of pedagogy is counterproductive to student success. As Murrell points out, this type of situativity for African Americans mitigates student agency and efficacy. To be a successful African American student, one has to have developed coping mechanisms to counter the mental health threats that are embedded in school cultural practices that are uninspiring and steeped in a history of racism that has yet to be countered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911427739">Carter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911427739">Cunningham, Corprew, &amp; Becker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085911427739">Griffin &amp; Allen, 2006</xref>, Murrell in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0042085911427739">Tillman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0042085911427739">Strayhorn, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The complex nature of racial identity is shaped by factors such as individual characteristics, family dynamics, history, and sociopolitical contexts. Research suggests that individuals begin becoming aware of their identity and begin exploring this construct as early as middle school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085911427739">Kao, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0042085911427739">Tatum, 2003</xref>). The development of racial identity becomes more complex for African Americans who consistently have to cope with erroneous perceptions, and stereotypes used to define them. As a consequence, African Americans who internalize these negative perceptions sometimes choose to avoid affiliations and activities associated with their racial group as they seek to position themselves as high academic achievers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0042085911427739">Thompson, 2002</xref>). Conversely, it is not uncommon to find African Americans who compromise their academic success to prove their allegiance to African American peers.</p>
<p>Adolescents become increasingly aware of their identities within a racial, gender, and academic context during high school. Adopted identities have a significant influence on the academic choices among many African American students at this juncture of their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>). Research suggests that African American students’ beliefs about self and race are closely related to their educational and social development, and to their perceptions regarding the value of education and its relationship to their current realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0042085911427739">Wright et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042085911427739">
<title>Media and African American Girls Perceptions</title>
<p>Mass media plays an influential role in positioning individuals in society. For those groups that are positively portrayed, this is very beneficial while others have had to consistently deal with the negative stereotypes that have been ascribed to their group. Researchers consistently question the role that mass media plays in African American girls self-perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911427739">Botta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085911427739">Gordon, 2008</xref>). All too often, images that portray African American girls as being hypersexual, lacking mainstream social habits, and other negative images are part of movies that highlight the lives of African American girls’ place in the American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0042085911427739">Rhodes, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi (2002)</xref> have discussed the implications that media has played in designating “who is beautiful” and how this affects African American girls perceptions of not only their physical attributes but also their abilities to excel academically. When African American girls get absorbed with fitting into White mainstream values and ideals, they typically used these ill-defined models as benchmarks of their ability to successfully navigate the various other challenges they face during their schooling.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427739">Morris (2007)</xref> contends that school personnel use these negative images to determine how they interact with this population, and that this has created numerous disadvantages for African American girls. For example, school personnel typically believe that African American girls demonstrate “loud and obnoxious behaviors” in voice and social interactions. This perception often results in teachers spending a greater percentage of their time addressing students’ social behaviors while neglecting to equally emphasize their academic well-being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0042085911427739">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Several scholars have used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simon’s (1998)</xref> cultural–ecological theory to describe and interpret the educational experiences of African American students. However, others have argued that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simons (1998)</xref> theoretical perspective does not sufficiently address school and institutional inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042085911427739">Foley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085911427739">Foster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042085911427739">Mickelson, 2003</xref>). Two tenets of the theory discuss (a) the way in which society responds to and treats minorities and (b) the manner in which minorities respond to various discriminatory and inequitable forces within society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simons (1998)</xref> posit that schools, as microcosms of society, reflect the larger society’s perception and treatment of African Americans as a group. In discussing the educational experience of minorities, Ogbu and Simons contend that structural barriers and societal discrimination contribute to their low achievement within schools. To this end, the presence of these structural barriers and discriminatory practices within schools have resulted in the development of an oppositional culture among African American students as a means of asserting their disapproval of the ways in which they are treated within schools. Embedded within this oppositional culture is the idea that African Americans do not excel because they view academic achievement as “acting White.” It is this oppositional culture, that Ogbu and Simons argue greatly contribute to large percentages of low achievement among African American students.</p>
<p>In this study, the researchers examined how the experiences of eight high-achieving discount or support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simons (1998)</xref> cultural–ecological theory. The study was guided by the following three research questions:</p>

<title>Research Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted at a high school located in southeastern school district of the United States. Kazak High, a fictitious name used to preserve confidentiality, houses two magnet programs, one academic and the other vocational. The school was located in a predominately low-income and working-class neighborhood. At the time of the study the school’s student population was comprised of more than 1,900 students. The racial composition of school was 57% African American, 30% White, 3% Latino, 8% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1.5% Multiracial, and 0.5% Native American. The racial composition of the students in the school’s academic magnet program was 90% White, 8% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% African American, and 1% Latino. In addition, the school employed 124 teachers and 6 guidance counselors. Historically, the majority of students attending Kazak High are of African American descent, making it an ideal location for the study.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data sources included semistructured individual and focus group interviews, journals entries, and field notes. Eight initial and eight follow-up interviews, lasting 35 to 65 min, were conducted with each participant. The first author audiotaped and transcribed the interviews. During the first focus group interview, semistructured questions were used to explore the participants’ shared experiences regarding their high school experiences. During the final focus group meeting, the participants were given copies of the researchers’ reconstructions and interpretations of what was discussed during the first focus group. The participants were asked to provide their feedback regarding the accuracy of these reconstructions and interpretations. Also, participants were asked to write at least three researcher-specified journal entries related to issues that emerged during the interviews. For example,</p>
<list id="list2-0042085911427739" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Describe school-related events that assisted you to achieve/maintain academic excellence (school-related events include any type of school-related event whether it occurred in the classroom, hallway or off-campus).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How have peers, teachers, parents, family, and community members influenced your decision to maintain high GPA’s?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Interview transcripts and reflective field journal notes were synthesized and typed into word processing computer files throughout data collection. Triangulation of these three modes of data collection contributed to the credibility of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085911427739">Patton, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0042085911427739">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911427739">Hatch’s (2002)</xref> inductive analysis method was used to search for patterns of meaning in the data. Following the transcription of all the data sets, the data were read and reread to identify “frames of analysis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911427739">Hatch, 2002</xref>, p. 163). The questions used in the interviews formed the basis for the frames of analysis. Frames of analysis provided “rough parameters” (p. 164) for examining the data. A total of 30 frames of analysis were identified during this process. Next, domains that reflected relationships represented in the data were created, because they give “researchers a way of getting at how participants organize their thoughts” (p. 165). A three-column table facilitated this stage of the analysis. In the first-column terms, the members of a category/domain were shown, the semantic relationships were listed in the second column, and the final column listed the domain/category. Domains, germane to the study, were identified and coded using Roman numerals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042085911427739">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0042085911427739">Patton, 2001</xref>). After rereading the transcripts, potential quotes were copied and placed into another three-column table. During the next step, the researchers sought to determine (a) if there were enough data to support the domain, (b) if the data were rich enough to defend the decision to include the domain, and (c) if there were any data that did not fit or “run counter to the relationships expressed in the domains” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911427739">Hatch, 2002</xref>, p. 172). The salient domains were then examined to identify if there were any “special relationships” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085911427739">Hatch, 2002</xref>, p. 172) between or among the domains. Following this, the researcher looked for themes that existed among the domains. A master outline, including a list of the themes, domains/categories and examples of excerpts that could be used to support each theme was developed.</p>

<title>Trustworthiness</title>
<p>Credibility, confirmability, peer debriefing, and triangulation established trustworthiness, an important component of the qualitative research process. Two member checks per individual were conducted to ensure that the participants’ voices were not distorted by researcher bias, and that reconstructed meanings represented those of the participants helped to ensure credibility. To assess confirmability, the first author remained immersed in the study to ascertain whether the findings were grounded in the data. A peer debriefer with three years experience as a researcher also assessed the data for confirmability. Triangulation of data, through the use of multiple sources of data, individual interviews, focus groups, and the participants’ journal entries, enhanced the dependability. In qualitative research, the transferability of findings depends on the degree of similarity between the original situation and the situation to which it is transferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085911427739">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2000</xref>). As the sample size in this study was small, the findings cannot be extrapolated beyond the context of the study. An analysis of the data revealed three major themes: (a) school policies and practices, (b) caring adults, and (c) self-identity and academic engagement.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section12-0042085911427739">
<title>School Policies and Practices</title>
<p>Many participants reported feeling unhappy with the inequalities that they believed existed between the school’s regular educational and magnet programs. The participants conveyed that students enrolled in the White-dominated magnet program (a) received more and better quality information and services regarding college preparation from the school’s guidance counselors and (b) receive better classroom instruction than students had in the regular educational program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911427739">Butler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). For example Brianna, an 11th grader observed,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is just so much that we are not exposed to. . . . My friend almost missed the deadline for dual enrollment, because the counselor waited until the last minute to give her the information. No one talks to us about scholarships like they do with [IB] students. . . . Then there are those teachers who barely teach you anything in class. It’s just crazy man. They do us wrong.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As suggested by past and current research, African American girls were underrepresented in advanced-level courses and college preparatory programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042085911427739">Moore &amp; Slate, 2008</xref>). Trina claimed that the school had many unfair practices. Although African American girls constituted the majority of all girls in the school, as Trina pointed out, only a very small percentage were enrolled in advanced-level courses or in the school’s prestigious International Baccalaureate Program.</p>
<p>Students felt that school personnel typically held negative perceptions of African American girls. They reported that these perceptions resulted in unfair administrative practices such as disproportionate citations for dress-code violations and discipline referrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911427739">Pugh-Lill, Neville, &amp; Poulin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042085911427739">Skiba, Michael, Nardo, &amp; Peterson, 2002</xref>). Amelia stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . they have different rules for us [African American girls] than they do for White and Asian girls. White girls and Asian girls can wear anything and get away with it, but they will send us to the dean for wearing the same thing. That’s ghetto [unfair] man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also reported instances where teachers were made racist comments during classroom instruction. For example Verona insisted,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . one of our teachers told us toward the beginning of the semester that many of us would get pregnant before the semester was over . . .. They don’t talk to the White girls like that. Some teachers treat us with a lot of respect, so we just talk to them about these incidents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of their distrust of the school system, participants were unwilling to report these teachers to their school administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). Instead, the participants managed these experiences by creating strong relationships with peers and school personnel who were respectful toward them and assisted them to achieve their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911427739">Lareau &amp; Horvat, 1999</xref>). The participants’ strongly held beliefs about the disparities in the school’s implementation of policies and practices potentially lead them to become skeptical of the school’s agenda as it related to them.</p>

<sec id="section13-0042085911427739">
<title>Caring Adults</title>
<sec id="section14-0042085911427739">
<title>Teacher pedagogy</title>
<p>Many participants reported that several teachers were sensitive and responsive to their sociocultural needs. This was exemplified by their use of relevant examples from a variety of sociocultural backgrounds, holding high expectations for student behavior and performance, providing a nurturing learning environment that valued students’ questions, and offering varied opportunities for students to practice their skills. Karima described teachers whom she felt created learning environments that were responsive to African American girls.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You know the teachers that are interested in making sure that African American girls succeed. They always tell you that you can do it and that you shouldn’t listen to the negative stuff that people say about us. . . . One teacher would take books to class about successful African American women to let us know that we can do anything we set our minds on. . . . [Other] teachers go out of their way to make sure that you understand everything that they teach in class. . . . [They] will take other textbooks to the class to help you to better understand the topic. They just show you in every way possible that they care about your learning. They are real [supportive].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conversely, the participants recounted instances where some teachers provided poor quality instruction and did little to promote and develop their critical thinking skills. Cassie explained, “some teachers just come to class and give you notes and worksheets and if you ask them a question, they tell you that you need to read the textbook.” Such attitudes perpetuated the participants’ distrust for the educational system and caused them to question the abilities of their teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0042085911427739">Ogbu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu &amp; Simons, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0042085911427739">Stinson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Brandy summarized the feeling of the participants, “. . . you have those teachers who don’t care whether you pass or fail. . . . Then there are those who act like they are scared of African American girls, because they say that we are loud and like to talk back.” She explained that the worst teachers gave assignments and took a prolonged period of time to return them, and, moreover, did not provide feedback to justify the grade given. She shared that teachers would “. . . cop an attitude if you ask them to explain this.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, several participants commented on the prejudicial preference some teachers showed by interacting more positively with non-African American girls, “preppy” African American girls, and Black girls of African and Caribbean descent. One participant defined “preppy” as African American girls who were “uppity,” always on task, well spoken, quiet, and polite. “Thuggish” girls were characterized as being argumentative, unwilling to participate in class, and always quick to fight their peers. Trina offered this perspective:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It seems like there are certain Black girls that they might favor and the rest of them they couldn’t care less for . . . some of them treat you differently according to whether you are preppy or whether you act all thuggish.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Karima expressed similar beliefs. She stated that teachers demonstrated less interest and respect toward those African American girls whom they perceived as being “loud” and argumentative:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If the African American girls are loud and like to argue, then I think they are treated different than those girls who are doing their work, [and are] quiet, and polite. I think teachers respect them more, and show more interest for them in the classroom.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teacher expectations exert a significant influence on student performance and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085911427739">Russell, 2005</xref>). Some of the participants suggested that several of the teachers’ academic expectations were congruent with society’s negative perceptions of African American girls. They asserted that these perceptions seemingly were conceived prior to their entering the class and were deeply entrenched in the interactions that they had with several teachers. These perceptions created estranged relationships between some teachers and some African American girls. Amelia offered this viewpoint:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think the teachers have the same expectations. I guess it’s the race thing. . . . Like for years and years, many African American girls have not been motivated, and I guess they expect, . . . more out of like the White girls than us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Overall, the participants valued teachers who demonstrated care and concern. They berated teachers who were oblivious to their needs and challenges. The participants believed that teacher expectations affected their academic future. They spoke highly of teachers who set high expectations and scaffolded instruction to meet their individualized learning needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0042085911427739">
<title>Family support</title>
<p>Each of the participants attributed their high academic performance to support from their parents and other family members. Although many parents and family members did not have college degrees, they offered moral, physical, and financial support that the participants needed to excel. Some of the participants talked about the role that their mothers played by monitoring their academic progress and overseeing the application process for college. Other participants reported that through words and actions, their parents or grandparents encouraged them to do well and persevere against the obstacles that they faced. Similar to what researchers reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085911427739">Kerpelman, Shoffner, &amp; Ross-Griffin, 2002</xref>; Turnage, 2004), several participants stated that their mothers were their primary influence and support. Trina described her mother’s support:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am able to do well in school because of my mom. She checks everyday to see what’s going on with me in school, and if I have homework. . . . She doesn’t know how to go about helping me to apply for college, but she will ask other people . . . or my guidance counselor about stuff that I have to do. Sometimes I forget to meet deadlines . . . so she keeps reminding me of what I have to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Karima described her mother’s diligence and support that helped her to acquire a college scholarship. She recounted how her mom’s persistence encouraged her to not give up:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This scholarship thing . . . she was, like, you’re not going to give up, you are gonna stay up and you’re gonna write the essay and keep looking. My mom would spend hours on the Internet looking for scholarships even when I didn’t feel like doing it. In the end, I got three scholarships to attend college in the fall.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants also discussed how parents and family influenced their decisions regarding schoolwork and activities. Some participants reported that their parents directed decisions they made regarding extracurricular activities and subjects they enrolled in. Others stated that their parents gave them the autonomy to choose their subjects and extracurricular activities. Erika stated that although her mom directed her decisions about school, her dad permitted her to choose her activities and subjects. Some participants also reported that their parents and family members strongly influenced their selection of courses. In most cases, they encouraged students to enroll in rigorous courses such as honors, academy, and AP. Other participants stated that their parents encouraged them to participate in extracurricular activities such as the precollegiate, student government, cheerleading, and other. For example, Amelia stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My parents insisted that I participate in student government, Precollegiate and the Spanish club. My mom . . . wants to ensure that I get a rounded education (gestures with hand, and laughs). . . she is always pushing me to enroll in Advanced Placement and Academy courses.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All the participants agreed that family and parental support were integral to their academic success and that managing their academic success became more challenging when family or parental support was lacking.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0042085911427739">
<title>Academic and Racial Identity</title>
<p>All of the participants possessed a strong sense of self that prompted them to work hard and change their trajectories. Although each of the students reported that family members encouraged them to excel (Author identity masked for review, 2008), it was their tenacity to supersede their perceptions of society’s expectations that propelled them toward successful academic performance. Each participant yearned for improved social and economic mobility for themselves and immediate family members. For instance, Erika suggested that excelling in school would give her an opportunity to pursue her dream of having a more affluent life. Amelia linked academic success to a better life for herself and her mother. Brandy and Trina discussed their fears of remaining impoverished that would perpetuate the cycle of poverty within their families and communities. All the participants reported witnessing the plight among individuals who depended on government assistance and this motivated them to achieve. Similarly, Verona viewed academic excellence as an opportunity to excel in a world that she thought socially and racially inequitable. She shared,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>for me to do something good with my life, I have to excel and go to college. As an African American female, I know I have to work two, three, four times harder than the average White female to do well, so I am working hard now. Education gives you the opportunity to do so much more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All of the participants articulated strong self-confidence in their cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427739">Grant, Battle, Murphy, &amp; Heggoy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). The participants valued education, because they viewed it as a means to reverse the negative social and economic trajectories that their families and communities had experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427739">Matthews-Armstead, 2002</xref>). Each participant experienced personal, social, and/or economic barriers such as the absence of a parent, limited social and economic resources, and negative peer and adult role models. However, they did not wallow or allow these situations to thwart their academic goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085911427739">Zirkel, 2005</xref>). Instead, they firmly held to a belief that hard work and positive academic outcomes would allow them to achieve the success that had eluded many of their family and community members.</p>
<p>Several participants talked about their devotion to their academics. Each participant was enrolled in two or more AP, International Baccalaureate (IB), or honors classes.</p>
<p>Fifty percent of the participants in this study had after-school jobs that required working 20 to 25 hr per week. The participants reported that they sacrificed “hanging out with friends” and “talking on the phone or watching television” to complete their homework and maintain jobs. Brandy and Amelia talked about developing a study schedule to ensure that they did not have to “cram” or become overly stressed during their final exams. Other participants described how they stayed up late to complete homework assignments or prepared study guides and notes for each of their classes. They asserted that school was their first priority and described how they dedicated the time and effort needed to ensure academic success. Collectively, they expressed a desire to achieve high grades in each of their classes, yet, they developed study habits that would not place too much pressure on them. For example, Brandy, an 11th grader who was enrolled in three AP courses, an honors course, and two regular education courses wrote,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>there is one week until midterms. I have figured out my study schedule and see that my history class needs the most attention . . .. I don’t have time for anything else but school. Television, friends, and going out are out of the question. Education is very valuable to me, and I know that my exam grades will be very pleasing to me when it’s time for report cards.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another 12th grader, Erika who was enrolled in three AP, two IB, and one honors class expressed similar sentiments:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You just have to work hard every day and stay focused. I rarely watch TV or talk to my friends . . . There is just so much work to do that I really don’t have a lot of time . . . during the week. I want to get into a good college . . . it’s worth the sacrifice (laughs).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their responses juxtaposed with research depict the social, cultural, and ethnic pressure that confront some high-performing African American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085911427739">Ford &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427739">Matthews-Armstead, 2002</xref>) and illustrate the realities that these high school girls faced as they sought to remain focused within the school context.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simons’ (1998)</xref> tenets regarding the presence of structural barriers and discrimination were evident in this study. In regards to the discrimination, participants were highly critical of the subtle and sometimes overt disparities in school personnel’s policies and practices. They berated the school’s practice of singling out African American girls for dress-code violations and that caused African American girls receive more discipline referrals than non-African American girls. These findings are consistent with research that indicates African American girls are more likely to be penalized for dress-code violations and other behavior issues than non-African American girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042085911427739">Morris 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0042085911427739">Pugh-Lilly et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0042085911427739">Skiba et al., 2002</xref>). Of equal importance, the participants reported that they received unequal information regarding college admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427739">Matthews-Armstead, 2002</xref>). This was demonstrated in participants’ claims regarding the amount and type of college information that was provided to them. In their view, school personnel placed more emphasis on providing college-related information to students who were enrolled in the academy program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). They stressed the need for equal access to college-related information.</p>
<p>Evident throughout the study was the influence that caring participants had on students’ academic performance. Embedded in these findings is the key role that teachers’ pedagogical practices play in fostering student engagement and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911427739">Booker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427739">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>). They described the contributions that several teachers made to ensure that they achieved academic success. For most of the participants, this was evident by teachers’ willingness to meet their individual needs both inside and outside of the school and by teachers’ use of culturally relevant during instruction and interactions. While expressing their appreciation, all participants suggested that caring teachers were integral to their academic success.</p>
<p>Conversely, the participants identified teacher attitudes and practices that dissuaded their engagement in school such as (a) tendencies to interact more positively with Black girls who were of African and/or Caribbean descent, (b) lack of genuine care for their academic and social well-being, (c) teachers’ stereotypical beliefs regarding African American girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427739">Gay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>), and (d) utilization of instructional strategies that were incongruent with the needs and experiences of the students. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427739">Ladson-Billings’ (2001)</xref> recommendation for culturally relevant pedagogy, the participants point out pertinent advice for teachers and school administrators who grapple with identifying effective strategies to meet the unique needs of African American girls.</p>
<p>Many of the participants believed that teachers and other school personnel held low expectations for them. They suggested that teachers’ beliefs were based on how African American girls were portrayed in the media. The participants also discussed school personnel’s perception that African American girls were loud. Interestingly, whereas many school personnel viewed being loud as a negative characteristic, the participants viewed this as positive. School personnel suggested that being loud was assertive and outspoken. However, they did acknowledge that it could also be viewed as a negative trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0042085911427739">Scott, 2002</xref>). Several participants also expressed a general distrust for school personnel. They recounted incidents of discrimination against them and their peers. However, they did not report these instances to school administrators because they had no faith in the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). Instead, the participants managed these experiences by creating strong relationships with peers and school personnel who supported their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085911427739">Lareau &amp; Horvat, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The theory of oppositional culture postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0042085911427739">Ogbu and Simons (1998)</xref> was not manifested in the participants’ descriptions of how they navigated their racial and gender identity to achieve high academic achievement. Although the participants were aware of the barriers that their identity provoked, they were determined to dismantle widely held stereotypic perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 2005</xref>). Thus, each participant remained engaged in school and established nuclei of support among amicable school personnel and their families to assist them in overcoming any established barriers that they encountered. Contrary to the cultural–ecological claim that African Americans withdraw from the educational process because they do not believe that their participation will remove the structural barriers that their group faces, all of the participants expressed a strong belief in the value of attending college, because they viewed it as a means of reversing the negative social and economic trends of their families and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085911427739">Grant et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085911427739">Hubbard, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085911427739">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042085911427739">Matthews-Armstead, 2002</xref>). Although each participant experienced personal, social, and/or economic barriers such as the absence of a parent, limited social and economic resources, and negative peer and adult role models, they did not allow these circumstances to prevent them from excelling in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0042085911427739">Zirkel, 2005</xref>). Instead, they made the necessary sacrifices, worked hard, and remained determined to achieve academic excellence.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The participants’ voices draw attention to the factors that contribute to the school experiences of high-achieving African American high school girls, discount and support tenets of Ogbu and Simons cultural–ecological theory, and highlight the need for researchers and other educators to continue to examine other theories that are suited to describe the educational experiences of various minority groups. Furthermore, their responses offer ways that high schools can restructure their environment’s policies and practices to better facilitate high achievement among minority grouping, and, in particular, African American girls. The following suggestions are based on the findings of the study.</p>
<list id="list3-0042085911427739" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Set higher expectations for African American girls</italic>: The students continuously described the negative perceptions that many school personnel held for African American girls. Students’ self-perception influences their academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0042085911427739">Saunders, Davis, Williams, &amp; Williams, 2004</xref>). Negative perceptions of self prevent many African American girls from realizing their potential and tend to be based on the interactions that they have with teachers and other school personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085911427739">Franklin &amp; Boyd-Franklin, 2000</xref>). Establishing higher expectations for African American girls is integral, because it builds their self-perception and motivates them to remain fully engaged in their school experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085911427739">Russell, 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hire highly qualified and caring teachers</italic>: The diverse nature of today’s classroom requires teachers who are experts in their subject areas and sensitive to the unique needs of their students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085911427739">Gay, 2000</xref>). Many participants described teachers who lacked the expert knowledge for the subjects they taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085911427739">Darling-Hammond, 2006</xref>). Some participants complained that the teaching methods were incongruent with their ways of learning and, thus, reduced their ability to fully learn. Implicitly, there was a need for more culturally relevant teaching strategies in their classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085911427739">Ladson-Billings, 2001</xref>). Training teachers in culturally relevant methods is also recommended. The importance that the participants placed on caring, teachers highlight the need for teachers to exude a caring during their interactions with all students, but in particular, African American girls. To address this issue, school administrators should be committed to hiring the most qualified and committed teachers for each subject area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911427739">Andrews, 2004</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>College preparation for all students</italic>: “All students should be provided with the opportunity, or at the very least, encouraged to consider college” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085911427739">Howard, 2003</xref>, p. 15). A number of participants mentioned that they did not have equal access to some college preparation courses or related information. High schools should make a concerted effort to ensure that students have equal access to AP, International Baccalaureate courses, other college preparation courses, and relevant college preparation information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0042085911427739">Norman et al., 2001</xref>). Placing college-related information in all classrooms and providing frequent information sessions for all students will ensure that they have equal access to college-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085911427739">Grantham &amp; Ford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0042085911427739">Russell, 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Establish clearly delineated rules and regulations</italic>: Research suggests that African American girls are often singled out for dress-code violations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042085911427739">Frazier-Kouassi, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042085911427739">Morris, 2007</xref>). Many participants berated school personnel for these incidents and suggested that African American girls received more referrals than non-White African American girls. In many cases, these referrals resulted from teacher’s misperceptions of behaviors and social practices. Establishing and implementing clearly delineated rules regarding dress code and other student behaviors could encourage African American girls to feel more connected to a school system that they believe unfairly targets them (Holcomb-McCoy, 2001).</p></list-item>
