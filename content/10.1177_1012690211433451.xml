<abstract>
<p>This article considers the transferability of sporting mega-event strategies across time and place. In doing so, it presents a number of arguments highlighting the progressive global standardization of sporting mega-event counter-terrorism strategies comprising continually reproduced security leitmotifs. Such orthodoxies are drawn from a range of experiences at both sporting and non-sporting mega-events. By contrast to these globalized models, the terrorist threats they seek to counter are almost always rooted in diverse local settings. This convergence of sporting mega-event counter-terrorism strategies does not simply represent an uncritical imposition of an external framework of security, however. Instead, this article identifies and interrogates how sporting mega-event security planning is also tempered by a range of localized processes, including vernacular cultures of security and the scale of extant security infrastructures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Terrorism and counter-terrorism have become defining political issues of the last decade. Whilst 9/11 did not necessarily bring a step change in the prevailing approach to counter-terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211433451">Fussey, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1012690211433451">Lyon, 2003</xref>), as popularly claimed, what did change was the availability of resources and attendant intensity of response. With reference to securing the global sporting mega-event, and particularly since the lockdown of the Montreal Olympics in 1976, securing the spectacle from the human, infrastructural, economic, psychological and reputational impacts of terrorism has been of seminal importance to security planners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Johnston, 2007</xref>). There is little to suggest that this will change in an era of post-millennial tensions typified by the threat of mass-casualty terrorist attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1012690211433451">Laqueur, 1999</xref>). Focusing on the security responses to terrorism instituted at the Olympics and other sporting mega-events, this article analyses the relationship between terrorism and counter-terrorism at such gatherings. In doing so, it identifies and analyses a number of tensions and contestations at the heart of these security practices. In particular, organizing security at sporting mega-events is normally an exceptional and uncertain endeavour for the hosts that, over time, has led to particular security orthodoxies prevailing. This article identifies how these ecologies of security develop via cross-pollination from other domains and adopt the staples of applied criminology. Of course, standardization does not necessarily simply equate to colonization. Here, localized processes and procedures inevitably seek to impose themselves. Tensions therefore exist at the intersection of global expectations and localized counter-terrorism practices. Often, the consistency of these counter-terrorism strategies unevenly map onto the idiosyncratic geographies to which they are applied and may abrade with a range of security strategies already in situ. Moreover, the application of counter-terrorism measures, as a component of the wider discourse of security, raises fundamental questions about what, exactly, is being secured? From what or from whom is security being sought?</p>
<p>To address these issues, the article is organized over three main areas of discussion. First, it examines the diversity of terrorist action in relation to sporting mega-events. Here, beyond the overstated (although important) emphases on Munich (1972), Atlanta (1996) and 9/11 (2001), lies a more complex picture of terrorist aspiration and action. Given the varying operational and targeting agendas that diverse ideological motivations bring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433451">Coaffee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211433451">Fussey, 2011</xref>), this generates considerable challenges for those charged with providing security. As such, whilst ‘total security’ is often proclaimed and aspired to, in a world of constrained financial, human and conceptual resources, its realization necessarily involves selective choices over the projected composition of risks and hazards. These choices, and the counter-terrorism strategies they inspire, are the focus of the second area of discussion. In doing so, the article outlines the form of globalized mega-sporting event orthodoxies and, in the concluding part of the article, considers the relationship – harmonious and discordant – between threat and security, terrorism and counter-terrorism, in relation to sporting mega-events.</p>
<p>Before engaging in such discussion, it is perhaps important to pause and consider what is meant by the sporting mega-event and how it has been conceptualized within the social sciences. This enables a more detailed understanding of its prominence among terrorist targeting preferences and, in a distinct yet related domain, the relationship between security approaches at such occasions and at ‘non-mega’ events. In general, mega-events of a sporting (such as the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup) and non-sporting (such as international Expos) nature may be seen as exceptional and, in some respects, ephemeral. Often, mega-events involve a level of organization unmatched outside of wartime and planning that requires significant alterations to the governance of the host city or country. Despite the evanescent nature of the actual occasion, mega-events also continue to resonate for long periods. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1012690211433451">Roche (2000)</xref> argues, mega-events are short-term episodes, yet hold long-term consequences for their hosts. Such consequences may be in the form of urban renewal (such as at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics), improved urban infrastructure (the 1964 Tokyo Olympics), or monumental levels of debt (1976 Montreal Olympics and 2004 Athens Olympics). Among the increasing number of occasions that may be afforded mega-event status, the Olympics have a particular prominence owing to the projection of a specific set of internationally recognized (if superficial) aspirational values (such as the ‘Olympic Identity’ generated during the Mexico City Games of 1968, and reproduced ever since) and its status as a global media event (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1012690211433451">Jennings, 2012</xref>). Of particular interest to this article is the reconfiguration of security governance that mega-events bring. Here, global pressures relating to the demands of international committees (such as the IOC and FIFA) exert particular influence upon domestic security arrangements. At the same time, local orthodoxies, cultures and resources play a significant role in shaping the nature of such provisions.</p>

<title>Terrorism and sport</title>
<p>To unpack this relationship between terrorist threat and security response at sporting mega-events, this section will assess the scale and diversity of terrorist threats before considering the scale and form of the responses they have stimulated. Rather than providing an exhaustive and narrative list of events, what follows is an analysis of some of the broader processes at work, particularly related to terrorist threats, and their implications for future security planning. This informs the article’s organizing argument that whilst these terrorist threats develop under myriad logics normally connected to their host environment, security strategies evolve in a more abstracted, consistent and internationalized way. This culminates in a standardized approach to security that is deployed into uneven topographies of threat within host cities and nations.</p>
<p>Any analysis of terrorism and sport – and particularly one such as this that asks questions over what is being secured and the way threats are constructed – needs to demonstrate how counter-terrorist strategies hold substantively different meanings across different nationalities. As the nascent trend of hosting sporting mega-events into new territories (and towards greater judicial plurality) develops, as evinced by recent decisions by both the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and FIFA,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1012690211433451">1</xref></sup> these disparities are set to increase. Moreover, documenting terrorist threats to sporting mega-events, however, necessarily entails numerous caveats. First, debates inevitably occur over which activities can be deemed ‘terrorist’. In the case of the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee’s insistence that the Games are free of politics (see below) may render any political statement a simultaneous act of Olympic resistance. There are many examples of such protests, including those surrounding the aboriginal Lubicon land claims during Calgary in 1988, protests over socio-economic inequality and the diversion of public monies to the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002 or the ‘No Olympics on Stolen Land’ campaign at Vancouver 2010. The second consideration concerns questions of ‘when’ and ‘where’ attacks occur and the degree to which these can be considered as directly relating to the sporting mega-event. This has considerable implications for the shape and form of the counter-terrorism strategies adopted at such events. Aside from the much-emphasized attacks at Munich (1972) and Atlanta (1996), for example, <italic>almost all</italic> terrorist activity surrounding the Olympics has occurred outside of the time and place of the Games, thus illustrating the importance of the spatial and temporal displacement of terrorism. Third is the issue of establishing whether terrorism or politically motivated violence specifically targets the event. In some cases it is explicit, such as the Italian Anarchist Federation attacks on Olympic merchandise stores ahead of the 2006 Turin Winter Games or, famously, Eric Rudolph’s attack at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Other links are suggestive, often apparent through the timing of attacks such as the left-wing Revolutionary Workers Association attack on Narita airport as spectators and competitors arrived in Japan days ahead of the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. Others are less clear and whilst extant terrorist activity may inform security planning for mega-events, the extent to which the events are being targeted is less obvious.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, what is clear is the symbolic utility that sporting mega-events, particularly the Olympics, hold for a diverse range of terrorist actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433451">Coaffee et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to contemporary emphases on violent jihadi extremism, for example, since 1988 terrorist threats to the Olympic Games have come from ethno-separatists, state-sponsored proxies, left-wing groups, right-wing extremists, environmentalists, violent jihadi extremists and anarchists (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211433451">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1012690211433451">Table 1</xref> demonstrates the range of different groups that have found utility in targeting the Olympics. The purpose here is not to document threats and attacks that have occurred to each Olympic Games but merely illustrative of the diversity of groups that have targeted sporting mega-events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1012690211433451">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>Given the usual disparities in targeting preferences and operational foci of different types of terrorist groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1012690211433451">Fussey, 2011</xref>), the fact that disparate terrorist actors favour the same symbolic targets regardless of their ideological, operational and tactical diversity is highly significant. This dynamic is perhaps articulated most clearly in relation to the three geographically proximate yet ideologically divergent groups that explicitly targeted the Barcelona Olympics of 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1012690211433451">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, despite the conspicuous internationalism of sporting mega-events, and in an era of supposed ‘international terrorism’, many of the groups that target them are grounded in specific <italic>local</italic> socio-political contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1012690211433451">4</xref></sup> This marks an interesting contrast to the conspicuous internationalism of the Olympic Games. These localized dynamics, in particular, sit uneasily against the globalized models of security that police such events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1012690211433451">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whilst sporting mega-events often constitute aspirational terrorist targets it is important to recognize that the connection between sport and terrorist activity is much deeper. Given the exceptionality of sporting mega-event security initiatives, this enduring link is significant. However, despite the risk of terrorist attack, major sporting events, with the exception of the attacks at the 1972 and 1996 Summer Olympics, have remained relatively untouched by international terrorism, although ‘security’ fears are often used as a justification for cancelling an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2009</xref>). This situation altered in March 2009 after a Fedayeen-style attack in Lahore, Pakistan, carried out against the Sri Lankan cricket team. As noted in <italic>The Times</italic>: ‘sport is the world’s great soft target, yet has led a relatively charmed life . . . until now’ but that this is likely to change: ‘Sport, with its huge crowds and big spaces, is essentially insecure. Sport is already a stage and the world is watching. All a terrorist has to do is alter the script and the publicity in the world is his to command’ (<italic>The Times</italic>, 2009, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Subsequently, in more recent years therefore, a number of high-profile terrorist attacks have been committed both against athletes and spectators at sporting events. Regarding the former, these include attacks on Sri Lanka’s cricket team in Lahore (above) and the ambush of the Togolese national football team in Angola’s Cabinda province 10 months later. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211433451">Richards (2010)</xref> also documents a number of additional acts of violence, including a suicide attack at the start of the 2008 Colombo marathon. Explicit threats (such as those preceding the withdrawal of the British women’s badminton team from the 2009 World Championships in Hyderabad) and generalized fears of terrorism (including the postponement of the UK-held Ryder Cup following 9/11) have also affected participation in high-profile sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1012690211433451">Richards, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Away from the normally ‘hardened’ targets of professional sportsmen and women, terrorists have also consistently targeted spectators of a range of sports. Examples include the aborted Grand National of 1997 following specific threats from Irish Republicans, the 2002 ETA bombing of a street near the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu ahead of a UEFA Champions’ League match between Real Madrid and Barcelona (and the evacuation of the same stadium two years later following ETA threats during a match between Real Madrid and Basque team Real Sociedad), the murder of 75 spectators at a Pakistani volleyball match in January 2010 and (potentially) Joel Hinrich’s apparent suicide attack outside a University of Oklahoma American football match in 2005. Congregations of large numbers of people and a spectacle holding global significance have also made the FIFA World Cup a target for violent attacks. In May 2010, for example, Reuters reported that Iraqi security personnel arrested a Saudi national al-Qaeda operative they claimed was, under the co-ordination of Ayman al-Zawahiri, planning to attack the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Other related events have occurred largely beyond the consciousness of Western media. One such example is the recent twin mass casualty attacks by contemporary Islamist bête noir al Shabab. Based in Somalia, al Shabab’s first attack outside of the domestic arena targeted a crowd of spectators watching the FIFA World Cup final on television in Kampala, killing 74 people. Significant here is the way this target simultaneously serviced two grievances: al Shabab’s hostility to what they see as the degeneracy of football (and its spectatorship), and to the Ugandan military contingent of African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).</p>
<p>Overall, the above examples illustrate the powerful symbolic connection between hosting sporting mega-events events and the fear of terrorist violence. A number of significant issues are at play here. First, such diffusion of attacks and the relative vulnerability of such populations are absent from the discourses surrounding counter-terrorism and sport. Second, and as this discussion has shown, despite most sport-related terrorist attacks existing outside of the time and/or place of the actual event they receive far less attention across public and policy discourses. It is no exaggeration to state that, in the West, for example, the al Shabab attack is more quickly forgotten than Eric Rudolph’s. Most notably, however, is the significant contrast between the diversity of terrorist actions and the similarities across strategies aimed at their amelioration. It is to this discussion that the article now turns.</p>

<title>Sporting mega-events and global security knowledge transfer</title>
<p>In order to host sporting mega-events, candidate cities and nations are required to provide significant assurances of their ability to host a safe and secure spectacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1012690211433451">Boyle and Haggerty, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Johnston, 2007</xref>). In doing so, a distinct anatomy of conceptual and physical security motifs have emerged. Since the Black September Organization attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics, ‘safety and security’ has overwhelmingly centred on the prevention of terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1012690211433451">6</xref></sup> However, since 2001, given the escalation and changing nature of the terrorist threat these security ambitions are increasingly difficult and costly to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Murakami Wood, 2006</xref>). Organizers of sporting mega-events are faced with a number of issues when developing such strategies. In particular, both the IOC and FIFA not only invest responsibility for security to the local hosts, they demand that such securitization does not get in the way of the sporting activities. However, as the following discussion demonstrates, such promises are easily made and often broken. Recent sporting mega-events have seen the spectacle overshadowed by dystopian images of ‘cities under siege’ (inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Johnston, 2007</xref>). Such exorbitant levels of security also transform the cityscape into a series of temporary ‘spaces of exception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1012690211433451">Agamben, 2005</xref>) with displacement of the policing by consent as special regulatory regimes are brought to bear so as to control behaviour and maintain order.</p>
<p>Despite the disparities of security infrastructures and policing priorities of the 18 different nations that have hosted FIFA World Cups and Summer and Winter Olympics in the post-Munich era, a number of distinct approaches to security have emerged. This represents the transfer of security knowledge on a global scale. In doing so, it is important to recognize that the development of these similar counter-terrorism strategies do not simply represent an uncritical imposition of an external framework of security. Instead, these sporting mega-event security planning processes intersect with a range of complex global and local processes and agendas.</p>
<p>What is clear though is that many sporting mega-event security operations repeatedly seek to orientate their strategies around a few core principles. These are normally grouped under the broad headings of ‘command’, ‘control’, ‘co-ordination’, ‘communications’ and ‘intelligence’. Event hosts’ strategies are usually structured in a manner that services these principles in a number of various ways. These may be formally articulated, such as in Athens’ C4I (Command, Control, Co-ordination, Communications, Intelligence) model of security for the 2004 Summer Olympics; selectively accented, such as the London 2012 C3 strategy which places primacy on command, control and co-ordination (yet embeds communication throughout); or is tacitly embedded (if not conspicuously articulated) within the strategy, such as the Johannesburg policing strategy during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1012690211433451">7</xref></sup> This article now turns towards an exegesis of the particular strategies deployed to service these principles.</p>
<sec id="section4-1012690211433451">
<title>The martial and the metropolitan</title>
<p>One notable theme of sporting mega-event security strategies is that of militarism. This can be identified in a number of forms, which fall into two broad themes: the application of military-type approaches to security and the manifest use of existing military personnel and related assets. Regarding the former, this is perhaps most notable in the use of surveillance technologies. Here, technologies used to secure military installations or to execute military operations are routinely tested in the host’s urban setting. Myriad examples exist. Here, the 1980 Winter Olympic Games at Lake Placid represent a particularly significant refinement of mega-event security strategies, incorporating innovations on surveillance and security practices previously used to secure military sites and airports which then subsequently became strategies emulated at all later Olympics. Such initiatives included the use of 12-foot high touch-sensitive fencing, voice analysers, ground radar, night vision and improved CCTV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1012690211433451">LPOOC, 1980</xref>) to secure the Olympic site. More recently, a Freedom of Information request to Kent Police has revealed plans to use Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs), often referred to as ‘drones’ and similar to (but not the same as) those deployed in Afghanistan, to patrol the skies above the London 2012 Olympic Games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1012690211433451">8</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1012690211433451">Minton (2010)</xref>, Olympic-related UAV surveillance has already occurred, observing the ‘Olympic Handover Party’ in central London during 2008.</p>
<p>Such developments connect with broader processes of ‘urban militarization’, an issue that has been afforded increasing academic attention over the last 20 years (see amongst others, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1012690211433451">Coleman and Sim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1012690211433451">Davis, 1990</xref>). In one authoritative study, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1012690211433451">Graham (2010)</xref> characterizes such developments as a trend of ‘new military urbanism’, where the urban sphere – now home to the majority of the global population – is the site of experimentation and application of martial techniques and technologies of control. In such circumstances, mega-event militarization exemplifies an existing process of urban governance. This process of urban militarization is itself connected to sporting events through experimentation and field-testing. For example, one-off high profile events like the US Super Bowl are routinely used to field-test the latest military technology for both use in combat operations and for rolling out in subsequent sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Murakami Wood, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>What is also significantly different about sporting mega-events, however, is the temporary deployment of large numbers of military personnel into the host setting. This has been particularly apparent in the operations of single-party states with large deployments of military personnel at the Moscow (1980), Seoul (1988)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1012690211433451">9</xref></sup> and Beijing (2008) Games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Fussey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1012690211433451">SOOC, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211433451">Peng and Yu, 2008</xref>, respectively). Indeed, at the time, Seoul’s security co-coordinator described his task as ‘very much like preparing for war’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211433451">Cottrell, 2003</xref>: 311). These martial features also became prominent in democratic societies. The advanced perimeter security surrounding Los Angeles Olympic sites was provided by the Pentagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1012690211433451">Cottrell, 2003</xref>), as it was at Atlanta, and the daily policing of the event was heavily supplemented by the US military. In a demonstration of further connectivity between Olympiads, the US navy also provided water-borne security at Seoul. This militarization, now established, continued throughout the 1990s, evident at Barcelona with the construction of bunkers around the perimeter of the main Olympic Village and tanks situated at strategic locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Fussey, 2010</xref>) and at Atlanta with the deployment of 11,000 troops to help police the Games (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1012690211433451">Buntin, 2000a</xref>). This approach continued into the new millennium with the deployment of 4000 military personnel to protect the Sydney Games, almost equivalent to Australia’s geographically proximate East Timor UN peacekeeping commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1012690211433451">Lenskyj, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1012690211433451">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Private security and the public spectacle</title>
<p>Other components of the mega-event security ensemble are private. A key moment in mega-event security history here was the 1984 Los Angeles Games where the entire programme was organized by the private sector. Private security personnel – replete with contracts that may be ephemeral, temporary and terminated – have since become a key feature of mega-event security operations both sporting and non-sporting. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Rogers (2008)</xref> highlight how private security specialists have become integral to security operations surrounding large-scale political conferences held in the UK. In relation to sporting events, significant questions have arisen over the post-event retention of these roles and individuals, as evinced in the case of the 1988 Seoul Olympics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1012690211433451">Lee, 2004</xref>). Private security ‘legacy’ implications are also indirect. At the time of writing the British Security Industry Association has co-developed the ‘Bridging the Gap’ scheme, aimed at recruiting the shortfall in the required 7000 private security guards for the 2012 Games, which will invest swathes of young people with the skills needed to service the ephemeral security needs of this exceptional event. The utility of diverting of thousands of East Londoners towards these specific areas of further education will be ascertained once the post-event (legacy) employment market for this sector becomes clear. Such issues around local resourcing, however, illustrate the way in which aspirations to provide globalized models of security are shaped and tempered by local conditions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such approaches again connect with and exaggerate enduring and extant processes affecting the governance of the urban realm: the privatization of public space. Whilst this concept normally refers to the ways in which formerly public space is becoming embedded with commercially conducive visions of order (inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1012690211433451">Reeve, 1996</xref>), such newly ordered and pseudo-privatized spaces are increasingly patrolled by private security contractors.</p>

<title>Observing the spectacle</title>
<p>Not all security measures are human. Since Montreal’s first major deployment of surveillance cameras at the 1976 Summer Olympics, ever-advancing surveillance technologies have become a central component of mega-event security. Whilst such measures are largely punitive, a common mistake in the broader literature is to uncritically assume that they are exclusively so. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1012690211433451">Lyon (1994)</xref>, for example, stresses the importance of the repressive and protective ‘Janus faces’ of surveillance. In this context, surveillance mechanisms also surveil the body (to ensure fair competition), or monitor dangerous crowd densities (a cause of injury to many visitors to the 1976 Innsbruck Winter Olympics) or assist with the co-ordination of emergency responders following an incident (as evinced by events prior to the Opening Ceremony of the 1994 World Cup). Nevertheless, successive sporting mega-events have seen considerable expansion in punitive law enforcement uses of surveillance technologies. Such developments are visible during the last English-hosted football-related mega-sporting event – the UEFA Euro 1996 football championships. A month before the championships were due to commence on 5 May, a number of minor disturbances broke out in Newcastle upon Tyne, one of the host cities, following Newcastle United FC’s capitulation in the Premier League title race. In response to the disorder, the police launched ‘Operation Harvest’, which drew on footage from 16 city centre CCTV cameras, and proceeded to conduct dawn raids on 30 suspects’ homes culminating in the arrest of 19 individuals. At the time this was claimed to have been the biggest policing operation ever to use CCTV technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1012690211433451">Bennetto, 1996</xref>). Of interest here is the way entirely separate CCTV systems were becoming co-opted into more integrated meta-networks. Another important component of the Euro 96 surveillance strategy was mobility in response to the hosting of major sporting fixtures. Mobile surveillance vehicles, so-called ‘hoolivans’, were extensively deployed throughout the championships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1012690211433451">Marsh et al., 1996</xref>) and have now become a central component of football and other sporting mega-event policing strategies internationally, as evinced at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1012690211433451">Klauser, 2008</xref>) and 2008 European Championships in Austria and Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1012690211433451">Hagemann, 2008</xref>) and in the forthcoming 2012 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Technological innovation has also accompanied such operational developments. Perhaps most famous was the much trumpeted use of Face Recognition CCTV (FRCCTV) to scan the crowd as they entered the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa for the XXXV Super Bowl in 2001. Less publicly proclaimed were the manifest failures of the system, which failed to identify anyone engaged in anything more serious than ticket touting and occupied operators with repeated false alarms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1012690211433451">American Civil Liberties Union [ACLU], 2002</xref>). Technological innovation to protect US sporting events continued at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City the following year via the deployment of advanced FBI-supplied communications systems (which failed to work correctly in the mountain terrain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1012690211433451">Decker et al., 2005</xref>), biometric scanners and more ambitious technological strategies to monitor atmospheric gamma radiation particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1012690211433451">Heller, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Technological deployment was perhaps most notable at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games via the development of a ‘panoptic fortress’ to give assurances to the rest of the world that the city was safe and secure to host the world greatest sporting spectacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1012690211433451">Samatas, 2004</xref>: 115). In spite of (and perhaps because of) its novelty and complexity, the technological centrepiece of the strategy, Science Applications International Corporation’s (SAIC) ‘C4I’ system, was widely seen a colossal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1012690211433451">Samatas, 2007</xref>). Insurmountable problems included its inability to host large numbers of potential users, failure to operate to capacity and the providers’ failure to establish the system in time for the 2008 Beijing Games.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1012690211433451">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Reconfiguring space</title>
<p>A key component of sporting mega-event security strategies is the reconfiguration of the physical environment via a series of efforts to ‘design-in’ counter-terrorism features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2009</xref>). As noted above, <italic>temporary</italic> security solutions have often literally swamped the host cities and in particular the sporting venues. However, <italic>permanent</italic> design and architectural features intended to counter such threats has, to date, been largely absent from security planning. Recently, however, it has become a key strategic issue as is clearly in evidence during planning for the London 2012 Olympic cycle. Indeed, the London Bid Book (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1012690211433451">London2012, 2004</xref>) explicitly promised that surveillance and security operations will begin at the start of construction or adaptation for every venue and will continue throughout the Olympic Games. Within the tightly controlled security cordons that encircle mega-event sites, common architectural and environmental features include landscaped security and crime reduction features, ‘Secure by Design’ standards of construction, infrastructure strengthening (for example, bridges and other structures), embedded electronic devices that scan for explosives, reduced or sealed potential concealment points (areas where explosives might be hidden, for example, bird boxes, litter bins or drains), blast resistant materials (such as shatter-proof glass, thus mitigating the source of most injuries during terrorist attacks) and hostile vehicle mitigation (measures to reduce the possibilities for vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices to reach their target) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1012690211433451">Coaffee, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Whilst such crime prevention principles are far from new (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1012690211433451">Newman, 1972</xref>), recent trends in the hosting of sporting mega-events have meant that such securitized urban reconfigurations extend beyond the time and place of the event. Regarding the former, planners, architects, developers and designers, alongside security specialists, increasingly design-in counter-terrorism features for sporting mega-event facilities as a function of not just the supposed threats faced by specific venues but also to embed safety and security features within ‘legacy’ community facilities. At the same time, as bidding for the 2012 and 2016 Olympics has demonstrated, sporting mega-events are increasingly connected with the broader regeneration of host neighbourhoods or even regions. Therefore the renewal, and often gentrification, of hitherto disadvantaged areas is facilitated as the demographic groups that are subsequently attracted to them place new demands for elevated levels of security and insulation from the extant incumbent communities (inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1012690211433451">Bauman, 2000</xref>). Of course, local topographies also influence this process. The availability of space in some Olympic cities, where developments cover huge areas (such as the 12 square kilometres of Beijing’s Olympic Green) will involve different securitization processes to more condensed configurations, such as the ‘compact’ London 2012 Olympic Park. In sum, architectures of ‘defensible space’ often cleave host neighbourhoods into geographies of access and entitlement. Movement across these borders is, of course, highly regulated, often through the electronic eye of surveillance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1012690211433451">
<title>Prescribed behaviour</title>
<p>Whilst not overtly geared towards counter-terrorism, another central feature of sporting mega-event security strategies is the extensive use of ‘zero-tolerance’ style policing approaches and exclusion orders, in settings as diverse as Sydney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1012690211433451">Lenskyj, 2004</xref>) and Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1012690211433451">Peng and Yu, 2008</xref>) (albeit with variations of scale). Such regulation is both physical and legal. Here, sophisticated technological and architectural security measures, such as those outlined above, are combined with more traditional ‘low-tech’ policing approaches. These strategies perform many functions and seek to regulate a broad suite of behaviours deemed undesirable such as perceived low-level disorder. Whilst ostensibly in place to address disorder and ensure the safety of spectators, the application of these policing strategies have been criticized for restricting the democratic right of protest and for being highly punitive measures aimed at protecting the market share of event sponsors. Regarding the former, a condition of hosting the Olympic Games is that prospective candidates adhere to the IOC’s Olympic Charter. Rule 51, s.3 which clearly states that hosts should allow no protests in or near Olympic venues, thus enabling rules established by unelected officials to override (often hard-won) domestic rights. In many cases these restrictions are extended beyond the political realm to protect the privileged advertising monopoly of event sponsors. Recent examples can be seen from the operation of South Africa’s ‘World Cup Courts’ in operation during the 2010 FIFA World Cup following the arrest and bailing of female Holland supporters for wearing clothing bearing the (diminutive) label of a rival beer company. Similar restrictions were at the time of writing undergoing approval in the New Zealand Parliament ahead of the 2011 IRB Rugby World Cup (the Rugby World Cup 2011 (Empowering) Bill) and are in place in the UK in relation to the 2012 Olympics (the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006). Regarding the latter, according to a government spokesperson (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1012690211433451">Dodd, 2009</xref>), these provisions were instigated to curb unauthorized advertising, sales of counterfeit goods and, without discernible irony, ‘over-commercialization’ near the Olympic venues. This has since led to numerous threats of legal action against local cafes, school sports days and universities for approximating the label of ‘London 2012’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211433451">Fussey et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusions: Interpreting counter-terrorism and the mega-event</title>
<p>The similarities in the trajectories, form and application of sporting mega-event security strategies stand in marked contrast to the diversity of terrorist threats they seek to ameliorate. Whilst a strong argument could be made that these shared security features represent an uncritical reapplication of accepted security frameworks across different domains, this article argues that, instead, it is possible to identify a number of complex processes that underpin and shape this dynamic. This in turn invests these standardized approaches to security with localized specificities.</p>
<p>One factor at play here is that of aspiration. The increasing unknowability of threats coupled with fear of mass-casualty postmodern terrorism have inspired what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1012690211433451">Beck (1999</xref>: 153) has called a ‘protectionist reflex’. This in turn has become articulated via total ‘lockdown’ responses that have become commonplace in sporting mega-event security operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1012690211433451">Coaffee and Murakami Wood, 2006</xref>). As such, aspirations for (if not the realization of) totalized security in any domain regularly feature the aforementioned components of sporting mega-event security strategies.</p>
<p>Other factors also drive this strategic standardization. Particularly important here is the governance asserted by international sporting federations such as the IOC, FIFA and UEFA who act as de facto ‘transfer agents’ in the ‘transnationalization of policy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1012690211433451">Stone, 2004</xref>). In 1983, for example, the IOC developed a dedicated ‘Security Delegate’ role, a measure replicated in the other aforementioned bodies. The IOC version covers four main functions: conveying the IOC’s expectations and guidelines to the host country, adopting an advisory role on security issues, assuming a diplomatic role (for example, during North Korea’s opposition to the 1988 Seoul Games) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1012690211433451">Sanan, 1996</xref>) and operating as a bridge between local security agencies and organizing committees and the IOC. In practice, this role invests the IOC with considerable oversight over domestic security arrangements and partly explains their spatial and temporal consistencies. Security plans are therefore formulated in close consultation with the sporting federation’s Security Delegate. Formal knowledge transfers between security practitioners working at prior Olympiads reinforce this process. For host cities, policing the Games is seen as an unprecedented exercise in exceptionality where existing orthodoxies prevail and recourse made to previous precedents. Here, <italic>international</italic> federations comprise the locus of ‘institutional memory’, and are uniquely positioned to broker appropriate knowledge to be applied <italic>locally</italic>.</p>
<p>At the same time, the same private sector security providers are routinely contracted across different events, territories and times. This particularly applies to large US corporations including IBM, General Electric and Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). Indeed, when efforts to favour local companies have been made, as attempted at the 2006 Turin Games, the complexities of procurement and tendering processes left insufficient time to develop and implement an effective security infrastructure, leaving planners to revert to experienced US providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1012690211433451">Ryan, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this process of standardization, various localized security vernaculars also shape the deployment of mega-event security. This connects with a number of wider debates surrounding the globalization of security, particularly critiques of the simplistic transfer of security policies across jurisdictions (inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1012690211433451">Zedner, 2009</xref>). Similarly, commentators have stressed the importance of localized occupational cultures in delivering security (see inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1012690211433451">Fussey, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1012690211433451">Reiner, 2000</xref>). Such local features include the availability of policing resources, ability to recruit the desired amount of private security guards, surveillance capabilities and regional influence over the prioritization of risks and threats to the Games. By contrast, other authors have pointed to the spread of a globalized ‘culture of control’ (inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1012690211433451">Garland, 2001</xref>). In the case of sporting mega-event security it is difficult to accept either extreme. Instead, specific security leitmotifs <italic>are</italic> replicated on a global scale <italic>yet</italic> are tempered to some degree by localized circumstances. Nonetheless, this overarching homogeneity of security practices across time and place necessarily and unequivocally impacts unevenly on the diverse host settings to which they are applied.</p>
<p>One of the key factors mediating this intersection of global and local is the extent of the hosts’ extant security assets. For example, when compared to other host cities, London’s counter-terrorism infrastructure is at an advanced stage, thus meaning mega-event related investments for the 2012 Summer Olympics have become ‘laminated’ onto existing capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1012690211433451">Coaffee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1012690211433451">Fussey et al., 2011</xref>). This has included the wholesale adoption of ‘Secure by Design’ approaches, involving the embedding, at the concept stage, design features such as access control and integrated CCTV, ‘stand-off areas’ for hostile vehicle mitigation, as well as the use of more resilient building materials. These are principles that have been embedded within for a number of recent London developments including Heathrow Terminal Five, the Millennium Dome, Wembley Stadium and Lords Cricket Ground. Moreover, approaches to 2012 Olympic security that approximate those adopted at non-sporting events may be observed, such as Britain’s hosting of the G8 (2005) and G20 (2009) conferences. Here, securitized spatial ‘rings’ were established as a means of asserting territorial control. Similarly, in preparation for 2012, a large expansive area of East London has been undergoing securitization for a number of years. The site for the main Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, was ‘sealed’ in July 2007 and nearby public footpaths and waterways closed for public access. The encircling 11-mile blue fence – ‘cordon blue’ – was put in place for ‘health and safety’ reasons and has been likened by some to the Belfast peace walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1012690211433451">Beckett, 2007</xref>). Moreover, fears of the ‘displacement’ of possible terrorist attack to other key sites in London has seen the extension of physical security beyond the Olympic Park sites. In addition to these securitized ‘buffer zones’, London authorities will be using advanced surveillance to track suspects across the city including the capital’s ever expanding system of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1012690211433451">Fussey, 2007a</xref>). Similar processes of merging of the global and local are in play in Russia ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. As the FIFA evaluation report of bidding countries noted, Russia drew praise for ‘continuously incorporating “lessons learnt” from international sports tournaments into the final security plan’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1012690211433451">FIFA, 2010</xref>: 23). At the same time the bid was commended for incorporating and building upon the federation’s existing ‘Safe City’ initiative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1012690211433451">12</xref></sup> The same ‘Safe Cities’ programme forms the bedrock of Sochi’s 2014 Winter Olympic preparations where an additional 3000 CCTV cameras are to be installed.</p>
<p>By contrast, the exorbitant costs of Athens’ Olympic security are connected to limited extant facilities that could approximate mega-event security strategies. A similar dynamic is likely to apply to Qatar, hosts of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Here, ambitions to attain a global profile via the hosting of prominent sporting events have yet to be matched by the development of associated security facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1012690211433451">13</xref></sup> Such ‘clean slate’ conditions are thus highly conducive to more wholesale importation of globalized security motifs.</p>
<p>In sum, these repeated features of sporting mega-event security strategies coalesce into an overall model that is oriented around the a number of core themes related to enhanced urban militarism, private security, integrated surveillance, rebordering the city through design intervention and control of behaviour. Whilst variations on these ‘lamination’ or ‘clean slate’ themes exist, sporting mega-event counter-terrorism strategies bear remarkable similarities across time and place. By contrast, terrorist threats at sporting events are almost always grounded in relation to their host setting. Terrorist threats to sporting mega-events, then, are almost always locally produced, yet the strategies designed to counter them are increasingly imported from global patterns of security governance.</p>

<p>This is evinced both generally, as the above examples have demonstrated, and particularly, in respect to what have been the most severe post-1972 threats to the Olympics: those affecting Sarajevo, Seoul and Barcelona.
