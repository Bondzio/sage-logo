<p>The “Point of Possible” is a powerful theme you will hear a lot about this year. Possible . . . what is actually possible?</p>
<p>Had you asked me 20 years ago—or even 5 years ago—if it was possible that one day I would be elected by my colleagues to serve as president of the American Association of Diabetes Educators, I would have fervently replied, “That is in no way fathomable, or possible!” And yet, I now find myself humbled, honored, and extremely proud to serve and represent this group of passionate diabetes educators. I have come to fully realize the point of possible.</p>
<p>My many life experiences, each step on my career path, every volunteer engagement, coupled with the support of family, friends, and colleagues, have shaped and prepared me for this moment in time.</p>
<sec id="section1-2325160312471648">
<title>This Is My Story</title>
<p>As an extremely shy child and teenager, engaging in conversations, presenting in front of the class, or generally being the center of attention brought me great angst. None of these came natural to me. And while I was engaged in a number of extracurricular activities, you wouldn’t find me taking the lead in any of them. <italic>Surely it wouldn’t be possible for me to serve in a national leadership position one day</italic>. Over time, with much effort and practice, I learned to push through the uncomfortable situations to simply talk, engage, connect, and just do it! Now I am energized by situations I would have once avoided.</p>
<p>As a dietetics student in college, the coursework on diabetes was definitely not my favorite. Diabetes management seemed so complicated. <italic>Surely it’s not possible that my career would focus on diabetes</italic>. And yet, diabetes has been the primary focus of every job on my career path—from rehabilitation to adult endocrinology, wellness, research, primary care, as well as inpatient and outpatient settings. The challenging aspect of managing diabetes is now the very reason diabetes education is my passion. I am invigorated by each situation and the challenge it brings. Every encounter is an opportunity to make a difference!</p>
<p>In reflection, while my life experiences and career path were significant contributors to where I am today, I largely credit my professional volunteer experiences with providing opportunities that honed my skill set to serve as AADE’s president.</p>

<title>My AADE Volunteer Path</title>
<p>My active involvement with AADE began shortly after I joined the organization nearly 20 years ago. I was a contributor to the newsletter of my then local chapter. From there I took on several different roles at the local level. Over time, I agreed to serve as an expert reviewer for several AADE publications and programs, join the faculty for the Core Concepts® Course, coauthor the <italic>Diabetes Education Review Guide</italic>, serve on a workgroup, and eventually run for the Board of Directors. I liked being in the middle of all the action. After completing that 3-year term, I was elected vice president, and you know the rest of the story. I could never have dreamed that my volunteer experiences would help provide the knowledge, skills, and experience for today.</p>

<title>The Point of Possible for AADE</title>
<p>An incredible year before us as AADE celebrates a milestone birthday! AADE is turning 40! Could the first AADE president, Allene Van Son, and our original 18 members have imagined that one day AADE would be more than 13,000 members strong with sustained growth of 5% last year, and 8-9% the year prior! We are where we are because of our rich history of strong leadership. Currently guiding this organization are your Board of Directors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diabeteseducator.org/aware/board">www.diabeteseducator.org/aware/board</ext-link>) and CEO, Chuck MacFarlane. Supporting all of the activities of this organization are our 40+ member staff at the headquarters in Chicago. You will find that they are a creative, brilliant, passionate, energetic, and committed team.</p>
