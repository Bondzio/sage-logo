<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I wish to comment on the review of my book, <italic>Boys and Their Schooling; The Experience of Becoming Someone Else</italic> (2011) by Shamus Rahman Khan in <italic>Contemporary Sociology</italic> 41:3, of May 2012. The reviewer more than once seems to have had in mind a book other than the one in front of him as he seems to wish or imagine that the book he is dealing with ought to be other than it is.</p>
<p>I will briefly draw your attention to three objections I have to his review. In order of appearance in his text, the claim is made that the book is “challenging to read.” This claim is made on the basis that “the reader must wade through almost half the text before ever seriously meeting a boy.” In response, it ought to be clear that I was establishing the basis for a critique of the essentialist construction of the disaffected schoolboy used to such powerful effect by those promoting what at the time was a panic about boys’ achievement at school. Furthermore, any reviewer of work written in this context would be aware of the way Paul Willis structured his canonic school ethnography, <italic>Learning to Labour</italic>…, which presents its theoretical exegesis throughout the second half of the book and which was said to be innovative at the time. Mine is simply placed in the first half—and this makes it difficult to read?</p>
<p>Secondly, your reviewer, in developing his point about the alleged difficulty of reading the text, seems unaware that in order for me to distance my work from what I refer to as the modernist canon in school ethnographies I set out to expose their unreflective use of the notion of experience, if in fact those authors ever mentioned it at all. Here your reviewer refers to “Foucault, Butler, and many others I have since forgotten.” One hopes that reviewers of school ethnographies in future will show a little more familiarity with the major work in this area written from British and Australian contexts. So much seems to have been lost on this reviewer.</p>
<p>Thirdly, your reviewer wishes we knew more about the boys in the study: what they looked like, what their families were like, what they do with their free time, and so on. There are glimpses of these and other aspects of their lives beyond school in the text, but again, this is a book about the constitution of experience in school, not anywhere else, if that is indeed possible. The fact that the boys in the study may seem to be known incompletely makes a point for me. As your reviewer says, “we hardly know who these boys are, as people,” and nor do schools! Furthermore, in not describing appearances I was (as anyone familiar with human ethics requirements would know) committing myself to maintaining as much as possible the anonymity of my research participants.</p>
<p>Finally, your reviewer, while acknowledging the centrality of the notion of experience in this work, continues to use the term unreflectively. Again, my intention was to try to capture something of the intensity of the moment in which experience is created, a rather different register in which to use this term.</p>
<p>It is always gratifying to have one’s work reviewed, whether positively or not (and your reviewer does praise faintly), but perhaps you and he may wish to compare notes with the following:</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Mr. Whelen suggests that I would be happier with a different book than the one he wrote; he would no doubt be happier with a different review, and gives readers two to pick from. I, too, would encourage readers to look at those reviews if the topic of Boys and Schooling is of interest. Opinions vary. Mr. Whelen is unfortunate, perhaps, in having me as a reviewer as I express my actual position on the books I review. And I stand firmly by that position, which is that, “if one is to set up an argument about the centrality of boys’ experiences, we should see boys experiencing things” [which we rarely do in this book]. Mr. Whelen acknowledges this critique by arguing, “The fact that the boys in the study may seem to be known incompletely makes a point for me. As your reviewer says, ‘we hardly know who these boys are, as people,’ and nor do schools!” This is very odd. Mr. Whelen has written a book critiquing scholars and schools for not knowing who boys are. And he then when confronted with a review of this book that points out that his ethnographic work does much the same (not bringing us into the lives and experiences of boys), defends his stance on the basis of the very critique his book is making. Schools don’t know about boys, nor see their experiences. I would have thought the point of scholarship would be to show us what the everyday doesn’t know or see. Sadly, I gather, I am wrong.</p>
