<p>Although observers from Aristotle onward have acknowledged the central importance of emotion in social life, it has been only recently that emotion has become a topic of empirical research in disciplines other than psychology. In <italic>Passion and Paranoia</italic>, Charlotte Bloch addresses questions about how emotions are embedded in the organization and culture of academia. In so doing, she adds to our understandings of how individual experiences and consequences of emotion are culturally and socially shaped.</p>
<p>After a short introduction, Chapter 2 outlines the theoretical perspective underlying the research. Drawing from Bourdieu, Dr. Bloch argues that the structure of academia has two dimensions: It is competitive and it is hierarchical. She uses the works of Collins and Kemper to argue that the interplay between power and status relationships within such hierarchical, competitive structures will encourage particular kinds of emotions. The works of Scheff on relationships between hierarchical structures and emotions, Clark’s work on the micropolitics of emotion, Flams’ ideas about emotions that represent organizations and Hochschild’s theorizing on feeling rules and expression rules complete the theoretical scaffolding. Taken together, these various theories form a nice package for thinking about how the structure of academia will encourage particular types of emotions as well as about how organizations will have guidelines for how emotions should be displayed.</p>
<p>From here the book moves into seven chapters offering empirical evidence gained from interviews with 54 people recruited from institutions of higher education throughout Denmark. Those interviewed are equally split between women and men, between faculties in health sciences, social sciences and humanities, between PhD students, Assistant Professors and Associate/Full Professors. The first two of these chapters explore the emotional lives and challenges of those at the bottom of the academic hierarchy, PhD fellows and Assistant Professors. The remaining chapters attend to the topics of emotions associated with the peer review process, the political nature of laughter, interactional dynamics in the lunchroom, social bonds among colleagues and gender.</p>
<p>Data in each of these chapters offer specific examples of what is a clear, forcefully argued, and nicely empirically demonstrated story: The competitive and hierarchical structure of academia leads to countless sources of distinctly negative emotional experiences. For students, the hesitations and fears created by the difficulty of learning how to do research are magnified by power relationships. Ph.D. supervisors, for example, routinely engage in displays of power that provoke fear and anxiety, students’ projects can become fodder in fights between warring factions of people far more powerful than students. Students and Assistant Professors alike fear being noticed in the ‘wrong way’, they fear offending a powerful person, they fear their work will be stolen by others. Actors at all levels of the academic hierarchy fear that their work will be publicly criticized, that they will be judged incompetent, that the successes of others will diminish their own standing in the hierarchy. Fear is omnipresent.</p>
<p>Most certainly, the competitive, hierarchical structure of academia greatly shapes relationships and interactions among colleagues. We learn that competition leads to jealousy, envy and distrust; that cooperation is read as weakness, that there is widespread belief that the peer review process is contaminated by reviewers’ motives to bring people down in order to gain an upper hand. Personal relationships among colleagues are characterized by indifference, instances that might seem to indicate ‘friendliness’ are instrumental acts understood as a necessary political strategy for self-protection. There is no escaping the consequences of hierarchy and competition. Even in the lunchroom, where it might appear that people are simply socializing, hierarchies are being negotiated and demonstrated in terms of different interactional rights, such as the right to determine conversational topics, to arrive late, to ignore others.</p>
<p>Chapter after chapter details how the structure and organization of academia create an emotional nightmare for actors working with it, a dreadful experience that can neither be acknowledged nor displayed. Everyone is fully and explicitly engaged in emotion work. Actors attempt to manage how they ‘actually’ feel, they work to manage how they appear to others, they work to manage others. Nothing is what it might seem. Values promoting ‘emotional neutrality’ lead to concealing feelings of anger, fear or shame created by exploitative relationships; the ‘politics of friendliness’ encourages hiding anger and irritation behind a ‘mask of friendliness’; doubt and uncertainty cannot be revealed because the competitive environment requires always appearing competent.</p>
<p>This book is a very nice example of empirical research on the sociology of emotion. It is well written, the arguments are logical and they are supported by more than adequate interview segments. My only complaint is that <italic>Passion and Paranoia</italic> is far more about paranoia than about passion. In the conclusion, Charlotte Bloch admits that she focused ‘upon the structural and cultural basis of the darker side of academic life’ (p. 136). And this is obvious. In a typical chapter we read a sentence or two about positive emotional experiences associated with teaching or research, but the sources, shapes and consequences of such emotions are not examined. Rather, we proceed quickly to the negative and dwell upon that. So, for example, many of the people she interviewed talked about the pride they experienced in their research and the joy that could accompany teaching successes. Such statements become mere stepping stones to extended discussion about how it is forbidden in academia to directly display pride, how the academic environment creates expectations of emotional neutrality, how telling others of accomplishments is taken as unacceptable boasting.</p>
<p>In brief, this book offers a thick description of the <italic>paranoia</italic>, the fear and distrust encouraged by hierarchical and competitive organizations. Further research might shed more light on the <italic>passion</italic> for the work, the satisfying relationships that can be – and that are – created by individuals despite structural characteristics.</p>
