<p>Discourses of reality TV, it seems, are everywhere: on television screens across the globe, on the lips of cultural commentators, and in the pages of scholarly publications—all attempting to come to terms with the cultural effect (and affect) of the accelerated development of what has become one of the most influential, controversial, and provoking media genres in contemporary culture. We have become habituated to the remaking of reality franchises for diverse national cultures, yet it is crucial to attend to the ways in which this now preeminent mode of television content is particularized within both its cultures of origin and the national locations in which it circulates. How is the context of the national articulated in the global language of reality formats? How are ideologies of gender, sexuality, race, and class identity—conventionally the representational ground of the genre—transformed, subverted, or reified by such articulations?</p>
<p>Derived from the conference we hosted on “Gender Politics and Reality TV” at University College Dublin in 2011, the essays gathered here draw from existing critical literature on reality TV’s ubiquity and centrality as a cultural form to explore its distinctive ability to narrate the national. The field of reality television studies has seen tremendous growth in the past decade, especially with regard to text-based studies of identity in US and UK reality programs. This work has consistently privileged analyses that coalesce around issues of authenticity, affect, neoliberalism, reception, transformation, consumerism, and celebrity. While this scholarship has done much to further our understanding of the ways that reality TV negotiates culture and identity, little has been written on the form’s intersecting politics of gender and nation. Indeed, one might go so far as to say that in the literature on English language reality TV, national identity tends to go unnoticed. Conversely, nation (and sometimes region) are automatically conceptually in play in analyses of such material from “remote” locales such as postsocialist Eastern Europe or Asia where “difference” from an unspecified but structuring monocultural norm is taken as read. In the opening chapter of <italic>The Politics of Reality Television: Global Perspectives</italic>, Katherine Sender writes that in the future, she “hope[s] to see comparative studies of how reality programs must contend with themes of gender and sexuality as they play out through struggles over nationalism and modernity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1527476412458163">2011</xref>, 7). This special journal issue takes up Sender’s call.</p>
<p>The essays assembled here treat up-to-the-minute forms of reality programming in US, UK, Canadian, and Irish contexts, foregrounding gendered issues of national identity in a television format marked by both high transnational circulation and significant national customization. Globalization, however, brings with it a peculiar set of anxieties within national contexts: a fear of cultural appropriation and subjugation, a loss of an “authentically” national identity within a matrix of postmodern representation that favors homogeneity and sameness over heterogeneity and difference. Reality formats, thus, are seen here as situated at the discursive intersection of globalization, national identity, and cultural representation; they function as a “contact zone” between the local and the global, in which the borders of identity, gender, and nation are picked apart and rearticulated.</p>
<p>In their focus on the construction and representation of national identity in a global context, the essays are also investigations into a recessionary era that has tended to fortify national affiliations and push questions of citizenship into the foreground while also making national identity more beset and uncertain. In Europe, the single currency is in serious jeopardy, putting the political and financial logics of the European Union and even the broader notion of the value of European collectivization in doubt. The implications of the effective loss of national sovereignty in small nations such as Ireland are still to be fully weighed. In Anne Sexton’s study here of the reality celebrity of “Celtic Tiger Cub” Katy French, she suggests that French acted as a prism for a growing national unease about the hypercapitalism of the Irish boom and its impacts on national subjectivity.</p>
<p>If the recession has made national identities more fraught, it has sometimes seemed that reality TV formats are growing more codified. Canada, often idealized as a rare national “success story” in the recession and as the site of social health par excellence, still trades in the disciplining of citizen-subjects along conservative lines as Tiara Sukhan shows in her essay here, examining how biopedagogies of transformation television operate in league with the neoliberalization of national health. While Canadian size-transformation programs such as <italic>The Last Ten Pounds Bootcamp</italic> and <italic>Bulging Brides</italic> construct healthy female citizens as those who embrace hegemonic beauty norms, Sukhan reveals how the contradictory nature of these shows nevertheless opens up spaces for some women to critique them. Contradictory national identity discourses also circulate on real estate TV shows such as <italic>House Hunters</italic>. As Mimi White demonstrates in her analysis, American dreams of home ownership dovetail with American myths of assimilation. For White, <italic>House Hunters</italic> circulates powerful narratives about gendered space, economic stability, and American geographic mobility, despite the uncertainty wrought by the 2008 housing market collapse and the ongoing economic recession.</p>
<p>In the US and the UK, the recession has also brought into vivid relief the diminished power of national mythologies and credos of exceptionalism, with a growing number of citizens reporting a belief that their country’s best days are in the past rather than the future. Such postimperial malaise may well be intensified by national and state budgeting, which in the name of austerity ruthlessly streamlines education, infrastructural upkeep, and social services while expanding security initiatives. Growing public awareness of the power of corporate lobbyists over government and consternation about the high profile of right-wing politicians who explicitly attack civic values feed these conundrums still further. The result, we argue, is if not a new nervousness about, then certainly a heightened consciousness of national identity against the backdrop of governmentality, corporatism, neoliberalism, and globalization. Thus, one of the overarching concerns unifying this group of essays is, “How do nationally marked modes of reality television play to audiences in such conditions?”</p>
<p>The essays speak to and place themselves alongside recent work by reality television scholars who have turned their attention to issues of national identity in both Western and non-Western reality shows. In 2009, a special issue of the <italic>Canadian Journal of Communication</italic> edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412458163">Jean Bruce (2009)</xref> featured scholarship on reality TV and national identity, including essays on <italic>Canadian Idol</italic> as well as the pan-Balkan reality TV show <italic>That’s Me</italic>. In addition to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412458163">Brenda Weber’s (2009)</xref> work on American identity and cultural citizenship in makeover TV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412458163">Cassandra Jones (2011)</xref> has explored connections between body transformation and American patriotism in <italic>The Biggest Loser</italic>. Despite the dominant circulation of US and UK reality programs in the global marketplace, some scholarship, such as Minna Aslama and Mervi Pantii’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412458163">2007</xref>) work on the Finnish adventure show <italic>Extreme Escapades</italic>, has demonstrated how national programs continue to be significant cultural sites for the exploration of national concerns. Other scholarship, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412458163">Sean Jacobs’s (2007)</xref> research on <italic>Big Brother Africa</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412458163">Dana Heller’s (2011)</xref> work on the global dance program <italic>So You Think You Can Dance</italic>, has highlighted how national, political, and economic ideologies are negotiated in localized versions of global media franchises. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412458163">Marwan M. Kraidy and Katherine Sender’s (2011)</xref> edited collection, <italic>The Politics of Reality Television: Global Perspectives</italic>, also valuably considers the migration of reality TV formats across a range of national media landscapes. In their analysis of online activity surrounding <italic>That’s Me</italic>, for instance, Zala Volcic and Mark Andrejevic demonstrate how the show’s creators used and commodified nationalist sentiments “banished from the political sphere proper” to mobilize and reconnect audiences from the former Yugoslav republics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1527476412458163">2011</xref>, 125). Other contributions on national identity include Aswin Punathambekar’s exploration of <italic>Indian Idol-3</italic>’s mobile publics and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412458163">Fabienne Darling-Wolf’s (2011)</xref> examination of the French adaptation of <italic>Star Academy</italic>.</p>
<p>However, more attention needs to be paid, as Sender notes, to the ways in which reality television operates as a site of negotiation between global and local representative strategies in the context of discourses of gender, race, sexuality, and class. Undoubtedly, the intersections of gender and reality television have always been a central concern in reality television scholarship. In 2004, for instance, <italic>Feminist Media Studies</italic> featured two special essay collections on gender and reality TV, edited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412458163">Sujata Moorti and Karen Ross (2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412458163">2004b)</xref>. Acknowledging the tension between the viewing pleasures and representational problems extended by the genre, Moorti and Ross fittingly titled the introduction to their first installment, “Reality Television: Fairy Tale or Feminist Nightmare?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412458163">2004b</xref>, 203). Tensions surrounding the expression and thwarting of gendered power on reality television have continued in the work of numerous scholars, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412458163">Anita Biressi and Heather Nunn (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412458163">Steven Cohan (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412458163">Dana Heller (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412458163">Su Holmes and Deborah Jermyn (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412458163">Misha Kavka (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412458163">Tania Lewis (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412458163">Angela McRobbie (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412458163">Susan Murray and Laurie Ouellette (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412458163">2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412458163">Martin Roberts (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412458163">Katherine Sender (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1527476412458163">Kimberly Springer (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1527476412458163">Brenda Weber (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1527476412458163">Helen Wood and Beverley Skeggs (2011)</xref>—to name only a few.

As noted above however, this scholarship does not interrogate the ways in which national identity and culture operate to transform or modify these frameworks.</p>
<p>Here is where this special issue specifically intervenes, bringing together questions of nation, gender, power, and representation. The concern with the preservation of national exceptionalism in a global and recessionary context is, we argue, intimately linked with another anxiety in the conceptualizing of the nation, one that can be read as historically and discursively gendered—the desire to be associated with and to promote high cultural forms, and the focus on the aesthetic object as a signifier of the nation’s being, its soul, its historical authenticity, <italic>and</italic> its “proper” future. Tim Edensor, making reference to Michael Billig’s concept of “banal nationalism,” notes that popular culture is excluded from this construction of national identity by virtue of its situation in the present, in the everyday (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412458163">2002</xref>, 11). The cultural practices of the ordinary citizen are positioned on the outside of the ideologically legitimated understanding of the nation: the nation must be timeless, archaic, and above all fixed and stable, and not subject to the vicissitudes of the popular and the new. This, of course, is the very ground of reality television: the ordinary, the banal, the everyday—the liminal and malleable space of the present. With the popular being perceived as the harbinger of the death of cultural specificity through its association with the colonizing force of global (conventionally, American) homogenization, it is little wonder then that the most persistent criticism of reality television is its perceived (lack of) realness—its terrain (global, popular, corporate) is, in itself, inauthentic and incompatible with the proper space of the national.</p>
<p>Given the connections between reality television and illegitimacy in a national context on one hand, and the examination of the genre as a space in which questions of gender, race, and class are frequently under the microscope, often problematically, on the other hand, it is clear that reality television programming represents one of the most significant and dynamic sites in which national and gendered ideologies are renegotiated. Within this context, the nervousness about the degradation of national identity in a globalized media culture, of which reality television formats operate as primary signifiers, is insistently mapped onto the bodies of those who participate in its representations. From <italic>Jersey Shore</italic> to <italic>Geordie Shore</italic>, from <italic>Flavor of Love</italic> to <italic>There’s Something about Miriam</italic>, overwhelmingly, these inauthentic bodies are demarcated along race, class, and, most significantly, gender lines. The urban working class, racial and ethnic minorities, and women have historically been placed in the position of “other” to the national subject, but in today’s globalized mediascape, anything perceived to be associated with “low” or mass culture is held up as a symptom of moral malaise or the destruction of “traditional” national values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412458163">1</xref></sup> In her essay here, for example, Paula Gilligan links the gendering of surveillance and the disciplining of working class subjects in UK “housing estate” programs to a national concentrationary imaginary that, for her, must be factored for in any understanding of the (still often mystified and oversimplified) summer 2011 UK riots.</p>
<p>Reality TV is a conduit for the abject spaces of contemporary transnational society, the spaces from which the national is corrupted; in this way, it is the perfect example of what John Hartley has called a “‘dirty’ category” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1527476412458163">West 2011</xref>, 65). Within this interstitial space of the global and the local, discourses of national authority and integrity are rearticulated and recodified, disrupted and transgressed, via the liminal agents of national Otherness. The essays here consider the sites of these dirty spaces—the body, celebrity, the working class, the domestic, the criminal, and, of course, the global—and the way that the abjection with which they are associated is insistently mapped onto discourses of gender, nation, and power.</p>

<p>Articles and debates about the theft of status goods during the 2011 London riots, for example, persistently placed reality TV as one of a range of contemporary seductions along with smartphones, iPads, flatscreen televisions, and other accoutrements of a vacuous consumer culture that alienates citizens (“The Big Brother and X Factor Generation”) from traditional understandings of proper “Britishness” and signals a “deeper moral malaise, where fundamental values and social norms have seemingly collapsed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412458163">Henwood 2011</xref>). Gilligan treats these connections at length in her essay here.</p>
