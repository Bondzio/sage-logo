<p>It is imperative for educators to have knowledge of gifted programming standards and an understanding of how to implement them to create meaningful educational experiences for gifted learners. Edited by well-known expert in the field, Susan K. Johnsen, PhD, this valuable resource includes a broad range of perspectives and expertise in chapters written by numerous respected authors and researchers in gifted education. In <italic>NAGC Pre-K-Grade 12 Gifted Education Programming Standards: A Guide to Planning and Implementing High-Quality Services</italic> (ISBN 978-1-59363-845-0), the six outcome-based standards that are essential to effective teaching and learning are clearly described and accompanied by suggestions to guide educators in the implementation of each one. Tables, graphics, and outlines are featured throughout the text, making it easy to read and understand. Sample assessments of student products and performances that aid districts in developing program and service evaluation benchmarks are included.

<p>What is it like to be gifted and African American? What are the challenges that young, gifted, Black students face in our schools today? How can parents of this special population of youngsters advocate effectively for their children? In <italic>Bright, Talented, &amp; Black: A Guide for Families of African American Gifted Learners</italic> (ISBN 978-1-935067-02-3), author Joy Lawson Davis addresses these and many more questions as she guides parents in identifying and selecting the most productive educational settings for their children. The book includes anecdotal stories that keep it interesting and real along with tables that help with the comprehension of the text. Shining a light on the underrepresentation of Black children in gifted programs, this resource is written for parents and others who desire to understand how gifted education and other programs can benefit bright, talented, Black children. Multiple resources that can be tapped to support children at home are included.

<p>Using a catchy flight theme, Janet Aaker Smith blends learning theory and engaging instructional strategies to offer ideas for educational experiences that can be used with any content area in the classroom. The techniques shared engage students in problem solving and application of acquired knowledge, stimulate questioning and reflecting on subject matter in ways that keep kids excited about learning, and offer opportunities for communication, interaction, and collaboration. The author shares many graphic organizers, kinesthetic activities, and tactile projects that may be used to extend lessons for gifted learners. <italic>Flying in Style: Differentiated STEM Activities—Science, Technology, Engineering, Math</italic> (ISBN 978-1-937113-02-5) encourages active learning for all students and focuses on Bloom’s Taxonomy, different learning preferences, and flexible grouping in planning instruction. Although written for educators, this resource could easily be used by parents who are interested in engaging children in active learning at home.

<title>Thinking of Books As Presents, Specific for Each Individual</title>

<p>The first line of the introduction to <italic>A Book Is a Present: Selecting Text for Intentional Teaching</italic> (ISBN 1-57274-672-6) explains, “This is not a book about the teaching of reading, but rather a book for teachers of reading.” Emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct texts for students in K-12 grades, author Margaret E. Mooney encourages teachers to make informed decisions about matching the book to the child. This text begins with a chapter on the factors that contribute to the difficulty level of a book and offers step-by-step questions for guiding teachers and parents in determining the appropriateness of specific books for individual children. Subsequent chapters address ways to distinguish among types of books, challenges readers may face, strategies for dealing with challenges, the importance of the “first glance” of a book, and the overarching theme of viewing a book as a present. This resource proposes that choosing the appropriate reading material for each student is crucial, especially in the diverse classrooms of today’s schools. For more information, contact Richard C.

<p>In collaboration with the National Association for Gifted Children, Kristie Speirs Neumeister, PhD, and Virginia H. Burney, PhD, examine gifted programming through a comprehensive lens. <italic>Gifted Program Evaluation: A Handbook for Administrators and Coordinators</italic> is a valuable resource for schools or districts that plan to implement a gifted program or currently have a gifted program that needs restructuring. Using a systematic approach, authors highlight effective methods for evaluating program design, identifying students whose needs will be met through the program, examining and implementing curriculum and instruction, planning professional development, and creating overall successful GT programs. The book includes sample surveys, interviews, checklists, and planning templates that can be used to collect and examine detailed information about the current program and educational offerings. Despite being geared toward professionals, parents could also benefit from this book, learning the “right” questions to ask about program options that are available to their gifted children in the school setting.
