<p>The past 15 years have seen a tremendous expansion in the corruption literature. This is a highly desirable development given how detrimental corruption can be to political and economic activity and how much it can hamper economic growth. In developing countries, it may even threaten regime survival. Although there are scholars who show that “greasing the wheels” can have efficiency improving outcomes, the general consensus is that corruption produces adverse effects: Rent seeking and corruption have significant social costs that divert valuable resources from productive activities; corruption distorts policy through restrictions on political and economic activity that create barriers to long-term growth; and corruption breaks down society’s trust in institutions, which can deter civic engagement and provide disincentives for productive activity.</p>
<p>What we are less sure about are the exact causes of corruption. Scholars have certainly looked in many places. Some have focused on societal factors (religion, ethno-linguistic fractionalization, identity of colonizer), economic factors (GDP per capita, trade openness, regulatory burden), and, increasingly, political factors. In the last category, democracy seems to have attracted most of the attention because of the expectation that increased competition among political actors serves as a system of checks and balances against abuse of power. Yet corruption occurs in democratic systems too. Even the EU, where liberalization and increased societal integration should eliminate incentives for misuse of public office, struggles with the problem of corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012445885">Warner, 2007</xref>). Other political factors such as federalism, executive regime type, and electoral rules have also presented empirically mixed findings.</p>
<p>That corruption is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes is the starting premise of Yadav’s work. She does not claim to be discovering the single central cause of corruption, but she does hope to illuminate an important source of corruption overlooked by the existing scholarship. Yadav rightly starts exploring this important problem with business interests since business funds represent a significant share of political expenditures that contribute to corruption in developing countries. Investigating the factors behind business groups’ decisions to bribe and lobby legislators helps identify important causes of corruption. The scarce literature that does look at the interaction of state and business interests has not identified systemic or institutional causes of corruption and has also produced mixed empirical evidence. On the other hand, those who do focus on business strategies for influencing political decision making rarely extend the analysis to address their impact on corruption. Yadav’s objective is to fill this important gap to explain why some developing country democracies experience higher levels of corruption. Her central research question is how “legislative institutions promote or restrain corruption through the rules of engagement they provide to political and business actors (p. 7).” Her goal is to offer a theoretical framework for the systematic analysis of the way that influence seeking by business actors leads to comparatively different levels of corruption.</p>
<p>Her explanation, in short, is that there is a “link between the incentives structures created by legislative institutions, the strategic lobbying decisions made by business groups, and corruption level[s]” (p. 17) in developing economies. The causal mechanism through which legislative institutions determine corruption levels has two related components.</p>
<p>First, legislative institutions determine the type of lobbying strategy adopted by business groups. Business groups choose to lobby political principals who command the influential legislative role. When parties influence the agenda setting in the legislature, introduce amendments to bills, and expel party members who vote against the dictates of the party whip, business interests choose to direct their lobbying efforts at parties. Alternatively, when individual legislators are in control of the timing, substance, and voting on bills, business-lobbying efforts are best directed at individual legislators.</p>
<p>Second, countries with party-focused lobbying will experience higher levels of corruption. On the demand side, parties require more money because of the scope of their operations and the size of their constituency. For the same reason, they derive much greater benefit from financial as opposed to nonfungible resources. On the supply side, parties will attract more corrupt money because such donations are easier to hide in party as opposed to individual accounts, and because of their ability to use legislation to capture bureaucratic and judicial institutions, parties are better able to guarantee outcomes to political donors. Hence, the use of illegal funds or corruption will be more prevalent in countries with party-focused legislative rules.</p>
<p>The second link in the causal chain adopts a very specific definition of corruption, namely, as the exchange of illegal funds. If there is a distinction between legal and illegal funds in this work, it is not clear. The overall causal argument is logically consistent only if we interpret corruption as the subset of lobbying activities that involve exchange of money. However, lobbying of parties and legislators can constitute corruption even if one does not exchange funds, such as when individual or business favors are exchanged to secure preferential political treatment. This can increase corruption even in individual-focused legislative systems. Moreover, some scholars have shown that businesses chose whether to “bend the rules” using separate and distinct strategies of bribery and lobbying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012445885">Harstad &amp; Svensson, 2011</xref>). This shows that any causal mechanism linking lobbying and corruption needs to specify more completely the varieties of lobbying mechanisms, regardless of which political principal is lobbied, that constitute corruption.</p>
<p>To test the causal mechanism, Yadav conducts a comparative case study analysis between India (more corrupt) and Brazil (less corrupt). The type of evidence utilized to make the comparison is impressive: original survey evidence on the perception of corruption by business groups, original open-ended interviews with relevant actors, and secondary surveys on lobbying and corruption, along with analytical narratives of legislative bills in the two countries. As hypothesized, in India, business groups choose to lobby parties because they are perceived to be in control of the agenda setting and amendment process while also controlling the voting behavior of legislators. In Brazil, business groups choose to lobby individual legislators because they are perceived to be the critical policy-making agents. In addition, cited evidence shows that there is a greater preference for money by parties in India and that lobbyists respond by contributing funds as opposed to other nonfinancial resources that are more popular in Brazil. But it is not clear what share constitutes illegal funds that in either case contribute to corruption. The evidence does show, however, that perceptions of political corruption are highly correlated with perceptions of bureaucratic corruption in party-focused systems, demonstrating that parties’ legislative strength over other institutions allows groups that do engage in corruption to expect greater returns on their investment and greater ability to hide those contributions.</p>
<p>The overall theoretical claim—that party-focused systems will have higher incidence of corruption—is tested using a quantitative analysis of cross-country corruption data from International Country Risk Guide, Transparency International, and the World Bank. Yadav makes another empirical contribution here by developing a data set of legislative rules for 64 developing economies that can be used to explore questions beyond corruption. Statistical models show a significant and positive impact of legislative institutions on corruption that is consistent across model specifications and types of corruption data. The evidence suggests that when legislative rules give parties control over agenda setting and amendments, corruption is higher by 11.2% and 9.0%, respectively. When legislative rules allow parties to control membership, corruption increases by another 10.5%.</p>
<p>The large-<italic>N</italic> analysis is probably the weakest component of this otherwise very carefully analyzed book. The use of corruption data based on expert assessment is surprising given that the comparative case study analysis demonstrated the value of survey and interview data that explore business groups’ own experience with corruption. Although they are not as prevalent in the existing literature, perhaps perception-based data sets such as the World Business Environment Survey would have been more appropriate. The choice of control variables is also limited. The analysis pays no attention to the enforcement side of the corruption problem or cross-country differences in the nature of media access and success in exposing corruption. The use of <italic>rule of law</italic> as a control variable in all of the presented model specifications is problematic. If judicial autonomy is at the center of this concept, it is highly likely that any measures of it are also picking up the underlying causes of corruption, causing endogeneity problems. This is especially true when the data for the control and dependent variable come from the same expert-created indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012445885">Treisman, 2007</xref>). Last, for a multicausal assessment of corruption, perhaps the study should have made more use of interactions between legislative institutions and critical political variables such as federalism and presidentialism. If we suspect that presidential systems limit corruption, it would be interesting to examine the incremental impact on corruption when such systems adopt legislative rules that center on the influence of individual legislators.</p>
<p>These limitations to the large-<italic>N</italic> analysis should not take away from the contributions of the book’s successfully implemented theoretical framework for comparatively analyzing the link among political institutions, lobbying behavior, and corruption. Using carefully selected and well-analyzed cases, the book demonstrates that legislative rules make for strong parties. At the same time, in the absence of checks and balances, strong parties can extract rents from business groups and contribute to corruption in developing countries. The book offers exemplary, carefully argued, and immaculately presented scholarship. It fills a really important hole in the literature on micro foundations of corruption by analyzing how often-overlooked legislative institutions shape the incentives of business interest to engage in lobbying behavior and use political funds to influence policy outcomes. This is a worthy contribution to the analysis of political factors that influence corruption levels in developing and developed economies.</p>
