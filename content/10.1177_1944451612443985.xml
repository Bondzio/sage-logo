<abstract>
<p>The number of patients awaiting a solid organ transplant in the United States continues to grow each year despite efforts to increase the donor pool. Because only 1% of all deaths in the United States may become eligible as organ donors, the preservation of donors and the maximum number of organs from each donor is essential. Optimal organ procurement rests on the principles of early identification of potential donors, timely family- and patient-centric discussion of the option for organ donation and then careful donor management up to and through the procurement process. Health care practitioners in the ICU play important roles at each step of this process. This article outlines the basic considerations for optimizing organ quality during the donation process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With organ transplantation becoming the treatment of choice for end-stage organ diseases, the shortage of available organs has become a global health care crisis. There are currently more than 113 000 people on the wait list for a life-saving organ transplant, and approximately 18 people die every day while waiting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451612443985">1</xref></sup> The transplant field has worked to expand the donor pool with the inclusion of split organs, living donors, extended criteria donors, and increasing numbers of donors after cardiac death; however, the shortage remains a major problem. Only 1% of all deaths in the United States are eligible to become organ donors. In 2011, there were approximately 7500 deceased donors and approximately 20 790 organs transplanted, representing a significant gap (based on Organ Procurement and Transplant Network data as of February 3, 2012). The disparity between the number of recipients and available organs makes the identification of potential donors and their maintenance crucial to sustaining transplantation as a viable treatment for organ failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451612443985">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Activation of the Procurement Process</title>
<p>The primary step in the organ donation process is the recognition of a potential donor in the ICU followed by continued clinical support in spite of the potential nonsurvivability of the injury. Pre-donor management is viewed as the most neglected portion of the donation–transplant process, yet it is critical to the end goals of transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451612443985">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612443985">4</xref></sup> Conditions of participation with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services require the referral of patients who meet the criteria for a potential donor to an Organ Procurement Organization (OPO). The set criteria for organ referrals are agreed on by the hospital and the OPO serving a given area, and typically include a neurological insult, including but not limited to trauma, stroke, hemorrhage, or anoxic injuries, in addition to ventilator dependence and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 5 or less. All other factors regarding suitability are at the discretion of the OPO, including age, medical history, or family preferences. These factors may cause the OPO to rapidly rule out a patient as a potential donor on referral, but it is the responsibility of OPO staff rather than ICU staff. Therefore, assuming the clinical criteria are met, the referral should be made. It is important to remember that when a patient is not referred, there will be zero potential for donation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451612443985">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once a referral is made, the OPO staff will work with hospital staff collaboratively, and provide support in clinical management, and support of grieving relatives. Once recognized and referred, it becomes imperative that medical management of the patient continues, in particular with respect to oxygenation, electrolyte balance, and adequate perfusion of organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612443985">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612443985">6</xref></sup> There is a fine line between giving the family a nonsurvivable prognosis, while continuing to aggressively treat a patient in order to maintain the option of donation. In some cases there may appear to be a glaring contradiction to a family at bedside between the devastating diagnosis and the continued aggressive treatment. Despite the apparent contradiction, it is important to remember that by continuing patient care, a family is empowered to ultimately make a decision regarding donation or to honor their loved ones’ first person authorization. Those who work in the donor–transplant field believe that every family has a right to be presented with the option of making their loved one an organ donor. By decelerating care, or not making a referral to an OPO, the option of donation is lost, and that right is taken away from patients and families.</p>

<sec id="section3-1944451612443985">
<title>Role of the ICU in Donor Management</title>
<p>Once a patient’s neurological injury has been deemed nonsurvivable, medical management should shift toward maintaining the option of donation. Should the patient have a first person directive or should their family authorize organ donation, OPO staff may take over care of the brain dead donor and implement a set of management protocols. However, prior to the declaration of brain death and family authorization for donation, providing continued care falls squarely on hospital staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612443985">6</xref></sup> In most cases, good patient care is equivalent to good organ preservation. It is critical to support the potential donors through the herniation process, keeping the patient hemodynamically stable while balancing fluid and electrolytes appropriately. Good support through the herniation process is beneficial for both organ donation and a smooth brain death declaration process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451612443985">7</xref></sup> Typically, potential donors going through the herniation process are the sickest patients in the ICU and require expert coordinated care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451612443985">8</xref></sup> In hospitals that are not commonly exposed to such a process, the OPO coordinators can be an invaluable resource.</p>
<p>Management of the herniation process should be focused primarily on hemodynamic support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612443985">9</xref></sup> As cerebral swelling begins to impede blood flow to the brainstem, a massive catecholamine release occurs and the patient’s physiology becomes increasingly hyperdynamic as the brain attempts to maintain perfusion. When cerebral perfusion ultimately ceases, resulting in death of neural tissue, the catecholamine stimulation is lost, often leading to cardiovascular collapse. To preserve the option of donation, it is critical that the ICU staff be prepared to manage the resulting hypotension with vasopressors and fluids as clinically indicated as substantial damage to organs can occur rapidly should perfusion be disrupted. Additionally, the inflammation associated with the catecholamine release can be considerable and lead to systemic injury that may diminish the number of transplantable organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612443985">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451612443985">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451612443985">10</xref></sup> Maximizing donor potential by lessening organ injury with the initiation of hormone resuscitation therapy may be indicated including the administration of methylprednisolone, levothyroxine, and vasopressin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451612443985">4</xref></sup> The so-called “catecholamine storm” is a predictable symptom of brainstem herniation in most cases, however not all patients follow this pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451612443985">11</xref></sup> Other rare possibilities include consistent hypertension, hypotension without prior hypertension, or even no changes at all. In any case, regardless of the progression or symptoms, the management goals of maintaining adequate perfusion and oxygenation are always paramount and will require the active participation of bedside nursing and critical care practitioners to manage well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451612443985">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Fluid and electrolyte balance are also critical in potential donor management. Loss of brain function often leads to diabetes insipidus (DI), resulting from the dysfunction of the pituitary gland and loss of antidiuretic hormone. DI is characterized by high volume urine output with very clear color and a specific gravity of less than 1.005. The extreme fluid loss associated with DI is detrimental to organ perfusion, cardiovascular support, and electrolyte balance. Recognition and treatment of DI is critical to maintaining organ function. Two common drugs can be used in treating DI. DDAVP (desmopressin) can be administered intravenously in patients with normal blood pressure, but if the patient is hypotensive, a vasopressin drip is appropriate, as it has a second function as a vasopressor.</p>
<p>This response (DI) serves as an important example of how critical the ICU’s role in the care of a potential donor is to the overall transplant process. There are several management goals that when achieved have shown evidence of a larger number of organs transplanted per donor, as well as better graft function post-transplant. These goals include adequate management of mean arterial pressure (goal: 60-100 mm Hg), central venous pressure (goal: 4-12 mm Hg), blood glucose level (goal: &lt;150 mg/dL), serum sodium (goal: &lt;155 mEq/L), pH (7.30-7.50), Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>/Fi<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> – P:F ratio (goal: &gt;300), and urine output (goal: &gt;0.5 mL/kg/h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451612443985">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451612443985">14</xref></sup> Assiduous attention to attaining these goals in the donor prior to procurement are essential for successful transplant outcome.</p>
<p>Management of oxygenation can present additional clinical challenges, as the lungs are particularly susceptible to the effects of brainstem herniation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451612443985">9</xref></sup> The goal of pulmonary management is to optimize oxygen delivery to organs, but to do so as to maintain the potential for lung transplant when indicated. Care in the administration of fluids is important, with the target central venous pressure less than 12 mm Hg, as well as use of positive end-expiratory pressure and adequate tidal volumes. Finally, the prevention and/or treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia should be continued or implemented to maintain viability of lungs and the donor as a whole; this can be of particular concern with potential donors who have been hospitalized long term.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is evident that the recognition and management of patients with the potential to become organ donors is critical to optimizing organ function. It is the hope of those in the transplant field that with increasingly better recognition of potential donors, the gap between available donor organs and potential recipients can be diminished. Furthermore, there is increased evidence that suggests continuing the medical management of patients with nonsurvivable brain injuries, as outlined above, leads to more organs transplanted per donor and better organ graft function post-transplant. In conclusion, the ICU plays a vital role in the initiation of the organ donation process. By recognition and management of the potential donor, the ICU staff has the potential to increase the number of donors and the number of organs transplanted per donor, which subsequently increases the chance of saving the lives of those waiting for an organ transplant.</p>
