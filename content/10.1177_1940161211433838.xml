<abstract>
<p>In the digital age, journalists are becoming more susceptible to the packaged visuals of politicians that image handlers are pushing electronically in an attempt to circumvent and influence the mainstream media. These managed photos and videos communicate officialdom, voyeurism, and pseudo-events, ranging from routine government business to a personal side of political leaders. They are designed to frame the subject in a positive light and to promote a strategic image. This article submits that demand for digital handouts of visuals, or “image bytes,” is stimulated by economics and institutional accommodation, including the constant need for Web content and journalists’ eroding access to government officials. A profile of the image management of Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper illustrates the jockeying between politicians, PR staff, and journalists over news selection, pseudo-events, framing and gatekeeping. Insights from 32 interviews with Canadian journalists and Conservative party insiders suggests that a two-tier media system is emerging between the small news operations that welcome digital handouts and the mainstream journalists who are opposed. Theoretical themes for international research include examining the implications of political image bytes such as the possible priming effect on journalists who are exposed to constant visual e-communication pushed by political offices.</p>

<p>In the digital age, the evolution of political journalism from textual to visual is speeding up, and shortened sound bites are competing with voiceless image bites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433838">Adatto 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433838">Esser 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433838">Mayer 2004</xref>). Public relations (PR) personnel are curtailing access to political leaders while planning, producing, selecting, and distributing their own favorable photos and video. News organizations are becoming more susceptible to reproducing the packaged visuals of politicians that image handlers push through e-mail and wire services, and which they upload to institutional, partisan, and commercial Web sites including Facebook, Flickr, and Twitter. These managed visuals can reflect serious matters and routine government business, such as politicians meeting with their counterparts or working in their offices, and can offer a glimpse of otherwise private moments. A prominent example is the iconic “handout” photograph<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161211433838">1</xref></sup> of President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration in the White House Situation Room being updated about the raid in Pakistan that led to the death of Osama bin Laden. That photo was taken by Obama’s personal photographer; was selected by PR staff to be posted on the White House Web site; was recirculated online, in wire services and in mainstream media; and then was criticized for having been digitally altered by the White House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1940161211433838">Winslow 2011</xref>). In addition to officialdom and voyeurism, these handout visuals depict the fake celebrations that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161211433838">Boorstin (1992)</xref> called pseudo-events: activities designed to achieve media coverage which are so devoid of substance that their newsworthiness is open to interpretation. These add to leaders’ fame and greatness by featuring politicians giving a speech, cutting ribbons and mingling with an adoring public, as well as showing off a talent, hugging family members and hobnobbing with celebrities. These visuals reappear in party ephemera such as newsletters—as well as in the news.</p>
<p>As consumers shift to the Web for information the 24/7 nature of news and restricted access to public officials is creating a constant need for visual content and a market for free digital photos and video, which we might refer to as “image bytes.” This article discusses the production and dissemination of digital photos by a political office. It examines strategic objectives such as framing and image management and it explores how journalists respond. Evidence from Canada suggests that PR personnel are using image bytes to circumvent and influence the media. Moreover, there is a two-tier media system emerging between the small news operations that use digital handouts and those organizations that are opposed to doing so. Insights drawn from interviews with journalists and political party insiders improve our understanding of the theoretical and practical implications of the digital age on political journalism. This adds to our knowledge about the relationship between the news media and political institutions, the dynamics of political communication, and the interplay between politics and journalistic practice.</p>

<title>Political Photography and Image Management</title>
<p>Image management techniques have been gravitating to an expanding online sphere. Whereas in 2000 the Web sites of American presidential candidates were text-based with some photographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1940161211433838">Shaw 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161211433838">Verser and Wicks 2006</xref>), and in 2002 only about 14 percent of U.S. Congress members’ online newsrooms contained photos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161211433838">Lipinski and Neddenriep 2004</xref>), a casual look on December 30, 2010, at government Web sites around the world found that digital photos were becoming the norm.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161211433838">2</xref></sup> All G8 member countries maintained an online library of unmediated photos of their political leaders for reporters to access. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s Web site archived multiple photos per “working day,” photos of German Chancellor Angela Merkel were stored in a “Chancellor’s Week in Pictures” section, and pictures of Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan were housed under the heading “Prime Minister in Action.” President Obama’s Web site presented a “photo of the day” in a style similar to that of the French president and the Canadian prime minister which, like the Italian PM’s site, all maintained a searchable collection of photographs. Other G20 leaders made photos available online, too. The visuals on Web sites of heads of government in Argentina, Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and South Korea were comparable to G8 leaders’, though China and Saudi Arabia emphasized various party or government officials, and the remaining G20 leaders’ sites promoted text of speeches and CEO-style portraits. The Web sites of non-G20 political leaders such as in the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, and Sweden made limited use of daily photos at the time. Yet despite the preponderance of online political photography, a knowledge gap persists about the relationship between information gatekeeping and the digital visuals of politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1940161211433838">Verser and Wicks 2006</xref>: 195).</p>
<p>The “presentation of self,” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161211433838">Goffman (1959)</xref> observed, involves looking at one’s public image as that of an actor wearing a costume and using props on stage while being observed by an audience. In politics, managing the public image and reputation of a party and its leader is often intertwined with selling policy, and it has an important endgame given that electors’ evaluation of leaders is a key variable in vote choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433838">Brown et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161211433838">Davies and Mian 2010</xref>). Image management is a component of the research-inspired “design” of a political product and can be used to counteract image weaknesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161211433838">Lees-Marshment 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433838">Paré and Berger 2008</xref>) with such methodical rigor that its techniques are on the margins of state propaganda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161211433838">Rutherford 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161211433838">Scammell 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>: 138). Political strategists employ advertising, branding, direct marketing, media relations, and e-marketing in a permanent campaign for public support. Less savory tactics include reducing opportunities for scrutiny, the airbrushing of photos, and promoting a negative narrative about an opponent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433838">Adatto 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161211433838">Boorstin 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433838">Mayer 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>). Their work is constrained by the realities of the leader’s character, is frustrated by opponents’ attempts to counterdefine an image, and shifts into damage control amid public controversy. Collectively, these efforts can shape how leaders appear in the mass media and can favorably influence public impressions of a politician (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433838">Brown et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161211433838">Davies and Mian 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161211433838">Rosenberg et al. 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Image handlers’ preferred techniques evolve with new technologies. Communicators take on more specialized roles, their skills and knowledge improve, and they respond to changing circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433838">Gandy 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433838">Negrine and Lilleker 2002</xref>). A managed technique that is evolving is the photo op whereby journalists are invited to visually document a pseudo-event, such as a news conference adorned with visual symbols, props, backdrops, and slogans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433838">Adatto 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>). In the age of e-marketing, the news release and press kit have gravitated to electronic distribution, and digital cameras and Internet bandwidth expansion have turned photographs and video into significant direct marketing tools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1940161211433838">Waters and Wang 2011</xref>). Image bytes have become integrated into the marketing of leaders through the clarity, simplicity, and consistency of visual messages. They reduce the perceived need for journalists to attend photo ops because political marketers can communicate an unmediated message directly to target audiences. This evolution of direct marketing is part of an ongoing struggle with reporters and editors over the “framing” of news and a leader’s image, that is, the control of what information is reported and how it is presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161211433838">Cappella and Jamieson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433838">Entman 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433838">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161211433838">Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007</xref>). Information that is highlighted in the news is more likely to command public attention and this can determine the course of action to resolve a political issue. The implication is that news framing can influence how audiences are informed, how they will respond, and what power politicians have to implement a preferred agenda. Gatekeeping results: PR staff restricts access to public officials and government information while journalists apply criteria for selecting the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433838">Berkowitz 1990</xref>). Consequently, PR staff “actively engage in visual framing strategies to promote desired candidate qualities and favored themes and to reinforce policy positions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>: 5), whereas journalists construct the news as they see it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433838">Berkowitz 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433838">Entman 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433838">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433838">Gandy 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1940161211433838">Schudson 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>A range of factors affect journalists’ news judgments. Foremost among them are the influences of political economy and the sociology of their occupation, including the institutional accommodation of a press gallery and a reporter’s relationship with government officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1940161211433838">Schudson 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433838">Gandy (1982</xref>: 8) has explained that as information becomes cheaper, it is more likely to be consumed. This positions those with the power to subsidize a stable and timely supply of information at an advantage to frame issues and influence decisions. He adds that senders and receivers are concerned with cost-effectiveness, that investigative reporting is time-consuming, and that journalists do not tend to question bureaucratic information. As a result, it is “easy to see how [journalists] come to favor those bureaucratic sources who can provide a regular, credible, and ultimately usable flow of information, insight, and imagery with which to construct the news” (p. 13). This dependency on others to generate information makes the news business “a parasitic institution” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>: 51).</p>
<p>Despite the symbiotic relationship, journalists often hold a rather dim view of politicians and PR personnel. They may be skeptical of political actors, who they may suspect are corrupt, untrustworthy, selfish, and calculating beings that are not in the game for the public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161211433838">Cappella and Jamieson 1997</xref>). Moreover, image management requires that image-makers deny what they are up to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>: 75). Although journalists profess neutrality, even the most fair-minded among them can be influenced by exposure to political spin, which can contribute to political news that is slanted. Editorial skews can extend to the selection of visuals, such as what angle to take, including the unscripted “gaffes” or damaging “gotcha” moments that can damage a political image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433838">Adatto 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433838">Entman 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433838">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161211433838">Glasgow University Media Group 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161211433838">Kim and Kelly 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1940161211433838">Tiffen 1989</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433838">Grabe and Bucy 2009</xref>). Given that journalists may wrap themselves in a cloak of objectivity, and yet are arbiters of shaping the news, it is little wonder that politicians and PR personnel are likewise disapproving of the media.</p>
<p>These competing dynamics in the relationship between the press and politics are present, if evolving, in the digital era. One of Andrew Chadwick’s observations about the hybridized mixture of old and new media is that journalists are integrating “digital practices and online sources into their own coverage, as they seek to outperform new media actors in an incessant, micro-level, and often real-time power struggle characterized by competition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161211433838">2011</xref>: 8). This drive to be first and authentic has created a market for participatory journalism among ancillary citizen reporters who capture images with their digital cameras. If newsrooms are using visuals submitted by unknown amateurs, then there may be a willingness to use professional visuals that have been produced by known political offices. This helps explain why political strategists coordinate and promote image bytes. Journalists tend to accord politicians opportunities for only short quotes and voiceless visuals anyway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433838">Esser 2008</xref>) and a political marketer’s distribution of photos is a low-risk, low-cost framing activity that may result in free and positive coverage of a controlled visual message. This is part of a broader effort to “prime” the audience’s point of view by suggesting particular benchmarks for evaluating issues and, in this case, which visual cues matter. If the news can be framed using a narrative of related visuals, then public opinion can be manipulated and the public policy agenda can be set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433838">Gandy 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161211433838">Glasgow University Media Group 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161211433838">Scheufele and Tewksbury 2007</xref>). There are also electoral benefits given considerable evidence that, in experiments, a positive nonverbal image is related to leaders’ popularity and power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161211433838">Mattes et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161211433838">Rosenberg et al. 2001</xref>). However, the distribution of image bytes reduces politicians’ willingness to interact with journalists and is causing some journalists to mobilize against controlled direct access to public officials. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161211433838">National Press Photographers Association (2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161211433838">2011b</xref>), for instance, advocates that visual journalists should avoid being manipulated by staged photo ops and must seek unrestricted access to subjects and government-controlled events.</p>
<p>The electronic distribution of packaged visuals raises many questions. When are news organizations more susceptible to reproducing political handout photos? Are communications personnel filling journalists’ need for new information by feeding them staged photos? Given ongoing changes in the news industry are photo releases a help or a hindrance? These are explored next in the Canadian context.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Between January and March 2011, information was collected from Canadian journalists and Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) insiders. Thirty-two conversations were conducted by telephone and/or via e-mail with media personnel (<italic>n</italic> = 24) and partisans (<italic>n</italic> = 8). Depth interviews with twenty-one respondents, of whom fourteen were journalists, were between forty and sixty minutes in duration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161211433838">3</xref></sup> Eleven respondents, including one Conservative, opted instead to answer a dozen open-ended questions by e-mail.</p>
<p>Research about the Prime Minister of Canada’s communications regimen is difficult given that the partisans and journalists who are most informed about it will not talk for fear of repercussions. Purposive sampling was used whereby the researcher’s expertise informed the selection of potential respondents within a small universe of knowledgeable experts. Senior visual media journalists who were listed on major news organizations’ Web sites were contacted. This was supplemented by referrals from respondents and information in news reports discussing the CPC’s use of image bytes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161211433838">4</xref></sup> Media respondents worked for <italic>Calgary Herald</italic>, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), CTV.ca, The Canadian Press, the Canadian Public Affairs Channel (CPAC), <italic>Embassy Magazine, The Globe and Mail, The Hill Times, Metro, National Post</italic>, the Newfoundland Broadcasting Company, <italic>Ottawa Citizen, Ottawa Sun, South Asian Focus, Straight Goods News, This Magazine, The Toronto Star</italic>, Transcontinental Media, <italic>The Weekly Voice, The Western Standard, Winnipeg Free Press</italic>, and <italic>Vancouver Sun</italic>. The presidents of the Association of Electronic Journalists Canada and the Canadian Association of Journalists participated. Securing interviews with political personnel was more difficult because of the demands of governing and strict message control emanating from the prime minister’s office (PMO). Conservative respondents were current and former senior communications personnel, a former chief of staff to Stephen Harper, a policy advisor, and three prominent CPC senators. Interview requests that were declined or not acknowledged included some journalists, the PMO, all contacted cabinet ministers, some senators, two former PMO communications directors, and the PM’s photographer. The sampling method, English-only conversations, and lack of information from current members of the PMO places some limitations on the scope of the findings.</p>
<p>Semistructured discussions with journalists explored the perceived positives and negatives associated with PMO handout photos. For example, what was their organization’s policy on using political and government photos? Under what circumstances would it use or not use them? What was their opinion about these photos? Conversations with party strategists explored whether they were involved in the creation of political photos and what they knew about the PMO’s practice of issuing photo releases. For example, did they ever distribute photos online? What did they know about the “Photo of the Day” section of the prime minister’s Web site? What were the reasons behind the PMO distributing handout photos? The interpretation of their responses follows next. Randomized identifiers have been assigned in nonchronological order to journalists (e.g., J1, J2) and Conservative party insiders (e.g., C1, C2) to provide an indication of the range of sources of information while protecting respondent confidentiality.</p>

<title>Photo Management and the Prime Minister’s Office</title>
<p>Canadian prime ministers go to great lengths to manage how their image is presented in the news. Their relationship with journalists has eroded as government communication has become more centrally managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161211433838">Kozolanka 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433838">Levine 1993</xref>) and as more emphasis has been placed on advertising to communicate unmediated policy messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433838">Rose 2000</xref>). The PMO has grown to employ personnel dealing with communications, policy, and issues management, and it maintains a team of tour advance staff that plans photo ops. Since Stephen Harper became prime minister in 2006, the office has further prioritized strategic image management and centralized messaging that appears to have been inspired by his American counterparts. The Conservatives’ techniques are similar to the communications discipline of Republican President George W. Bush, which left the media with little choice but to report on the visuals designed by White House image handlers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161211433838">Graber 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433838">Mayer 2004</xref>), an era of news management that itself has similarities with British Conservative party techniques a decade earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161211433838">Scammell 1995</xref>). Ideas are also drawn from Democrats given that in 2011 the design, layout, and even the color scheme of Prime Minister Harper’s “photo of the day” Web page were identical to President Obama’s “photo of the day” page (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161211433838">Prime Minister of Canada 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1940161211433838">White House 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Stephen Harper’s style of media management is a regular source of discussion among political observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433838">Flanagan 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433838">Martin 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433838">Paré and Berger 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161211433838">5</xref></sup> Harper was the first federal leader in Canada to employ an image consultant to handle his makeup, hair, and clothing selection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161211433838">6</xref></sup> New positions in his PMO include a manager of visual communications and a manager of new media and marketing. His government has reduced media access to Conservative public officials and to bureaucrats. He has shunned interactions with the parliamentary press gallery in a dispute over his demands to select which journalists can ask him questions (though he is not the first prime minister to have done so; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433838">Levine 1993</xref>). Only government photographers and videographers have been allowed to document Harper’s visits to military combat zones. The executive branch has directed that government Web sites must feature party colors and requires that the bureaucracy obtain its approval for any public communication. The rigidity of this image management itself became a media frame during the spring 2011 federal election when Harper was labeled as running a “bubble campaign” that insulated Conservatives from unscripted situations. On occasion, this frame of a communications control freak attracts attention outside Canada. In August 2011, international media reported that Harper was so insistent on controlling the timing of photo opportunities during a trade mission to Brazil that he locked himself in the Brazilian foreign minister’s bathroom until his demands were met. In denying the story, Harper’s communications director assured journalists that “bottom line guys, when these things happen it’s because the team is fighting for you guys so you can get access.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1940161211433838">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Generating publicity through image bytes has become a key component of such a disciplined and sheltered style of media management. The Harper team targets its preferred elector segments by narrowcasting to small news operations run by two to three people, particularly ethnic media, and via the Internet. PMO advisories routinely specify that events are a “photo opportunity only” and sometimes state that only photojournalists will be bused to an undisclosed location. Whereas journalists are “penned” (C8) away from the prime minister at public events, Harper’s official photographer has exclusive access to public and private moments, and often travels with him. This is the public servant who documents a visual history of behind-the-scenes political moments and whose official photos had, until Harper, only been released to the press on request. In the Harper PMO, these duties rotate between two photographers (a married couple) and an assistant. Subscribers to RSS news feeds can receive real-time summaries of the PM’s photo gallery and the chosen photo of the day. Twitter followers are informed of a new photo in a short message, such as: “Flickr: PM celebrates Canada Day with Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bit.ly/jNdwGa">http://bit.ly/jNdwGa</ext-link>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1940161211433838">Twitter 2011</xref>). Other notifications are exclusive to journalists or partisans and some such electronic media advisories attach a recent photo of Harper. As well since 2009 the PMO has e-mailed what it calls a “photo release” to select journalists that describes a new photo and includes a government URL to access a depository of photos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1940161211433838">8</xref></sup> For example:</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>The media downloads section of the prime minister’s Web site offers visual thumbnails of recent photographs, accompanied by a sentence description, and clicking on a thumbnail leads to a high-resolution digital file that is suitable for reproduction. A copyright statement permits these visuals to be reproduced, unless doing so is for commercial purposes, in which case written permission can be sought by e-mailing Public Works and Government Services Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161211433838">Prime Minister of Canada 2011c</xref>). During the 2011 election campaign, these visuals ceased being updated. Instead, this occurred more frequently on the CPC’s Web site; after the election, the practice resumed as before on the prime minister’s site. Where there has been convergence, however, is on Harper’s Facebook page, which has made no such differentiation between using party and government resources for visual content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433838">Facebook 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>What is the strategy behind the Conservative party’s production and distribution of digital photographs? How do Canadian journalists feel about this practice? When is this tactic most likely to achieve media coverage? These questions are explored next.</p>
<sec id="section4-1940161211433838">
<title>The Strategy Behind Political Handout Photos</title>
<p>The creation and electronic distribution of digital photos, and video, has become an integrated part of the prime minister’s communication strategy. The objective is to achieve pickup in national media, in community publications, on news aggregators and on blogs, as well as to attract visits to the PM’s Web site. As one party respondent explained, “If you want to find out about the PM you go to his Web site, not the <italic>Toronto Star</italic>’s” (C4).</p>
<p>Publicly, Prime Minister Harper’s communications director has stated that a photo release is synonymous with a text press release, while the deputy PMO press secretary has added that they are providing a resource for small publications.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1940161211433838">9</xref></sup> In private conversations, Conservatives explained that managed visuals are designed to reinforce the “common man” brand attributes of their leader, and are an attempt to defy negative image stereotypes, such as juxtaposing Harper’s patriotic love of hockey against perceptions that he is an aloof ideologue. Issuing digital visuals also reduces the ability of news editors to decide which photos should be shown to the masses. In the past, said one Conservative, “the wire service, the photo editor, and the photographer were the gatekeepers” (C3), while another expressed frustration that a photojournalist “takes 150 shots and the paper decides which one to use” (C7). Now the party can reach “outside the [press gallery] bubble” and smaller media outlets will use PMO photos “in a second because they need the content” (C5). This is an important struggle because, as one Tory noted, “Visuals trump words. . . . The more pictures you use the better your chances are to cut through the clutter” (C1).</p>
<p>Conservative respondents explained that Stephen Harper’s visual communication strategy can be traced back to a postmortem after the CPC placed second in the 2004 federal election (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433838">Flanagan 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433838">Paré and Berger 2008</xref>). At the time, party consultants advised that visuals could be used to influence swing voters who were more likely to be disengaged and uninformed and to access news online. Audiences would become more comfortable with Harper, it was reasoned, if his image took on the characteristics of a prime minister. Communication personnel put less effort into speeches and event attendance and instead vexed about visuals. They became “obsessed” with the details of photo backdrops, stage positioning, color schemes, and the leader’s clothing (C8). Business jackets and suits were preferred because these would conceal Harper’s waistline while staying true to his personality; as one Conservative relayed, the business attire works, because “that’s who he is—he’s not a guy who sits around drinking with the boys” (C7). Backdrops of Parliament Hill were chosen to symbolize the leader working in the PM’s office; Canadian flags were used as props to suggest patriotism and statesmanship. When this communications discipline paid off with the CPC’s election victory in 2006, it was carried over into the business of governing and into the campaigns of 2008 and 2011. This includes an American-style emphasis on pomp by lining the hall of honor—the ceremonial area in the center block of the Parliament buildings—with flags when Harper walks with another world leader toward journalists’ cameras. “A lot of the photos’ content is <italic>pro forma</italic>, things you just do as a PM,” explained one Conservative (C1), remarking on the routine business depicted in most photos, though the PMO does make an effort to feature irreverent content, such as reoccurring photos of Harper with kittens that are designed to soften his image. Meanwhile, stark relations with recalcitrant journalists have supported the party’s desire to frame him as a strong leader.</p>
<p>The Tories’ use of image bytes as part of a framing and priming strategy is designed to influence busy journalists. Strategists incur no extra cost to flood all media outlets with electronic content and through the “drip, drip, drip” of digital visuals they may be winning a subliminal priming battle. This is by design; one Tory believed that “the editors are looking at them even if they don’t put them in their paper. Over time this can frame how they perceive the PM” (C1). Handout photos are regularly discussed among journalists, including among opponents, who may make snide remarks as a PMO e-mail is deleted or may mock an associated Twitter announcement. As an editor of a free newspaper explained, “When we receive a photo from the PMO, even if we delete it, we are informed about where he is and what he’s doing. It’s always in the back of your mind” (J10). Likewise, the editor of a publication that does not use handouts observed, “We’re human beings. I’m sure there’s some small psychological impact” (J3). In this way, image handlers may be priming how news gatekeepers see a party leader.</p>
<p>The creation and distribution of digital photos also serves an internal party function and prompts partisan loyalty. An e-mailed photograph of the party leader contributes to the marketing of the leader by updating Conservatives across the country about their party’s issue of the day, where the prime minister is, what the government is doing, and whether a policy decision warrants a search for more information. It allows the party to stay “on message” by reducing the likelihood of a parliamentarian or even a member of a local riding association contradicting the PMO. “This keeps us all on the same page,” explained one Tory (C6); another remarked, “I want to know where he is and what he’s doing. The picture comes with an explanation. It’s just shorthand” (C7). If a PMO photo has a local angle, parliamentarians may forward it to local reporters, to riding association members, to constituents, or to family and friends. Some photos are uploaded to a parliamentarian’s own Web site and are included in newsletters, calendars, or campaign flyers. Thus the circulation of photos has the added benefit of reinforcing the strict party discipline that characterizes Canadian politics.</p>

<title>How Journalists React to Political Handout Photos</title>
<p>There is general alarm among mainstream journalists about Stephen Harper’s attempts to insulate his government from scrutiny. The parliamentary press gallery is frustrated that the prime minister is rarely available for scrums (again, not unique to Harper; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433838">Levine 1993</xref>). Photojournalists can no longer wander around the Parliament buildings and they risk being blacklisted by communications personnel if they record party officials arriving at or departing from a photo op.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1940161211433838">10</xref></sup> Visual journalists have noticed that their photographs provide environmental context, such as the presence of other MPs, but that the PMO’s visuals tend to be constructionist by profiling only Harper. They feel that their time is wasted waiting around for opportunities that do not emerge and they feel devalued by an administration that attempts to circumvent a parliamentary institution. Nevertheless a respondent reported that such protocols are becoming accepted because “there’s nothing to fight for” (J5).</p>
<p>One specific incident that was described by respondents as “a seminal moment” (J23) and a “loggerhead” (J5) has come to be seen by a number of Canadian journalists as a tipping point in their relationship with the Harper administration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1940161211433838">11</xref></sup> In May 2009 the Governor General, Michaëlle Jean, visited an Inuit community in northern Canada. The political symbolism associated with the visuals of a vice-regal authority eating uncooked seal heart generated international media attention. When Harper and his inner cabinet visited Iqaluit four months later, and sought to make the same visual political statement, the PMO barred Canadian journalists and a shared “pool” camera from documenting the ministers sampling bits of seal meat. Instead the PMO distributed its own photograph of the PM and eight smiling ministers, who had toothpicks in hand, clustered around a plate. The PMO’s version was the only visual record and it was picked up by mainstream media.</p>
<p>Was the PMO photo newsworthy? As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433838">Entman (2004)</xref> has observed, a free press should impose an impartial filter on government officialdom to help the public deliberate policy positions, which limits the government’s ability to frame ideas; however, in practice this results in a “framing contest” (p. 9). Such a game ensued when the journalism community voiced concern at the time, which persisted in research interviews more than a year later, that the PMO handout only <italic>implied</italic> that ministers ate seal. Journalists could not confirm that the meat had been eaten and could not report whether any of the ministers were sickened. The Canadian Press (CP) filed a complaint with the PMO about their exclusion and in 2010 an investigative journalism association issued an open letter of complaint about Harper’s media management. In asking media to “stop running hand-out photos and video clips” the Canadian Association of Journalists expressed its concern:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Access to public events is now restricted. Photographers and videographers have been replaced by hand-out photos and footage shot by the prime minister’s press office and blitzed out to newsrooms across Canada. It’s getting tougher to find an independent eye recording history, a witness seeing things how they really happened—not how politicians wish they’d happened. Did cabinet ministers grimace while they tasted seal meat in the Arctic last summer? Canadians will never know. Photographers were barred from the fake photo-op. Those hand-out shots are, unfortunately, widely used by media outlets, often without the caveat that they are not real journalism. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161211433838">Canadian Association of Journalists 2010</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Harper’s staff responded by saying that to be fair to reporters who were not nearby when the seal meat was eaten that a decision was made to block those who were. The incident led to some, but not all, mainstream media agreeing to develop stricter policies about the use of digital handout photos in an attempt to remind the PMO who decides what photos make the news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1940161211433838">12</xref></sup> By comparison, a Conservative respondent felt that the dispute was “trivial beyond belief” and maintained that Canadian journalists “should move to Libya” to be exposed to real political issues (C7). At the core of the debate may be that the nearly two dozen journalists who were in Iqaluit were upset with how they were treated. Having invested time and money on traveling to the remote location they had a quid pro quo expectation of extraordinary access to the political executive.</p>
<p>This is a good example of the conflicting values of the press, who want the freedom to capture interesting and unusual visuals, and the political class, who want the power to influence positive and risk-averse images. Jockeying over framing is also illustrated by an event that occurred while interviews for this research article were being conducted. In February 2011, controversy erupted over revelations that Bev Oda, the Conservative minister for international cooperation, had misled the House of Commons over an altered memo. As media interest intensified, she declined interview requests and other ministers responded to questions intended for her in the legislature. Then, on February 16, Oda was photographed by Reuters smoking a cigarette outside the Parliament buildings, while wearing sunglasses; the candid image is best described as a mobster version of Roy Orbison. The “gotcha” photograph was widely publicized by news editors. It was lampooned in editorial cartoons; was deemed the photo of the week by the <italic>Toronto Sun</italic> and Global News; was discussed by a panel on CBC-TV’s <italic>The National</italic>; and Global TV and <italic>Maclean’s</italic> magazine ran online “caption challenge” contests to solicit amusing descriptions. CPC respondents saw the Oda photo as beyond the pale, believing that it contributed to a decline in civic discourse, with one remarking that “photographers have their own agenda. . . . It was a predatory photo designed to deepen her problems” (C4). Journalists countered that the PMO had sheltered Oda from public appearances and accountability, leaving the fourth estate with little choice. During this time (February 17 to 19) the PMO’s photos of the day were of Harper buying maple syrup, cleaning his glasses in his office, and playing his guitar at home.</p>
<p>A journalist’s struggle to investigate public policy is becoming a battle over the freedom to document the photo ops that themselves have raised alarm. Some veteran journalists remarked on a worldwide trend toward stricter media management at political events, from leader summits to the Olympics. Journalists and partisans alike rationalized rigid political communications by citing past gotcha photos, in particular the iconographic CP photo of Conservative leader Robert Stanfield fumbling a football during the 1974 federal election campaign. That case epitomizes the political struggle over image framing given that the CP took a roll of photos of Stanfield playing catch, but newspapers including the <italic>Globe and Mail</italic> ran the one photo of him fumbling the ball, which fed a contrast with the dashing image of Liberal PM Pierre Trudeau. The ability for just one wayward photo to derail a politician’s career was offered as justification for image handlers’ wariness of the power of the press, if not their management techniques.</p>
<p>Mainstream journalists’ concerns about image bytes were not shared by the respondents at small media operations which have lower standards for replicating news releases and photo ops. These organizations welcomed the PMO’s digital media service because of the time, financial, and content value, including access to a library of visuals. Freelancers can submit photos with their text copy and columnists can upload handouts to their blogs. One reflected that “life is a lot easier for reporters with digital photos. We’ve got all these photos coming all the time” (J21). These respondents found their mainstream peers’ concerns about journalistic integrity to be insulting. They said that they use handouts only for illustrative purposes to support an existing story (i.e., they do not write stories because of photos) and are careful to identify the PMO as the source. One editor remarked, “We leave it for the reader to decide. We know the photos are being taken in a certain perspective to make the subject look good and in a positive light” (J8). The editor of another small newspaper remarked that mainstream outlets are themselves not immune to editorial biases:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Journalistic integrity is a personal thing, but on an organizational level, we know that in Canada, media integrity depends on how well each of them espouse their particular political bias! So short of rejecting a rather attractive picture of Harper and choosing a bad hair [photo] of Harper, a choice that editors make, free availability of pictures should in no way affect journalistic integrity, if we have it to begin with. As a community newspaper with limited resources, we are glad they exist and appreciate their timeliness and cost-effectiveness. (J13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nevertheless, some small news operations did recognize the potential for problems. As one editor explained, “[We have] virtually no budget for content. Since we have very little money for photographs, we do make use [of] any content made available at no cost even if it comes from official sources, raising questions about objectivity” (J9). The PMO’s photograph “service” is thus divisive yet equitable and it is propagandist yet helpful. The circumstances for media outlets using handout photos are discussed next.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1940161211433838">
<title>When the News Media Is More Likely to Use Political Handout Photos</title>
<p>The interviews with media professionals indicate that factors involved in whether or not the news media will use a political handout photo include content, online news, political economy, professional integrity, and simplicity. Many of these reinforce longstanding findings about news selection (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433838">Berkowitz 1990</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section7-1940161211433838">
<title>Content</title>
<p>The substance and timing of a handout photo is a major consideration. Candid moments and environmental portraiture tend to be preferred to add information about the subject. That is, there is a preference for interpretative photographs that appear opportunistic and authentic but that are in fact planned and executed to create a certain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161211433838">Kim and Kelly 2008</xref>). Some editors send their own staff to a newsworthy event to obtain a photograph that fits with their operation’s visual style and tone. When a handout photo is the only one available then an editorial discussion ensues about whether the event is appropriately represented and whether the visual would enhance the story. Innocuous photos are considered to include a politician mainstreeting or delivering a speech, a stock photo used for illustrative purposes, or a local “feel good” issue like the official opening of a playground. All types of news organizations request CEO-style headshots of politicians for election coverage or for general purposes such as slides on television. Photos are rejected if they are deemed to be heavily biased, overly promotional, unrepresentative, if it cannot be confirmed that the event took place, and/or if they are of poor taste.</p>
<p>Journalists cast a wide net for digital handout photos. The Parliament of Canada provides official headshot photos of parliamentarians and some MPs respond to requests to submit photos of themselves in their ridings. Visuals from all sorts of government, legislative, and party online inventories as well as commercial sites such as Facebook and Google Images are perused. The Canadian Forces’ image gallery (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.combatcamera.forces.gc.ca">www.combatcamera.forces.gc.ca</ext-link>) is a major resource, because it offers photos of military operations conducted afar in classified and dangerous situations, including photos of slain or wounded soldiers. Media such as CPAC (the Canadian equivalent of C-SPAN) track down historical photos via the national archives, from museums or international sources. That the Canadian media is more willing to use visuals produced by political offices in other jurisdictions, such as by the White House or 10 Downing Street, is a further indication of the influences of economics, proximity, and access.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1940161211433838">
<title>Online news</title>
<p>News is gravitating to the Web where a photo is expected for each story. Online news is updated throughout the day, including the Web sites of weekly print publications. Handouts assist with competitive pressures to be “Web first,” whereupon the initial version of a report is posted online (J10). News sites and columnists’ blogs tend to have a lower editorial threshold because of frequent deadlines, regular updating, opinionated discussion, and statistics showing that stories with pictures are clicked more often. Even an adamant opponent of Harper’s media tactics admitted that journalists are “desperate” for photos to fill “an insatiable demand for photos online” (J24).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1940161211433838">
<title>Political economy</title>
<p>Changes in media economics mean that handout photos tend to be welcomed by community newspapers, political publications, and online media. The appeal of free visuals is also growing in larger organizations because of changes in newsroom budgets and staffing. Only the largest media organizations can be opposed out of principle. They can afford their own photographers and photos produced by wire services such as Canadian Press, Associated Press, and Reuters, though the former has been losing major clients including CanWest Global in 2007 and Sun Media in 2010, and news agencies are competing with copyright-free news content such as News Canada (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.newscanada.com">www.newscanada.com</ext-link>). Using a professional agency involves negotiation of a reproduction fee, whereas political handout photos can be quickly located in the public domain, archived for future use, and reproduced at no cost without hassle. One editor at a mainstream newspaper conceded that “the economic model is such that the PMO can be an effective wire service” (J3), which saves news operations time and money, helps reporters meet deadlines, and levels the playing field for tiny newsrooms. A reporter at a niche magazine explained that his organization “can’t have a guy taking photos everywhere” (J22) while another observed that “newsroom budgets are shrinking everywhere and people are looking for cheaper options” (J2). One reporter concluded that “as newsrooms shrink there are fewer [photojournalists] to send. In a way governments are filling a need” (J24).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1940161211433838">
<title>Professional integrity</title>
<p>Whether to use a handout photo presents an ethical dilemma for some editors. Supporters tend to work in small community media and/or for Web-based news where there are lower vetting thresholds, though they stand by their ethical judgments. As one explained, “It’s not a source of concern. We handle it the same as other PR content we get every day” (J10). Framing still occurs, as handouts risk being reframed by journalists, such as a photo of a party leader ice skating being used for a column about the leader treading on thin ice. “When there’s so many photos available they can be used for anything,” noted a respondent (J21) who archives handouts for future use.</p>
<p>Image bytes provoke strong opinions among opponents, who tend to be employed by large reputable media companies and/or hold leadership positions in industry associations. One critic said that the publishing of PMO photos is “lazy journalism and propaganda—it’s not news, it’s spin” and complained that “all we get is the happy, happy, love, grip and grin” (J24). Another remarked that journalists are responsible for guarding “against manipulation and leveraging” (J4); a mainstream newspaper editor commented, “We decide what’s news and what’s important. . . . They control [photos], we don’t, so we don’t like it” (J16); and one respondent felt that the press “should doubt everything that we do not know to be true” and was concerned that journalists have shifted from being information filters to facilitators (J20). Yet even news organizations that oppose handouts may use ones deemed to be innocuous; the professional caveat is that any such visual must illustrate a story that was already being pursued.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1940161211433838">
<title>Simplicity</title>
<p>Each day reporters may receive hundreds of electronic news releases from all and sundry. They are more likely to use digital handouts if they are prompted that new photos exist and if they feel that the visuals are easy to reproduce. The decision about whether to open a photo release e-mail often depends on the subject line, whether a story was already being pursued and/or if there is a local angle. Communicating the availability of photos is constrained by low bandwidth, which prevents high-resolution visuals being sent out, though digital technology is quickly evolving. Whether to follow the provided URL depends on the interest generated by the accompanying text. Party strategists are aware that a photography service can simplify matters for the media. One Conservative remarked, “Most journalists don’t attend press conferences or attend scrums. They wait to receive the information electronically so they can view it from the comfort of their desks” (C6).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has added to an emerging body of knowledge about politics and the news media in the digital age. It offers fresh evidence about the ongoing skepticism and contest between politicians, PR staff, and journalists over news selection, pseudo-events, framing, gatekeeping, and priming. In profiling the image management of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, it addresses an information gap about political communication in Canada and adds to a foundation for comparative, international research about digital image bites.</p>
<p>Two overarching theoretical themes have emerged for further research. First, “image bytes” are the new reality confronting visual journalism. Digital handouts reinforce centralized messaging and respond to the economic realities of the information business. When authentic photos are received effortlessly, they address a newsroom’s growing need for new visual content. Second, technology continues to shift the rules of the game. Visual handouts and their Web platforms seem poised to displace other forms of institutional accommodation of the political press and to disrupt the business model of wire services. Journalists are now fighting for the right to document the pseudo-events that were scoffed at in the television age. Meanwhile a serious concern is so subtle that journalists who are busy challenging political authority are likely oblivious: the possible priming effect on them from their exposure to constant visual e-communication pushed by political offices.</p>
<p>Despite the significant concerns resulting from this article, in particular for democratic government in Canada, idealists should be mindful that journalists can pressure change by channeling controversy over government protocols. This for instance resulted in President Obama ending the White House’s practice of photo reenactments after the controversy that emerged when he staged his announcement of bin Laden’s death for pool photographers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1940161211433838">Winslow 2011</xref>). Moreover, over time the public demand for Web 2.0 will grow, and more citizen journalists will scrutinize government business and supplement the watchdog role of the fourth estate—though the news management techniques of PR staff will surely adapt.</p>
