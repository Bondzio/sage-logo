<abstract>
<p>Firms may find competitive adjustment difficult because they are hamstrung by rigid labor market rules. However, such difficulties may also be caused by conflicts between strategic choices in the management of human capital and the opportunities and limitations created by a given regulatory framework. This latter possibility has been almost totally ignored in the debate regarding the urgency and content of labor market reforms in countries whose labor market institutions have been labeled as “rigid” by international experts. This article uses the results of qualitative interviews with Spanish employers to suggest that strategic choices may be far more important in determining the consequences of labor market institutions than is generally recognized. I show that these choices are often the result of beliefs about how labor market institutions <italic>should</italic> work. These findings suggest that supposedly “neutral” calls for greater efficiency in labor market institutions are really arguments about the relative appropriateness of different expectations regarding how firms should pursue adjustment, expectations that are directly related both to the relative balance of power between employers and workers and to the structure of their relationship. In other words, the phrase “politics of labor market reform” should be understood to refer not only to the political consequences of reforms but also to the inherently political nature of the reforms themselves.</p>

<title>I. Introduction</title>
<p>If economic globalization implies a permanent process of competitive adjustment, does it also mean the inevitable degradation of collective rights at work? Employers and their allies frequently argue that the relaxation of limitations on their discretion to manage—the freedom to hire, fire, and redeploy workers as they wish—is indispensable to the future competitiveness of the advanced industrial countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0032329211432132">1</xref></sup> This article takes issue with this claim through an analysis of firms’ competitive adjustment strategies in Spain, a country that is widely considered to have among the most restrictive labor market rules anywhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0032329211432132">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, firms that engage workers collectively are often able to adjust more effectively than those that go to great lengths to limit collective voice at work. These results are surprising for two reasons: first, because Spanish labor regulations are generally considered to be a significant obstacle to competiveness; and second, because most observers believe that Spanish employers have developed a set of relatively effective strategies for evading these regulations, albeit with important negative effects for aggregate social welfare (i.e., high rates of unemployment and precarious work). My research shows that the central obstacle to more effective adjustment strategies in Spain is not the regulatory framework itself but rather how firms choose to respond to the challenges and incentives constituted by it.</p>
<p>The employer choices described in this article are largely motivated by the beliefs of senior managers rather than by the structural position of their respective firms or the composition of their workforces. This is a result with important implications for debates about the reform of labor markets and labor relations systems in Spain and beyond. If employers’ perceptions of labor market rigidities are driven at least as much by beliefs as they are by some objective incompatibility between the dictates of competition and the regulatory framework, then employer demands for regulatory reforms are best understood as ideologically motivated preferences regarding the distribution of power in the workplace. In other words, claims for the technical superiority of one or another labor market reform proposal are inextricably connected to efforts to privilege a particular model of corporate governance and to discredit others. The evidence presented here reminds us that demands for greater employer discretion in deploying human capital are neither neutral nor, critically, indispensable for competitive success.</p>
<p>This article is not the first to question assertions that productivity-stifling rigidities in labor market institutions are to blame for Spain’s exceptionally high rates of temporary employment and unemployment: heterodox economists dispute the claim that Spanish labor market institutions generate obstacles to creating and sustaining quality jobs and competitive firms; jurists defend the principles of collective regulation of the employment relationship and limits on dismissal without cause, which are enshrined in existing rules, and reject reforms proposed by mainstream economists as tantamount to an abandonment of these principles. Although the protagonists in this debate disagree about the “rigidity” of Spanish labor market institutions, none disputes that labor market institutions have a direct impact on firms’ choices of human resource strategy; in other words, that strategic options flow relatively seamlessly from institutions.</p>
<p>Recent work in the comparative political economy of labor markets calls this shared belief into question by demonstrating that labor market actors may reshape or even ignore formal institutions that prove unsuitable to their collective purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0032329211432132">3</xref></sup> How they do so is in no way predetermined by the institutions themselves, but rather depends on their strategic objectives, the balance of power between the actors involved, their beliefs about the nature of their relationships, and their understandings of the formal institutional framework within which they operate. For example, in an interesting corrective to the varieties of capitalism literature,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0032329211432132">4</xref></sup> Herrmann (2008) has demonstrated that pharmaceutical companies are capable of successfully pursuing human resource strategies that go against the grain of the rules and norms attributed to each nation’s labor market institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0032329211432132">5</xref></sup> If German, Italian, and British firms can deploy strategies that contravene the incentives structured by whole constellations of institutions constituting particular varieties of capitalism, surely Spanish employers can design human resource strategies that sidestep supposed institutional rigidities to achieve world-class standards of labor productivity.</p>
<p>Even those who argue that Spanish labor institutions are extraordinarily rigid would not deny that such alternatives exist. However, they would maintain, this misses the point: employers pursuing such strategies are few and far between, precisely because labor market institutions are relatively authoritative. Their critics, meanwhile, would respond that such strategies are rare because of broader problems in Spanish product and service markets.</p>
<p>Indeed, restoring employment and encouraging employers to pursue greater investments in human capital will surely require reforms that extend well beyond the regulation of the Spanish workplace itself. To name just a few: reducing transaction costs associated with opening a business; promoting greater competition in business services; facilitating access to financing, especially for smaller enterprises; and equilibrating the balance between social protection and incentives for the unemployed to improve their employability and willingness to accept work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0032329211432132">6</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the claim that at least some of Spain’s labor market problems lie in the regulation of the workplace itself is hardly controversial.</p>
<p>This article offers a new perspective on this debate using results from interviews with Spanish employers across a range of sectors regarding their beliefs and experiences with labor market institutions. As the evidence presented here suggests, the commonplace that Spanish labor market regulations are extraordinarily rigid deserves far more skeptical scrutiny (and empirical testing) than it has received to date.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0032329211432132">7</xref></sup> This evidence also reveals important limitations in the reform proposals of conventional economists as well as their critics. Despite many points of disagreement, their diagnoses and proposed solutions share a common limitation: an overly narrow view of how labor market regulations shape behavior that leaves little space for such important mechanisms as culture, beliefs, and politics.</p>
<p>As a result, they fail to explain why some firms find current employment regulations to be rigid while other similarly situated employers are able to adjust human resources successfully. Do successful firms outwit poorly designed institutions, or do failing firms refuse to play by the institutional rules? Or, perhaps, do the determinants of success and failure lie entirely outside the realm of labor market institutions? The research presented here suggests that the degree to which participants and observers describe Spanish labor market regulations as rigid depends very much on prior understandings of how labor markets <italic>should</italic> work. These understandings, in turn, shape firms’ choices of human resources strategies, the solutions they develop to the challenges posed by labor market institutions, and critically, their abilities to adjust across the business cycle.</p>
<p>The implications of this research speak to issues of labor market regulation far beyond Spain. If institutions result from the accretion of multiple political battles, then the incentives they offer are highly unlikely to be univocal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0032329211432132">8</xref></sup> And if institutional incentives are ambiguous, employers have to make difficult choices about what to do under conditions of great uncertainty. How they come to these decisions thus becomes critical to understanding how labor market institutions work in practice and what we might expect from any particular set of reforms. Moreover, employer choices have important consequences for the balance of power in the workplace and the distribution of opportunities and rewards in society. The question of how proposed labor market reforms might influence these choices is therefore profoundly political: different reforms privilege different employer choices, which in effect, I will argue, means privileging some beliefs about how institutions should work over others.</p>
<p>The article will proceed as follows. In the next section, I briefly summarize conventional explanations for Spain’s labor market problems, the principles underlying these respective arguments, and the solutions they propose. Section three details the problems facing Spanish employers in their own words, and section four develops an original typology of responses to these problems and the reasons underlying employers’ strategic choices. Section five clarifies the implications of these findings for the Spanish case, examines debates about labor market reforms more generally, and is followed by a brief conclusion.</p>

<title>II. Explaining Poor Labor Market Outcomes</title>
<p>Spain’s unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2011 was an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)–leading 21.3 percent. Unfortunately, Spaniards are quite familiar with such bleak numbers. In 1985, unemployment reached 21.5 percent, falling only modestly to 15.9 percent at the peak of recovery in 1990 and reaching an all-time high of 24.6 percent in 1994. Even after a decade of intensive economic growth that preceded the current crisis, the unemployment rate scarcely fell below 8 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0032329211432132">9</xref></sup> Adding insult to injury, Spain’s rate of temporary employment has also been the highest in the European Union (EU) for more than two decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0032329211432132">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most conventional accounts attribute these problems to flawed labor market institutions. High effective costs for layoffs are assumed to discourage employers from offering workers permanent contracts. Theoretically, employers can dismiss permanent employees with cause (economic, technological, or organizational changes) for 20 days of pay/year worked up to the equivalent of 24 months of salary. In practice, however, judges are reluctant to recognize causal dismissals; as a result, most workers receive 45 days/year up to 42 months of salary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0032329211432132">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the structure of collective bargaining and worker representation in Spanish firms is said to dampen job creation by raising wage costs and complicating companies’ efforts to pursue competitive adjustment through work reorganization rather than through adjustments in employment levels. Collective bargaining in Spain is predominantly organized by sector in separate agreements in each of fifty provinces. Agreements are automatically applied to all workplaces within the bargaining unit and provide a strict floor for firm-level wages and wage structures, job classifications, and working hours. Sectoral bargaining agents for workers are selected on the basis of elections for worker representatives in firms with six or more employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0032329211432132">12</xref></sup> Given that the median voter in these elections has a permanent contract and that employers can reduce employment levels cheaply by not renewing temporary contracts, sectoral bargaining agents appear to have few incentives to engage in wage restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0032329211432132">13</xref></sup> Major changes in workplace organization must be negotiated with worker representatives in the firm. Like dismissal rules, these requirements are also claimed to encourage employers to adjust through employment levels, in this case to avoid lengthy and potentially costly bargaining over work rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0032329211432132">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In sum, the conventional wisdom argues that the combination of expensive dismissals for permanent workers and restrictive rules governing collective relations at the sectoral and firm levels discourage job creation and, in particular, the creation of permanent employment. However, these institutional features of the Spanish labor market are not sufficiently different from those in other countries to explain the country’s singularly high rates of temporary employment.</p>
<p>Early attempts to explain this gap focused on demand-side factors: namely, an employment structure weighted toward low-skilled, easily replaceable jobs in volatile sectors like tourism and construction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0032329211432132">15</xref></sup> In an important correction, Polavieja<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0032329211432132">16</xref></sup> argues that high rates of segmentation between permanent and temporary workers exist across a wide variety of job functions, including those where important levels of firm-specific human capital and high monitoring costs would, according to much theorizing in both economics and sociology, encourage employers to offer more stable contracts in order to motivate worker effort through seniority wages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0032329211432132">17</xref></sup> He attributes this Spanish anomaly to both institutional rigidities as well as structural dynamics—the combination of high levels of legal protections for permanent workers and high unemployment rates. Under these circumstances, employers may efficiently motivate even highly skilled temporary workers by dangling before them the possibility of obtaining a permanent contract.</p>
<p>This theory rests in part on the existence of buffer effects between permanent and temporary workers. Where, as in Spain, temporary employment is high and the cost difference between dismissing temporary and permanent workers is large, permanent workers’ fear of dismissal should be correspondingly low. This buffer is assumed to have a negative impact on permanent workers’ productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0032329211432132">18</xref></sup> As a result, although high turnover of workers with firm-specific assets is costly, these costs may well be less than those of creating additional permanent workers: “[I]f the use of temporary contracts allow employers to extract greater levels of output from their professional workers than standard incentive schemes in long-term employment relationships, then there is simply no reason why temporary employment should be confined to low-skilled jobs.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0032329211432132">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>These findings constitute the point of departure for the labor market reforms proposed by 100 influential economists in April 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0032329211432132">20</xref></sup> They argue that current labor market institutions encourage firms to pursue competitive adjustment through levels of employment, giving rise to both widespread fixed-term contracting and large fluctuations in the unemployment rate as economic conditions change: “…existing regulation induces firms to respond to economic fluctuations through labor turnover, rather than looking for alternatives such as changes in workplace organization.” They maintain that replacing Spain’s numerous, state-defined employment contracts with a single contract offering gradually increasing severance would eliminate the divide between temporary and permanent employees. They also believe a single contract would encourage employers to make bigger investments in human capital, which, in turn, would raise productivity and also make employers more reluctant to dismiss workers. They also propose reforms in collective bargaining rules to make it easier for firm-level negotiators to opt out of clauses from sectoral agreements that are now automatically extended to all firms within the sectoral/geographical bargaining unit. Such a change, they argue, would enable employers to adjust wages and working conditions more quickly, encouraging internal flexibility rather than reliance on employment levels as a key to competitive transformation.</p>
<p>A minority of economists dissents from this conventional wisdom, arguing that Spanish labor regulations are an obstacle only for those employers who choose low-road competitive strategies, and, in any event, such employers are generally able to circumvent much of the formal regulatory framework.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0032329211432132">21</xref></sup> These economists believe that high levels of temporary work and unemployment are the result of the state’s long neglect of industrial policies that would encourage or even oblige employers to invest in higher value-added activities and its underinvestment in social programs (like childcare and aid for dependent persons) that would create an enormous number of well-paying, secure jobs.</p>
<p>A similar debate plays out within the community of Spanish labor and employment law<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0032329211432132">22</xref></sup> scholars; however, the efficiency concerns that dominate the economists’ analyses share the stage with concerns about equity. Labor law’s claim to distinction as a field of theory and practice rests on the contention that contracts between employers and workers are not contracts among equals: labor law’s <italic>raison d’être</italic> is the protection of the weaker party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0032329211432132">23</xref></sup> Efficiency concerns are not absent from Spanish labor law;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0032329211432132">24</xref></sup> however, workers’ right to bargain collectively and restrictions on employers’ abilities to change workers’ job status or working conditions unilaterally without proper cause are understood by most jurists not as “rigidities” but rather as fundamental building blocks for a just and equitable society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0032329211432132">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, then, the minority opinion within the community of labor law scholars is precisely that which argues that efficiency concerns should be the point of departure in policy debates regarding labor market reforms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0032329211432132">26</xref></sup> Most Spanish labor law jurists limit their proposals to measures that will improve the functioning of existing institutions (e.g., incremental reforms in contracting rules, work rules, collective bargaining structures, and procedures for dispute resolution and labor administration) without calling into question the overall balance of power between employers and workers or the basic principles set out in the Spanish Constitution, the Workers’ Statute or the 1985 Organic Law for Union Freedom.</p>
<p>A group of more than 700 labor law scholars, heterodox economists, and sociologists published a response to the 100 economists, arguing, unsurprisingly, that the jobs crisis in Spain had nothing whatsoever to do with labor market regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0032329211432132">27</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Encouraging layoffs without cause or judicial control is not the way to reform a labor market in the context of a new, more productive economic model. …The result would be to generalize the precariousness of work and the reduction of layoff costs. …It is absolutely incongruent to take advantage of the present situation to reduce or eliminate social rights.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Central to this argument is the belief that employers who lay off workers without cause must be penalized. Adherence to this principle explains the radical rejection of the 100 economists’ proposal for a single contract category that can be ended for any reason at all (except for violations of fundamental rights). These scholars also reject the 100 economists’ proposal to facilitate firm-level opt-outs from sectoral collective bargaining agreements on the grounds that this would effectively undermine the central principle of workers’ right to voice in the setting of workplace conditions, particularly given the high number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Spain where there are no workplace representatives.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary debate regarding the future of labor market regulation in Spain is thus complicated by contrasting sets of first principles. Economists do, of course, care about justice and equity, particularly when framed in terms of aggregate welfare; however, they also believe that more efficient outcomes are generally more equitable, and, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, just. Hence, their analysis is primarily concerned with identifying the relative consequences of existing institutions and their theoretical alternatives for both levels of employment and firms’ abilities to respond to market signals. Likewise, most Spanish jurists understand that labor market rules are increasingly important for firm success; yet, they also believe that significant changes to these rules can generate both uncertainty about rights and roles and efficiency-sapping conflict (in firms, in the courts, and in the streets), thus counseling restraint.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0032329211432132">28</xref></sup> This worldview explains jurists’ critical concern with ensuring that extant rights and obligations and the procedural norms that underlie their application are followed, both under the present scheme and in any process of institutional adjustment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0032329211432132">29</xref></sup> It also helps explain why so many economists find the reform proposals of jurists to be lacking in ambition. The law, as Bourdieu has noted, is inherently conservative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0032329211432132">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Differences regarding first principles between the dominant camps within labor economics and labor law, respectively, have a significant impact on their preferences for both the substance and process of reforming labor markets. Substantively, they differ regarding the links between efficiency and equity in the design of labor market institutions; procedurally, they differ regarding the efficacy of radical changes in achieving their preferred ends.</p>
<p>These differences are clearly illustrated by the one issue about which both groups do agree—that the structure of collective bargaining needs to be adjusted to promote greater use of internal rather than external flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0032329211432132">31</xref></sup> Substantively, the critics of the 100 economists demand that unions be fully involved in any firm-level negotiations over decoupling from sectoral agreements, whereas the economists’ proposal is less demanding, particularly with respect to smaller firms. Procedurally, the economists advocate legal reforms with or without the support of the social partners, whereas the counterproposal’s signatories insist that any changes in the rules governing collective bargaining be negotiated. This insistence on a negotiated reform brings to the fore a thorny reality described by a leading labor law scholar:
<disp-quote>
<p>The obstacles to the utilization of agile mechanisms for internal flexibility in our labor relations system today are not to be found substantively in the legal framework…[but rather in] <italic>specific customs</italic> established with the passage of time in collective bargaining agreements. It is precisely in the moment of discussing the adaption of the contents of these agreements to the internal flexibility requirements of the firm where we perceive the largest degree of disagreement between the social interlocutors [leading to a renewed dependence on temporary contracting, outsourcing, and dependent contractors].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0032329211432132">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This article contributes to the debate regarding the appropriate direction of labor market reform in Spain—and beyond—by opening the black box defined by these “customs,” that is, habitual ways of solving regulatory problems in the workplace. In the remaining sections, I offer a stylized description of the various ways Spanish employers address regulatory challenges in pursuing their preferred human resource strategies, identify the origins of these solutions, and discuss their implications.</p>

<title>III. Paths to Human Capital Adjustment: The View of Human Resources Managers</title>
<sec id="section4-0032329211432132">
<title>A. The Research</title>
<p>This paper reports results from approximately thirty formal interviews and more than twenty less structured conversations with senior human resources managers of firms from the following sectors: agribusiness, banking, broadcast media, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, construction, construction materials, food and beverage, transportation, hospitality, logistics, professional services, oil and gas, telecommunications, and telematics. Firm staff in Spain ranged in size from under 200 to several thousand. A few firms had no works council (required by law should workers seek to organize one in firms with fifty or more employees) whereas others were almost entirely unionized (<italic>afiliados</italic>). Some firms had their own collective bargaining agreement (or multiple plant-level agreements), whereas others were subject to sectoral agreements negotiated at the provincial or national level. The sample includes Spanish family-owned firms as well as Spanish and foreign multinational corporations. Corroboration for certain claims made by employers was obtained through three focus groups and many informal discussions held with union leaders, labor inspectors, and small business administrators (<italic>gestorías</italic>).</p>
<p>Interview subjects were identified through their relatively intense participation—and in some cases, leadership—in various forums for the exchange of ideas among human resources and labor relations professionals and through personal contacts. The interviews were organized around a semistructured questionnaire that ensured comparability of answers across the sample while providing extensive opportunity for detailed follow-up around specific issues. Interviews lasted at least an hour and as many as three; approximately 90 percent lasted between ninety minutes and two hours. The sample is not representative of human resources managers in Spain, nor is it in any way statistically significant; it does, however, provide considerable insight into the most innovative thinking and practice regarding the limits and possibilities of the existing regulatory framework—precisely the issue on which this article seeks to shed light.</p>
<p>Subjects were asked to define the challenges their firms face in the context of the current crisis, the ways in which the crisis has altered their human capital strategies, and the central obstacles—both formal and informal—to putting these new strategies into place. The results reveal that firms’ adjustment strategies in the face of the current crisis are significantly influenced by their beliefs regarding how the labor market <italic>should</italic> work, which, in turn, influence their understandings of how existing institutions work in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0032329211432132">
<title>B. The Challenges Facing Spanish Employers</title>
<p>In a nutshell, the current crisis has pushed the firms interviewed for this project to adjust their human capital strategies in two broad ways: workforce reductions (nonrenewal of temporary contracts, layoffs, and outsourcing) and productivity improvements. These employers are seeking to enhance productivity by moderating salaries, by increasing worker motivation, and by augmenting flexibility through changes in workforce deployment. The particular forms taken by these strategies vary notably across the sample, as do the ways they have been implemented and the degree of success obtained. Not surprisingly, all those interviewed complain about labor market rigidities that complicate their efforts. However, the content of these complaints and the degree to which they view these rigidities as a real impediment to firm competitiveness vary markedly. Differences in strategy, implementation approaches, and success rates are closely related to the ways in which managers understand the regulatory framework that governs Spanish labor and employment relations. Differences in these understandings closely track the differences in first principles underlying the debate among economists and labor law scholars regarding labor market reforms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0032329211432132">
<title>C. Workforce Reduction Strategies</title>
<p>Employer concerns about obstacles to pursuing workforce reductions in Spain exhibit far less variety than do those about internal flexibility. Indeed, employer opinions regarding dismissals dovetail with the criticisms leveled by economists: layoffs of longtime permanent workers are expensive, collective layoffs (EREs) take too long to pursue, and certain groups of workers (works council representatives, pregnant women, and mothers of young children) enjoy near-total job protection. Moreover, situations that in theory reduce the costs of layoffs with cause—significant economic losses, changes in technology or workplace organization that make jobs redundant, or poor employee performance—are, in practice, difficult to prove in court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0032329211432132">33</xref></sup> Employers can expect that individual workers and their representatives will denounce claims of legitimate cause in the labor courts, delaying their implementation and introducing a great deal of uncertainty regarding the final outcome; many judges view even carefully documented disciplinary layoffs skeptically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0032329211432132">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>EREs require the ability and willingness to pay indemnizations higher than those established for layoffs with cause; indeed, gaining works council acquiescence to a collective layoff often requires payments that exceed the legally mandated cost of individual layoffs without cause—forty-five days per year up to the equivalent of forty-two months of salary plus a thirty-day mandatory notification period. EREs also involve multiple layers of time-consuming negotiations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0032329211432132">35</xref></sup> In the first instance, employers must seek agreement from the works council, which, in turn, will often prefer to ask the rank and file to approve any negotiated settlement. When works councils dispute claims about the need for layoffs, employers will often look to involve sectoral union officials (<italic>federaciones</italic>) in the negotiations. Opinions regarding the utility of this approach are mixed. On the one hand, most employers have found the federations to be more professional than workplace representatives. Given their contacts with multiple firms, they often have a better understanding of market conditions as well as sectoral trends (and thus, the urgency of the changes sought) and of the relative generosity of the proposed indemnizations.</p>
<p>However, several factors affect the willingness of union officials to support employers’ layoff proposals. First, inter-union battles for worker support can generate bidding wars even at the sectoral level. Many times smaller, more radical unions seize on collective layoffs as an opportunity to gain support by painting the main unions, Comisiones Obreras and Unión General de Trabajadores (CC.OO. and UGT) as timid; as a result, union officials often recognize privately the reasonableness of an employer’s proposals but are reluctant to support them publicly. A related problem frequently emerges at big industrial plants outside large cities. In these cases, employers are vulnerable to political grandstanding by unions seeking to demonstrate their ability to defend local workers’ jobs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0032329211432132">36</xref></sup> Finally, union officials are often reluctant to challenge the positions of works council members for fear of losing their allegiance. Works councils in Spain are legally independent of unions; union officials thus cannot force their local members to accept an employer proposal or even a union counterproposal. Because a union’s institutional privileges (seats at sectoral bargaining tables, control of training funds that are a key component of their operational budgets, access to state subsidies, etc.) are determined by the number of works council delegates who run successfully for their posts under that organization’s colors, union officials legitimately fear that publicly supporting employer proposals rejected by works councils may lead to a loss of delegates in the next round of shop-floor elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0032329211432132">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the complications associated with collective layoffs, many employers prefer to negotiate a series of individual layoffs just below the limits the law sets for collective procedures. This strategy is obviously less politically complicated than an ERE and avoids signaling economic problems to competitors; however, according to employers, it has three drawbacks. First, when the total number of desired layoffs is high, it can slow the process of adjustment even more than an ERE because the number of workers that can be laid off in any three-month period is limited to less than 10 percent of the workforce. Second, while such layoffs need not be negotiated with worker representatives, refusal to do so may well generate considerable ill will and even, in some cases, outright conflict. A third, related risk is that if workers or their representatives denounce these practices to the Labor Inspectorate, the strategy may be declared fraudulent, leading to substantial fines and even a court-imposed obligation to reinstate dismissed workers.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, few of the interviewed managers were particularly concerned with the costs of adjusting staffing levels. As one manager said, voicing a widely echoed sentiment, “Given the employment problems in Spain, free layoffs are neither realistic nor appropriate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0032329211432132">38</xref></sup> Clearly, firms would prefer to pay less for layoffs. At the same time, many managers were quick to point out that the 2002 labor market reform made possible the immediate dismissal (without cause) of all but a handful of specifically protected workers (works council members; mothers of young children) with perfectly predictable costs. For larger firms with the concomitant financial resources, gaining the ability to pursue individual layoffs rapidly and with predictable costs resolved their most important complaint regarding the regulation of dismissals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0032329211432132">39</xref></sup> In fact, several managers commented that the main employer association’s Confederación Española de Organizaciones Empresariales (CEOE) persistent, noisy complaints about layoff costs speak more to the organization’s inability to aggregate more complex employer demands than they do to the actual priorities of most employers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0032329211432132">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Caveats like these aside, layoff costs for workers with substantial tenure are, in comparative terms, relatively expensive. Clearly, one important strategy for reducing layoff costs is to maintain a significant cushion of temporary workers whose contracts are simply not renewed should market conditions change. However, given the similarities of Spanish labor market institutions to several other European countries, the cost differential between dismissing permanent and temporary workers cannot fully explain the country’s exceptionally high temporary employment rate. Thus, when we examine firms’ productivity strategies, we must begin by discussing the role of temporary employment in workforce productivity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0032329211432132">
<title>D. Pathways to Productivity</title>
<p>Productivity concerns are a key factor in many firms’ decisions to rely heavily on temporary contracts. Many of the employers interviewed feel that the regulatory framework (law, collective bargaining rules, and the role of worker representatives in the firm) is far less flexible with respect to internal—or functional—flexibility than it is with respect to external—or contracting—flexibility. Although the formal rules limiting flexibility in job assignments and scheduling for temporary and permanent employees are the same, in practice, temporary employees (especially those who seek to have their contracts renewed) are far more likely to accept changes in working conditions than their permanent counterparts. This also means that temporary employees often perform tasks that are formally reserved for higher salary grades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0032329211432132">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Employers clearly understand that temporary contracting increases—at least in the short term—external, internal, and salary flexibility. However, firms are far less able to measure the productivity costs of temporary employment in terms of motivation, training, and skills, which leads to underestimating its true costs. Gaining proficiency in executing even the most simple of tasks requires time and knowledge of organizational routines and networks. With temporary employment so widespread, many of these workers are clearly performing far more than simple tasks; their productivity is likely to be low without time on the job and training. However, when firms rely heavily on temporary employment, they and their employees have weak incentives to invest in firm-specific skills; moreover, if turnover among temporary workers is high, such investments will often be lost before they can be amortized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0032329211432132">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>With respect to motivation, however, many employers echo the words of Polavieja (2006), arguing that temporary employees are often <italic>more</italic> motivated than permanent workers because they feel more vulnerable than their peers, particularly those with considerable tenure. This brings us to the nub of the problem for enhancing labor productivity in Spain. Having consolidated an approach to human resources management that exploits the divisions between temporary and permanent workers, many firms encounter enormous difficulties when seeking to put alternatives in place. Temporary contracting—first facilitated in 1984 by the Socialists as a way of increasing labor market participation rates for youth, women, and other outsiders—eventually consolidated a peculiarly Spanish policy of adjustment, “flexibility on the margins.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0032329211432132">43</xref></sup> Flexibility on the margins is typically understood as a strategy of external flexibility. However, as we have just seen, temporary contracting is the cornerstone of many employers’ strategies for increasing productivity through <italic>internal</italic> flexibility.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, then, most prescriptive analyses of the Spanish labor market offer proposals for institutional innovations with an eye toward encouraging firms to adopt tactics that do not rely so heavily on the level and composition of employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0032329211432132">44</xref></sup> Often obscured within this debate is the fact that some firms from sectors in which human capital strategies are key to competitiveness manage to succeed across the business cycle without massive recourse to temporary employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0032329211432132">45</xref></sup> This neglect suggests that we need to develop a fuller appreciation of how firm strategies interact with the formal regulatory framework: specifically, it would be helpful to know more about what alternatives exist to the contract-based model of productivity management and how robust each of these alternatives is across the business cycle.</p>
<p>Clarifying whether the relative successes and failures of firms’ human capital adjustment strategies are the product of labor market regulations, strategic choices, or other factors beyond their control is obviously critical for determining the appropriate direction of policy reforms. However, such data is largely absent from the mainstream debate regarding labor market reforms in Spain and elsewhere. If firms’ failures to adjust are perhaps more attributable to strategic choices than to the limitations of the institutional framework in which they operate, then our diagnoses of their competitive problems may be radically misguided. Given that these diagnoses inform proposals for labor market reforms that can significantly affect not only labor market performance but also the distribution of power within the firm and the capacities of workers and employers for collective action, the political—as well as economic—implications of how we define the obstacles to firms’ human capital strategies are enormous.</p>

<title>E. A Typology of Regulatory Solutions to Human Capital Challenges</title>
<p>In order to engage this question, this section offers a stylized description of two broad categories of human capital management strategies and four different kinds of regulatory solutions firms pursue as they seek to put one of these human capital strategies into place. This discussion will reveal that employers’ beliefs about the rigidities of the labor market are very much shaped by the human capital strategies and regulatory solutions they embrace and their adequacies or limitations across the entire business cycle. In many cases, criticisms of the regulatory framework tell us more about a firm’s failure to adapt its regulatory strategy to new economic realities and institutional incentives than about the regulatory framework itself.</p>
<p>Many of the rigidities that employers complain about are in fact rigidities of their own creation: during the recent decade of growth, many Spanish firms were able to pursue their preferred human capital strategy while paying little regard to the underlying logic of formal labor market institutions. Having established strategies that are difficult to sustain across the business cycle, it is not surprising that many managers understand their difficulties to be a product of the regulatory framework itself rather than previous management decisions. However, the supposed rigidities of the Spanish regulatory framework do not prevent other firms from putting in place significant productivity improvements through measures other than contract (external) flexibility, even when doing so necessitates important corrections in their human capital strategies.</p>
<p>This observation suggests an important limitation of extant models of human resources strategies. Typologies of human resources strategies in business studies have evolved toward an ever more fine-grained parsing of strategies according to underlying competitive strategies, the value and scarcity of employees, the character of the employer-employee relationship, and the like.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0032329211432132">46</xref></sup> However, because most of these typologies are developed from empirical research or metaresearch in Anglo-Saxon, lightly regulated environments, they underestimate the importance of regulatory challenges to successful human capital management in other contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0032329211432132">47</xref></sup> To capture the primordial importance of the regulatory environment for Spanish firms’ human capital strategies, I take a different approach. Rather than develop a highly differentiated typology of strategies, I organize firms’ human resources objectives into just two categories—control or commitment. Following Arthur (1994), control strategies are those that manage people through the establishment of defined rules and objectives and close monitoring to ensure compliance. Commitment strategies are those that use human resource policies to encourage employees to identify with organizational goals and to provide them with the skills and tools they need to make decisions that advance the firm’s interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0032329211432132">48</xref></sup> This simplification allows me to focus attention on the variety of regulatory solutions pursued by firms seeking to put in place one or the other of these strategies.</p>
<sec id="section9-0032329211432132">
<title>Four regulatory solutions to support human resource strategies</title>
<p>I label the four regulatory solutions identified in the course of this research “sweating,” “compliance,” “individualization,” and “productivity coalitions.” Each solution defines a set of human resources practices that are designed to avoid, comply with, or leverage regulatory institutions (labor laws, collective bargaining agreements, worker representatives in the firm) in order to achieve greater productivity through compensation policies, internal flexibility, and motivation. The productivity-enhancing tactics associated with each of these solutions are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0032329211432132">Table 1</xref> below.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0032329211432132">49</xref></sup> Sweating and compliance are regulatory solutions for firms whose human resources policies are built around a control strategy. Firms that seek to elicit greater worker commitment deploy individualization and productivity coalitions. Most firms combine elements from more than one of these regulatory solutions; however, most of their personnel and labor relations practices can be captured by just one. Each correlates with a set of beliefs about how the Spanish labor market functions and thus reflects firms’ particular preferences regarding labor market reforms.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p><italic>Sweating</italic> describes a low-road solution of increasing productivity through a variety of formally illegal but widely practiced tactics. Companies increase wage productivity by paying as little as possible, which can be achieved in several ways. Wages can be held in check by misusing temporary contracts, both by assigning temporary workers functions superior to the contracted classification and by potentially evading bonuses linked to job tenure. Firms also get more for less by paying workers a portion of their salary off the books—often achieving significant reductions in social security taxes—a practice that is common though obviously difficult to quantify.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0032329211432132">50</xref></sup> Finally, firms can push employees to work extra hours for little or no additional compensation, a practice that is widespread in many smaller and not a few larger firms.</p>
<p>Under the sweating model, internal flexibility (functional flexibility, workday flexibility) is achieved by avoiding clearly demarcated job definitions and by communicating the expectation that workers fulfill a variety of tasks as assigned. Workers are motivated to be more productive by the pervasive insecurity of their positions (layoffs of temporary workers or permanent ones with brief tenure are not expensive, especially when the formal salary on which indemnizations are based is very low) and by occasional offers of extra pay or better working conditions (e.g., better work assignments and schedules).</p>
<p>The sweating solution, particularly when it is applied in small firms, is hard to police from the outside, in Spain or anywhere else. However, the model is highly dependent on the existence of a strong buyer’s market for labor. In effect, recourse to sweating is the expression of an employer’s market power over and against formal institutions. Outside of large workplaces where labor inspections are relatively frequent, the application of formal Spanish labor market regulations rests mainly on the willingness of workers or their representatives to denounce illegal practices: where workers lack knowledge of their rights or believe that making a claim might entail the loss of their job in a context where few alternatives exist, they are unlikely to go to the authorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0032329211432132">51</xref></sup> Finally, if workers view certain practices that comprise the sweating model as normal, local worker representatives, where they exist, are also unlikely to denounce their employers because doing so may well create conflicts with their colleagues.</p>

<p>Sustaining the sweating solution is more difficult when the labor market turns in workers’ favor. This may be due either to general market conditions (higher demand for labor) or because workers’ specific skills are scarce. In the latter case, sweating may coexist with other types of employment relationships, depending on the type of worker involved. Under these conditions, sweating is effectively thwarted by labor market dynamics that give workers sufficient power either to demand that the law be adhered to or simply to change employers. Sweating is also more difficult to maintain as a firm grows, as unions and regulators are more likely to challenge such practices. However, decentralized operations and the absence of a works council may extend the viability of sweating by reducing the likelihood of random inspections and formal grievance claims. Employers who lose the market power that undergirds sweating practices discover that the regulatory framework in Spain does indeed have some bite, either through direct experience or, more likely, through conversations with other employers and, especially, financial and legal advisors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0032329211432132">52</xref></sup> In many cases, the next step is the adoption of a solution I have labeled compliance.</p>
<p>The <italic>compliance</italic> solution is deployed largely by firms whose managers view personnel management as a broadly administrative matter and labor primarily as a cost to be contained. These perspectives follow seamlessly from an understanding of work organization as, in large measure, a technical problem to be solved through top-down control. For such firms, productivity is obtained by managing pay carefully—both to reduce costs and to align workers’ incentives with those of the firm. These firms are often obsessively conscious of the formal regulatory framework—the opportunities it generates as well as the limits it imposes. Firms with compliance-oriented HR policies complain bitterly about limitations on variable pay in collective bargaining agreements, unfair competition from smaller firms that are able to sweat their workers, and, above all, their inability to achieve internal flexibility without giving up something in return in sectoral, local, or individualized bargaining.</p>
<p>The current crisis means that many companies are ill-disposed, if not financially unable, to link individual or collective side payments to programs of work reorganization that fall under the definition of “substantial modifications” in the Workers’ Statute and thus may require either the assent of each affected worker or an agreement with worker representatives. At the same time, job insecurity generated by the crisis has sometimes increased workers’ willingness to accept changes without compensation when they believe that greater productivity and better work organization are truly keys to firm survival or their continuity in their jobs. However, for many firms that pursue compliance solutions, this argument is a tough sell: where the workplace culture has long held that firm strategy is strictly a management concern, employees are often skeptical about claims that work must be radically reorganized if the firm is to survive. This research documents that workers and their representatives often reject changes to pay, working conditions, and work organization even when jobs, including their own, are on the line.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0032329211432132">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The limitations of the compliance solution are the mirror image of those identified for sweating. In each case, when economic conditions are favorable for employers, the solution offers a relatively straightforward path to greater internal and external flexibility. Compliance provides flexibility when economic growth is strong and firms have the resources to pay for it, whereas sweating works best when economic growth is low, jobs are scarce, and workers feel they have no better alternatives. In boom times, firms that practice sweating may be successful in moving toward compliance. On the other hand, employers who practice compliance may be tempted to pursue sweating when adversity strikes, but they will, at a minimum, face resistance from those workers whose positions are most consolidated—along with the possibility of complaints to the labor inspection service and fines. The formal dimensions of the Spanish regulatory framework (law, collective bargaining agreements, labor administration, and jurisprudence) do indeed pose obstacles to economic restructuring for firms that pursue compliance solutions as they seek to implement control-based human resources strategies.</p>
<p>Compliance is not, however, the only alternative to sweating pursued by Spanish employers; others take seriously the idea that human capital strategies can be a source of lasting competitive advantage, and that more committed and better qualified workers deliver superior results. Indeed, some of these firms have abandoned the compliance strategy precisely because they have discovered that it imposes substantial risks when firms face economic difficulties. We now turn to these alternatives.</p>
<p>The <italic>individualization</italic> solution finds its inspiration in Anglo-style human resources management. Managers in these firms often describe union leaders and works council members as fossilized “dinosaurs” committed to unmasking the supposed threat to workers’ rights contained in each and every employer initiative. They generally believe that the interests of motivated, capable workers can and should be aligned with those of the employer; for them, formal institutions of worker representation are nothing more than an obstacle to a more effective partnership between firms and their individual members. Indeed, more than one proponent of this approach has declared that, “the employees’ real representative here is the human resources department.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0032329211432132">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>How do such firms define and navigate the obstacles to productivity they find in the existing regulatory framework? Whereas firms that adopt the compliance solution look to manipulate the institutional framework to their advantage, those that opt for individualization seek to reconstitute the terms of the employment relationship outside the framework of formal institutional rules. For example, many of these firms have largely renounced the use of temporary contracts: they believe that a generalized policy of permanent contracting from day one demonstrates the firm’s commitment to employee development and preempts the negative motivational consequences frequently associated with the change in status when workers move from temporary to permanent contracts. Similarly, many recent well-financed start-up ventures, some of which now employ hundreds of people, have made avoiding the creation of a works council a major priority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0032329211432132">55</xref></sup> These firms select for fit as well as skill, rejecting candidates who identify with unions or fail to embrace a culture of meritocracy.</p>
<p>Where there is no works council, wage and internal flexibility are largely achieved through negotiations with individuals or work groups in which the sectoral collective bargaining agreement sets an effective floor for pay and an (at-best) loose reference for professional categories and working hours.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0032329211432132">56</xref></sup> Wages are typically somewhat higher than the sectoral collective bargaining agreement, and variable pay, whether collective or individual, may sometimes be a significant component of total compensation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0032329211432132">57</xref></sup> These firms generally invest far more in training and development and nonwage benefits than those pursuing the compliance strategy, and they often devote considerable effort to identifying and grooming key personnel.</p>
<p>Where there is a works council, firms often adopt a blended strategy that mixes individualization wherever possible with compliance for many rank-and-file workers. Over the long years of economic growth during the 2000s, such firms tended to focus most of their human resources budgets on programs for their most valued professional staff. Negotiations with works councils were largely limited to discussions around issues where their input or consent was required by law. At the same time, many firms dedicated considerable effort to identifying activities that might “keep the works council busy and distracted.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0032329211432132">58</xref></sup> Although such tactics may also be seen in some firms that pursue compliance, individualizers took their efforts a step further: they sought to isolate the works council and undermine its legitimacy with professional staff and (at a minimum) more skilled blue-collar workers through aggressive employee communications programs, individualized raises and nonconsolidating bonus payments, individualized training and development opportunities, and other types of social benefits. When, despite employers’ efforts to decouple the employment relationship from the formal institutional framework, workers or works councils resisted changes in hours and work organization by asserting their legal right to reject certain unilateral changes (<italic>modificaciones sustanciales</italic>), employers frequently responded by negotiating individual or group compensation to achieve their objectives. As we shall see in a moment, this particular aspect of the individualization solution would prove to be particularly vulnerable among firms whose economic fortunes took a turn for the worse with the current crisis.</p>
<p>The final regulatory solution observed in this study is the development of <italic>productivity coalitions</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0032329211432132">59</xref></sup> Productivity coalitions can be found in a broad variety of firms with all types of workforces. What these firms share is a management philosophy that places a premium on negotiation and transparency. In most cases, their human resources directors are lawyers or labor relations specialists; in others, labor relations are managed by a dedicated specialist who commands a great deal of authority both within the human resources area and with the heads of business units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0032329211432132">60</xref></sup> In every case, the human resources area has a strong voice in the executive boardroom.</p>
<p>The managers of these firms believe that “unions and works councils have a legitimate role to play in society and in the firm.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0032329211432132">61</xref></sup> This is not to say that they find it easy to work with works councils or union officials. Like their counterparts who are pursuing other solutions, these managers complain that worker representatives are often unreasonable in their demands and poorly prepared to understand the realities of the context in which the firms operate. However, unlike most of their counterparts, they believe that their mandate includes the development of workplace representatives’ understanding of the business, and, critically, ensuring that all line managers have the ability to engage these representatives.</p>
<p>These firms drive productivity by adjusting pay to reflect results, by frequently reorganizing tasks and work processes, and by motivating workers at all levels of the organization to be engaged in the search for ever-greater productivity. Stated in this fashion, the solution does not appear so different from that of individualization. Indeed, all of these firms pursue some variant of individualization with their senior professional staff. At the same time, however, they reject the notion that mere compliance is an effective approach to managing rank-and-file workers and their representatives.</p>
<p>The firms that build productivity coalitions share financial and operational data with workers and their representatives and dedicate substantial time and resources to ensuring that everyone (at least those on the works council) understands it. Although many larger firms offer operational managers a simplified introduction to the formal rules governing workplace relations, those pursuing productivity coalitions train operational managers how to engage worker representatives and build their support—or at least obtain their acquiescence—for the productivity-enhancing innovations they wish to implement.</p>

<title>IV. The Political Implications of Strategic Choices in Human Capital Management</title>
<p>Like their counterparts who pursue individualization, managers committed to building productivity coalitions aim to reconstitute the employment relationship; however, they look to do so within rather than outside of the formal institutional rules that govern the Spanish workplace. Are these simply alternative paths to greater productivity, or might there be reason to believe that one is superior to the other? Once again, we can ask how these solutions perform across the business cycle. As we saw above, neither sweating nor compliance appears to be a viable preferred solution in the Spanish context: the internal logic of each is likely to lead to its collapse at some point across the business cycle. What about individualization and productivity coalitions?</p>
<p>During our interviews, the most frequent solution we observed featured individualization for senior managers and a mix of both individualization and compliance practices with respect to rank-and-file workers, particularly in firms with works councils. On multiple occasions, managers from these firms claimed that the current economic crisis revealed serious shortcomings in the extant regulatory framework. Their complaints were largely focused around the obstacles to imposing unilaterally significant changes in work organization. Employers are no longer willing to purchase greater internal flexibility and have begun to argue that internal flexibility and changes in the structure of pay are critical to restoring profitability and saving jobs. On many occasions, however, workers and their representatives have resisted the changes employers seek by pulling the institutional levers provided by the existing legal framework (restrictions on unilateral changes in work organization [<italic>modificaciones sustanciales</italic>]; the automatic renewal of any collective bargaining clause that is not renegotiated [<italic>ultraactividad</italic>]; etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0032329211432132">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Firms that had attempted to build productivity coalitions were far less likely to voice these complaints. Every firm who pursued this solution noted that it required a long-term commitment to dialogue and education with workers and their representatives, patience in implementing changes, and a willingness to renounce certain objectives in order to reach consensus. At the same time, the longer firms sought to build productivity coalitions, the more goodwill they generated with workers—and the easier it became to make drastic changes quickly when the circumstances required it. None of these firms was totally satisfied with the regulatory framework, but all were convinced that it did not keep them from implementing the reforms they needed to compete effectively without relying on external flexibility alone. Indeed, three firms in our sample actually switched from individualization to a productivity coalition approach as the economic crisis unfolded—precisely because they were concerned about the robustness of compliance-oriented relations with their works councils at a time in which substantial restructuring was likely to be necessary.</p>
<p>Employers who pursue individualization generally do so not only because it is the dominant approach to managing human capital today, but also because they believe it is the solution that best enables them to overcome the rigidities they find in Spanish labor market regulations. As a rule, they define evading regulatory restrictions on managerial discretion as a central objective in human resources management and the key to workforce productivity, an argument underlying the reform proposals of mainstream economists. Managers in firms pursuing individualization were also likely to believe that the key to business success was the alignment of individual incentives of senior professionals with those of the firm. Most of their training budgets were targeted toward senior staff; productivity measures for rank-and-file personnel were often quite underdeveloped.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0032329211432132">63</xref></sup> These managers frequently defined worker representatives as “impossible to work with,” and as “only interested in themselves and totally disconnected from their colleagues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0032329211432132">64</xref></sup> Thus, when they discover that, in difficult times, individualization fails to offer a way around regulations, they find their prior assumptions about the labor market confirmed.</p>
<p>By contrast, employers who have built productivity coalitions find that they often are able to achieve the flexibility they need to maintain their edge in a rapidly changing competitive environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0032329211432132">65</xref></sup> Most of these employers believe, like most labor law scholars, that the Spanish regulatory framework ultimately requires firms with formal worker representatives to bargain in good faith and to seek win-win solutions for firms and their employees. They may not necessarily believe that this is the best way to regulate the employment relationship, but they are skeptical that a politically realistic alternative exists. Moreover, they often believe that radical changes in the current regulatory framework may well generate more problems than they would solve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0032329211432132">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>What are the origins of these differences in beliefs? This survey is not sufficiently large to offer a definitive answer. However, the findings suggest a number of hypotheses. The most important source of different beliefs among our interview subjects appears to be education. Human resources directors who hold undergraduate degrees in law are more likely to pursue productivity coalition solutions than those who did not study law. These differences are reinforced by the nature of the managers’ postgraduate education. Productivity coalitions are often found in firms led by managers who studied in specialized human resources and labor relations masters programs in Spain; in rare exceptions the managers only hold an MBA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0032329211432132">67</xref></sup> Productivity coalitions are particularly unlikely when the manager holds an MBA from an internationally prestigious program (whether the school was in Spain or abroad).</p>
<p>These results are not entirely surprising. Law school curriculums in Spain expose students to the principles defended by most labor law scholars as well as the formal institutional rules that encourage productivity coalitions. The faculties of most specialized masters programs in labor relations and human resources in Spain include a significant number of labor law scholars and professionals with substantial experience in collective bargaining, health and safety rules (which stipulate a major role for worker representatives in Spain), and conflict resolution. In programs more focused on labor relations, union officials, labor inspectors, and employer representatives are also likely to offer courses. Many of these professionals are sympathetic to the productivity coalition solution; at a minimum, they convey to their students that the Spanish regulatory framework makes managing collective employment relations a critical component of any successful human resources strategy. These academic and professional specializations—and the contents of the courses these professionals teach—are entirely absent from generalist business education at more elite programs in Spain and elsewhere. Those who did not study law and later took an MBA at one of these programs will have learned approaches to human resources management that are highly influenced by the individualistic, anti-union perspective that dominates the major U.S. business schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0032329211432132">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>This education effect appears to be robust across sectors, although a number of managers in the Spanish units of Anglo multinationals reported extreme difficulties in getting their global managers to appreciate the benefits of building productivity coalitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0032329211432132">69</xref></sup> Among Spanish companies, sectoral differences were observed according to the degree to which flexible organization has been historically important for tasks carried out by rank-and-file workers. It is not surprising that worker representatives’ capacities for organizing industrial action in a context of substantial formal rights to voice generated a culture of negotiation in firms where flexible work organization was key to competitiveness. Nevertheless, the limits of these sectoral differences—in particular, the existence of productivity coalition solutions in firms without a long history of labor conflict, a strong union presence, and activities far removed from traditional industries—suggest that beliefs inspired by education and workplace experiences are critical to explaining the variety of regulatory solutions observed across the sample.</p>
<p>Given that the vast majority of executives in Spain have studied in U.S.-inspired MBA programs, it is not surprising that the HR managers we interviewed described their senior management teams as being supportive of compliance or individualization solutions. However, we found that several HR managers were able to pursue productivity coalitions despite the preferences of senior management.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0032329211432132">70</xref></sup> This is likely attributable to the fact that decisions about the management of labor relations are often understood to be broadly technical matters left to specialists. If such specialists have a background in law, they are more likely to pursue productivity coalitions as they look to achieve the objectives set out for them by senior management. However, their ability to implement such solutions depends not only on their beliefs but also on their influence within the firm and, especially, their ability to incorporate training in labor relations (especially the management of relations with worker representatives) into development programs for mid-level managers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0032329211432132">71</xref></sup></p>

<title>Alternative explanations</title>
<p>While very small firms can pursue sweating or individualization without much fear of serious regulatory problems, sweating is increasingly less viable as firm size increases. One of the central questions underlying this research then is why firms choose the regulatory solutions they do once they are too large to easily evade enforcement. My research reveals that the beliefs of key personnel overseeing the design and implementation of human capital policies—beliefs that are rooted in their educational and professional experiences—are perhaps the decisive factors in explaining the observed variety in employers’ regulatory solutions. In this section, I briefly review a number of alternative explanations.</p>
<p>A first alternative is that employers shift among regulatory solutions depending on structural factors such as changes in the business cycle or the nature of the challenges facing their particular sector. When times are bad, firms can impose compliance solutions while they count on the discipline of the market and recourse to temporary employment to minimize worker resistance. When labor markets turn favorable for workers, firms can shift to individualization strategies, purchasing the flexibility they need.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0032329211432132">72</xref></sup> One important finding of my research is that some firms that pursue this combination of compliance and individualization have shifted toward productivity coalition solutions in the face of extreme competitive difficulties. When they are unable to gain sufficient productivity through a combination of individualized negotiations with insiders and recourse to temporary employment, these employers have sought to transform the employment relationship through negotiated adjustment with worker representatives and more transparent communication with their entire staff. However, not all firms in such situations choose to pursue productivity coalitions. Moreover, my results reveal no consistent trends across sectors, with similarly placed firms in the same sector pursuing a variety of regulatory solutions.</p>
<p>Differences in workforce characteristics are another possible explanation for the variety of regulatory solutions observed. One commonly posited source of differences in firm strategies is the level of unionization. High rates of affiliation imply closer communication between workers and their local representatives, which, in principle, encourages greater sensitivity to individual workers’ concerns as well as greater capacity for organizing collective resistance to unilateral, employer-imposed changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0032329211432132">73</xref></sup> However, variations in affiliation rates do not dovetail closely with the regulatory solutions firms pursue. Some employers with well-organized and significantly unionized workforces seek to pursue productivity coalitions as a central tool for competitive adjustment, whereas other similarly placed firms label worker representatives “irresponsible” (and much worse) and do all they can to minimize their influence over employer decisions and their coworkers.</p>
<p>How might we explain this result? First, prior to the current crisis, both individualization and compliance strategies were relatively effective regulatory solutions for most larger employers. A combination of temporary contracting and the purchasing of whatever additional flexibility they required enabled most employers to adjust successfully while maintaining arm’s-length relations with worker representatives, regardless of the overall degree of workforce organization. Second, Spanish workers join unions for reasons that generally have little to do with voice at work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0032329211432132">74</xref></sup> In a country with high rates of unemployment and precarious work, opportunities for permanent contracts are particularly scarce for youth in general and low- and medium-skilled workers in particular. Employers have often taken advantage of this fact in highly unionized firms by delegating to unions considerable control over hiring in exchange for their acquiescence to wage moderation or changes in shop-floor organization or working hours. Workers who seek to obtain employment for family and friends may often find unionization to be indispensible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0032329211432132">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Affiliation decisions are also frequently related to workplace conflicts, particularly layoffs. Where works councils are relatively innocuous bodies in firms that have pursued compliance or individualization strategies, worker representatives may not be up to the task of negotiating layoffs or significant changes in workplace organization. The conflicts and insecurity such situations generate are an important opportunity for sectoral union officials to gain a foothold in firms and, potentially, to attract new members. These types of union interventions often prove helpful in defusing tensions and may offer a bridge toward the building of productivity coalitions. Again, however, increases in unionization surrounding staff reductions do not automatically drive changes in employers’ choices of regulatory solutions.</p>
<p>Another potential factor favoring the emergence of productivity coalitions is the type of collective bargaining agreement that governs firm-level relations. The approximately 10 percent of workers whose employment relationship is governed by a firm-level collective bargaining agreement are overwhelmingly located in larger firms where affiliation rates are often much higher than average.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0032329211432132">76</xref></sup> Does the existence of a firm-level agreement imply a greater propensity to pursue productivity coalitions?</p>
<p>There is no reason to believe this is the case. Until the reform of collective bargaining in 2011, sectoral collective bargaining agreements could provide obligatory content for firm-level agreements regarding critical questions such as contracting and job categories, geographic mobility, and the like.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0032329211432132">77</xref></sup> Since 1994 employers have been able to modify the distribution of working hours, shifts, compensation systems, work organization, and productivity targets as stipulated in a collective bargaining agreement, a formal or informal pact, or by custom if (and only if) changes can be negotiated successfully with the works council or subsequently approved through mediation or arbitration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0032329211432132">78</xref></sup> If the changes affect individual arrangements, workers have recourse in the courts and the right to an indemnization of up to nine months salary if they refuse the change. Opting out of established wage rates has been theoretically negotiable but in reality extremely difficult to implement except in the most drastic of circumstances.</p>
<p>As a consequence, firm-level collective bargaining agreements offer employers few advantages over sectoral agreements. In fact, many firm-level agreements originate in labor conflicts motivated by workers’ demands for pay or working conditions that improve on sectoral agreements. Moreover, rules governing the renewal of collective bargaining agreements may actually discourage collaboration. Spanish labor law requires the automatic renewal of any collective bargaining clauses (including significant changes in workplace organization and job assignments) when both sides do not agree to renegotiate. As a result, even local worker representatives in highly organized workplaces have few incentives to initiate dialogue with employers regarding the transformation of workplace organization. In such a context, it is not surprising that employers have often preferred to restrict collective discussions over workplace changes to those few issues that cannot be handled any other way (i.e., through unilateral imposition of changes or through individual side payments).</p>
<p>Some employers indicated that they preferred sectoral collective agreements to firm-level ones because they believed that workplace conflict would be reduced when workers and their local representatives were less directly involved in negotiations. Although such firms may prefer to negotiate changes with respect to the sectoral agreement individually, the magnitude of the desired changes may make this approach impossible (particularly when the changes would affect significant numbers of workers or deliver more flexibility than permitted in the sectoral agreement). Moreover, with issues such as the size of salary increases and overall hours at least partially resolved at the sectoral level, these firms may find it easier to negotiate other issues such as changes in work organization with local representatives; in other words, a case can be made that productivity coalitions may be easier to negotiate when the relevant collective bargaining agreement is sectoral rather than local.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0032329211432132">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>If productivity coalitions are not clearly linked to affiliation rates or the level of collective bargaining, perhaps they are related to employee skill levels? The results do not support this hypothesis. Regardless of skill level, firms that reach a certain size face significant regulatory obstacles to pursuing unilateral control or commitment strategies at some point in the business cycle. I have identified productivity coalitions in low-skill sectors such as food and beverage and construction and in high-skill sectors like engineering, banking, and pharmaceuticals. I have also identified firms in all of these sectors that fail to pursue such solutions even when faced with severe competitive pressures and acknowledged shortcomings in internal labor flexibility.</p>
<p>Finally, the emergence of productivity coalitions could be linked to the age of the firm. Perhaps younger firms have been able to build workplace cultures that are more integrative than the paternalistic or arm’s-length cultures that have long dominated Spanish workplaces?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0032329211432132">80</xref></sup> Anecdotal evidence (including two firms in this study) suggests that a small number of businesses created from the 1990s onward have sought to prevent the creation of works councils or union sections in their firms through a combination of careful selection processes and an intensive commitment to human resources management techniques. Such employers avoid publicizing their efforts to avoid the attention of unions and, perhaps, competitors. However, the small number of firms of which we have direct knowledge have relatively highly skilled, youthful workforces and have managed to weather the current crisis reasonably well. It is not clear whether such strategies are robust enough to withstand a protracted crisis in which workers are asked to do more and more in exchange for less and less.</p>

<title>The political significance of employer beliefs</title>
<p>The differences in employers’ interpretations of labor market obstacles and in their preferred solutions to these challenges as described in this article have broad political implications. Almost all observers agree that Spain’s OECD-leading rate of temporary employment is a drag on productivity and a potential threat to political and social stability. However, the policy prescriptions that follow from the belief that high rates of precarious employment are a product of excessive protections for permanent workers are quite different from those implied by the belief that precarious employment is the product of employers’ ideologically motivated reluctance to engage worker representatives sufficiently. Similarly, empirical studies demonstrate that Spanish firms have failed to pursue internal flexibility with the intensity of many of their European counterparts, leading to an overreliance on adjustment through levels of employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0032329211432132">81</xref></sup> Again, the policy prescriptions that follow from this data will vary significantly depending on whether one views this as a problem of legal rigidity or of employers’ reluctance to negotiate.</p>
<p>This article’s exploration of the limits of four different regulatory solutions across the business cycle implies an alternative hypothesis regarding the causes of high temporary employment in Spain, one with important policy implications. As we have seen, only productivity coalitions have proven to be a robust solution across sectors and business cycles. However, only a small minority of firms has pursued this strategy until now. In times of rapid economic growth, most firms were able to achieve adequate levels of financial performance through compliance or individualization (or some combination of the two). The cushion of temporary employment on which both of these solutions rests was made possible by the 1984 labor market reforms put in place by the Socialist government of Felipe González. This reform greatly facilitated temporary contracting while leaving legal restrictions on internal flexibility largely in place. In 1994, the last González government passed a new round of labor market reforms that significantly expanded the possibilities for negotiated internal flexibility. Critically, however, the Spanish economy was already recovering from the crisis of the early 1990s at the time of this reform and continued to grow at a rapid pace until the current crisis brought the boom to a screeching halt in the second half of 2007.</p>
<p>From 1984 to the present, temporary employment in Spain remained extraordinarily high in cross-national terms. This anomaly appears less surprising when this timeline of policy reforms is mapped against the evolution of economic cycles and the human capital strategies described in this article. From 1984 to 1994, the productivity coalition solution was significantly constrained by labor market rules that limited internal flexibility. By the time these legal restrictions were relaxed ten years later, most firms were already adept at finding ways to gain internal and wage flexibility through external flexibility (i.e., temporary contracting). Although these strategies may not have been the most efficient, the productivity costs involved were clearly acceptable for most firms during the long boom that was already nascent in 1994. As a result, the options for negotiated flexibility solutions that the 1994 reform put in place went largely unused outside that small minority of firms that has pursued productivity coalitions.</p>
<p>Now that the productivity costs implied by the interaction between the extant regulatory framework and the dominant regulatory solutions pursued by Spanish firms are clearly too high to bear, the question of regulatory reform is once again front and center. Is there an alternative to the neoliberal prescription of more relaxed contracting rules for all workers, both permanent and temporary, and greater employer discretion with respect to internal work rules?</p>
<p>The success of productivity coalitions suggests that such an alternative already exists. This argument is reinforced by recent analyses of the German case, which show that legal restrictions on external flexibility and political opposition to pursuing more orthodox neoliberal reforms have pushed employers and workers to find new, more flexible solutions internally. Critically, the solutions that have restored German economic growth were forged in the context of a long crisis that gave rise to a rapid increase in temporary employment, not unlike the one in which Spain now finds itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0032329211432132">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>What would happen if the institutional incentives favoring productivity coalitions in Spain were to be overturned? Given that ideological opposition to this strategy is extremely widespread within the Spanish managerial class, such regulatory solutions would likely disappear from all but the most highly unionized firms. If comprehensive reforms of labor market rules were to generate a substantial increase in employment, this might, on average, be a good deal for Spanish workers. However, such an outcome is far from certain; and, as the research presented in this article makes clear, such reforms would almost certainly undermine the possibilities for industrial democracy in most Spanish workplaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0032329211432132">83</xref></sup> Spanish employers, as this research has shown, <italic>can</italic> pursue competitive adjustment without evading the incentives to dialogue that are embodied in existing regulations. That many choose not to do so is a weak argument for the radical reform of existing institutions, both in Spain and anywhere else where the institutional protections for workers’ rights are currently under broad assault.</p>

<title>V. Conclusion</title>
<p>The variety of strategic solutions described in this article speaks eloquently to the fact that human capital strategy choices are driven not only by the quest for competitive advantage but also by beliefs about how the world of work can and should be organized—beliefs about the appropriate balance of power as well as the character of the relationship between employers and workers. These beliefs play a powerful role in determining how employers understand and respond to institutional incentives; that is, they are a critical intervening variable between formal rules and the politics of work in the firm. This fact is particularly relevant in densely regulated labor markets like Spain’s and those of most other Continental European countries. Here, the success of a firm’s human capital strategy depends not only on its ability to motivate workers but also on its robustness in the face of institutional obstacles across the business cycle.</p>
<p>Given the limits of the sample and the qualitative nature of the survey, this article does not pretend to draw conclusions regarding the degree to which specific institutional reforms may improve the aggregate performance of the Spanish labor market. It does provide, however, a useful correction to arguments that Spanish labor market institutions condemn firms to uncompetitively low levels of labor productivity. Spanish firms’ excessive reliance on temporary contracting as a strategy for achieving internal—as well as external—flexibility is not only a response to institutional incentives but also a product of their beliefs about the obstacles to obtaining internal flexibility through other means.</p>
<p>Because institutional incentives are often ambiguous, and even contradictory, beliefs play a critical role in guiding actors’ responses to the rules and regulations that are intended to shape their behavior. It is therefore vital that we understand their origins. My research suggests that education can play a crucial role in shaping employers’ beliefs regarding labor market institutions and, thus, their responses to the human capital challenges they face.</p>
<p>The debate about labor market rigidities in Spain is thus not merely, or even primarily, a technical one: it is a battle for advantage in markets and in politics; it is a contest among contrasting visions regarding the appropriate balance between efficiency and equity concerns, between individual and collective rights, at work and in society as a whole. As we have seen, individualization and productivity coalitions—both solutions to the challenge of gaining greater commitment from rank-and-file workers—provide very different levels of collective voice to workers. Absent institutional incentives to collective participation, few managers in Spain would offer it: if the regulatory framework is changed to facilitate the unilateral imposition of greater internal flexibility by employers, then productivity coalitions are likely to become few and far between. Critically, as I have noted, the firms that rely on individualization as a regulatory solution to achieve worker commitment do so not because they <italic>cannot</italic> pursue productivity coalitions, but rather because they prefer not do to so. In other words, the first principle of equity and collective voice at work underlying much of Spanish labor market regulation is not so much economically obsolete as it is politically anathema to many employers.</p>
<p>The cause of equity can, of course, hardly be well served by Spain’s OECD-leading levels of unemployment and temporary contracting. However, as this research shows, institutions that promote worker voice are hardly an insurmountable obstacle to workplace productivity. The micro- (and macro-) political implications of proposals for institutional reform that involve the effective abandonment of core principles such as worker voice therefore deserve far more careful reflection and debate than they have received to date. Those who seek to preserve (or abandon) these principles should also remember that shaping beliefs is at least as important as shaping legislation in their struggle to achieve their objectives.</p>

<p>Investments in technology are excluded from this discussion because virtually all firms seek to enhance productivity through technology investments when they can do so.

<p>The practice is so common, at least in smaller firms, that the phrase “B salary payment” (<italic>la paga en B</italic>) is familiar to most Spanish adults.

<p>If employers abandon sweating practices on the counsel of their professional advisors, whether or not they have truly suffered a loss of market power is of course open to discussion. The role of professional advisors in shaping employers’ perceptions of the labor market is currently under study as part of the same project but is unfortunately beyond the scope of the present article. The power of such demonstration effects on firms’ compliance behavior has been documented in the context of EEOC complaints in the United States. See C.

<p>Sectoral collective bargaining agreements generally define the structure of pay, frequently capping the percentage of variable compensation at very low levels. However, where workers do not object, variable compensation can be negotiated individually or hidden within pay categories that are labeled differently.

<p>Workers are not, of course, indifferent to arguments about the risks of job loss. However, several factors limit their sensitivity to these claims: employees with long tenure may feel that the risks will be borne by others because they are too expensive to dismiss; unless the situation is truly dire, workers may not feel a sense of urgency; and even when they do, distrust of management may lead workers to underestimate the real risks involved in their defense of the status quo.</p></fn>
