<p>The aim of <italic>Gender, Race and the Politics of Role Modelling</italic> is to complicate the notion of role models as the potential “saviors” for addressing the so-called feminization of schools in North America, and the so-called commonsense approach that pairing role models with students of similar racial and gender identities will necessarily increase student achievement and learning. According to Martino and Rezai-Rashti, these are the messages that permeate media, public discourse, and commonly held ideologies, though such messages are not based in empirical research.</p>
<p>Martino and Rezai-Rashti argue that this conceptualization of role models—that male teachers are the “heroes” to save male students from the “scourge” of female domination in schools—is based on an essentialist understanding of identity. Throughout the book, they provide an extensive array of case studies that breakdown the notion that gender and race are static categories. The book then serves to elucidate the ways in which not just gender and race intersect but are also connected to individual and social experiences of sexuality, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class.</p>
<p>In responding to what the authors argue is a dearth of empirical or theoretically based research on the influence of male teachers on student learning, the authors discuss their interviews in Canada and Australia with teachers and students and classroom-based observations in the context of several critical race, feminist, and postcolonial theorists. In fact, their integration of theory with their discussions with teachers is one of the strengths of the book in that it seems to embody a connection between theory and “real life.”</p>
<p>The first and second chapters set up the theoretical underpinnings and offer explanations of some of the terminology used. While a clearer description of the authors’ understanding of “role modeling” might have been helpful in the beginning, the next seven chapters abundantly illustrate how multifaceted individual identities and “role modeling” in general are by sharing the voices and experiences of male and female teachers from a variety of backgrounds and cultures. Chapters 3 and 4 detail the stories of male and female black teachers to demonstrate the limits of restrictive understandings of gender and race, and breakdown arguments that affiliation between teacher and student identities will necessarily produce positive relationships that improve student learning.</p>
<p>Chapters 6 through 8 each address the ways in which teacher practices and bodies are gendered and raced. The authors clearly detail how issues of authority and integrity for a teacher in the classroom are intimately connected to their bodies/sex and embodiment of gender. For the teachers interviewed, the idea of a teacher being “fun” and “laid back” was strongly connected to the hegemonic heterosexual masculine identity of some male teachers. This was juxtaposed against what was seen as a “repressive” and “anal retentive” feminization of the classroom by some female (and nonhegemonic male) teachers.</p>
<p>In chapters on male privilege and the “demonization” of female teachers, as well as other chapters, the authors’ interviews with male and female teachers build up a case for understanding the variety of masculine identities, the range in degrees of privilege accessible to male teachers, and the numerous points of view related to the experience and position of male teachers in elementary schools.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 addresses how a limited understanding of multiculturalism held by one school’s administration produced practices that upheld diversity “tokenism,” inadequate responses to diverse sexualities and “Islamophobia” in the school and community. This in turn placed a burden on individual teachers based in a simple understanding of role models. This burden was also evident throughout the book in stories of how teachers received students “like them,” and thus were expected to “bring them around.” However, as the authors argue, this strategy of passing students along puts too much pressure on individual teachers. This, in effect, puts the responsibility of “at-risk” students on individual teachers and thus relieves the school (and sometimes the community) from addressing how larger social structures influence student achievement.</p>
<p>In Chapter 10, the authors bring in perspectives of a diverse range of students. I found this chapter of particular interest, albeit brief, in addressing another side to role modeling—the student side. Martino and Rezai-Rashti describe that the majority of the students interviewed did not perceive their teachers to be role models, and would instead identify one of their parents as a role model (which was typically the case for more affluent students) or would identify with athletes or musicians (which was typically the case for students from the “multicultural, urban school”). Though the interviews with students were conducted in groups, which raises the question of peer influence in responses, students seemed to indicate that a teacher’s gender did not “matter” for the students’ learning, and students focused more on the relational aspects of a teacher’s pedagogy. Additionally, while in general the students did not seem to support the idea that a teacher’s race or ethnicity impacted their learning, some minority students claimed that teachers of similar cultural backgrounds were “very strict” and “more rigid” in their teaching and management styles.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Gender, Race and the Politics of Role Modelling</italic> offers a compelling counter narrative to the “commonsense” notion that male students will learn better from male teachers. As a teacher educator interested in multiple perspectives on teacher–student relationships, I would have been interested to hear more from the students’ (and other nonteacher) perspectives. Additionally, the emphasis on providing “theoretically informed” empirical research may have contributed to the book’s language that was at times difficult to follow, though it does embody a connection between theory and “real life.” However, the book makes a strong case. It asks us to move beyond a simplistic conceptualization of role modeling, generate creative and critical strategies to address the shortage of male teachers that reflect teachers’ dynamic identities, and place more importance on pedagogies and practices that can help improve student learning.</p>
