<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: Within the domains of health and social care the expertise of patients, service users, volunteers and carers is becoming increasingly recognized and valued. Their involvement in various aspects of research and service development is becoming more common through ‘co-production’, emphasizing the social capital of these groups in contributing to new types of knowledge and service development. This article develops the notion of ‘co-production’ further by discussing the value of involving lay people, volunteers, service users and carers in scholarly writing and dissemination activities, and will explore ways of achieving this. Bourdieu’s General Theoretical Framework is used to explore how the field of ‘higher education’ can embrace the social and cultural capital of those outside of the academy in both research and scholarly writing activities, and how volunteers and lay researchers can be supported in such activities.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: In producing this article, two volunteers were asked to reflect on their experiences of becoming researchers, and their thoughts about disseminating the research findings through scholarly writing. The social capital of experts by experience can be valued within scholarly writing, and through this creative process different representations and understandings of the social world we live in begin to emerge.</p>
<p>• <italic>Application</italic>: The importance of synthesizing alternate epistemologies within academic debate and discourse is centrally important when involving lay people and volunteers in research. This serves to stretch the boundaries of professional knowledge further, and contributes ‘insider’ perspectives to our understanding of social life.</p>

<p>Co-production can be seen to be an increasingly important approach within public policy and practice in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017310393796">Needham, 2009</xref>), and refers to the ways in which service users, carers, and members of communities can be involved in collaborative partnerships to develop research, new types of knowledge and practice development. It is claimed that universities no longer hold the monopoly over knowledge production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310393796">Arnoldi, 2007</xref>), and within the domains of health and social care practice and research, the expertise of patients, users of services, carers, and members of local communities is becoming increasingly recognized and valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393796">Pawson, Boaz, &amp; Grayson, 2003</xref>). In the fields of mental health and disability, in the UK, there is now a wide network of user organizations involved in various aspects of research and service development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310393796">Gilbert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017310393796">Savan, 2004</xref>). It is suggested that involving lay perspectives and the views of users and carers in research can improve both the quality and relevance of research for practice development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310393796">Rhodes et al., 2002</xref>), and this allows for new types of knowledge to inform and develop future practice. These individuals can therefore be seen as experts by experience, who are helping to produce new types of knowledge which push the epistemological boundaries to encompass diverse ways of viewing the world.</p>
<p>This article explores how the scholarly contributions of such ‘experts by experience’ can be encouraged within academia, and how their contributions can be taken beyond involvement in research projects, to include ‘co-production’ of written contributions and dissemination of research findings. The volunteers discussed in this article were involved in all aspects of the research process. They presented the findings at a dissemination conference, and some expressed a desire to disseminate further through contributions to a book and developing academic papers. In particular they could share their own experiences of being volunteer researchers, as well as disseminating findings that they felt particularly strongly about such as the impact of sexuality on bereavement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310393796">Fenge &amp; Fannin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This involves the challenge of developing a more inclusive approach to academic writing, which embraces alternate voices. Despite the current emphasis on co-production within both research and development, which supports the validity of the lived experiences of lay researchers, carers and service users alongside more positivist methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310393796">Glasby &amp; Beresford, 2006</xref>), the themes arising from the two narrative accounts within this article highlight the perception that it is more difficult for those outside of the academy to write about their experiences for publication. It might be suggested that academics have learnt to play the scholastic game of academic writing, in terms of being aware of the jargon that is used for professional purposes and the format for presenting their ideas. Their own professional scholastic social and cultural capital allows them access to the Higher Education field. Academics could be seen to use professional cultural capital to develop a linguistic power boundary that lay researchers and volunteers engaged in scholarly writing find difficult to breach. As part of this discussion, Bourdieu’s General Theoretical Framework will be used to explore how the field of ‘higher education’ can embrace the social and cultural capital of those outside of the academy in both research and scholarly writing activities.</p>
<p>In his work <italic>Distinction</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393796">Bourdieu (1984)</xref> described how the concepts of social field, capital, and habitus all work together to generate social action. A key element of Bourdieu’s work relates to his notion of social field, which he defines in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>A field is a structured social space, a field of forces, a force field. It contains people who dominate and people who are dominated. Constant, permanent relationships of inequality operate inside this space, which at the same time becomes a space in which the various actors struggle for the transformation or preservation of the field. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468017310393796">Bourdieu, 1998</xref>, pp. 40–41)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The field is the setting in which action takes place, and it is in this space that dominant and subordinate groups struggle for control over resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310393796">Bourdieu &amp; Wacquant, 1992</xref>). Individuals, institutions and class groups exist within a social space, and within this space each has some form of social relation with the other, in which some assume dominant positions and others find themselves in subordinate positions. Social capital can be viewed as the social networks and relationships that individuals have, and the resources embedded in such relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017310393796">Lin, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>With regards to co-production we can see the field of academic research as one in which the academy and academic cultural capital has been traditionally dominant through scientific knowledge paradigms. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393796">Garrett (2007)</xref> explains how the development of ‘looking after children’ (LAC) materials in the United Kingdom in the 1990s can only be properly understood in the way in which it is located within government and higher education fields, and the capital of the academics who helped to develop it. This is relevant when exploring who was ‘disqualified’ from contributing to the development of such materials because they ‘lacked the appropriate forms of capital’ which included looked-after children, disadvantaged parents, and even social work practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310393796">Garrett, 2007</xref>, p. 360). As a result, the power of academics and government policy-makers excluded those who had key ‘insider’ knowledge about looked-after children.</p>
<p>We can understand the field of higher education as consisting of the relations between students and staff, academics and managers, and researchers and the participants in research studies. Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310393796">Maton (2005, p. 688)</xref> suggests that one of the main advantages of Bourdieu’s theoretical framework is that it allows higher education to be seen as ‘an object of study’. Struggles within the higher education field are depicted as not only being about trying to gain as much social capital as one can, but also a struggle over the debate about ‘which form of capital should be the Gold Standard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310393796">Maton, 2005</xref>, p. 690). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310393796">Bourdieu (1988)</xref> described the importance of ‘scholastic capital’ within the field of Higher Education. This is pertinent to the discussion in this article where co-production within scholarly writing might be seen as a challenge to the traditional ‘gold standard’ of academic writing as scholastic capital. Co-production offers the chance to create new types of knowledge through collaboration with the social and cultural capital of experts by experience (service user, carers/lay people) using new paradigm research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017310393796">Turner &amp; Beresford, 2005</xref>). This new type of knowledge appears to have links to the description of Mode 2 knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393796">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>). Such knowledge can be viewed as more ground-up in nature and is carried out in a context of application and may be described as being ‘more socially accountable and reflexive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310393796">Gibbons et al., 1994</xref>, p. 3). It can therefore be seen as interactive co-production in action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017310393796">Nowotmy, Scott, &amp; Gibbons, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310393796">Ozga, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017310393796"><title>Background</title>
<p>Within health and social care provision the UK government’s approach to personalization is resulting in service users and carers being required to use their skills and capacities to develop and manage their own packages of care through individual budgets, direct payments and person-centred planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310393796">Manthorpe et al., 2008</xref>). This policy emphasis and philosophical basis of personalization facilitates a reduction in the demarcation between professionals and non-professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310393796">Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>). Through a process of ‘co-production’ it is recognized ‘that people who use services have assets which can help improve those services, rather than needs which must be met’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017310393796">Needham, 2009</xref>, p. 1).</p>
<p>Within the growing policy context of personalization, co-production values the social capital of service users, carers and members of communities as having a central voice and role to play within service development. However, this article argues that ‘co-production’ can mean much more. Partnerships involving co-production can be used to encourage involvement in both research and knowledge development, and contributes to the growing awareness of new types of knowledge and understanding through user-led research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310393796">Pawson et al., 2003</xref>). It can be argued that different modes or genres of writing and representation of knowledge allow different discourses to emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310393796">Archer, 2006</xref>). For example, narratives can offer meaningful insights into service user/carer experience, and can be used to express knowledge which has not yet been formalized or systematized (Colombo, 2003). Narratives can be used to develop health and social care practice by offering insights to improve care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017310393796">Wilcock, Brown, Bateson, Carver, &amp; Machin, 2003</xref>), or to provide an insight into the values through which individuals interpret their own lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310393796">Cant, 2008</xref>). Narratives have also been used to present a ‘story’ about research activity in which multiple voices and identities come into play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310393796">Riessman &amp; Quinney, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of narrative can be seen to value the social and cultural capital of experts by experience within scholarly discourse. Different kinds of social and cultural capital encounter a range of generic forms and ways of presenting information. One critique of academic scholarly writing is that little attention has been paid to the more holistic aspects ‘such as lecturer-writer’s sense of self and identity, their emotional orientation to their writing and their creative process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310393796">Antoniou &amp; Moriarty, 2008</xref>, p. 158). It might be argued that encouraging experts by experience to become involved in co-production of scholarly outputs may lead to an increased recognition of the personal voice as cultural capital, and an appreciation of contested areas of knowledge and debate where the multiplicity of meanings inherent in health and social care practice are played out.</p>
<p>The two volunteers involved in co-producing this article had initially become involved in a participatory action research project which was funded for three years by the Big Lottery Fund, and was a joint initiative between a voluntary agency working with older people in Dorset, and Bournemouth University. This study was granted ethical approval by the local ethics committee as a Participatory Action Research project. The Gay and Grey project, as this research became known, was among the very first in the UK to undertake participative action research with older lesbians and gay men. It aimed to support and facilitate older lesbians and gay men to engage in research about their experiences of exclusion and marginalization, and enabled them to inform local agencies about their needs. In this project volunteers developed a questionnaire, and undertook 30 in-depth qualitative interviews. A number of volunteers were involved in the analysis of findings and the write-up of the final report, whilst other took on roles of networking and working with service providers to develop service provision. A number of the volunteers co-authored the final project report entitled <italic>Lifting the lid on sexuality and ageing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393796">Gay and Grey in Dorset, 2006</xref>), and a social work text book entitled <italic>Social work practice with older lesbians and gay men</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310393796">Fannin, Fenge, Hicks, Lavin, &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>). More recently a number of other papers have been accepted for publication which have been co-produced and co-authored by the volunteers. The following two narratives illustrate an insight into the struggle that volunteers, researchers and co-producers experienced in terms of writing for an academic audience. In producing this article the volunteers were asked to reflect on their experiences of becoming researchers, and their thoughts about disseminating the research findings through scholarly writing.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1468017310393796"><title>Ann’s thoughts on academic writing</title>
<p>Here I am, a woman in her 70th year, being asked to contribute (occasionally) to some academic papers and recently have been co-author of a book aimed at University Qualified Social Workers. My Mother who is now dead would be amazed.</p>
<p>I left school when I was 15 with no ‘O’ levels or any qualifications of any kind. At that time I was far more interested in horses than using my brain, which according to my Mother and Father was sadly lacking in substance anyway. It wasn’t until I was in my mid-40s that I started to regret my lack of interest in education and decided I’d like to go to university. So I did. The degree was a multi-disciplinary course which included politics, sociology, women’s studies and conflict resolution. I surprised myself by graduating with an honours degree at upper second. My mother, who was alive at the time, was astonished; I was excited. But now, 25 years on I am, as a volunteer and on the periphery of academia, writing articles which occasionally get published. How did this come about and how does it feel? It feels good.</p>
<p>I don’t feel like an academic, but then I am not sure what an academic is. I remember thinking as I was entering university for the first time all those years ago, that I was going to be out of my depth rubbing shoulders with all those fine minded people striding the hallowed corridors of learning. It wasn’t long before I discovered that in fact the hallowed corridors of learning were dirty, busy and threadbare and the lecturers and dons just ordinary people like me. The difference is that they had learnt the art of ‘mystification’ (the ‘academic’ I suppose would do a reference to Marx here!) and had become adept at using written language in a way which made them appear superior, leaving other ‘non academics’ impressed, bemused and terrified.</p>
<p>So how did it happen that I now have the opportunity to contribute to ‘academic’ papers?</p>
<p>It all began about five years ago when I spotted an advert in the newsletter of a lesbian group I belong to, asking for volunteers to participate in some research which was to look into the needs, wants, aspirations and fears of older lesbian and gay people. This, as an older lesbian with fears and aspirations, struck a chord with me so I volunteered.</p>
<p>Naively I thought it was a case of just filling in a questionnaire and waiting for the results of someone else’s analysis after the questionnaires had been completed. I was wrong. The research was to be undertaken by us – the volunteers – with guidance and support from a salaried project worker and a senior researcher and lecturer attached to Bournemouth University. This was Participatory Action Research: this was the ‘methodology’ or in non-academic language, the way in which the research was going to be conducted. For three years we designed questionnaires, we interviewed other older lesbian and gay people, we debated, discussed (and disagreed) amongst ourselves, we were given some training in interviewing and report writing, we laughed, we cried and, most importantly for the purposes of this article, some of us started writing.</p>
<p>When we were writing up the report we decided that it should be written in accessible language and if we found the odd jargon word creeping in we’d throw our hands up in horror and quickly find an alternative. Although it was a very difficult process because we all had such different perceptions, the actual writing was relatively simple as we were just gathering up data and reporting on it.</p>
<p>So what is different about ‘academic’ writing? Apart from formalized language and style, which I personally find intimidating and slightly annoying (although I do think it is something that, rightly or wrongly, one can get used to), I suppose what I find most difficult is the business of having to prove a statement. This is called ‘research’; this is looking up what other people have said about the subject previously. I have often thought that a lot of academic study these days seems to be going round and round in circles with very few people having original thoughts! I have however, found doing all this ‘research’ very interesting and exciting, so maybe this is what ‘academia’ is all about; the process of learning what others have thought and extending on those thoughts. A bit like the British constitution and the legal system really. Perhaps, if we thought of ‘academic’ writing as just ‘gathering data and reporting on it’ we could cut it all down to size and see it for what it can in many cases be – a bit of pompous showing off.</p>
<p>The problem is that we do need centres of advanced ‘academic’ study; we need those who are paid to ‘gather data and report on it’ and to do original research to allow for society to continue to develop, improve and prosper. But by encouraging a culture of exclusive and inaccessible language, a whole section of the population is kept at a distance. Many of those people who have much to offer in the way of imparting knowledge are excluded simply because they feel they haven’t got the expertise to inform in ‘academic’ ways.</p>
<p>There are just two volunteers left continuing to do the work of disseminating the results of our research (spreading the word). To find out why the others dropped out would need further investigation. I can only say why I stayed. There are two main reasons. 1) The subject matter is close to my heart. Our research showed up that a very high percentage of older lesbian and gay men are very reluctant and fearful of ‘coming out’ about their sexuality even to their close friends and family; only 47.7 percent were ‘out’ to friends and 47.3 percent to family. This indicates that something is very wrong in our society and I feel a great urgency to right such a wrong. 2) I just love writing. I cannot put my finger on why, I just do. Whether I can do this well or not is immaterial, I just like putting words on a page.</p>
<p>Are there any personal gains? Certainly there are no financial gains, quite the opposite. The personal gains I think stem from the stimulation of the brain, thinking things through and trying to explain to others what I feel passionate about. Being given the chance to do this, whether by ‘academic’ writing or more mundane jottings is a great privilege.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1468017310393796"><title>Christina’s thoughts on academic writing</title>
<p>Being born at the beginning of the post-war ‘birth bulge’, and failing to leap the 11 + hurdle, meant that my schooling was somewhat basic. Having therefore left school at 15 after a less than adequate education and no qualifications, I had no experience of academic writing although I had achieved a diploma. However, as that was in Funeral Directing, which was a very practical course, my first experience of academic writing came when I embarked upon an Open University degree course at the age of 38, prompted more by a reaction to the death of my mother than any burning desire to gain a degree. Six years later, when I achieved a BA, I was much more versed in how to write social science essays. Twenty-plus years later I still find myself mentally reciting ‘say what you’re going to say, say it, say what you’ve said’. Something that became even further ingrained whilst developing public speaking skills within the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
<p>As I had retired I thought that it was unlikely that there would be any further need for such activity. However, I chanced upon information about a research project looking into the needs of older lesbians and gay men (Gay and Grey project) that had the potential to make a difference in the lives of some disadvantaged and invisible people. This was not something I could ignore and having volunteered I found that there was to be a report to which I was expected to contribute. The opportunity to develop the findings into a text book for post-qualifying social workers, thus ensuring the continuation and widening dissemination of the results, could not be ignored although I had severe doubts about my ability to write something interesting and useful that had the potential to change ingrained working practices.</p>
<p>Like all professions, academia has its own ‘language’ that embraces those in the know and excludes everyone else, a linguistic power boundary that is difficult to breach. Would it be possible to break through that barrier to produce something acceptable and understandable? Also, whilst the book would be co-authored, each chapter would be the work of an individual, did I have the tenacity, determination and focus to sit down and write in isolation?</p>
<p>On reflection, I realized that one of the things that helped in both my OU degree studies and the development of <italic>Lifting the lid on sexuality and ageing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393796">Gay and Grey in Dorset, 2006</xref>) was the fact that there were others with which to share my ideas. In both cases they were honest and constructive in commenting on what I’d written as well as my writing style. Knowing that in writing the book I would have the same type of back-up from both academics and non-academics gave me the confidence to go ahead and have a go. Also, despite the difficulties inherent in co-writing, I found I had enjoyed working on the research report.</p>
<p>Initially, I found the writing process itself was quite frustrating. The main challenge, I think, was to find a balance between a clear and open style of writing with the need for academic acceptance. At first I struggled with both the content and the style and the writing was very slow. But, I reached a point where I decided the best approach was just to write what I wanted to say, see if it made sense, then edit it into a more ‘academic’ style. This speeded up the whole process and made it much more enjoyable. Collaborating with a university lecturer meant that there was access to someone who could go through and pick up any lack of clarity or inconsistency, which was invaluable.</p>
<p>On a personal level it gave me an added confidence in my own ability and confirmation that despite having been retired for some time my brain was still functioning. It also restored some of the status lost by being retired and getting older, and there’s something quite uplifting about being able to say that you are a published author, however small your contribution. During the whole process of the Gay and Grey research project through to the publication of the book <italic>Social work practice with older lesbians and gay men</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310393796">Fannin et al., 2008</xref>), a number of papers were being written and accepted by academic publications. That volunteers participated in writing those papers shows that they have a valuable contribution to make. This could be used to encourage others who may feel reticent about writing for academic publication. In particular, the fact that the styles and previous experience of all the volunteers differed considerably, means that novices can feel confident that their contributions are as valid and appropriate as any other.</p>
<p>Academics can learn much from the participation of non-academics. Being immersed in any profession can blinker you to the views and experiences of the rest of the world. Keeping ideas and knowledge fresh and up to date by interacting with those outside your own, often narrow, focus can be both rewarding and enlightening.</p>
<p>Having successfully participated in the production of a comprehensive report and contributed to an academic publication, future participation in similar activities holds challenge but little fear. It is clear that it is possible for a non-academic to contribute to academic publications, be they short papers, reports or text books. This article is one further step in that process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468017310393796" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>What is valued by government policy and rhetoric is a form of knowledge production within health and social care which requires higher education to increasingly work in partnership with service users, carers and lay people within communities to produce knowledge which will help to inform professional practice. This new type of emergent ‘insider’ knowledge can be seen to operate as a regulative discourse, constituting what counts as legitimate knowledge. As the two narratives clearly highlight, the social capital of experts by experience can be valued within scholarly writing, and through this creative process different representations and understandings of the social world we live in begin to emerge. The field of higher education can therefore be challenged by the inclusion of other forms of social and cultural capital in research and scholarly writing. A goal for this type of inclusive and co-produced representation is to ‘criticize the way the world is, and offer suggestions about how it could be different’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310393796">Denzin, 2001</xref>, p. 24).</p>
<p>Individuals situate themselves within their social context according to their socially acquired system of perceptions and pre-dispositions or <italic>habitus</italic>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310393796">Bourdieu (1973)</xref>, the development of habitus is influenced by one’s place in the social structure, and is an internalized representation of early socialization. The relation between field and habitus is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310393796">Bourdieu (1996, p. 213)</xref> when he noted that ‘social reality exists, so to speak, twice, in things and in minds, in fields and habitus, outside and inside of agents’. As the narratives within this article suggest, the volunteers had to challenge the exclusionary self-perceptions that they had about their own ability to write as well as the entrenched cultural perceptions that may exist about the higher education field and their place within it. As Christina’s narrative suggests this process included encountering and conquering her ‘severe doubts’ about her ability to write.</p>
<p>The potential exclusionary effect of previous educational experience raises important questions about those who have the confidence to take part in collaborative scholarly projects. Both of the co-authors within this piece are graduates, and within the wider Gay and Grey project those that chose to take on the research and writing roles all had some experience of higher education. Other volunteers without an Higher Education background appeared more willing to become involved in other aspects of the project and this does raise the prospect that even within projects which are based on participation and co-operation that some form of ‘political disempowerment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310393796">Lennie, 2005</xref>) can occur which prevents all voices being heard, and limits the types of roles that individuals are willing to take on.</p>
<p>It could be suggested that the habitus of the experts by experience who have contributed to this article and previously through the production of <italic>Lifting the lid on sexuality and ageing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310393796">Gay and Grey in Dorset, 2006</xref>) and other scholarly outputs, have adjusted to the demands of the higher educational field. This has been achieved by being socialized to the concept of HE through the original Gay and Grey research project and report writing activities they have been involved with. This process includes becoming aware of some of the assumptions that derive from the culture and language of the field of higher education, and a growing appreciation of what scholastic capital means. As Ann highlights in her narrative, this included an understanding of the ‘formalized language and style’ required within academic writing. It may be perceived that there is a contradiction in this article as it has been submitted to a journal that privileges particular styles of writing and content. However, it could be argued that it is important to get the scholarly contributions of experts by experience (service users/carers/laypeople) published in a field normally dominated by academics.</p>
<p>In time the HE field and the academic journals and processes which represent it, may become more permeable to different representations of knowledge, and writing genre may have to change in order to accommodate the voices of excluded groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017310393796">Heron &amp; Murray, 2004</xref>). This may include narrative reflections and insider accounts which provide important perspectives which can help to challenge social work policy and practice and provide new ways of viewing the complexities of sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310393796">Hicks, 2008</xref>). As Christina explains in her narrative, this involves removing professional blinkers and engaging with new ways of viewing the world. The participatory methodology employed in the Gay and Grey project meant that the project was fed and nurtured by the different perspectives of the volunteers involved within it. The outcomes would have been different without their involvement and such an approach promotes new understandings for both practice and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310393796">Fenge, 2010</xref>). However, it is also important to consider how certain voices may be represented and others silenced through such processes. For some individuals the exclusionary forces of the HE field, as well as the impact of group processes from working alongside other volunteers may be disempowering, and thus their involvement remains in the periphery.</p>
<p>A critique of Bourdieu’s framework is that it lacks ‘an appreciation of the role of contradiction in social processes and discursive action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310393796">Collins, 1993</xref>, p. 117). Indeed the current culture within higher education is very different to the context in which Bourdieu’s own studies of higher education took place, when universities were insulated from wider political and economic pressures and could remain relatively autonomous institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017310393796">Naidoo, 2004</xref>). Higher education now must embrace partnerships with a range of stakeholders and as a result the field of higher education could be seen to be more fluid and permeable to outside influences than originally depicted by Bourdieu in his writings. As Ann and Christina’s narratives suggest, with support it is possible for diverse forms of knowledge to find representation within the higher education field.</p>
<p>An important component of this development is the need to support the process of academic writing in order to build the confidence of those writing for publication. This is important when challenging a habitus which might restrict an individual’s ability to write if it is seen as outside of their social and cultural experience. This is not a surprise, and is as equally pertinent for academics who are attempting to put pen to paper. The importance of peer support for academics during academic writing has been noted by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310393796">Grant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017310393796">Moore, 2003</xref>; Murray, Thow, Moore, &amp; Murphy, 2008). This has also been depicted as a position of mutuality which involves recognition of a common positionality, or common project within peer support for writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468017310393796">Lee &amp; Boud, 2003</xref>). Both Ann and Christina’s narratives highlight the importance of the peer support they received from other volunteers in the project, as well as the support from the university based researcher. Their writing journey involved the need to build confidence and support to sustain interest when difficulties were encountered. These supportive peer relationships are pivotal as academic writing can be seen as risky on a number of fronts. This might be particularly relevant when trying to engage those without an HE education themselves in research and scholarly activity. To support such endeavours, it may be useful to develop writing and dissemination workshops in which participants would be encouraged and supported to develop their own creative writing skills, as well as considering other methods of dissemination.</p>
<p>Writing involves emotional risk taking and to write for publication involves making oneself visible and open to public scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310393796">Antoniou &amp; Moriarty, 2008</xref>). For the writers involved in this piece, there could be extra risks involved with their exposure of their own sexuality, and their writing can be seen to be an identity related activity. This indeed raises ethical dilemmas around personal disclosure in writing, and the personal risks that may be involved when research and writing involves sensitive topics. The writers are therefore not only involved in disclosing themselves as being outside the academy to a largely academic audience, but also by the focus of the research project they are involved with, they make their sexuality visible.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1468017310393796" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The fluidity in field boundary, and the way in which the habitus of the volunteers appears to have been able to embrace a new identity as a scholarly writer, demonstrates some of the nuances within social processes. It could be suggested that the habitus of the volunteer researchers in this article adjusted itself to the demands of the scholastic HE field, through being socialized to the concept of academic writing by taking part in the research project and dissemination activities. Some of the volunteers in the Gay and Grey project were able to become fully involved in disseminating the findings of the research through scholarly writing. Despite playing an academic game on a scholastic HE field that is dominated by higher educational capital, engaging in scholarly writing has enabled members of a marginalized group to have a voice in defining the knowledge known about them. However, this article could be critiqued for focusing on encouraging non-academics to contribute to scholarly writing that merely valorizes academic writing and dissemination as the ‘gold standard’ by which everything else is judged. Does this not just reproduce the social and cultural capital of the academic world at the expense of the experience of more diverse understandings?</p>
<p>Should we instead be interested in how different forms of cultural and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310393796">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>) can be expressed and presented? Knowledge can be shared in a range of forms, and perhaps the challenge for academia is to embrace multimodal approaches to knowledge and understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310393796">Archer, 2006</xref>) which do not merely reproduce the written word as the gold standard. The 21st century has already seen changes in the way we communicate with each other through the growing use of the internet, through chat rooms, blogs and Twitter. The boundaries between professional and non-professional are becoming blurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310393796">Leadbeater &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>), and new ways of communicating and presenting information are becoming available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017310393796">O’Neill et al., 2002</xref>). This includes more performance-based media, such as film, drama and art work. This raises many challenges itself in terms of how different forms of multi-sensory data can be represented in an inclusive way for academic, practitioner and lay audiences alike.</p>
<p>As well as breaking down barriers by involving a diverse range of voices within academic writing and representation, it is perhaps equally important to embrace these new methodologies for social research and practice which represent the complexity of contemporary society, and allow a diverse range of voice to find expression. In this way new ways of knowing or ‘extended epistemologies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310393796">Bradbury &amp; Reason, 2003</xref>) will inclusively embrace a wide range of experience which hitherto have remained under-represented in academic debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310393796">Guhathakurta, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is also important to recognize a paradox in co-production, whereby academics still hold a powerful role in supporting the process. Although co-production can shift the balance of power away from the professional or academic, and enable new types of knowledge to emerge, it is essential to recognize the position of power that academics retain within the field of higher education. However, despite these constraints within the traditional higher education academic field, the Gay and Grey project and ongoing involvement of some of the volunteers in dissemination activities and scholarly writing, offer some hopeful signs that new emergent voices and diverse perspectives can be synthesized within academic debate. Through co-production service users, carers, and lay people from communities can be encouraged and supported to push the boundaries of professional knowledge further, and increasingly contribute ‘insider’ perspectives to our understanding of social life. In the future, new methodologies which move beyond the gold standard of the written word may enable a more diverse contribution to academic knowledge and debate.</p>
