<p>This 440-page book has a total of eighteen articles on a wide range of issues from “employment relations in India and China” to an analysis of “the political economy of comparative employment relations.” With limited space, the editors have corralled an eclectic cluster of academics, whose contributions combine to offer us a very usable reader on what is happening in employment relations around the world. Although the majority of authors are from Australia and the United Kingdom, we do find representatives from Argentina, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Knowing the sources of the articles is useful because their topic focus, writing style, and level of sophistication say clearly that this book is almost exclusively for graduate classes or a touchstone for research.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four sections with the first part setting out the challenges of this undertaking. A “perspectives” section follows, designed to set the academic stage. Within these first one hundred pages the reader has the foundation for a semester’s graduate-level readings class. The third section, and the majority of the book, offers vignettes of paired countries, including Chile and Argentina, Japan and Korea, Canada and the United States, China and India, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand, South Africa and Mozambique, France and Germany, and the Gulf countries. Again, these pieces set the stage as well as pique our interest for more.</p>
<p>The final segment, which offers three articles, is by far the most interesting. The first analyzes corporatism and neoliberalism in Ireland and Italy. The second examines the role of multinational enterprises, and the final one examines the question of regulating global capital through international labor standards and corporate voluntary initiatives. In that article, Tony Royal, a lecturer in the Department of Management at the J.E. Cairnes School of Business and Economics in Galway, Ireland, analyzes how global economic governance has serious implications for employment relations at all levels and, not surprisingly, concludes that “human and labour rights are still much lower down the pecking order than interests of shareholders, global capital and trade.” Although the conclusions are not new to the field, the manner in which the analysis is developed in such an abbreviated fashion is impressive.</p>
