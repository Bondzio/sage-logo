<abstract>
<p>Black beauty shame emerges within the Black/white binary because of the beauty values sedimented in our structure of feeling since African enslavement. This article does not start from white beauty as the ideal, but focuses on the performativity of Black beauty shame as it transforms or intensifies the meanings of parts of the body in Jamaica and its UK diaspora. Using extracts from interviews with UK Jamaican heritage women, the discussion illustrates how Black beauty shame produces such intensification. First, where white beauty is iconic and reproduces the Black other as ‘ugly’, and second, where the Black ‘mixed race’ body is constructed as ‘other’ because of Black Nationalist discourses on beauty. The women’s critique of the shaming event shows that shame is undone through dis-identification as speakers draw on alternative beauty discourses to produce new beauty subjectivities. Dis-identification illustrates the transformational potential of shame as new Black beauty positionings emerge within the diaspora, drawing on beauty ideologies and models from Jamaica and thus destabilising the Black/white binary.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1464700113483250" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article, I use extracts from interviews with three Black British women of Jamaican heritage<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464700113483250">1</xref></sup> to look at the performativity of Black beauty shame. That is, the production of subjects through both Black beauty shame’s racialised intensification of body parts in gaze, touch and discourse, as well as these women’s dis-identifications from such intensification through using alternative beauty discourses from Jamaica<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464700113483250">2</xref></sup> to produce new beauty subjectivities. The discussion seeks to go beyond the ‘given’ of psychic damage from the stigma of ‘Black ugliness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483250">Carroll, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483250">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464700113483250">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>) to thinking about how alternative beauty models generated within Jamaica and its diaspora produce new beauty subjectivities. The interview extracts encompass the two iconic Jamaican beauty models: the darker-skinned and more afro-haired Black Nationalist and the post-1980s lighter-skinned and straighter-haired ‘browning’. These iconic beauty models show that Black beauty shame exists in Jamaica as a decolonising state and in its UK diaspora. This is because white/light-skinned/‘mixed race’ beauty are iconic and produce addressivities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464700113483250">3</xref></sup> for the darker-skinned other as ‘ugly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483250">Carroll, 2000</xref>). Further, there is also the production of an addressivity for the Black ‘mixed-race’ woman as ‘other’ even within an aesthetic context where lighter skin and straighter hair are seen as the Black beauty ideal. This othering is produced by the Black anti-racist aesthetics resulting from Garveyism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464700113483250">Garvey, 2004)</xref>, Rastafarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464700113483250">Barrett, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483250">Chevannes, 1994</xref>) and Walter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464700113483250">Rodney’s (1969)</xref> Caribbean Black Power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464700113483250">4</xref></sup> These Black Nationalist discourses produce the addressivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483250">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464700113483250">Pearce, 1994</xref>) of ‘other’. Black beauty shame is thus relational and has many shades and hair textures. Women draw on these Black Nationalist discourses as well as Jamaican beauty ideals such as ‘browning’, which has emerged from modern Blackness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464700113483250">Thomas, 2004</xref>), to undo shame in the moment in which it is named and dis-identified from. As women name shame and dis-identify from it, this very <italic>doing</italic> and <italic>undoing</italic> of the addressivity of ‘ugly’ or ‘other’, marks the performativity of Black beauty shame as constraining beauty norms and identities as well as being a catalyst for transformation. The article first looks at shame and the links between performativity, intensification and addressivity, followed by an overview of Jamaican beauty genealogies. The discussion of the extracts draws out the complexities of Black beauty shame and the emergence of new beauty subjectivities.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1464700113483250"><title>Black beauty shame’s performativity: Intensification and addressivity</title>
<p>Where ‘Black’ does not routinely go with ‘beauty’, Blackness is made intelligible through ‘an entire play of white racist signifiers that ontologically truncate the black body; it … calls forth an entire racist world view … the power of racial speech, the power of racial gesturing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464700113483250">Yancy, 2012</xref> : 3). In Jamaica and its UK diaspora, Black beauty is celebrated as varied. However, because of the Jamaican national romance with mixing, for some, ‘dark skin’, ‘big lips’, ‘broad noses’ and ‘natty hair’ as markers of African descent are still considered to be sources of ugliness. As such, shaming encounters are normalised within a racial affective economy in which African descent ugliness is ‘already embedded within citationality conditions that involve larger racist assumptions and accusations as they relate to the black body that shape [their] intelligibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464700113483250">Yancy, 2012</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Shame as a ‘bad feeling’ attaches to what one <italic>is</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464700113483250">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>) because of judgement by others irrespective of feelings of attachment. As we judge we are possessed by affects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>). This is not Kantian ‘sensory states produced by thought [as] interruptive thoughts are produced by affects. Feelings are thoughtful, affects are thoughtless’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>: 116). Further, affects like shame are expressions of intensity not always mediated through language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464700113483250">Gutiérrez Rodríguez, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464700113483250">2010</xref>). As we judge others negatively we direct towards them a stream of affect which eliminates relationality because of objectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>). In judgemental projection we mark others with affects that we refuse in ourselves but which still possess us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Judgements are significant for our life experiences and feelings of shame or esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464700113483250">Hobson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483250">Mama, 1995</xref>). In the transmission of Black beauty affect, judgement’s projection or introjection is the moment of affective transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>) of esteem or shame. Shame is often a transitory affect experienced intensely in/on the body in moments of humiliation, and the accumulation of such experiences can be sedimented in the psyche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483250">Munt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483250">Probyn, 2005</xref>). The psyche here extends from the individual to the group being marked as shameful <italic>or</italic> the group with the power to shame, as different ‘shame scripts’ and subjectivities are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483250">Munt, 2007</xref>: 3). Affect is transmitted within and between groups across time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483250">Brennan, 2004</xref>). Thus, it is possible to continue to be affected by Black beauty shame accumulated over the centuries of slavery and colonialism because shaming beauty judgements continue to be made based on racialised/racialising beauty ideals. Accumulation of shame is not just about ‘telling me what I am … it also lets one know that he/she has power over me, power to hurt and mark one’s consciousness with that hurt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483250">Munt, 2007</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>The power to mark consciousness and tell us what we are makes Black beauty shame relevant not just for the body, but also for racialised politics, identities and societies. The power of shame lies in its ability to intensify or transform the meaning of, for example, body parts, a prohibited identity or other people’s behaviour towards oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483250">Ahmed, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1464700113483250">Munt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483250">Probyn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464700113483250">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>). Intensification works through shame’s ability to produce a ‘precarious hyperreflexivity of the surface of the body [which] can turn one inside out or outside in’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464700113483250">Sedgwick, 2003</xref>: 116). Intensification orients us to what we are supposed to be as racialised bodies, as it produces addressivities where individuals always exist in a state of being addressed as beautiful/ugly and in the process of answering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483250">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>). Answering occurs from a subject in process as an utterance context establishes a position from which to speak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483250">Hitchcock, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483250">Tate, 2005</xref>). Further, for Mikhail Bakhtin, struggles reside with the sign but also in the access to signification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483250">Tate, 2005</xref>). This is what marks the subject as agent rather than simply an always already known position produced through relations of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464700113483250">Hitchcock, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, beautiful/ugly addressivities can be the location of esteem or shame, and can constrain our beauty identifications -- but the answer, the speaking back, can re-orient these addressivities and call them into question. Such re-orientation means that which has been racially intensified as ‘other’ can be transformed to become the norm/the ideal through alternative beauty discourses. This reminds us of Ernesto Laclau’s view that ‘if the process of naming of objects amounts to their very constitution, then their descriptive features will be fundamentally unstable and open to all kinds of … rearticulations’ (Laclau cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483250">Butler, 1993</xref>: 210). In rearticulations we also see the instability and incompleteness of subject formation as speakers critique their discursive beauty shame positionings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464700113483250">Tate, 2005</xref>). Black beauty shame’s performativity, therefore, is constituted both by the addressivities constructed by the reiterative power of discourse to produce the ‘phenomena that it regulates and constrains’, as well as by a subject bringing into being what she/he names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483250">Butler, 1993</xref>: 2). Such performativity also operates on the basis of expressions of intensity not mediated through language, because shame/esteem is sensed as subjects draw on shame/esteem scripts from Jamaica’s beauty genealogies.</p>

<p>Beauty discourses permeate sociality and psyches as they sediment in our structures of feeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464700113483250">Williams, 1961</xref>) over centuries of political and aesthetic debate and stylisation. Black beauty has always been placed as other to whiteness, purity, acceptability and femininity, with an accompanying preference for lighter skin and straighter hair from the times of slavery and colonialism in the Black Atlantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483250">Arrizón, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483250">Bush, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483250">Candelario, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483250">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464700113483250">Mohammed, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1464700113483250">Pinho, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>). Discourses of the impossibility of Black beauty always already imply shame because of ‘Black ugliness’. Indeed, beauty and ugliness were determined by the racial formations of slavery and colonialism in ways which still resonate in Jamaica and its diaspora.</p>
<p>During slavery and colonialism in Jamaica the aesthetic universal of Black ugliness emerged within the white beauty iconicity of ‘the English Rose’; for example, Jamaican planter Edward <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464700113483250">Long’s (1972)</xref> view was that Black women were suitable mates for orang-utans because of their physical similarities. White beauty iconicity worked its way outwards from a British centre alongside other norms of the ‘mixed race’ beauty of the mulatta, the quadroon and the octoroon, which Jennifer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483250">DeVere Brody (1998)</xref> collapses into ‘mulattaroon’ to illustrate the constructedness of these categories. ‘Mulattaroon’ beauty was established as more desirable than African beauty though ‘not quite white’, keeping Blacks at the bottom of the beauty hierarchy. The ‘“beauty” of the negress and the mulatto was part of the grammar of the exotic, and race and beauty were drawn together in a hierarchy of appearance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464700113483250">Nuttall, 2006</xref>: 10). Syrian, Jewish and Lebanese migrants were inserted into the white upper class although aesthetically not ‘the English Rose’ ideal as illustrated in the 1930s beauty pageants in Jamaica, which stressed white English looks and comportment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464700113483250">Rowe, 2009</xref>). After emancipation in 1838, indentured Indian labourers, located as ‘coolies’, had the same social and aesthetic status as the former enslaved Africans. Chinese indentured labourers were eventually absorbed into the upper and middle classes economically, but had an uneasy aesthetic inclusion. Beauty thus mirrored the social ordering of Jamaica’s pigmentocracy during slavery whose legacy is that lighter skin, ‘good features’ and straighter hair still define Black feminine beauty. This racist legacy continues to be disguised today within the national story of mixing as emblematic of racial equality and Jamaica’s cultural call to Africa on independence.</p>
<p>Since the 1930s, many Jamaicans influenced by Garveyism and Rastafarianism refused preference for whiteness while valorising ‘natural Black beauty’. The basis of the valorisation of Black beauty is an anti-racist aesthetics which is a cultural criticism constructed from efforts to grapple with the (mis)uses of beauty in Black experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464700113483250">Taylor, 2000</xref>). This was based on a wider critique of the racism experienced by Black people in the colonies and the diaspora more widely, and political activism around the need for Black self-determination and racial equality.</p>
<p>From the 1940s to the 1960s the creole multinationalist project was consolidated. This was reflected in the precursor to the Miss Jamaica pageant, the ‘Ten Types One Nation’ contest, which acknowledged Jamaica’s racial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464700113483250">Rowe, 2009</xref>). The country’s national motto ‘Out of Many, One People’ on independence from Britain in August 1962 also acknowledged racial diversity. Although Jamaica developed cultural citizenship based upon valorisation of African heritage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464700113483250">Thomas, 2004</xref>), this ideological link has been struggled over at the level of aesthetics given persistent pigmentocracy and continuing contestation post-independence over the face of the nation, Miss Jamaica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483250">Barnes, 1997</xref>). From the 1970s the Miss Jamaica pageant has served as a test of the nation’s readiness to erase the stigma of darker skin and more afro-hair as we continue to see an annual replay of the ‘Ten Types’ contest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464700113483250">5</xref></sup> Indeed, it was not until 2007 that Zahra Redwood, a darker-skinned dreadlocked participant, was crowned as Miss Jamaica Universe, while lighter-skinned straight-haired Yendi Phillips was crowned Miss Jamaica World. Changing sponsorship of ‘Miss Jamaica’ has meant that the focus is on choosing someone who has the best chance of winning international competitions such as Miss World or Miss Universe, as we can see from these two choices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464700113483250">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alongside the cultural policy link to Africa following independence there was also an attachment to ‘brown’. However, it was no longer a phenotypical hangover from slavery but ‘signified a respectable way of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464700113483250">Thomas, 2004</xref>: 24). So brown was a ‘becoming’ identity category in creole multiracial nationalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>). It is within this negotiated space between the brown of creole multiracial nationalism, ‘modern Blackness’ (that is, previously marginalised urban expressions of Blackness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464700113483250">Thomas, 2004</xref>), and the decline in the hegemony of British colonial class and colour hierarchies, that ‘browning’ emerged within the Black space of struggle for representation in 1980s Jamaica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The etymology of the word ‘browning’ is unclear, but it is more than likely derived from dancehall lyrics in Jamaica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1464700113483250">Mohammed, 2000</xref>). Browning engages with brown not as a phenotype, but as a possibility of becoming acceptably and respectably Black and African originated among working-class Jamaicans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>). Browning and its emergence represent the ongoing negotiation of systems of power and domination from the 1980s to today in Jamaica, in which subaltern aesthetics and politics lay claim to a space within the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>). This is shown in Jamaica and its diaspora in the continuing public debate about Miss Jamaica and skin bleaching as women and men strategically seek to embody ‘browning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464700113483250">Brown-Glaude, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464700113483250">Hope, 2011</xref>). We can see this latter in the continuing discussions within Jamaica and its diaspora on Vybz Kartel’s 2011 launch of his bleaching cosmetics range for the purpose of stylisation, and the Jamaican government’s 2007 anti-bleaching poster campaign, ‘Don’t Kill the Skin’. ‘Browning’ has spread out from its birthplace through dancehall to the Jamaican diaspora. As a practice rather than a phenotype, browning gives us an aesthetic parsing of Black beauty as part of a ‘distinctive counter culture of modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464700113483250">Gilroy, 1993</xref>: 36).</p>
<p>As we see in Miss Jamaica and bleaching, Black beauty is performative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464700113483250">Tate, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">2009</xref>). This is illustrated in the constant attempt to embody hegemonic norms which Judith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483250">Butler (1990)</xref> calls a performative reiteration. Black beauty is a matter of <italic>doing</italic>, and beauty stylisations and judgements are about ‘racing’ bodies as well as being raced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464700113483250">Tate, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">2009</xref>). If white beauty is the ideal, Black beauty stylisations can disrupt this ideal as well as the normalisations of Black ugliness. Stylisations can also disrupt ideas that Black ‘mixed-race’ beauty is other if the ideal emerges from Black anti-racist aesthetics’ focus on darker skin and natural, ‘more Afro’ hair. Miss Jamaica World/Universe and ‘browning’ then represent the national variety of possibilities for Black beauty’s embodiments. Embodiments not based solely on the Black/white binary of slavery and Black Nationalism, but on the national valorisation of ‘mixed looks’ as the aesthetic ideal.</p>
<p>Racialised/racialising discourses on beauty/ugliness are always already present in Jamaica and its diaspora and made known in stylisation based on different beauty models. For example, Ada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464700113483250">Wingfield (2008)</xref> shows some of the complexity of Black beauty stylisation and politics when she looks at the work of Black beauty salons in the USA. For her, hair can be straightened either to fit a white hair image or only to make curly hair more controllable; but natural hair styles with African, African American or Jamaican origins – such as canerows,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1464700113483250">7</xref></sup> dreadlocks, afros and braids – show rejection of white-oriented images of beauty and pride in natural Black beauty because of Black Nationalist politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464700113483250">Wingfield, 2008</xref>). The debate on the politics of natural/unnatural hair has been a long-running one in Black Atlantic diaspora communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464700113483250">Banks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483250">Craig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483250">Farris Lewis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464700113483250">Figueiredo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464700113483250">Rooks, 2000</xref>). However, in the Jamaican context, Carolyn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483250">Cooper (2004)</xref> argues that even hair seen as unnatural because it has been straightened, is a wig or is weaved on, is not an imitation of white hair styles but related to re-interpreted African stylisation traditions. African aesthetics reorients iconicity towards Blackness in Jamaica.</p>
<p>Black beauty is complex with as many irresolvable differences as it has embodiments/stylisations. All of its differences are potential reservoirs of shame depending on who judges because beauty is culturally instituted, situated in discourses, maintained by politics and capable of transformation by communal and individual practices. This makes us remember that there is no natural beauty which pre-exists its cultural inscription and that whiteness is not the sole orientation in stylisation or the only available beauty model, as we see from the variety in Jamaica. Further, when we say ‘she is beautiful’, we produce an addressivity which interpellates her and initiates her ‘beautying’ in opposition to that which is deemed ‘ugly’. Beauty and ugliness are performatively produced in and by discourse so it is possible to change the addressivity of beautiful/ugly on the basis of an alternative set of discursively constructed attributes, as is the case in the Afrocentricity of Jamaica’s Rastafarianism and Garveyism. Beauty stylisations as performative reiterations link the psyche and the social when they re-produce or question the ideal of perfection as judgements of beauty are made which lead to esteem or shame. Let us now turn to focus on the performativity of Black beauty shame intensification and its transformative potential in terms of white exclusion.</p>

<p>For the white children in her 1970s Northern England first school represented by Coral here, the phrase ‘Black beauty’ would be oddly troubling, as Black does not go together as easily with beauty as it does with grotesquerie and spectacle, with being a strange <italic>thing</italic> though one which is known as abhorrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483250">Gilman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464700113483250">Hobson, 2003</xref>). Coral shows that beauty is racialised, contingent and fixes bodies in the beautiful/ugly binary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464700113483250">Brand, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483250">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483250">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464700113483250">Nuttall, 2006</xref>). She also shows that beauty is assessed partially in relation to a norm, that such judgement is accomplished through gaze, word and touch and exposes the person being judged to shame because of their constructed ugliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483250">Carroll, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As we see from Coral’s extract, what makes beauty shame possible within the Black/white binary is the stock of beauty value which has been sedimented in our structure of feeling over many centuries. This leads to forms of racialised measurement of beauty and ugliness which intensifies the meaning of the entire surface of racialised bodies. What this meant for Coral and other Black children in her first school was that they could never measure up. As a discourse, ‘not measuring up’ produces racist name calling and being touched by white hands in one’s youth because ‘we’ are not seen as normal. There is almost an entitlement of the ‘normal’ to touch those designated ‘abnormal’. Words and touch in their turn enmeshed her in a bad feeling which attached to Black skin and hair as an affect produced from proximity to a white ideal which would always find her lacking. This leads, as Coral commented, to ‘a lot of Black people start[ing] to get a complex from there’, an acute shaming <italic>sensing</italic> of one’s racialised difference – a shame which is transmitted through words, gaze and touch as one is judged as ‘other’.</p>
<p>Coral’s extract also shows, to quote Sara <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483250">Ahmed</xref>, that shame<disp-quote>
<p>becomes felt as a matter of being – of the relation of self to itself – insofar as shame is about appearance, about how the subject appears before and to others [where the] ‘apartness’ of the subject is intensified in the return of the gaze; apartness is felt in the moment of exposure to others, an exposure that is wounding. (2004: 104--105)</p></disp-quote>The wounding of apartness is felt here by the addressivity as ‘other’ produced by ‘rubber lips’, ‘cotton wool hair’ and touching of the hair as if ‘your hair wasn’t normal’. Further, the wounding of apartness is also felt because these words and actions do not relate to oneself but to a racist past–present sedimented in social, cultural and political life. As such, one is placed as impotent to respond to the distancing of whiteness, to its interpellation as ‘other’, abject. Children like Coral could never just <italic>be</italic> ‘kids’ because the discourse of racialised difference preceded and claimed them as ugly through its addressivity. They were judged as abnormal, the source of white disgust, which transmits itself as shame to those who are judged as ‘ugly’. Subjects are imbricated in this very relationality of white disgust-shame in Jamaica and its diaspora when they reiterate the known of ‘African’ descent ‘ugliness’ visible on skin, hair or face, for example, when Jamaicans insist on the ‘mixed’ ideal as the epitome of beauty. This devaluation of African descent looks, and the necessity for its valorisation, has been the message of Garveyism and Rastafarianism since the 1930s.</p>
<p>For those who are aesthetically devalued, there is a constant necessity to account for themselves in contexts where their abnormality is taken as a given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483250">Carroll, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464700113483250">Taylor, 2000</xref>). Coral’s story shows us that shame adheres to and is reflected by the surface of the Black body. Her narrative and recognition of the impact of her experience as being where she, along with a lot of other Black people, got their ‘thing from about being called rubber lips and cotton wool hair and stuff like that’, make us think again about how words wound and erase our individuality through the racist iteration of name calling. How words can turn her inside out is shown as she reflects on their psychological damage. How words can go from the outside in reflects how they produce shame linked to an assumed Black primitive past and ugliness. This is how the sensing of beauty shame works as it draws on discourses which other and inferiorise to produce the addressivity of ‘the shamed’ and ‘the shameful’.</p>
<p>This interpellation is so powerful that she still talks about it in adult life. Here is something which is interesting about the performativity of shame. It does not recede in the moment when the physical feelings of shame – goose pimples, hot faces, wanting to cry – die down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483250">Probyn, 2005</xref>). Shame as a hyper-reflexivity of the surface of the body re-emerges repeatedly throughout our lives in the moment of recall of the shaming event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464700113483250">Tate, 2009</xref>). Feeling Black beauty shame is related to one’s experience of the self in social bonds, which brings into awareness the imagery that the other rejects the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1464700113483250">Mokros, 1995</xref>). ‘Shame brings the fear of abandonment by society … of being left to starve outside the boundaries of human kind’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464700113483250">Probyn, 2005</xref>: 3). In Coral’s story, shame’s long-term performativity appears through its ability to call up her location on the borders of the savagery with which the history of racialisation imbues cotton wool hair/rubber lips/the right to touch. The pain which she calls her ‘thing’ and other Black people’s complex at once both resists naming shame as well as making it clear because of its un-nameability. Even whilst unnamed, the performative power of shame lies in its ability to reduce one to a stereotype, to an object of derision and distance. Whilst being located through shame as the stereotype, Coral also brings into being what she names through dis-identification. That is, racist actions normalised in the 1970s as a natural reaction to those of Jamaican descent placed as other to the British nation because of ‘race’ and culture.</p>
<p>Alongside this she also unmasks the possible origin of her ‘thing’ as being to do with her early experiences of racism and not <italic>her</italic> own hypersensitivity. Pinpointing how racism works through privileged subjects blaming the other for their problem, Coral denies the positioning of Jamaican heritage people as merely having an unwarranted complex. She does this by highlighting the cause of presumed hypersensitivity as their interpellation as ‘other’ in repeated shaming events. She also dis-identifies from racialised discourses of abnormality, and through this identifies herself as a person with a background, a community, a name. Coral does not allow shame’s performativity to make her the stereotype. Shame’s becoming potentiality is therefore stopped by the words ‘you know like your hair wasn’t normal’. These words also place the racist actions of the white children as abnormal, as strange, as aberrant. What made ‘rubber lips’ and ‘cotton wool hair’ simultaneously empowering – because in being voiced they enabled their rejection – and devastatingly hurtful was that they were related to racist stereotypes which are trans-generational in their scope as they arise from a sedimented racist habitus. As Jamaica and its diaspora fixate on debates on mixedness and a disavowal of Africa, racialised positions of beauty shame are always already present with the possibility for multiple shaming events.</p>
<p>Coral’s shame occurred in her wounding encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483250">Ahmed, 2004</xref>) with others because shame attached itself to the surface of her body, which was positioned as being out of place. Encounters enable one to do or not do shame as shame is itself shaming, because for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464700113483250">Sedgwick</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>shame is peculiarly contagious and peculiarly individuating. One of the strangest features of shame … is the way bad treatment of someone else, someone else’s embarrassment, stigma, debility, bad smell, or strange behavior, seemingly having nothing to do with me, can so readily flood me – assuming that I am a shame-prone person – with this sensation whose very suffusiveness seems to delineate very precise, individual outlines in the most isolating way imaginable. … That’s the double movement shame makes: toward painful individuation, toward uncontrollable relationality. (2003: 36–37)</p></disp-quote>As a result of the ‘painful individuation–uncontrollable relationality’ nexus, Coral carries communal trans-generational beauty shame as well as her own. Her extract shows us this individuation–relationality movement as she talks about this experience as being one of the Black kids at school – ‘we’ – while at the same time being about <italic>her</italic> personal pain. Communal and individual shame is the result of the racialised relationality that is a part of the lives of Jamaican heritage people who live in a society structured by racial dominance, as well as in Jamaica itself where ‘race’ and colour dominance continue within its discourse of mixing. In both contexts there are beauty norms structuring spaces as well as interactions, and there are bodies that fall outside of those norms that make the Black/white/mixed social skin uneasy. Such uneasiness can only be allayed by shaming subjects back into their location of un-belonging.</p>
<p>Possibilities for shame continue within the wider African diasporic and Jamaican heritage communities. Many writers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483250">Collins, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464700113483250">Hunter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464700113483250">Mama, 1995</xref>) have dealt with this in terms of the beauty perceived in light(er) skin and straight(er) hair so that those who are dark(er), for example, always already have shame as a possibility because of the iconicity of whiteness/lightness/mixedness. This is beyond dispute. What has been important to show through Coral’s extract is that such iconicity need not produce subjects who are ‘psychically damaged’ and who ‘dislike being Black’ as is often claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483250">Carroll, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464700113483250">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>). However, what I want to do next is to complicate the Black/white binary in terms of Black beauty shame. I want to turn to look at the possibility for shame <italic>within Black community</italic> among those who are <italic>supposed to be beautiful</italic> because they are light(er) skinned and straight(er) haired. This highlights the fact that they too have to engage in dis-identification in order to nullify Black beauty shame’s exclusion and carve out a space for browning beauty.</p>

</list>In this extract, we see the paradoxes which exist within Black community around hair texture and skin shade from the point of view of two Black British ‘mixed-race’ women of Jamaican descent during the 1990s, at a time when the Jamaican beauty model ‘browning’ had been circulating in the Jamaican diaspora for at least ten years. On the one side for Dana there are Black women who bleach their skin and straighten or weave-on their hair in order to look like her ‘artificially’, but then she cannot be accepted for what she looks like naturally. For Dana, beauty must look natural rather than purchased if it is to be acknowledged as Black beauty, as is indicated here by Tara’s ‘naturally’. This focus on being natural as in devoid of artifice shows the continuing significance of Black anti-racist aesthetics for Dana and Tara. Dana places her would-be shamers outside of the politically correct Black anti-racist aesthetics view of naturalness as integral to beauty because they straighten/weave-on their hair and bleach their skin. These practices place them outside of Black anti-racist aesthetics which valorises natural darker skin and ‘afro’ hair, thus making them politically suspect. Couple this with her assertion that they cannot accept that this is how she looks naturally and we have a positioning of these Black women as other to Dana’s and Tara’s conscious Black beauty politics. Indeed, from their perspective, it is the Black women being spoken about who should feel shame because of their bodily practices.</p>
<p>Dana recognises that she would be more acceptable if she also used artifice – ‘a wig’ or ‘weave’ – so it would be clear that her straighter hair was not real when other Black people pulled it. This is her source of relational shame. To remove the relational shame attached to a body that bears the mark of whiteness there is almost an injunction to share in communal stylisation practices, to perform Black beauty by wig, weave and bleach. Black beauty shame is indeed very tangled and not quite as straightforward as we tend to think if we solely focus on the relationalities produced by the construction of white beauty as iconic. Tara joins the conversation with her own experience of a shaming hair pulling event combined with ‘dirty looks and little remarks’, which both women see as part of the daily lives of Jamaican heritage ‘mixed-race’ women with straight(er) hair and light(er) skin – ‘but it’s something you know I’ve just learned to live with I know that this will happen’. However, even knowing that hair pulling is a form of Black credential checking does not stop Tara from displaying her hair although it could be a source of shame. She does not take her sister’s route and cut her hair short. She dis-identifies from the shame of having naturally straight(er) hair and lighter skin and performs an-other Black beauty which struggles to be recognised and accepted as Black. Here is where beauty rubs up against Black Nationalist politics and the requirements of Black anti-racist aesthetics to deny lighter-skinned and straighter-haired women a place in Black beauty. Instead, they have to learn to live with the possibility of shaming events within Black community because ‘certain Black people are going to behave like that’. Her claim that this is only related to ‘certain Black people’ makes clear that this negativity is not found in the Black community generally. There will be spaces of respite from shame for these women where they can be at ease, accept each other’s looks and be accepted as part of Black beauty <italic>regardless</italic> of their looks. Relational and individual shame lose their grip as women performatively produce other Black beauty addressivities through dis-identification from ‘the shamed’ contained in, ‘But it’s something I’ve learned to live with I know that this will happen. Yeah they won’t stop me leaving my hair out and wearing it long’.</p>
<p>I want to move briefly to look at touch, as both examples spoke about the performative potential of touch to shame one into the position of abject other. Are Dana’s and Tara’s experiences different from Coral’s memory of having her hair touched by white kids because it was not seen as ‘normal’? Those who are doing the touching are Black and those being touched are also Black, but there is a fundamental difference to the affective <italic>effect</italic> of the touch itself. To be abjected by whiteness is a regular Black experience, painful and enduring though it can be. However, to not be permitted entry to Blackness, to be placed as politically suspect, abject, other, because of skin and hair is a different matter. It is different because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483250">Ahmed (2004)</xref> persuasively argues, one feels shame because of a quest for relationality. If one feels part of a Black community and is committed to that, then rejection from that home is felt to one’s very core. Rejection is felt so deeply because our identification possibilities are brought into question. This points to the pervasive impact of beauty norms on identifications, politics and the (im)possibility of non-shaming interactions within Black communities. The struggle for women who are doubly abjected from Black community because of light(er) skin and straight(er) hair which marks them as ‘mixed race’ is to continue to assert their position as Black beauties.</p>
<p>It is almost as if these women are being asked to atone or at least feel guilty for an embodiment that to some people is ‘out of place’ within Black community because of the mark of whiteness. The pull on the hair and the remarks confirm their lack of fit and keep them outside of the Black social skin unless some of their assumed ‘white’ beauty iconicity is removed, in this case represented by Tara’s sister cutting her hair to become an insider. Her sister’s shame at her exclusion from Black community because of its beauty politics led her to take this action, which shows her subjection to its normalisations. She could not move past these limitations as Tara and Dana have done because wanting to belong arrested her movement. Tara and Dana show us the possibility for beauty transformations through shaming events. Simply, if you are always made the abject there must come a point at which enough is enough. Through their dis-identification based on wearing their hair long, exposed and natural, they show us this moment. Their dis-identification disturbs the Black anti-racist aesthetics habitus, even if just momentarily, so that we can see that its social rules are re-inscribed in their dispositions, in how they see themselves and in the extent to which they can see alternative beauty possibilities in, for example, Jamaica’s ‘browning’ beauty model. The process of shame, dis-identification and re-inscription underlies the performativity of Black beauty shame as a moment of beauty transformations. We see this at the level of the nation if we remember Jamaica’s beauty genealogies. These Black beauty transformations challenge politics as they establish new boundaries for, and languages, ideologies and stylisations of, Black beauty so as to negate beauty shame in Jamaica and its diaspora.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1464700113483250" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In Jamaica and its diaspora, Black beauty is not neutral but racialised/racialising, ideological, culturally constructed, societally instituted and always already contains the possibility for shaming judgements. What we have seen in the examples is that Black beauty shame attaches to the body and attempts to speak who we are through performatively producing addressivities of ‘the other’. The intensification of parts of the body such as skin, lips or hair makes one feel shame because of the ‘raced’/racialising habitus in Jamaica and its diaspora, as well as beauty discourses on/of belonging and acceptability. These Black beauty discourses produce addressivities which expect a predetermined response of esteem/shame because of their ‘forcible citation of a norm, one whose complex historicity is indissoluble from relations of discipline, regulation, punishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483250">Butler, 1993</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>The extracts above reveal a self which has surpassed its negation and has re-emerged through dis-identification from the abject addressivities of Black beauty shame. Black beauty shame thus loses the power to turn these women outside in or inside out even whilst they might continue to experience a precarious hyper-reflexivity of the body. This movement beyond shame has been enabled by Black Nationalist discourses on anti-racist aesthetics emanating from Jamaica (Rastafarianism, Garveyism, Black Power) as well as Jamaica’s ‘browning’. These discourses deconstruct beauty and re-construct it as a possibility for all Black women as they call into being Jamaican perspectives on Black beauty removed from the necessity for comparison to the white norm.</p>
