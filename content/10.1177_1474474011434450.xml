<p>This book is a geography of hope. Previous geographical inquiries into mental health care, reflecting their time and place of writing, have invariably offered more sobering assessments with titles such as <italic>Landscapes of Despair</italic>. Parr’s contribution reflects the possibilities of more upbeat post-asylum studies for the new millennium. She draws on a decade of research informed by concerns – methodological as well as empirical – for voice and representation in studies of mental health. Her scant interest in medical services and sites allows her to encounter <italic>people</italic> rather than patients, across a range of everyday spaces.</p>
<p>Parr’s key argument is that people with mental health problems ‘are active in rescripting their own social recoveries from a stigmatising and static figuring of “mental patient” and &amp; their understanding and use of different social spaces is central to this process.’ The book’s opening chapters critically review work on mental (ill)health and social space as well as the way community, inclusion and citizenship are themes that help ‘place’ contemporary experiences of mental (ill)health. Subsequent chapters develop four case studies – rural geographies of mental health, gardening as a route to social inclusion, artistic expression and wellbeing, and on-line geographies of mental health. What makes this book both original and uplifting is its exploration of new understandings of how environments beyond formal health services can not only engage people with mental health problems but also enhance wellbeing.</p>
<p>This richly textured volume (complete with evocative photographs) is a contribution to not only post-asylum geographies, but also geographies of the third sector and social geographies of identity and inclusion. The conclusion is something of a <italic>tour de force.</italic> Parr weaves together themes such as difference, creativity and citizenship, achieving a theoretical synthesis that acknowledges the agency of those who have hitherto lived lives constrained by stereotypes. Her achievement is charting a thoroughly peopled landscape of deinstitutionalisation through highlighting ways of creatively engaging with the lived realities of mental health problems.</p>
