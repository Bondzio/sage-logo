<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The purpose of this review of students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was to summarize the following: (1) academic deficits in math and reading, (2) possible theoretical contributors to these deficits, and (3) psychostimulant interventions that target math and reading, as well as, parallel interventions involving sensory stimulation. <bold>Method:</bold> A comprehensive examination of the literature was conducted on children with ADHD with and without co-occurring disabilities, summarizing their reading and math achievement and the effects of psychostimulant and sensory stimulant interventions on these academic areas. <bold>Results:</bold> Students <italic>without</italic> co-occurring disabilities (ADHD-) had fewer deficits in reading than in math and than students with co-occurring disabilities (ADHD+). Furthermore, students with ADHD+ demonstrated greater responsiveness to psychostimulants through improved reading recognition and math calculations, with limited gains in literal reading comprehension. Added sensory stimulation produced differential gains for both groups in reading recognition and comprehension and in math calculations and problem solving. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The efficacy of psychostimulants was documented on specific areas of achievement for the ADHD+ group, but this review did not support the administration of psychostimulants for students with ADHD-. For both groups of students, differential gains, losses, and habituation were documented in response to sensory stimulation for both subareas within reading and math, which were interpreted as support for the optimal stimulation theory.</p>

<body>
<p>The purpose of this review is to summarize two major areas of academic dysfunction (reading and math) in children with ADHD with and without co-occurring disabilities and to present possible contributors to these deficits and the effects of stimulant interventions on these identified areas. Previously available in the literature were a number of recent reviews on the behavioral/social problems and interventions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1087054711430332">Normand et al., 2011</xref>) and on neuropsychological processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1087054711430332">Nigg, Willcutt, Doyle, &amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2005</xref>). However, for those reviews of academic functioning, most had (a) aggregated across academic areas (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711430332">Berthiaume, 2006</xref>), (b) summarized a variety of interventions across mild disability and unskilled populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1087054711430332">Jitendra, DuPaul, Someko, &amp; Tresco, 2008</xref>), or (c) failed to determine whether the sample studied had a co-occurring academic deficit or learning disability (LD) when evaluating the effects of psychostimulants (e.g., as critiqued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1087054711430332">Pelham, 1986</xref>). Separately reviewing children with ADHD with and without co-occurring LD is important because children with ADHD are more likely to have co-occurring LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711430332">Barbaresi, Katusic, Colligan, Weaver, &amp; Jacobsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711430332">Frazier, Youngstrom, Glutting, &amp; Watkins, 2007</xref>), and LD could be the major factor in assessments of response to intervention.</p>
<p>The relative neglect of these academic and population distinctions is problematic, because children with ADHD, particularly those with attentional problems (the inattentive and the combined subtypes), are more likely to fail in school than are children with the hyperactive and impulsive subtype (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711430332">Baumgaertel, Wolraich, &amp; Dietrich, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711430332">Gathercole &amp; Pickering, 2000</xref>). The importance of attentional problems is further highlighted by evidence that the inattentive and the combined subtypes represent more than three quarters of students with ADHD, a population that represents 8% to 20% of community samples worldwide and an annual average of 9% of children aged 5 to 17 years with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711430332">Akinbami, Liu, Pastor, &amp; Reuben, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711430332">Faraone, Sergeant, Gillberg, &amp; Biederman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-1087054711430332">Wilens, Biederman, &amp; Spencer, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the hyperactive/impulsive subtype may be a developmental precursor of the inattentive or combined subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1087054711430332">Lahey, Pelham, Loney, Lee, &amp; Willcutt, 2005</xref>). This is supported by findings of an increase in identifying the inattentive subtype and a decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity symptomology over a period of 8 years in children ages 4 to 13.</p>
<p>Thus, the above findings argue against nominal classifications of subtypes in this review. Furthermore, we present information along a continuum from clinically diagnosed children to those who were undiagnosed or at risk for ADHD. The decision to aggregate these two groups is based on findings that clinic-referred samples and community samples (i.e., selected from behavioral ratings) were equivalent in characteristics, outcomes, underlying skill deficits, and responses to intervention (for review and data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711430332">Barbaresi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711430332">Epstein, Shaywitz, Shaywitz, &amp; Woolston, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1087054711430332">Merrell &amp; Tymms, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers, Marks, Miller, Newcorn, &amp; Halperin, 2008</xref>). Although differences between these groups are in degree more than in type, clinic-referred samples of children with ADHD are more likely to represent children with co-occurring disabilities (ADHD+, defined in this review as a study with 25% or more children with co-occurring disabilities), whereas community samples are more likely to represent children without co-occurring disabilities (ADHD−, defined as a sample with less than 25% of children with co-occurring disabilities). Most studies have examined students with ADHD+ drawn from convenience samples of clinic-referred children.</p>
<p>In summary, this review will make a distinction between children with and without co-occurring disabilities, between math and reading achievement, and between specific areas within math and reading. This will allow us to determine whether academic deficits and the effectiveness of stimulants can be attributed to ADHD or to the more extreme scores of students with LD. We further selected a comparative assessment of stimulant interventions to document the efficacy of psychostimulants for children with ADHD, as well as the differential effectiveness of sensory stimulation (i.e., visual, auditory, and proprioceptive).</p>

<title>Academic Deficits</title>
<p>The majority of children with ADHD and inattention have academic deficits and school-related problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711430332">APA, 2000</xref>). Indicators of academic deficits are their more frequent use of special education and remedial services, lower grades, 3 times the rate of retention and of dropping out of school, more absences, lower standardized achievement, cumulatively less schooling (e.g., 32% fail to complete high school), and poorer long-term vocational outcomes than comparison peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711430332">Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, &amp; Fletcher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711430332">Frazier et al., 2007</xref>). Although poor academic outcomes have been documented, most researchers agree that educational impairment is secondary to ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711430332">DuPaul, 2007</xref>). Primary academic impairment is more typical of students with learning disabilities (LD) and intellectual disabilities. Therefore, in this review, it is important to determine the degree to which children with ADHD are at risk for these co-occurring disabilities. We have also subdivided reading and math into specific content areas to determine whether these subareas might provide better targets for intervention than previously documented.</p>
<sec id="section2-1087054711430332">
<title>Reading</title>
<p>Reading can be subdivided into fluency (reading accuracy and rate) and comprehension (literal comprehension or recall of “who,” “what,” and “when,” and abstract comprehension involving inferential thinking). Reading accuracy involves translating visual symbols or letters (orthography) into sounds and spoken words (phonology). Phonological problems characterize students with reading disabilities (RD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1087054711430332">Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>), and RD co-occurs at higher rates in students with ADHD (25%-44%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711430332">August &amp; Garfinkel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1087054711430332">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2006</xref>) than is observed in the general population (18%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1087054711430332">Lyon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1087054711430332">Shaywitiz, Morris, &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>). This is about twice the rate than RD is observed in the general population.</p>
<p>In the absence of co-occurring RD, poor decoding due to inadequate phonological skill is not associated with ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711430332">Bental &amp; Tirosh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1087054711430332">Samuelsson, Lundberg, &amp; Herkner, 2004</xref>). Perhaps for this reason, it is not typical of students with ADHD− to have poor reading achievement, or poor recognition of familiar real words (assessed on word identification subtests) or unfamiliar nonwords (pseudowords or nonsense words assessed on word attack subtests; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054711430332">Keulers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1087054711430332">Marzocchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1087054711430332">Rucklidge &amp; Tannock, 2002</xref>). Thus, group differences in reading decoding have more readily been documented when co-occurring RD represents (a) the majority of students with ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711430332">Fischer, Barkley, Edelbrock, &amp; Smallish, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1087054711430332">Zentall, Grskovic, Javorsky, &amp; Hall, 2000</xref>), (b) about half the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711430332">Diaz &amp; Montague, 2006</xref>), or (c) when students were unassessed for risk factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711430332">Barbaresi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1087054711430332">Zentall, Smith, Lee, &amp; Wieczorek, 1994</xref>). However, when studies subgroup students, the combined group (ADHD+) had lower reading decoding scores than students in the ADHD− or the comparison group, who did not differ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711430332">Dykman &amp; Ackerman, 1991</xref>). Thus, reports of inaccurate decoding may be explained by a failure of past research to exclude students at risk for RD (i.e., performing below grade or IQ expectancies).</p>
<p>Speed may provide a more reliable assessment of deficit performance. That is, self-paced computer-presented reading passages were read more slowly by boys with ADHD− (4% with LD) than by comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 1994</xref>). With better controls for at-risk factors, several studies have matched groups on word recognition or covaried reading accuracy. Using these controls, the text was read silently at a slower rate and with greater variability by elementary and adolescent students with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711430332">Ghelani, Sidhu, Jain, &amp; Tannock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1087054711430332">Schuck, 2008</xref>). This slower rate of reading could contribute to findings that students with ADHD were parent-rated as lower in enjoyment and involvement in reading (e.g., free reading) than were comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711430332">Acevedo-Polakovich, Lorch, &amp; Milich, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>More frequently documented for children and adolescents with ADHD− are difficulties with reading comprehension, even when equating groups in reading recognition accuracy, speed, and cognitive skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711430332">Beike &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711430332">Brock &amp; Knapp, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711430332">Ghelani et al., 2004</xref>). Some work assessing ADHD− has reported inferential but not literal comprehension deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711430332">Beike &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>), whereas other work did not find literal or inferential comprehension difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1087054711430332">Miranda, Soriano, &amp; Garcia, 2006</xref>); these differences could be attributed to the nature of the inferential questions assessed in each study. Ghelani et al. reported that poorer comprehension was associated with a slower reading of color and object names but not with naming letters and digits. Differences between these types of measures are in the semantic properties of naming colors and objects, which could explain why statistically partialling out the effects of receptive language eliminated group differences in reading comprehension (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, some difficulties in reading comprehension, not explained by reading recognition, could be explained by difficulties in listening comprehension. This conclusion is consistent with evidence that children with ADHD scored worse in listening comprehension than on tests of reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711430332">Aaron, Joshi, Palmer, Smith, &amp; Kirby, 2002</xref>). In addition, receptive language requirements of holding information in mind may contribute to the nature of reading comprehension deficits in students with ADHD with and without LD. These difficulties are reading passages that (a) are long, (b) have interruptions in the story sequence (e.g., excessive description), or (c) include elements of causality (for review and data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711430332">Beike &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711430332">Cherkes-Julkowski &amp; Stolzenberg, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1087054711430332">Zentall, Cassady, &amp; Javorsky, 2001</xref>). Relaying causal events is necessary to maintain coherence in retelling a story (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1087054711430332">Lorch, Berthiaume, Milich, &amp; van den Broek, 2007</xref>) and is defined by the relatedness of each idea unit to a statement before, after, and to the beginning or ending of the story. Using this metric, students with ADHD− without reading problems were less proficient than comparisons in retelling elements of a story that were interrelated within a sentence-by-sentence context and within the beginning and/or ending elements of a story (i.e., in the control condition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711430332">Beike &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>). The failure of students with ADHD− to retell causal elements from stories has similarly been reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1087054711430332">Miranda et al. (2006)</xref>, who also documented problems in ordering story information. In related literature, students with ADHD+ oppositional defiant disorder were also less likely than comparisons to mention beginning events when telling stories from pictures in books without words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711430332">Flory et al., 2006</xref>; for review of story comprehension more generally, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1087054711430332">Lorch et al., 2007</xref>). The aforementioned difficulties may be related to the failure of this group of children to sustain attention or hold verbal material in mind.</p>
<p>There is further evidence that reading silently (but not aloud) contributes to poorer comprehension for students with ADHD−, with equivalent word reading performance to that of comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711430332">Dubey &amp; O’Leary, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1087054711430332">Schuck, 2008</xref>). This poorer performance cannot be explained by working memory requirements (i.e., students can refer back to the text) nor by a slower rate of reading (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711430332">Ghelani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1087054711430332">Schuck, 2008</xref>). More likely, reading silently involves more frequent skipping of material and less self-monitoring of comprehension. Self-monitoring is important, because it is significantly associated with reading comprehension in low- and high-achieving students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1087054711430332">Kinnunen, Vauras, &amp; Niemi, 1998</xref>). We note that comprehension deficits were not found when silent reading passages were computer presented for students with ADHD− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1087054711430332">
<title>Math</title>
<p>A much higher rate of math learning disabilities (MLD) has been recorded for children with ADHD (31%-60%) than is observed in the general population (6%-7%; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1087054711430332">Mayes &amp; Calhoun, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1087054711430332">Shalev, Auerbach, Manor, &amp; Gross-Tsur, 2000</xref>). In other words, the rate of MLD is about 5 times that of typical students. Furthermore, when students with ADHD advanced in age from 6 to 8 years to 9 to 13 years, a 15-point discrepancies between IQ and calculation test performance increased (but not in reading or spelling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1087054711430332">Nussbaum, Grant, Roman, Poole, &amp; Bigler, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In the area of math calculations, poor performance on an arithmetic subtest is commonly reported for clinic-referred students with ADHD+ (with LD or unassessed for LD) relative to comparisons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711430332">Barkley, DuPaul, &amp; McMurray, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711430332">Fischer et al., 1990</xref>). Specifically, the results reported were poorer timed addition fact efficiency (proportion of items within a set completed correctly) and poorer timed subtraction fact accuracy and efficiency, especially with negative numbers and with borrowing (e.g., consistently subtracting the smaller number from the larger; 43% with conduct disorders [CD], 7% at risk for RD, 14% at risk for spelling disability, 13% with LD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>). Similarly, inaccurate performance characterizes young students with ADHD−, as well as an increased error rate over time on addition, subtraction, and multiplication calculation tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711430332">Bennett, Zentall, French, &amp; Giorgetti-Borucki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>). Such accuracy differences between groups remained when students with ADHD− (19% with co-occurring psychiatric conditions) were given time and one half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1087054711430332">Lewandowski, Lovett, Parolin, Gordon, &amp; Codding, 2007</xref>) and when slower fine motor response skills were statistically controlled (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-1087054711430332">Zentall, 2007</xref>). However, these group differences in accuracy were eliminated when IQ was partialled from the analysis and when assessing middle school students with ADHD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1087054711430332">Zentall, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Difficulties with math procedures (e.g., immature finger counting) have been documented for students with ADHD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>) and ADHD− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1087054711430332">Rubinsten, Bedard, &amp; Tannock, 2008</xref>). Inadequate production also characterizes students with ADHD+, who completed half the number of calculations as comparisons, even when difficulty was individually assigned (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>). Similarly documented for both types of ADHD samples across age levels has been slower retrieval speeds and greater variability (i.e., <italic>SD</italic> scores; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711430332">Dykman and Ackerman (1991)</xref> specifically reported 30% slower speed in simple calculations for students with ADHD (with and without RD) than for comparisons. Group differences in retrieval speed during addition and subtraction cannot be attributed to behavioral interference because off-task differences were observed only during multiplication calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1087054711430332">Zentall, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Mathematical problem solving is also a difficult area for students with ADHD. Math word problems require several complex processes (reading, math language, mental representation of the problem, procedural steps, deriving solutions), all of which need to occur pretty much at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711430332">Desoete, Royers, &amp; DeClercq, 2003</xref>). When reading is statistically partialled out of the analysis, speed does not differentiate between students with ADHD− (4% with LD) and those without ADHD (2% with LD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 1994</xref>). What does differentiate groups is the attentional load of word problem (e.g., single type problem/two different types of operations, same operation/mixed type of problems with an action verb, such as “gave,” and the differences between two quantities) even for those materials presented at students’ preassessed math levels, adjusted by IQ and reading comprehension for children with ADHD− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1087054711430332">Zentall, 1990</xref>). The above attentional-load findings are similar to findings that children with inattention used irrelevant verbal information and selected inappropriate procedures more than comparisons during the performance of word problems with added irrelevant verbal information—not explained by IQ or reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1087054711430332">Marzocchi, Lucangeli, De Meo, Fini, &amp; Cornoldi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1087054711430332">Passolunghi, Marzocchi, &amp; Fiorillo, 2005</xref>). This pattern of performance was different from students with MLD, who had more difficulty with irrelevant numerical information.</p>
<p>To further examine verbal attentional load as a possible contributing factor to problem solving, we used computer control of math word problems and varied the placement of the unknown in the problem while retaining identical vocabulary, content, and problem length. This required a transformation of the order of information (i.e., holding information in mind). Initially, the findings suggested that problem-solving deficits were associated with greater attentional load even when IQ and prior exposure to math were controlled. However, when reading comprehension was entered as a covariate (i.e., excluding at risk for RD factors), group differences only remained in the performance of multiplication word problems with nonverbal concepts (e.g., time, distance, sets), which had also been recorded on group assessments of concepts/applications subtests (LD worse than ADHD−, who performed worse than comparisons; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-1087054711430332">Zentall, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>Contributors to academic deficits</title>
<p>Overall, the academic deficits reported above for students with ADHD have been attributed to insufficient effort applied to task performance. This has recently been framed as a self-regulatory deficit due to impaired executive functions (EF; for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711430332">Barkley, 1997</xref>; for critique, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1087054711430332">Nigg, 2001</xref>). Self-regulation requires the ability to behave effortfully to construct learning goals and to subsequently self-monitor and regulate behavior to meet those goals. Barkley suggested that children with ADHD have a diminished cognitive capacity to self-regulate effort and are unable to delay responding. However, this descriptive model of deficit neurocognitive EF processing does not provide a testable hypothesis. Furthermore, only about 35% to 50% of children have response inhibition deficits, and recent reviews have concluded that EF deficiencies are insufficient as an explanation of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1087054711430332">Nigg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-1087054711430332">Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, &amp; Pennington, 2005</xref>). For example, EF performance can only be shown to correlate at low to moderate levels with various types of regulatory performance and behavior, because random assignment of EF abilities cannot be achieved (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054711430332">Garner, 2009</xref>). In addition, executive dysfunctions (a) are common to many disability groups (e.g., Garner), (b) do not explain the severity of academic impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711430332">Barry, Lyman, &amp; Klinger, 2002</xref>), and (c) are not necessarily responsive to psychostimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson, Baler, &amp; Volkow, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Lack of effort has also been considered a motivational problem—unrelated to cognitive deficiencies. Early work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711430332">Douglas (1985)</xref> proposed that children with ADHD have an unusually strong need for immediate reward (i.e., intolerant of reward delay) and are more vulnerable to the arousing (and distracting) effects of reward. Extensions of this model suggest that the performance of these students will be improved when reinforcers are powerful, frequent, and immediate, and they will be frustrated by the withdrawal of rewards (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1087054711430332">Shiels et al., 2008</xref>). A broader theory of delay aversion has been proposed to explain the failure to self-regulate, which is supported by studies documenting better performance with rapid response requirements (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1087054711430332">Sonuga-Barke, Williams, Hall, &amp; Saxton, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>With even greater parsimony than delay aversion is the optimal stimulation theory, applied to students with ADHD, who were theorized to be physiologically underaroused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-1087054711430332">Zentall, 1975</xref>). When insufficiently aroused, children attempt to self-generate stimulation through increased activity and risk-taking behavior (i.e., sensation-seeking behavior, including aggression, attention to novelty, and increased emotionality; for theory and review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711430332">Banaschewski et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Zentall, 1983</xref>, and for review of a related biochemical dopamine deficiency hypothesis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1087054711430332">Sikstrom &amp; Soderlund, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1087054711430332">Volkow, Wang, Fowler, &amp; Ding, 2005</xref>). Lower physiological arousal can explain “trait” qualities of ADHD, which can be observed, for example, in the greater activity during infancy and during sleep than observed for typically developing children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1087054711430332">Porrino et al., 1983</xref>). Lower arousal can also explain the interaction of trait with state (for review of the nonoptimal state regulation hypothesis, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1087054711430332">Sergeant, Oosterlaan, &amp; van der Meere, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1087054711430332">van der Meere, 1996</xref>). That is, developmental dysfunction in trait arousal would be expected to contribute to a patterned way of responding by these children that would be moderated by changes in the stimulation available in concurrent tasks and settings.</p>
<p>Although all individuals need an optimal level of arousal to selectively attend and maintain attention to relevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711430332">Cooley &amp; Morris, 1990</xref>), the arousal and biochemically based explanations suggest that the activation of students with ADHD may be insufficient. Students with ADHD are thereby drawn to salient stimulation, are less able to suppress attention to “nonrelevant” information/stimulation, and fail to attend to neutral or deep-structure features or details. Thus, the attentional “deficit” of students with ADHD could be more accurately termed an “attentional bias.” For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1087054711430332">Passolunghi et al. (2005)</xref> reported that these children were better able than their peers to recall nonrelevant problem information. Unfortunately, attempting to take in more stimulation focuses attention to the surface features of problems. For example, students with ADHD fail to attend to the deep structure of math concepts, even though group differences in math computation ability and IQ were statistically controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, children who focus on the deeper structure of problems have better conceptual knowledge and greater procedural skill to apply to new problems (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1087054711430332">Kercood, Zentall, &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>). Insufficient arousal further contributes to difficulties sustaining attention during later task performance (i.e., more rapid habituation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1087054711430332">Sergeant, Geurts, Huijbregts, Scheres, &amp; Oosterlaan, 2003</xref>), especially during repetitive or familiar tasks. Insufficient arousal also increases the likelihood of intrusions (internal or external distractions) during task performance, which are typically manifested as attentional lapses and response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, there are several explanations for the academic deficits of students with ADHD. Most of these relate to an apparent lack of “effort” that has consistently been documented by reduced production, greater variability, and reduced speed. This lack of effort has been attributed to cognitive deficiencies (i.e., lack of ability to self-regulate and handle delay) and to motivational deficiencies (i.e., abnormal responses to reward/punishment and to delay). These motivational theories can be subsumed within the theory of inadequate physiological activation. That is, the punishing aspects of delay (failure to inhibit responses) can be explained by the fact that (a) delay requires ceasing action as well as curtailing motor or verbal stimulation, (b) fast event rates increase arousal through increased stimulus input, and (c) failure to delay reward can be attributed to the appetitive effects of reward, as well as of stimulation. In other words, continuous reward, “smaller sooner” rewards, and fast event rates may normalize response speed and variability in children with ADHD by functioning like added stimulation, whereas partial schedules, “later larger rewards,” and slow event rates involve less reward/feedback but also less ongoing stimulation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1087054711430332">Marco et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the viability of any theory depends on continued empirical validation. In this review, we have predicted that students with ADHD should respond to added biochemical and sensory stimulation with greater improvements than observed for comparisons and to habituate more rapidly to ongoing sensory stimulation. We also propose that added stimulation placed on nonrelevant task features will disrupt their performance, because these children are attracted to stimulation and do not initially discriminate between what is relevant versus nonrelevant (i.e., practice moderates these initial effects). In sum, trait differences should interact with state differences producing greater vulnerability to the possible arousing and distracting effects of stimulation (i.e., differential responses to tasks and settings). We propose that these differential positive and negative effects are best examined in an assessment of sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, active responding) and with group designs, because studies assessing psychostimulants or using single-participant designs rarely include typical children. However, the literature on psychostimulants does provide an assessment of efficacy, and single-participant research provides an assessment of the generality of stimulation effects.</p>

<title>Psychostimulant Effects</title>
<p>“Psychostimulant drugs, particularly methylphenidate (MPH), are the most commonly prescribed drugs in children for the treatment of ADHD” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054711430332">Grizenko, Bhat, Schwartz, Ter-Stephanian, &amp; Joober, 2006</xref>, p. 47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-1087054711430332">Wilens &amp; Biederman, 1992</xref>). Stimulants such as d-amphetamine (d-AMPH), MPH, and atomoxetine (Strattera) enhance catecholamine activity (noradrenergic and dopaminergic) in the central nervous system by increasing the availability or blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine in presynaptic neurons, thus enhancing the neurotransmission of impulses and brain activation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1087054711430332">Grizenko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1087054711430332">McNab et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-1087054711430332">Wilens &amp; Spencer, 2000</xref>). Dopamine is a neurotransmitter signaling the brain that a stimulus is salient and relevant, thus “motivating the individual to engage in the task and improving attention and performance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1087054711430332">Volkow et al., 2005</xref>, p. 1412). Although psychostimulant drugs are effective in most cases, some children are not good candidates for medications (e.g., “patients who have comorbidities that are contraindicated for stimulant use based on medical issues and/or risk for stimulant abuse”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1087054711430332">Wigal, 2009</xref>, p. 21). Nonstimulant medications are available for those children. The nonstimulant medications include atomoxetine, clonidine, guanfacine, desipramine, deprenyl, and bupropion (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1087054711430332">Rains &amp; Scahill, 2006</xref>). However, this review will focus on the more extensively studied psychostimulants, which are considered a “first-line treatment” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1087054711430332">Wigal, 2009</xref>, p. 28).</p>
<p>Also, for the purposes of this review, we have set aside the well-documented improvements in classroom behavior (activity, on task, rule following) and in neurocognitive functions (e.g., attention, paired associate learning, short-term memory; for recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>). Findings from that review yielded specific gains on laboratory tasks that required repeated motor, cognitive, or attentional responses. However, tasks that require cognitive strategies, flexibility, planning, and inhibitory control were less likely to yield performance gains attributable to stimulant drugs and may actually result in performance losses especially at high dose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>). Although these cognitive and behavioral gains should lead to increments in student effort and readiness to learn, the efficacy of stimulants on achievement has not been well documented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Overall achievement</title>
<p>Lower rates of school absenteeism and retention correlate with psychostimulant intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711430332">Barbaresi et al., 2007</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers et al., 2008</xref>, who did not find significant differences between medicated and nonmedicated samples in retention rates). These authors did report, however, that a long-term course of medication (i.e., 1 year or more) produced higher grade-point averages in high school—albeit in ADHD samples that may have had an initially more positive clinical response to medication than never-medicated or minimally medicated participants. More reliable evidence of the effects of stimulant medication over placebo has been documented in classroom performance (e.g., school and homework assignment accuracy, percentage of assignments completed within a time period, quiz and test performance, academic ratings by teachers) often in combination with ongoing behavioral intervention and typically for children academically below grade level or with co-occurring disabilities (for a review of achievement and classroom measures, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711430332">Elia, Welsh, Gullotta, &amp; Rapoport, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1087054711430332">Pelham et al., 1993</xref>). These classroom measures were combined across subject areas and reported to be more robust than findings assessed using achievement test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711430332">Forness, Kavale, &amp; Crenshaw, 1999</xref>). The reduced efficacy for achievement data could be explained by the practice of aggregating achievement rather than separating out academic subareas. Thus, a more specific analysis of the effects of psychostimulant medication on different types of reading and math performance will be presented.</p>

<title>Reading performance</title>
<p>Assessments of students with ADHD− in the area of reading decoding have failed to find medication effects on overall reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711430332">Gittelman, Klein, &amp; Feingold, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1087054711430332">Richardson, Kupietz, Winsberg, Maitinsky, &amp; Mendell, 1988</xref>) or on the rate and accuracy of decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711430332">Ballinger, Varley, &amp; Nolen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1087054711430332">Sutcliffe, Bishop, Houghton, &amp; Taylor, 2006</xref>), even when controlling for initial reading levels and IQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711430332">Forness, Swanson, Cantwell, Youpa, &amp; Hanna, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>However, for ADHD samples of children with co-occurring LD or unassessed LD, early reviews documented gains in 7 of the 14 studies with a reading measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1087054711430332">Schachar &amp; Tannock, 1993</xref>), yet teacher-rated gains that were validated by achievement data or gains that were sustained over time were reported in only 2 of these studies. The inconsistency of these findings may be explained by the failure to subgroup children with and without LD. More recent work that has separated ADHD− from ADHD+ groups has documented short-term gains for students with ADHD+ (not for the ADHD− group) in (a) accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1087054711430332">Sumner et al., 2009</xref>), (b) accuracy plus speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054711430332">Keulers et al., 2007</xref>), and (c) increased speed (not accuracy) for students with ADHD+ (28% receiving special education services; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1087054711430332">Wigal et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, on specific assessments of phonics or nonwords, only students with ADHD+ demonstrated medication-based gains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711430332">Gittelman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1087054711430332">Keulers et al., 2007</xref>). The specificity of these effects is supported by the failure to find medication effects on phonics assessments for students with ADHD− (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711430332">Balthazor, Wagner, &amp; Pelham, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1087054711430332">Richardson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1087054711430332">Sutcliffe et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In classroom studies that often involve ongoing behavioral interventions, students with ADHD+ make gains in reading accuracy and production on a timed oral reading task in response to stimulants over placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1087054711430332">Pelham, Walker, Sturges, &amp; Hoza, 1989</xref>). In a similar classroom study but without ongoing behavioral interventions, 49% of the sample of boys with ADHD and CD showed 25% fewer oral reading errors on individually graded passages while on medication compared with placebo, with a 17% adverse responder rate (i.e., children with a 10% or more increased error rate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711430332">Forness, Swanson, Cantwell, Guthrie, &amp; Sena, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>In reading comprehension, there are requirements to identify words, as well as to translate decoded text into meaningful sequences of information to understand or encode written language. The effects of stimulants on students with ADHD− have generally failed to document improvements in reading comprehension across a range of individually administered reading achievements tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711430332">Ballinger et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711430332">Gittelman et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1087054711430332">Richardson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1087054711430332">Wigal et al., 2010</xref>), as well as on assessments of classroom skill series workbooks while statistically controlling IQ and initial reading levels and in the absence of ongoing behavioral treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711430332">Forness, Swanson, Cantwell, Youpa, et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the weight of evidence fails to document gains in reading comprehension for children with ADHD−, there is limited evidence to the contrary. That is, students with ADHD with <italic>and</italic> without RD made reading comprehension gains, albeit gains for the co-occurring group were greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1087054711430332">Sumner et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, assessments were administered 4 times over a 16-week course of medication, and the repeated nature of these assessments may have contributed to their sensitivity to medication. More support for medication can be found in the related literature on listening comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711430332">Francis, Fine, &amp; Tannock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1087054711430332">McInnes, Bedard, Hogg-Johnson, &amp; Tannock, 2007</xref>). (Note that in these studies, gains were not found in comprehension when stories were accompanied by pictures or when sentences were assessed with pictured stimuli.)</p>
<p>Reading comprehension gains have been recorded for children with ADHD+ (i.e., consistent “medication responders” with co-occurring conduct or oppositional disorders; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711430332">Forness, Swanson, Cantwell, Youpa, et al., 1992</xref>) and for combined groups of children with ADHD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1087054711430332">Wigal et al., 2011</xref>). Also on repeated daily workbook types of assignments (in combination with behavioral treatments), significant improvements were made in the number attempted and proportion of timed reading comprehension questions answered correctly over placebo for students with co-occurring disorders or academically below grade level (for review and data, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711430332">Balthazor et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1087054711430332">Pelham, Bender, Caddell, Booth, &amp; Moorer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1087054711430332">Pelham et al., 1989</xref>).

Of these two subareas, psychostimulant medication shows consistent positive outcomes on calculations for children with ADHD+ (co-occurring LD, MLD, or RD, at least a quarter attending special classes, unassessed for LD, or at risk and performing below grade level in academic subjects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711430332">Brams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711430332">Douglas, Barr, O’Neill, &amp; Britton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711430332">Dykman &amp; Ackerman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1087054711430332">Pelham et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1087054711430332">Silva et al., 2006</xref>). In these studies, gains reported were documented in effort ratings and in decreased time or a greater number of math calculations attempted and solved correctly per minute and within 10 min (math efficiency). Increased accuracy (25%-30% over placebo) has been documented as well, with increased addition and subtraction percentage correct with and without borrowing or carrying. Positive findings, such as these, have also been assessed on individualized daily worksheets and recorded as more problems attempted, fewer omission errors, and greater accuracy on addition plus subtraction facts, addition involving carrying, subtraction involving borrowing (not in simple subtraction, multiplication, or division), and on the accuracy of problems with mixed procedures (calculating and then judging odd/even) for students with ADHD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711430332">Elia et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1087054711430332">Rubinsten et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1087054711430332">Tannock, Schachar, Carr, &amp; Logan, 1989</xref>). For 93% of those children with ADHD+, a shift in procedures from using fingers and loud verbalizations to silent fact retrieval has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1087054711430332">Tannock et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Time effects have been assessed in samples unassessed for LD. For example, gains were reported in the number of math problems correct relative to a placebo group of students, whose academic performance decreased over time (0-7.5 hr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1087054711430332">Swanson, Kinsbourne, Roberts, &amp; Zucker, 1978</xref>). Also, when students with ADHD were administered problems at an individualized difficulty level, stimulants increased the number of pencil/paper math problems attempted and number correct relative to placebo in as little as 1 hr post ingestion but not at later time periods (9, 10, 11, or 12 hr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1087054711430332">Silva et al., 2006</xref>). Overall, the efficiency of working on simple math problems has been improved without increasing the total amount of time children dedicate to on-task behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711430332">Douglas, Barr, Amin, O’Neill, &amp; Britton, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>However, when combined with behavioral interventions, computational accuracy gains have been documented in response to medication interventions for students with ADHD, with and without LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711430332">Elia et al., 1993</xref>). Another study <italic>without</italic> ongoing behavioral interventions failed to find gains in computation for an ADHD− group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1087054711430332">Rubinsten et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1087054711430332">Pelham et al. (1989)</xref> also failed to find gains in accuracy or production on a 2-min timed, classroom math calculations task, although this duration may be insufficient to assess group differences on attentional tasks, such as computations. For children with ADHD+, medication does not reduce specific errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711430332">Benedetto-Nasho &amp; Tannock, 1999</xref>); however, there is evidence of an increase in self-corrected errors in response to psychostimulants for this group (25% with co-occurring LD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711430332">Douglas et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>No assessments of math problem solving were found. Related literature with a problem-solving word-finding puzzle has documented improved persistence for medicated boys under failure conditions (insolvable puzzles) relative to boys with ADHD under placebo conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1087054711430332">Milich, Carlson, Pelham, &amp; Licht, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Sensory Stimulation Effects</title>
<p>The use of sensory stimulation may be one of the least well-recognized approaches to intervention. Added stimulation involves physical changes within tasks (e.g., added color, music, animations, content novelty) and increased requirements for active physical and social responding. In the following review of the effects of these variables on reading and math, we have set aside the differential gains documented for students with ADHD in response to high stimulation reported during the performance of attention tasks and during spelling and handwriting academic tasks (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-1087054711430332">Zentall, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-1087054711430332">2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section11-1087054711430332">
<title>Reading performance</title>
<p>Because decoding involves a symbol-to-sound translation process, most intervention studies “explicitly teach application of phonological rules” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1087054711430332">Lyon, 1996</xref>, p. 65). This is important for students with RD, as well as for those at risk for RD, who are equivalent in characteristics, underlying skill deficits, and response to intervention to those with RD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711430332">Fletcher, Blair, &amp; Scott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1087054711430332">Shaywitz, Morris, &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Although students with ADHD− are as accurate (but not as fast) as their peers in decoding words, added visual stimulation has been documented to improve decoding accuracy. That is, students with ADHD− read aloud as accurately as their classmates (with no effect on speed or comprehension) with color overlaid on the last two thirds of a standardized reading test, and their accuracy was lower than their peers only in the black-on-white condition (i.e., their performance was normalized by the color added; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, when reading silently, blue-colored overlays improved the reading recognition of students with ADHD+ relative to the performance of the non-ADHD group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054711430332">Iovino, Fletcher, Breitmeyer, &amp; Foorman, 1998</xref>). Unlike color stimulation, novel font plus style changes (e.g., outline, bold, shadow) added to words were not effective in improving oral reading for students with ADHD+ in single-participant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711430332">Belfiore, Grskovic, Murphy, &amp; Zentall, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Some single-participant research has combined different types of stimulation in computer-assisted instruction (CAI). However, most of this work involves increased information (instruction and immediate feedback), in addition to stimulation (color, animation, active involvement, self-pacing). These combinations improve oral reading fluency relative to baseline (small-group instruction and seatwork) for students with ADHD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711430332">Clarfield &amp; Stoner, 2005</xref>). Similarly, college students with attention disorders read with fewer self-reported mind wanderings and read faster, with 40% showing increments in comprehension, while using a CAI reading program with auditory and visual input stimulation as well as color-highlighted text that guided visual tracking from left to right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1087054711430332">Hecker, Burns, Elkind, Elkind, &amp; Katz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Color has also been added late to reading comprehension tasks and the positive effects depend on whether the stories were read silently. That is, when color overlaid the last third of the stories that were read aloud, it did not alter reading speed or comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 2000</xref>). However, when stories were read silently, color-added-late to text (2nd third highlighted with pastels and the last 3rd third highlighted with fluorescents) improved immediate and across-session reading comprehension performance of students with ADHD+ relative to the noncolor condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711430332">Belfiore et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, when reading silently, red-colored overlays improved the reading comprehension specifically of students with ADHD+ more than no overlays and differentially more than the non-ADHD group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1087054711430332">Iovino et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>An important caveat of this research is that students’ responsiveness to added color stimulation lost impact over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711430332">Belfiore et al., 1996</xref>), consistent with prior evidence that these students habituate to stimuli more rapidly than peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1087054711430332">Sergeant et al., 2003</xref>). To address this problem, we considered the possibility that habituation would be less likely to occur with added cognitive or content novelty. Those cognitive variables that increase arousal are, for example, surprise, novelty, incongruity, and complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711430332">Berlyne, 1961</xref>). Using this variable of high-content novelty added to reading materials, we predicted that it would increase physiological activation sufficiently to enhance attention for students with ADHD and could combat fatigue associated with skill deficits for students with RD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711430332">Beike &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>). Novelty was defined as active verbs, unfamiliar characters, surprising story endings, and vivid adjectives. Boys with ADHD responded differentially better to high than to low novelty conditions relative to comparisons—primarily in abstract comprehension (what was a character feeling and best name for the story) and on all assessments of causality—all with large effect sizes, but not on literal comprehension (“who” and “what” questions where these children do not have difficulty). (Students in the RD group also scored better in the high than in the low condition on abstract comprehension questions and on one causality question.)</p>
<p>In addition, active responding appears to have differential effects on reading comprehension. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1087054711430332">Schuck (2008)</xref> reported that reading aloud on individually graded reading passages normalized the comprehension performance of students with ADHD− relative to comparison students. These gains were not attributable to reading rate, because all the students read more slowly during the silent than aloud condition. Furthermore, these findings parallel single-participant research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711430332">Dubey and O’Leary (1975)</xref>, who reported that students with ADHD+ (delayed reading comprehension) performed with significantly fewer errors (skipping words, phrases, and lines) and with improved reading comprehension when they read stories aloud in contrast to reading silently. Related research has also documented differential gains in listening comprehension assessed in the active condition retelling stories prior to answering comprehension questions but not in the nonactive condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 2001</xref>). Overall, we attribute the gains from verbal activity to increased arousal produced by speaking aloud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1087054711430332">Smith, Malmo, &amp; Shagass, 1954</xref>), although alternative explanations could be self-monitoring comprehension or that restating events activates the memory of earlier events for children who typically focus on final story events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1087054711430332">Milch-Reich, Campbell, Pelham, Connelly, &amp; Geva, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although content novelty can produce differential gains, increased proprioceptive stimulation (activity) does not. For example, in reading recognition tasks, all the children with co-occurring disabilities (more than 50% were from special classes in the ADHD and non-ADHD groups) attempted more words and read with greater accuracy in an active condition (holding and flipping word cards to be read) than in a passive condition (teacher control of word cards; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Meyer, 1987</xref>). There were differential attention and behavioral gains (impulsive errors, talking/noise making, activity) in the active conditions for the ADHD+ group, but there were no differential reading decoding gains.</p>

<title>Math performance</title>
<p>Adding visual stimulation to rote calculation tasks can be an effective intervention. For example, in single-participant research assessing children with ADHD+ (a) addition problems were each printed on brightly colored cards, which increased calculation production relative to performance on gray cards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1087054711430332">Lee &amp; Asplen, 2004</xref>), and (b) color-highlighted operation signs improved math accuracy relative to a nonhighlighted condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1087054711430332">Kercood &amp; Grskovic, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, such performance gains can be differentially effective. That is, more correct addition problems were produced in a 20-min session during the high within-task stimulation condition (colored numbers and movement) than in a low stimulation condition (black numbers on a gray computer screen) for students with ADHD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1087054711430332">Lee &amp; Zentall, 2002</xref>). Differential performance losses were also documented in a follow-up study. That is, students completed fewer problems when competing environmental stimulation was presented (cartoons on an adjacent monitor) than in the “gray” adjacent monitor condition.</p>
<p>An alternative type of visual stimulation (transitional values and information from the light source, such as contrasts, transparencies, shadows, highlights) was added to geometric figures to be calculated and compared with a control condition with geometric figures presented with the same color but with only a single value and no input from the light source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1087054711430332">Kang &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>). In support of predictions, students with ADHD−, who performed equivalently to their peers on a geometry pretest, actually performed better than comparisons in the high-intensity image condition with a large effect size.</p>
<p>Adding auditory stimulation also has important effects. Elementary boys with ADHD+ and comparisons completed a 10-min math calculation task under three conditions: high stimulation (self-selected music), low stimulation (speech recording), and no stimulation (silence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711430332">Abikoff, Courtney, Szeibel, &amp; Koplewicz, 1996</xref>). Boys with ADHD performed more problems with greater accuracy with background music than with silence (or with speech)—effects not found for comparison peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711430332">Abikoff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1087054711430332">Scott, 1970</xref>). The benefits of music on math production have also been reported for children with behavioral problems, especially for those with high levels of “stimulus-seeking and over-activity, closely resembling the ‘hyperactivity syndrome,’” according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1087054711430332">Hallam and Price (1998</xref>, p. 90). The generality of these effects has also been reported. That is, 30% of children with ADHD and co-occurring disorders in a summer program demonstrated significant improvements in completing “academic seatwork” in the presence of background music relative to comparisons, who did not show similar gains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1087054711430332">Pelham et al., 1994</xref>, cited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711430332">Abikoff et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, adolescents, who performed math operations with music recorded from a local rock station, no longer differed from their peers in math calculation performance—an outcome that was different from the authors’ expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711430332">Fischer et al., 1990</xref>). In other words, the stimulation “distractor” served to eliminate group differences rather than to exacerbate group differences as expected. Related research documented that nonlinguistic auditory stimulation (white noise) can improve performance on a memory task relative to no noise for students with ADHD+ (half from special-needs schools) while disrupting the performance of the comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1087054711430332">Soderlund, Sikstrom, &amp; Smart, 2007</xref>). Students with ADHD− also self-reported preferences for more noise and talking during math than did comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Although music and white noise appear to have beneficial effects, ambient classroom noise plus conversations can be detrimental to math, especially for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Shaw, 1980</xref>). That is, young children with ADHD completed fewer math problems correctly in the high conversational noise than in the low noise condition. This finding was discussed in terms of the overlapping of conversations with thinking and is consistent with findings that young children reported fewer preferences for noise and talking than older children while performing math word problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Combinations of visual and auditory stimulation have been assessed in a computer-administered math calculations task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711430332">Bennett et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, students with ADHD− were as accurate as their peers in cross-modal conditions (spoken problems with visual multiple-choice answers) and less accurate than peers under same-modality conditions (visual problems with visual answers). That is, input from visual and auditory sources normalized their performance.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, CAI also involves combinations of stimulation (individual rapid pacing, active engagement, practice with multiple sensory input) and increased information derived from behavioral interventions (instructional objectives, incentives, immediate feedback/reinforcement, small chunks of academic material; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711430332">DuPaul &amp; Stoner, 2003</xref>). One of the first studies using CAI with students with ADHD was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1087054711430332">Kleiman, Humphrey, and Lindsay (1981)</xref>, who reported that students with ADHD completed twice as many math problems on the computerized task as they did on a pencil and paper task. (Accuracy was not measured or reported.) More recent work has examined math performance in single-participant research with ADHD+ students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1087054711430332">Mautone, DuPaul, &amp; Jitendra, 2005</xref>). All participants correctly completed more digits per minute and allocated more engaged time. When competition and animation stimulation in the form of games were added to math practice tasks, increased gains were also observed for the ADHD+ students in CAI single-participant research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1087054711430332">Ota &amp; DuPaul, 2002</xref>). Reported in this study were improved math performance (accuracy and number of problems completed) and increased engaged time over baseline conditions (teacher instruction, independent seatwork, paper and pencil activities, and one-on-one instruction, when needed). These performance gains are in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al. (2011)</xref>, who concluded from their review that rapid tasks with feedback, such as video games, should produce larger dopamine increases than would slow or repetitive memory and attentional tasks.</p>
<p>Social stimulation has been added to CAI programs in the form of working with a partner in a game format with animated concepts. Such combinations yielded increased attention to math (and reading) for students with ADHD than during a program with only drill and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711430332">Ford, Poe, &amp; Cox, 1993</xref>). Although performance was not reported in this study, students with ADHD− have self-reported preferences for working with others during calculation performance more often than comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>). Similarly, classwide peer tutoring (CWPT) also involves increased social stimulation, with the entire class divided into two teams with individuals taking turns tutoring one another (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1087054711430332">Greenwood, Carta, &amp; Hall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1087054711430332">Greenwood, Horton, &amp; Utley, 2002</xref>). Correct responding by the tutee on the first attempt achieves 2 points, whereas incorrect responding achieves feedback and another chance to answer the question for 1 point. Moderate effects for children with ADHD have been documented in response to CWPT on weekly calculation test performance in single-participant and small-sample ABAB reversal designs (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711430332">DuPaul et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The area of math problem solving has a smaller empirical base assessing the effects of sensory stimulation. In single-participant research, improved accuracy and reduced variability have been reported under conditions requiring students with ADHD+ to read math problems aloud and then write answers rather than just writing the answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1087054711430332">Lovitt &amp; Curtiss, 1968</xref>). Also in single-participant research, students with ADHD+ attempted more written word problems and showed improved accuracy when provided with proprioceptive stimulation (puzzle toy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1087054711430332">Kercood, Grskovic, Lee, &amp; Emmert, 2007</xref>) and in a generality assessment using taped math word problems in a classroom setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1087054711430332">Kercood &amp; Grskovic, 2010</xref>). In group designs where differential effects can be assessed, the effects of yellow-highlighting keywords (e.g., units of measure) were assessed. Differentially a slower rate of production and improved problem-solving performance were documented for children with ADHD− when their materials were first presented with highlighting followed by nonhighlighted materials relative to the opposite order and performance of comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1087054711430332">Kercood, Zentall, Vinh, &amp; Zentall, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Reading</title>
<p>RD occur at twice the rate in ADHD than in comparison samples. Perhaps for this reason, most research documenting group differences in decoding accuracy (word identification of real words and nonwords) have included students with RD or at risk for RD in their samples. When students with ADHD do not have overlapping RD, their difficulties are in encoding rather than decoding, although variability and slower silent reading have been documented for this ADHD− group. In the area of reading comprehension, differences between students with ADHD− and comparisons occur during the performance of long, descriptive reading passages that are read silently, without computer support, and that have interruptions in the sequence of the narrative or that require retelling the order of information or the interrelatedness of ideas across distal story elements (causality).</p>
<p>Preliminary evidence of specific difficulties with inferential story comprehension questions has been documented for the ADHD− group but not for literal, “who” and “what” types of questions. These specific difficulties may be related to sustaining attention over time to hold information in mind to look forward and backward in the text that would be needed to understand causal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1087054711430332">Marzocchi et al., 2008</xref>). Successful readers are able to monitor and regulate these sustained attentional resources for ongoing comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1087054711430332">Keene &amp; Zimmermann, 1997</xref>). Group differences in reading comprehension were obviated, when receptive language was statistically controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-1087054711430332">Zentall et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that verbal working memory or sustained auditory attention may contribute to deficits in reading and listening comprehension, and in retelling stories from pictures while alluding to earlier and later elements in the story.</p>
<sec id="section15-1087054711430332">
<title>Psychostimulants and reading performance</title>
<p>For students with ADHD−, psychostimulants are not effective in altering the accuracy of reading words or nonwords, and the “true” deficits of speed and variability have not been assessed in response to medication. Also in the area of reading comprehension, gains in response to psychostimulants have rarely been documented for students with ADHD−. Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1087054711430332">Sumner et al., 2009</xref>) reported gains in reading comprehension in four repeated assessments. However, in the area of listening comprehension, students with ADHD− have been reported to make gains (i.e., in scientific explanations and identifying characters’ actions and emotions), as long as the stimulus materials were not pictures (i.e., confounding stimulant medication with visual stimulation).</p>
<p>In contrast to the ADHD− group, students with co-occurring disabilities made consistent gains on standardized reading assessments (reading words and nonwords, speed, and on daily classroom reading assignments). In classroom studies, medication interventions combined with ongoing reading instruction also yielded gains in reading accuracy for 49% of one combined sample. Similarly, improved reading comprehension has been documented on standardized assessments and on daily, workbook assignments. Specific gains for these ADHD+ groups have been in the number of questions attempted and the proportion of literal (recall) comprehension questions answered correctly when also provided with ongoing individualized instruction, but not in inferential comprehension nor on homework assignments. However, only about 18% of students with ADHD (positive medication responders combined with and without LD) showed at least a 25% medication gain in silent reading comprehension over placebo.</p>
<p>Finally, we address long-term gains in reading achievement, which show promise in recent studies. Early longitudinal assessments reported initial gains that were no longer in evidence at 24- or 36-month assessments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1087054711430332">MTA Cooperative Group, 2007</xref>). Recent work yields long-term gains in real words and nonwords with IQ statistically controlled for ADHD+ conduct/oppositional disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, mean reading achievement gains (comparable with increments of 0.29 school years) were associated with continued use of medication for students with ADHD and unreported LD status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1087054711430332">Scheffler et al., 2009</xref>). However, these samples of students who continued use of medication may have had an initially more positive clinical response to medication than an unmedicated or minimally medicated group of children with ADHD.</p>

<sec id="section16-1087054711430332">
<title>Sensory stimulation and reading performance</title>
<p>Color overlays have been used to improve the decoding accuracy and reading comprehension of students with ADHD with and without LD. Also, color added toward the end of reading passages has differentially improved the oral reading accuracy of students with ADHD− and improved the comprehension of students with ADHD+. Increased arousal can also be achieved by novelty added to the content of stories (e.g., active verbs, unfamiliar characters, surprising endings). Under these high novelty conditions—relative to low—students with ADHD− differentially answered questions that assessed inferential comprehension and causality better than comparisons. Increased silent reading speed has also been documented for ADHD− college students in response to CAI programs that used color to guide tracking (added stimulation + guided practice).</p>
<p>Research has also examined active responding (proprioceptive stimulation) within the context of reading. Fewer decoding errors when reading aloud for the ADHD+ group than reading silently and increased comprehension for the ADHD− and ADHD+ groups relative to comparisons have been documented. Similar gains in response to CAI reading programs for college students have been documented for combined auditory and visual input plus visual tracking (i.e., increased stimulation and color-guided practice).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-1087054711430332">
<title>Math</title>
<p>Inaccurate math performance characterizes children with ADHD+. In fact, MLD occurs at about 5 times the rate for children with ADHD as for typical students. Inaccurate performance occurs specifically during (a) multiplication, (b) subtraction with the procedural requirements for borrowing, and (c) computer-presented problems in the same modality as answers (visual computations and visual answers). Across groups with and without co-occurring LD and across age levels up through middle school, the retrieval speed of math calculations is slower, more variable, and with fewer problems attempted than documented for comparisons. Also for both groups, there are difficulties sustaining sufficient attention to math practice to develop automated fact retrieval that is not reliant on finger counting. Specific difficulties with math procedures are those that require holding information in mind (e.g., for borrowing, negative numbers). Overall, students with ADHD- appear to be similar but less severe in math performance deficits than students with ADHD+. For example, inaccurate performance has been documented only for young students with ADHD− and not for middle school students with ADHD−.</p>
<p>In the area of math problem solving, slower word problem performance has been attributed to reading recognition, whereas inaccurate performance appears to be related to factors that underlie reading comprehension (verbal working memory), especially for the ADHD+ group. When these factors have been statistically or procedurally controlled, remaining group differences are related to problems with (a) attentional selectivity when irrelevant verbal information has been added, (b) shifting sets between two types of operations or actions, and (c) directing attention to deep-structure information (e.g., math concepts).</p>
<sec id="section18-1087054711430332">
<title>Psychostimulants and math performance</title>
<p>Assessments of math calculations (i.e., increased accuracy, number attempted, effort ratings, self-corrected errors, efficiency per unit of time, reduced omission errors) were consistently improved by stimulant medication assessed on standardized measures and on daily classroom assignments for students with ADHD+. Accuracy gains were specifically found for those procedures requiring working memory (e.g., addition with carrying, subtraction involving borrowing, mixed procedures of calculating and judging odd/even, decreased finger counting). Two studies examined students with ADHD with and without LD; one reported gains only for the ADHD+ group and the other reported computational gains for students with and without co-occurring LD in response to medication combined with ongoing behavioral intervention.</p>
<p>Long-term effects were increased overall math achievement (comparable with increments of 0.19 school years in math) for students with ADHD who had self-selected continued use of medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1087054711430332">Scheffler et al., 2009</xref>). Also assessed longitudinally were computational gains for adolescents/young adults, who self-selected psychostimulant medication for 1 year or more versus a no-medication sample (or less than 1 year of treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers et al., 2008</xref>). These medication gains failed to remain significant when IQ was partialled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1087054711430332">Powers et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting initial differences between continued use/nonuse medication groups of children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1087054711430332">
<title>Sensory stimulation and math performance</title>
<p>More sensory stimulation research has been conducted on math performance than on reading, and more research has been conducted on math calculations than on math problem solving. For students with ADHD+, findings of differentially improved math calculations were documented in response to visual background color, color added to relevant numbers/operation signs, and music added to the background relative to low stimulation conditions and to the performance of comparisons. For students with ADHD-, differential gains were reported from light effects added to geometry shapes and also when auditory problems were presented with visual answers (cross modality input).</p>
<p>Other types of combined stimulation that have produced gains in math fact performance were peer tutoring and CAI, with and without games. However, it is difficult to untangle the stimulation effects (active responding, more rapid pacing, visual animations, social stimulation) from the added information of short segments of instruction and practice with reinforcement/incentives.</p>
<p>With an even smaller empirical base in math problem solving, gains have been documented for students with ADHD+ with active responding (i.e., reading problems aloud and then writing answers versus just writing and when listening to taped problems or working on written problems while manipulating a physical toy vs. no toy). For students with ADHD−, differential gains have been reported when color was added to “relevant” words in math problems.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we reviewed major areas of academic deficit for students with ADHD+ and ADHD− and the responses of these students to psychostimulants and to parallel sensory stimulation interventions. To these purposes and in basic skills, we documented specific deficits in reading recognition only for the ADHD+ group, which were responsive to psychostimulant medication. Also for the ADHD+ group, differential reading recognition gains were documented with color added and proprioceptive stimulation provided.</p>
<p>For children with ADHD− without reading recognition problems (i.e., problems only in speed and variability), psychostimulants were not effective, although added color stimulation did improve accuracy scores for this group. In the area of basic skills in math calculations, ADHD− and ADHD+ groups demonstrated significant deficits, but psychostimulants were consistently effective in improving calculation accuracy only for the ADHD+ group. For the ADHD− group, only improved effort ratings were sensitive to psychostimulants, unless there were also ongoing behavioral interventions. In sum, the effects of stimulant medication over placebo in the basic skill areas of reading decoding and math fact accuracy were primarily for ADHD+ samples. This would parallel laboratory findings, documenting efficacy of psychostimulants with repetitive attentional and memory tasks with fewer gains documented on tasks requiring cognitive flexibility and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1087054711430332">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In higher level comprehension tasks, reading comprehension deficits relative to comparisons were attributable to the poorer reading decoding skills of the ADHD+ group. For the ADHD− group, the reading comprehension deficits appeared to be related to requirements of holding information in mind, and these were sensitive to psychostimulant medication only when there were repeated assessments on the same reading comprehension test. However, added content novelty and proprioceptive stimulation (reading aloud) produced differential improvements in silent reading comprehension for the ADHD− group. For higher level math word problems, the performance of the ADHD+ group was primarily explained by reading comprehension, and no research was located on the effectiveness of psychostimulants on these math problem-solving scores. Preliminary evidence did suggest that proprioceptive stimulation provided for children in the ADHD+ group was effective. Only a few deficits were documented in math problem solving for the ADHD− group. Of these, the speed of problem solving was explained by slower reading speed. However, difficulties with math concepts appeared unrelated to other factors, but there were no studies located that assessed the effectiveness of psychostimulants on math problem solving for this ADHD− group. In contrast, sensory stimulation (yellow-highlighting) produced differentially improved problem-solving accuracy, and the requirements to read problems aloud plus write answers produced performance gains for this ADHD− group relative to just writing answers.</p>
<p>At this time, the positive effects of psychostimulants appear to be on basic math and reading skills for students with ADHD+ but also on reading comprehension. Thus, the effectiveness of psychostimulants is related specifically to ADHD plus co-occurring disorders. For example, psychostimulants were not effective for children with ADHD− in documented areas of basic skill deficits (math calculations) and in basic reading skills, where they were slower and more variable than comparison peers. Overall, this review calls into question the administration of psychostimulant medication to students with ADHD− (i.e., without co-occurring LD or behavioral disorders). Future research will need to support these outcomes more conclusively by defining students with ADHD+ as participants <italic>all</italic> with co-occurring disabilities and to assess them separately from students with ADHD−, who should be defined as all children without significant risk factors for co-occurring disabilities. Future research will also need to assess psychostimulant effects experimentally, in situ classroom studies, in studies that have ongoing behavioral interventions, and in studies without this combination. This level of specificity may be needed to improve the consistency of medication findings and define the parameters of effectiveness and need for treatment.</p>
<p>Although sensory stimulation has a considerably smaller empirical base, differentially improved oral reading accuracy was reported for students with ADHD with and without RD with color added overall and added late in reading passages, but not for novel font-style changes. Even more consistently demonstrated were the differential effects of visual, auditory, and combined stimulation on basic math calculations. Fewer studies assessed the higher level skills of comprehension than the lower level basic skills. However, differential gains in reading comprehension have been produced by added visual stimulation, proprioceptive stimulation when reading aloud, and content novelty for both groups of students with ADHD (but not for comparisons). In math problem solving, there is also preliminary work documenting gains when active responding is allowed for the ADHD+ group in single-participant research and when it is required prior to answering math word problems for children with ADHD−. Also for the ADHD− group, differential gains were found when color was added to words in story problems.</p>
<p>The sensory stimulation research that has been conducted has the advantage of including non-ADHD comparison samples, which were used to assess differential responding to stimulation, as predicted by the optimal stimulation theory. Differential responding was documented by positive outcomes produced by added stimulation, negative outcomes when stimulation was placed on nonrelevant task features, and faster habituation than would be observed for typical comparisons. In addition to reporting differential gains, we also reported differential losses when stimulation was placed on nonrelevant features. Because children with ADHD are attracted to novelty, they will attend to novel stimulation, sometimes at the expense of attending to relevant task features. This happens when salient stimulation embeds relevant task stimulation or when placed contiguous to a relevant task (e.g., “distracting” cartoons, verbal conversations), which will differentially disrupt the calculation performance of students with ADHD. These negative effects of nonrelevant stimulation are more likely to occur when children are young, the task is unpracticed, performance is timed, or the task is selectively more difficult for this group. The attraction to relevant and nonrelevant stimulation by children with ADHD further indicates the appetitive nature of stimulation for this group.</p>
<p>Overall in this review, differential gains, losses, and more rapid habituation to sensory stimulation were documented in research with ADHD− and ADHD+ groups. This suggests that sensory stimulation addresses the essential elements of ADHD (need for stimulation). The advantages of sensory stimulation may be the specificity of academic effects that can be achieved in contrast to psychostimulants. That is, psychostimulants may be too general in their effects relative to the specific nature of the academic problems that characterize students in the ADHD− group, unless there is also a behavioral or instructional intervention program ongoing in the classroom.</p>
<p>Future research will be needed to replicate the effects of sensory stimulation on reading comprehension and math word problem tasks and to assess the generality of these effects with listening comprehension tasks. The use of color or emphasis to highlight relevant information has the potential to direct attention to (a) underlying math concepts, (b) changes in math problems with mixed operations/actions, and (c) distal information in the comprehension of causal elements in stories. It would also be important to untangle active responding that is involved in reading aloud from the auditory feedback that also occurs. That is, reading aloud may provide improved self-monitoring of comprehension. Active responding appears to be another important variable to assess in future research, because children with ADHD− self-report preferences for more standing and moving than do comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-1087054711430332">Zentall &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the potential contribution of this review is heuristic, with evidence documenting specific deficits in math and reading for students with ADHD, with and without co-occurring disabilities. The apparent lack of “effort” demonstrated by these students is not fully explained by impaired EF abilities or by motivational factors (reward- and motor-delay aversion). The predictions from these related models can be explained by inadequate physiological arousal. Finally, this optimal stimulation theory has not addressed anxiety disorders that can co-occur with ADHD, but anxiety may be a moderating variable augmenting arousal under child-specific states of perceived threat (e.g., social, math, reading), thereby reducing the effectiveness of stimulant interventions (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1087054711430332">McInnes et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
