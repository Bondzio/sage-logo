<abstract>
<p>Poor understanding or practice of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) causes devastating complications. Therefore, good Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) nursing care for preterm neonates and close monitoring of complications is essential for successful TPN therapy. The study was conducted in NICU at Ain Shams University Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, using a quasi-experimental research design with prepost intervention assessments. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire sheet and an observation checklist (prepost format) and developed a comprehensive guidelines program about nursing care of TPN of preterm neonates. Results revealed that the program had a significant positive impact on nurses’ knowledge and practice outcomes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a life saving therapy for many infants who are unable to tolerate enteral feedings. It fulfills preterm neonates’ needs for growth and development when their size or conditions preclude enteral feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811417314">Chaudhari &amp; Kadam, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses are responsible for the administration of parenteral nutrition and monitoring for fluid and electrolyte imbalance and early signs of infection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1054773811417314">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Assessment of preterm neonates’ nutritional status by the critical care nurse and timely intervention by the interdisciplinary health care team optimize infants’ outcomes and transition through their critical care phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773811417314">Sole, Klein, &amp; Moseley, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, this study evaluates the effect of providing a comprehensive guidelines program about nursing care of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) on the educational outcomes of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) nurses who take care of preterm neonates.</p>
<p>Good nursing care and close biochemical monitoring are absolutely essential for successful PN therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811417314">Chaudhari &amp; Kadam, 2006</xref>). Neonatologists, surgeons, nurses, nutritional support team, care coordinators, microbiologists or infection control team, clinical chemists, pharmacists, social workers, and psychologists with expertise in infant feeding difficulties constitute health team members who have different roles in PN therapy. Such collaborative care would certainly have better outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811417314">Mascarenhas, Kerner, &amp; Stalling, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Although feeding through the gastrointestinal tract is the preferred route for nutritional management, there are specific conditions when TPN as an adjunctive or sole therapy is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811417314">Chaudhari &amp; Kadam, 2006</xref>). TPN, also referred to as parenteral nutrition (PN), is provided when the gastrointestinal tract is nonfunctional because of an interruption in its continuity, or because absorptive capacity is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773811417314">Kozier et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Preterm infants, especially those who have been growth restricted in utero, have fewer nutrient reserves at birth, compared to term infants. In addition, they are subject to physiological and metabolic stresses that can affect their nutritional needs, such as respiratory distress or infection. However, because of the rapidly changing clinical condition of preterm infants, many neonatal intensive care units review and formulate a new PN order on a daily basis. That order takes into account infant’s clinical condition, weight, urine output, and current laboratory data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811417314">Peverini, Beach, Wan, &amp; Vyhmeister, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The solutions used in TPN contain multivitamin mixtures, minerals, and trace elements in addition to glucose (dextrose), which is an important energy source. Lipid is given as a source of essential fatty acids and energy and to provide balance to the nutritional intake. Specialized amino acid solutions are available for use in renal and hepatic failure and for infants. Iron should not be added to lipid-containing solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811417314">Moore, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773811417314">Bhatia and Adamkin (2006)</xref> suggested that early amino acids are a very good strategy. They begin with “vanilla” total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as soon as the umbilical venous catheter is inserted. It is a stock solution of 4% amino acids, which only contains amino acids and glucose, and is infused literally from the first hours of life with the intention of providing about 2 g per kilogram per day of protein right from the beginning.</p>
<p>Careless use due to inadequate understanding or poor supervision can result in devastating complications such as septicemia and metabolic imbalances. Such complications can be reduced by meticulous management of PN in response to biochemical abnormalities, nutrition teams, policies to reduce sepsis, and staff training to be more aware of pericardial and pleural effusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811417314">Ahmed, Irwin, &amp; Tuthill, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, guidelines for the relative amounts of the various ingredients composing a PN solution must optimize nutritional support while protecting against potentially dangerous values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811417314">Peverini et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1054773811417314">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A quasi-experimental research design with prepost intervention assessments is used to measure the effect of the implemented guidelines program about nursing care of TPN for NICU nurses on the educational outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1054773811417314">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>The study was conducted in the NICU at Ain Shams University Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, which admits in-born and out-born neonates with medical and surgical conditions. It is a three-room NICU; each room accommodates 7 NICU patients. The unit contains a room for preparing TPN, a room for preparing formulas and a store. About 9 to 11 is the daily number of neonates taking TPN during the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1054773811417314">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All the 40 nurses working in NICU, with different qualifications and years of experience, were included in the study. They were all females and had been working in the setting for at least 3 years.</p>
<p>A consecutive sample of 80 preterm neonates, less than 37 weeks gestational age, was recruited in this study from NICU. The inclusion criteria were preterm neonates with gestational age between 35 and less than 37 weeks, weighing 1,800 grams or more, with a validated order of TPN administered by an intravenous access either peripherally or centrally. Exclusion criteria were preterm babies who were postoperative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1054773811417314">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Researchers designed and used two different tools that included self-administered questionnaire sheet (prepost format), and observation checklist (prepost format).</p>

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1054773811417314">
<title>Observation Checklist (Prepost Format)</title>
<p>This is used to assess each nurse’s performance during preparation and administration of total parenteral nutrition for preterm neonates. It consisted of four parts with a total of 28 questions:</p>
<sec id="section13-1054773811417314">
<title>Part 1</title>
<p>Preparation of TPN: (a) Use the five rights of medication administration and verify rate per hour, (b) maintain strict aseptic technique when handling catheter, dressing changing, tubing, and administrating TPN solution, and (c) monitor fluids and electrolytes, vital signs, and laboratory results.</p>

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1054773811417314">
<title>Educational Guidelines Program</title>
<p>The researchers developed and implemented a comprehensive guidelines program about nursing care of TPN for preterm neonates. The program phases were</p>
<sec id="section18-1054773811417314">
<title>Exploratory phase</title>
<p>Baseline assessment for nurses had been done before the development of the program content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1054773811417314">
<title>Validity and reliability</title>
<p>During the program construction phase, the content of nursing care of TPN provided for preterm neonates was based on the identified nurses’ needs, in addition to reviewing related literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811417314">Elkin, Perry, &amp; Potter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811417314">Moore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773811417314">Sole et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773811417314">Williams &amp; Schlenker, 2003</xref>). In addition, a group of experts reviewed the program and evaluated for interrater reliability content; they were Consultant Neonatologists and the Head Nurse of the NICU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1054773811417314">
<title>Implementation phase</title>
<p>The intervention program was implemented in a series of four sessions, 4 days a week. These were 2 days in the morning shift (Saturday and Wednesday); and another 2 days in the afternoon shift according to the nurses’ schedule, with a total of 10 hr for each group. Four of these hours were allocated to theoretical content, in two sessions, 2 hr each. This part covered the goals of TPN, its indications, components, routes, and steps of administration, precautions to follow, monitoring for neonates with TPN, and the recommended documentation after infusion. The practical part of the program was provided through two sessions, 3 hr each, for a total of 6 hr. This part covered training on the technique of TPN, its safe administration, monitoring of complications such as mechanical and technical, infections, metabolic, and nutritional complications.</p>
<p>During the implementation stage of the program, participant nurses were divided into eight groups of five nurses each, according to their schedule. After clarifying the objectives of the study, a simple introduction was illustrated to the participant nurses (The study period spanned from June to October 2007).</p>
<p>The program was initiated by the theoretical part, followed by the practical part. Teaching strategies included small group discussions, demonstrations, and bedside nursing rounds for correction of mistakes on the spot. Audiovisual media used included a movie about administration of TPN, printed handouts rich in colored pictures and boards. In addition, real equipment and machines needed for administration of total parenteral nutrition such as infusion pump, bacterial filter, Y-connection, scalp vein set, IV infusion set and bottles of lipid emulsion, amino acid, dextrose, and electrolytes were actually used for the training. All materials were revised after the practical sessions to give the participant nurses the chance for repracticing in the presence of the researchers to ensure maximum efficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1054773811417314">
<title>Evaluation phase</title>
<p>The target outcome of this study focused on appraisal of nurses’ knowledge and practice that were assessed after the program using the same tools of the pretest.</p>
<p>Self-administered questionnaire sheets were completed by nurses in the NICU independently. According to the designed model key answer, the knowledge of nurses was categorized into two categories, either “unsatisfactory” when the total score obtained was less than 75%, or “satisfactory” when 75% or more from the total grade of the provided questionnaire.</p>
<p>The observation checklists were completed, for assessment of nurses’ performance during provision of care for preterm neonates. The practice of the nurse was categorized into “adequate” once the nurse had 80% or more of the total marks, or “inadequate” when less than 80%.</p>
<p>Knowledge and practice were evaluated twice for each participant nurse, with two different preterm neonates: before and after the exposure to providing the comprehensive guidelines program about TPN.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1054773811417314">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>Five pilot participant-nurses were asked to answer the questionnaire. They were observed during caring of preterm neonates receiving TPN to appraise the applicability of the tools related to their knowledge and practice. Modifications such as exclusion criteria of neonates and questions related to recommended documentation were added according to the pilot results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1054773811417314">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>Ethical issues in this study involved the assurance of confidentiality and anonymity for the participant nurses. All participants and mothers of preterm neonates were informed about the purpose and design of the study. Official approvals to conduct the study were obtained from the Ethical and Research committees as well as the supervisor general and the chairperson of the NICU. They recommended that the study should not include preterm neonates less than 35 weeks gestational age, or postoperative neonates because of their critical conditions. And, all 40 NICU nurses should be included in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1054773811417314">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data entry and statistical analysis were done using SPSS 13.0 statistical software package. Quantitative continuous data were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test since normal distribution of the data could not be assumed. Qualitative categorical variables were compared using chi-square test. Whenever the expected values in one or more of the cells in a 2 × 2 tables is less than 5, Fisher exact test was used instead. Statistical significance was considered at <italic>p</italic> value &lt;.05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The desire for evidence-based clinical guidelines for nutritional support of the preterm infant has been identified. In addition, consistent, comprehensive, multidisciplinary appraisal of practice is an integral component of improving nutrition outcomes in the neonatal population. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773811417314">Kuzma-O’Reilly et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>At the beginning of this study, a pretest is applied to assess the knowledge and practice of participating nurses, in addition to their sociodemographic data, to develop specifically targeted comprehensive guidelines program about total parenteral nutrition according to their identified knowledge and practice deficits. The study findings indicated low knowledge scores before implementation of the guidelines. This is particularly evident as regards the components of TPN and precautions to follow. These two areas were of major importance since time is critical for the decision to start TPN in preterm neonates. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811417314">Irving, Simone, Hicks, and Verger (2000)</xref> clarified that although feeding through the gastrointestinal tract is the preferred route for nutritional management, there were specific instances when PN as adjunctive or sole therapy is necessary to meet nutritional needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding route of administration of TPN, nurses should always update their knowledge since research always adds new evidence in this area. This might explain the low level of knowledge scores demonstrated among the present study nurses. In congruence with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773811417314">Marshall and West (2004)</xref> emphasized that nursing practice was inconsistent within and between intensive care units (ICUs) and this could be linked to the shortage of reliable and valid research into the many issues associated with the effective delivery of enteral and parenteral nutrition.</p>
<p>Concerning knowledge about the precautions nurses should consider while administering TPN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811417314">Baird (2001)</xref> pointed to a major risk that is often overlooked by nurses. Preterm neonates have low antioxidant reserves and, like sick term infants, typically suffer significant oxidative stress. Therefore, by protecting these infusates from light, bedside nurses can reduce the amount of hydroperoxides infused and protect NICU patients from the associated risks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nurses have very high knowledge scores regarding monitoring neonates with TPN, even before implementation of the guidelines. This high level of knowledge could be related to the fact that in real-life situation, the major role of the nurse is to monitor the preterm neonates with TPN for most of the time of the shift. On the same lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811417314">Ista and Joosten (2005)</xref> emphasized that critical care nurses play an important role in feeding of critically ill children and preterm neonates. They should be knowledgeable about many procedures and caregiving interventions, such as observation and care of the neonate during administration of nutrition, whether enteral or parenteral.</p>
<p>The highest relative increases in the scores were related to goals and components of TPN. Meanwhile, no statistically significant increases were noticed in the scores of knowledge related to monitoring and documentation. Overall, the majority of the nurses have unsatisfactory knowledge at the pretest. After application of the TPN guidelines program, statistically significant improvements were revealed in most areas of knowledge and in total knowledge. In congruence with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811417314">Brown, Garrison, and Hutchison (2007)</xref> reported about the effect of implementation of an interactive computerized PN worksheet that resulted in improvement of the knowledge of NICU, pediatric residents, and neonatal nurse practitioners and led to statistically significant reduction in the error rates in both groups.</p>
<p>The present study also assessed nurses’ practice related to TPN. The results demonstrated relatively high scores for administration of TPN and monitoring of complications related to mechanical and gastrointestinal complications. The high scores of these two areas were quite plausible given the clear related policies and procedures and the fact that this is the daily routine work of these nurses. The low scores were related to management of metabolic and infectious complications of TPN before implementation of the program. Low scores might be explained by both lack of knowledge and the infrequent occurrence of such complications, which might limit nurses’ related experience. However, these complications are always a threat to preterm infants and can occur at any time and nurses should be prepared and should be capable of dealing with such complications. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811417314">Johnson and Sexton (2006)</xref> mentioned that complications of PN included infection, accidental damage to, or removal of, the line, and cholestatic liver disease. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811417314">Chaudhari and Kadam (2006)</xref> reported that TPN should only be used in units where there is full-time medical coverage, trained nursing staff who can be relied on for proper care of IV lines, facilities to prepare solutions correctly under laminar flow hood, appropriate laboratory backup, and appropriate equipment including infusion pumps.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773811417314">Pérez-Navero et al. (2005)</xref>, in an epidemiologic study of artificial nutrition in critically ill pediatric patients, reported that PN complications consisted of catheter-related infection, thrombophlebitis, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811417314">Camara (2001)</xref> reported about the use of peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC lines) as means of administration of and assuring better parenteral nutrition to infants. Although there are many benefits to the use of these catheters, physicians and nurses within the NICU must remain acutely aware of the risks involved with placement of PICC lines so that complications can be minimized. Prevention of sepsis in neonates is always a priority and several measures can be implemented to reduce this risk, including scrupulous aseptic technique, knowledgeable selection of the insertion site, and consistent daily care. Other complications such as thrombosis, extravascular collection of fluid due to catheter migration or blockage, vessel perforation, and line leakage are all concerns when using this valuable tool in the care of preterm neonates. Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773811417314">Hulst, Joosten, Tibboel, and Van Goudoever (2006)</xref> stressed that meticulous routine nutritional assessment and monitoring are essential to prevent inadequate nutritional supply and its potentially harmful consequences.</p>
<p>After application of the guidelines program, statistically significant improvements were noticed in all areas of TPN administration, where maximal scores are reached at the posttest. The scores of all areas of monitoring of complications increased at the posttest; however, the increases in the areas of monitoring of metabolic and infectious complications did not reach statistically significant differences. This might be due to the relatively higher pretest scores in these two areas and could be attributed to the seriousness of related complications. Overall, all nurses had adequate practice at the posttest, compared to about two thirds in the pretest. The seriousness of infectious complications were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811417314">Irving (2001)</xref> that preterm neonates react to infection by having increased apneas and bradycardias with associated saturation drops, an increased oxygen requirement, and/or temperature instability. This emphasized that every attempt should be done by NICU nurses to apply aseptic technique during preparation and administration of TPN for preterm neonates based on the established guidelines program.</p>
<p>Embedding the change in the system is also an important factor that guarantees its success. Implementation of the TPN guidelines program could not be achieved without looking at organizational climate and leadership issues. These factors were taken into account in the present study and certainly contributed to the positive impact of the applied guidelines. In agreement with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773811417314">Pollack and Koch (2003)</xref> demonstrated a lower incidence of complications in NICUs with better overall scores for leadership, coordination, and conflict resolution. Therefore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773811417314">Rikli et al. (2006)</xref> concluded that implementation of the potentially better practice had a positive influence on nurse satisfaction.</p>
<sec id="section27-1054773811417314">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>One of the strengths of the study is that physicians and nurses showed appropriate cooperation and participation. The limitation of the study is the lack of storage places to store the media used during the program and in each session the researchers held full responsibility in carrying and storing their heavy materials for providing the program.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study demonstrated that implementation of a TPN guidelines program had a significant positive impact on NICU nurses’ knowledge and practice and led to higher educational and practical outcomes during administration and monitoring of TPN complications among preterm neonates. The used Simulation Training seems to be safe and life saving for NICU preterm neonates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-1054773811417314">
<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>Based on the study findings, it is recommended to offer regular educational programs and in-service training that target NICU nurses in all shifts. The developed program should be implemented on a wider scale and for longer time to assess long-term impact. Participation of setting leaders in every step of development and implementation is strongly recommended to provide an organizational climate that helps success of the program.</p>
<sec id="section30-1054773811417314">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Nurses in NICU have a unique position in caring for preterm neonates and typically have an important impact on administrating TPN, whether it is delivered by peripheral or central vein access. Researchers designed the prepost intervention assessment formats to focus on the theoretical and practical requirements of the NICU nurses. Researchers also implemented the comprehensive guidelines program about nursing care of TPN of preterm neonates started by the theoretical part; it was a helpful technique for alerting the participant nurses about goals, indications, components, routes, steps, and precautions and recommended documentation of TPN administration. The target of the practical part is an overall training for nurses to eliminate the weak points related to safe administration of TPN, monitoring of complications with focus on factors related to mechanical, technical, infections, metabolic, and nutritional complications.</p>
<p>Ultimately, researchers encouraged nurses to ask for more explanations for vague points, and the researchers were always available to answer any questions, and to make sure of their feedback. Teaching strategies included demonstrations as well as nursing rounds for correcting mistakes on the spot. Researchers used a film about administration of TPN, and boards. Moreover, essential real equipment and machines for administration of TPN were used during the training. Handouts were distributed to the nurses to serve as references and proper guidance. Findings assured the main outcome of the researchers as pediatric educators, statistically significant improvements in most areas of total knowledge, and practice of NICU nurses after following of the TPN guidelines program.</p>
