<p><bold>Objective:</bold> Habituation has an important role in attention. By reducing one’s sensitivity to a constant source of stimulation, it frees up attention resources to process new distinct items. Impaired habituation may disrupt sustained attention via inability to modulate the repeated intrusion of irrelevant stimuli. <bold>Method:</bold> Using Troxler fading, this study investigated habituation to peripheral stimuli in adults with ADHD. A total of 41 adults (21 ADHD and 20 controls) participated in the study. <bold>Results:</bold> Adults with ADHD were slower to habituate to peripheral stimuli. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The findings suggest that impaired habituation may explain the clinical symptoms associated with adult ADHD.</p>

<p>ADHD is one of the most common disorders of childhood and is believed to affect 3% to 7% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711423621">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>). The disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than observed in individuals of comparable levels of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711423621">APA, 2000</xref>). Recent clinical and empirical evidence indicates that 50% to 70% of children with ADHD display the cardinal signs of the disorder well into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711423621">2002</xref>). A conservative estimate of the prevalence of adult ADHD is approximately 4.4% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711423621">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>). Although ADHD is generally diagnosed in childhood, a number of individuals are not diagnosed until they become adults (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711423621">Nadeau &amp; Quinn, 2002</xref>) as they often have poor insight into their own impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711423621">Kessler et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, the alarming increase in the number of adults diagnosed with ADHD in the past decade has resulted in a greater need to understand the underlying pathophysiological causes of ADHD across the life span to provide more accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Structural and functional imaging data suggest that children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD have decreased volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711423621">Castellanos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711423621">Filipek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054711423621">Hesslinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711423621">Mostofsky, Cooper, Kates, Denckla, &amp; Kaufmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711423621">Pliszka, Lancaster, Liotti, &amp; Semrud-Clikeman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711423621">Seidman et al., 2006</xref>) and abnormal activation of the frontal lobe regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711423621">Bush et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711423621">Dibbets, Evers, Hurks, Bakker, &amp; Jolles, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711423621">Durston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711423621">Schneider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711423621">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711423621">Vaidya et al., 1998</xref>). Further support for dysfunctional frontal activation comes from numerous neuropsychological studies that have found that both children and adults with ADHD have deficits on measures of executive control compared with non-ADHD controls. These studies have identified impairments in response inhibition, complex problem solving, and sustained effort on tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711423621">Denckla, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711423621">Seidman, Biederman, Weber, Hatch, &amp; Faraone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711423621">Woods, Lovejoy, &amp; Ball, 2002</xref>). Additional structural and functional studies have shown decreased activation and volume of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711423621">Pliszka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711423621">Seidman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711423621">Tamm, Menon, &amp; Reiss, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Classic studies of visual attention have had important implications for the etiology of ADHD. In a series of studies, Posner and colleagues’ use of positional cues to direct attention to spatial locations prior to the presentation of a target has led to the identification of three separate attentional networks that operate independently and involve distinct brain areas. The orienting network is responsible for selecting sensory input and is thought to be associated with both parietal and frontal areas. The alerting network is responsible for achieving and maintaining an alert state and is associated with frontal and parietal regions of the right hemisphere. Finally, the executive control network, which resolves conflicts among different responses, is associated with the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711423621">Fan, McCandliss, Sommer, Raz, &amp; Posner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711423621">Posner &amp; Raichle, 1994</xref>). A number of studies suggest that individuals with ADHD do not have deficits orienting or alerting to tasks but suffer from an inability to inhibit ongoing tasks (i.e., difficulties with the executive control network; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711423621">Logan, Schachar, &amp; Tannock, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For more than a decade, researchers have noted the similar pattern of distractible, impulsive, and hyperactive behavior between individuals with ADHD and individuals with frontal lobe damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711423621">Benton, 1991</xref>). It has been well noted that individuals with frontal lobe damage are easily distracted and so impaired in their ability to regulate behavior that their actions are impulsive and hyperactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711423621">Andrewes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711423621">Fuster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711423621">Luria, 1973</xref>). Individuals with ADHD, like patients with frontal lobe damage, are easily distracted and have an impaired ability to control their behavior. Findings from neuropsychological studies of patients with bilateral damage to the ACC or frontal lobe damage have shown that patients with damage to the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711423621">Cohen, Kaplan, Meadows, &amp; Wilkinson, 1994</xref>) or frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711423621">Fuster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711423621">Luria, 1973</xref>) have slowed or incomplete habituation. Habituation is an automatic low-level learning process that plays an extremely critical role in attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711423621">Cohen, Sparling-Cohen, &amp; O’Donnell, 1993</xref>). By reducing our sensitivity to a constant source of stimulation, it accentuates new distinct items to attend to preferentially. Habituation plays an important role in filtering large amounts of information received from the environment. Without habituation, we would be unable to distinguish meaningful information from our ever-changing environment.</p>
<p>The most compelling evidence in support of frontal lobe involvement in habituation comes from studies using Troxler fading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711423621">Mennemeier et al., 1994</xref>). Troxler fading paradigms examine the rate at which participants habituate to stimuli in peripheral vision during prolonged fixation on a central target. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711423621">Mennemeier and colleagues (1994)</xref> examined adult patients with frontal and parietal lobe lesions. Their study showed that patients with parietal lesions reported accelerated fading (5-10 s) compared with controls (17 s). In contrast, patients with frontal lobe lesions rarely reported Troxler fading. The findings indicate that the parietal cortex may be important in sustaining an image in the peripheral environment especially in response to movement, but the frontal cortex is necessary to habituate attention to objects in the peripheral environment when the objects are redundant and not targeted for action.</p>
<p>Given the similar behavioral and neurological dysfunctions in ADHD and frontal lobe impairments, it is possible that understanding the habituation processes of individuals with ADHD may shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms involved in ADHD. Theory posits that rather than having difficulty orienting to stimuli, individuals with ADHD have difficulty maintaining attention to relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711423621">Booth, Carlson, &amp; Tucker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711423621">Dibbets et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711423621">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). In other words, individuals with ADHD have difficulty actively inhibiting distracting stimuli. Furthermore, a key problem in ADHD research is the inconsistent conceptualization of inhibitory processes in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711423621">Nigg, 2001</xref>). Some researchers investigate controlled effortful processes (i.e., deliberate suppression to achieve an internally guided goal), whereas others investigate automatic processes (i.e., uncertainty in the presence of a novel stimulus). Although these processes may be partially distinct, they rely on the same underlying neural systems (i.e., basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex, and associated cortical and subcortical structures). As such, in any real-world behavior, the relationship between these systems is reciprocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711423621">Nigg, 2005</xref>), and habituation may be a process that links controlled and effortful processes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711423621">Jansiewicz, Newschaffer, Denckla, and Mostofsky (2004)</xref> examined whether children diagnosed with ADHD showed an impaired ability to habituate to visual peripheral stimuli using the Troxler fading paradigm. The researchers found that children with ADHD showed slower fading to peripheral stimuli than did non-ADHD controls. In addition, children diagnosed with ADHD reported fading on a significantly smaller percentage of trials than did control participants. The authors concluded that the findings of prolonged visual habituation in children who have ADHD may be related to clinical aspects of the syndrome, such as distractibility, impulsivity, and difficulty staying on task.</p>
<p>The present study attempted to examine the findings of slowed visual habituation in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711423621">Jansiewicz et al., 2004</xref>) in a population of ADHD adults. The executive control processes of adults are more complete (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711423621">Passler, Isaac, &amp; Hynd, 1985</xref>), and thus, examination of slowed habituation in an adult population may eliminate the confounds of testing children at different stages of incomplete development. In addition, findings of slower visual habituation in an adult ADHD population may provide additional biologically based end points that are measurable in this population and may also serve as a marker for treatment response.</p>

<title>Adult Semi-Structured Interview</title>
<p>A short semistructured interview was administered to each participant using a modified version of Barkley and Murphy’s Adult Interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711423621">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 1998</xref>). The semistructured interview asked questions to further establish current degree of ADHD symptoms and to probe for behavioral, conduct, anxiety, and mood disorders that might better address the attentional difficulties. As ADHD is often joined with a wide range of comorbid disorders, it is necessary to assess whether the concentration difficulties, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are primary symptoms of ADHD or are secondary symptoms of another medical or psychiatric condition. In adulthood, ADHD is often comorbid with substance abuse, antisocial personality disorder, and anxiety and mood disorders, or may be related to medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or hypo- or hyperthyroidism. The interview was used to further validate degree of ADHD symptoms and aid in making exclusionary decisions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711423621">Table 1</xref> for a list of comorbid disorders).</p>

<title>IQ</title>
<p>The WASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711423621">The Psychological Corporation, 1999</xref>) was administered to establish IQ. The WASI can be used with a broad age range (6-89 years). The WASI consists of the following four subtests: vocabulary, similarities, block design, and matrix reasoning. The WASI is nationally standardized and yields the three traditional Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale IQ scores.</p>

<title>Visual fading task (Troxler fading)</title>
<p>In the visual task, participants were instructed to maintain focus on a central fixation point (a 9-mm yellow crosshair) on a medium gray background screen throughout the experiment. A black dot (a two-dimensional circle 5 mm in size) appeared in one of the four positions in their peripheral vision (45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°); participants were told not to shift their attention to the black dot in their peripheral vision. The participants were asked to report when the black dot in their peripheral vision faded from awareness by pressing a button (left click) on a computer mouse held in their dominant hand. The circle was presented in a stationary, moving, or validity condition. In the stationary condition, the black dot appeared near the edge of the visual field and did not move. The stationary black dot stayed on the screen for 30 s or until the participant reported fading by pressing the mouse button. Participants were expected to report visual habituation or fading in response to the stationary black dots. In the moving condition, the black dot appeared near the edge of the visual field and moved in an orbit at a rate of 3.16 cycles per second for 30 s or until the participants reported fading by pressing the mouse button. In the moving condition, participants were not expected to report visual habituation or fading; if they did report fading, it was expected to be slower than fading of the stationary dots. In the validity condition, the black dot appeared at the edge of the visual field and was blended into the gray background color within 5 s after the start of the trial. In the validity condition, participants were expected to report visual habituation or fading in response to the black dots only after the 5-s mark.</p>
<p>The visual task consisted of all possible combinations of the 12 conditions of the visual experiment (stationary–peripheral locations 1-4; moving–peripheral locations 1-4; validity–peripheral locations 1-4). The stimuli were presented in each of the four possible quadrants one at a time and there were 1,500 ms between stimulus presentations. The visual task was administered in a counterbalanced order across participants. The visual task consisted of two blocks of 24 stimuli with a 5-min break between block presentations. All participants performed a short visual practice trial, which consisted of three moving, three stationary, and three validity stimuli.</p>
<p>Visual stimuli were presented on a 19-inch flat panel LCD monitor measuring with stand 17.8 × 13.1 × 7.9 in. The screen resolution was 1,280 × 800 (32 bit). The monitor was level with tilt set to be perpendicular with the floor. The monitor was placed on a table, and the distance from the top of the monitor to the floor was 48 in. Participants were seated in a stationary chair (without wheels) at a distance of 24 in. from the monitor to assure that the visual angle was the same across participants (1° of visual angle from seated position to 9 mm center crosshair and 16° of visual angle from seated position with eyes fixated on crosshair to 5-mm dot in peripheral vision). Room and computer monitor luminance was standard across all participants. The visual task was controlled by the experimenter from a laptop connected to the monitor.</p>
<p>A Quick Glance II-SH Eye Tracker by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711423621">Eye Tech Digital Systems (2006)</xref> was used to monitor participant’s eye movements during the visual task. Quick Glance II-SH is a high-resolution video camera with strobe and with a dark pupil eye tracker that uses infrared illumination to track eye movements. The video camera was mounted on the bottom center panel of the monitor, and the infrared illuminators were attached on the left and right side of the monitor 5 cm from the top of the monitor. Participants were asked to place their chin on a chin rest to minimize head movement.</p>
<p>The researcher was able to monitor participant’s eye movements in real time while the participants were completing the visual task. If the participants broke visual fixation from the center crosshair at any time during the stationary condition trials, those trials were deleted and replaced by other trials of the same type later in the testing session. The range of rejection for determining a broken fixation was set at eye movements of more than 2° of visual angle in any of the four peripheral quadrants of the display where the black dots appeared. If participants moved their gaze slightly on any trial when the dot first appeared and immediately reoriented their gaze to the central crosshair, the trial was not deleted. Blinking was also permitted.</p>
<p>Each participant’s eye gaze was calibrated before administration of the visual task by presenting 16 disk-shaped targets on the screen. The targets are displayed one at a time in succession across the entire screen display. Participants were asked to look directly at the center of each target when it appeared. If the calibration points were not good for any specific point on the screen, they were repeated to improve calibration. Each participant’s calibration setting was saved to be used in subsequent trials.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary goal of this investigation was to examine the visual habituation processes of adults with ADHD. As predicted, adults with ADHD were slower than controls to report fading to visual stationary stimuli. This finding is similar to previous reports of slower habituation to visual stimuli in children diagnosed with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711423621">Jansiewicz et al., 2004</xref>). The replication of slowed habituation in an adult ADHD population is an important finding. First, the finding is consistent with the notion that ADHD is a lifelong disorder. Second, and perhaps more important, the finding may help to shed light on the neuroanatomical basis of ADHD.</p>
<p>A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cause of ADHD. These theories range from dysfunction in lower level brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711423621">Halperin &amp; Schulz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711423621">Sergeant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711423621">Sergeant, Geurts, Huijbregts, Scheres, &amp; Oosterlaan, 2003</xref>) to dysfunctional top-down executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>). Previous research using the Troxler fading paradigm to investigate habituation processes in frontal lobe patients and children with ADHD has been interpreted to support dysfunctional executive control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711423621">Jansiewicz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711423621">Mennemeier et al., 1994</xref>). This finding logically follows the neuroimaging evidence of reduced frontal lobe volume and activation in children and adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711423621">Castellanos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711423621">Filipek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711423621">Mostofsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711423621">Seidman et al., 2006</xref>) and the similar hyperactive and impulsive behaviors displayed by frontal lobe patients and individuals with ADHD.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that visual Troxler fading is mediated by the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711423621">Clarke &amp; Belcher, 1962</xref>), and the frontal cortex receives projections from the thalamus through interconnected cortical–thalamic pathways. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711423621">Watson, Valenstein, &amp; Heilman (1981)</xref> have proposed that connections between the frontal lobe and the nucleus reticularis (NR) of the thalamus might play a role in the habituation process. The NR is involved in arousal and activation, and is closely linked to the motor system (e.g., basal ganglia and frontal lobes). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711423621">Mennemeier and colleagues (1994)</xref> further proposed that the NR may facilitate habituation when stimuli are unchanging by inhibiting thalamic transmission to the cerebral cortex. However, the frontal cortex sends excitatory signals to the NR and may facilitate habituation of selected stimuli, but if stimuli are novel or biologically adaptive, the NR will be inhibited by the thalamus. This proposal suggests that damage to the frontal cortex may facilitate the inhibition of the NR causing a disruption in habituation. It must be noted, however, that these conclusions may not fully explain mechanisms of habituation, and because these conclusions were based on examination of patients with frontal lobe lesions, they may not generalize to ADHD. Alternatively, it is possible that impairments in lower level brain areas (i.e., reticular activating system and thalamus) may be capable of having a direct impact on the later developing frontal lobe regions and executive control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711423621">Halperin &amp; Schulz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711423621">Sergeant et al., 2003</xref>). These early brain impairments could adversely affect mechanisms of habituation.</p>
<p>Although neuroimaging evidence has indicated that individuals with ADHD have reduced volume and activation in the frontal lobe region, the neuroimaging findings of additional brain region abnormalities in ADHD cannot be ignored. Brain imaging studies of children and adults with ADHD have also found abnormalities in the ACC, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711423621">Castellanos et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711423621">Durston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711423621">Filipek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711423621">Pliszka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711423621">Seidman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711423621">Vaidya et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that the ACC is involved in a number of cognitive processes (e.g., attention, salience, interference, and response competition; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711423621">Bush, Luu, &amp; Posner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711423621">Casey et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711423621">Downar, Crawley, Mikulis, &amp; Davis, 2002</xref>). Studies that have investigated cingulotomy patients have found that despite having intact processing in a number of cognitive domains (e.g., language, visual perceptual skills, motor, and memory), these patients have a variable and incomplete pattern of habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711423621">Cohen et al., 1994</xref>). Additional research on cingulotomy patients has also found impairments in selective and sustained attention as well as executive control deficits in response generation, intention, and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711423621">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>As the anterior cingulate has rich interconnections with the frontal cortex (orbitofrontal and dorsolateral), the parietal cortex, the motor systems, limbic region and basal ganglia, it was proposed that damage to this area in cingulotomy patients indicates that the ACC influences both attention and executive control by modulating the salience of external signals so that attention can be directed to the most important environmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711423621">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>). Overall, this suggests that damage to the ACC may disrupt the temporal continuity needed to discriminate and coordinate response strength to incoming signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711423621">Cohen et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding of decreased volume and abnormal activation of the ACC and slowed habituation in children and adults with ADHD suggests that deficits in ACC modulation may be able to explain both the cognitive (i.e., inattention and working memory) and behavioral (i.e., hyperactivity and impulsivity) symptoms of ADHD. In fact, it has been reported that damage to the ACC mimics the behavioral symptoms commonly displayed by individuals with frontal lobe damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711423621">Cohen et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the inability to habituate to, or filter, irrelevant signals can cause disruption in both bottom-up (arousal and activation) and top-down (executive control) processing.</p>
<p>Although the present study cannot offer any direct evidence supporting the underlying neural correlates of habituation, it does indicate that further investigation of visual habituation in ADHD may reveal important insights into both the neuroanatomical basis of ADHD and the brain mechanisms involved in habituation.</p>
<p>A concern in studying deficits in ADHD, and a potential limitation in the present study, is the use of tasks that may confound motor performance with attention and the difficulties of operationalizing attentional constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711423621">Barkley, 1998</xref>). In the present task, like many in the research literature, participants were required to perform a motor response to report a change in a subjective attentional task (i.e., report fading by pressing a button). It is unclear from the results of previous studies, and the present study, whether true attentional processes or motor responses are being investigated.</p>
<p>Additional studies are needed to further examine the potential confound of dishabituation in Troxler fading. Dishabituation is defined as an increase in responsiveness to previously habituated stimuli following the presentation of another stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054711423621">Thompson &amp; Spencer, 1966</xref>). Future studies may wish to counterbalance the start of the trials to prevent order effects rather than completely counterbalancing the presentation of all trials by type and location. This may prevent a potential dishabituation confound because participants will be asked to report fading to all trials of a stimulus type, and location, before a new stimulus is presented. It is also suggested that in between trials of different stimuli types, the researcher may wish to present a series of previously habituated stimuli to measure dishabituation.</p>
<p>Further investigation of habituation processes should combine event-related potentials and functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the underlying neural components. Future research may also attempt to measure degree of functional impairment at home, school/work, and relationships. A better understanding of the underlying neural activity of visual habituation deficits in ADHD and the degree of functional impairment in different settings may lead to the development of tests with the specificity to diagnose ADHD. Specific tests will enable clinicians to identify attentional deficits earlier, make more accurate diagnoses, monitor medication efficacy as well as develop more effective interventions.</p>
