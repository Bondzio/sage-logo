<p>The book aims to provide a practical guide for designing and managing learning programmes that occur in the workplace. The main focus is on developing a seamless integration of the courses shared between higher education institutions and the workplace. Such learning is formally known as ‘work-integrated learning’ in which the workplace becomes a formal aspect of the university curriculum that seeks to combine theory and practice.</p>
<p>Work-integrated learning is largely ‘about students working to learn – and students learning to work’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>The authors combine a wealth of experience derived from their 15 years of research explorations that covered different disciplinary, professional, policy, cultural and legislative environments. Their initial research showed that there was no formal professional organization that was responsible for the quality and conduct of work-integrated learning, and hence no database that revealed which universities included work-integrated learning in their degree programmes. The collective infrastructure was ‘largely invisible, without infrastructure or policies to support its practice’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>The purpose of this text is to present a paradigm for the necessary infrastructure that would ensure the quality of such work-integrated learning.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, the authors report that governments and universities are now deeply interested in work-related learning programmes, which have become a vital higher education enterprise.</p>
<p>The chapters include aspects of policy and conceptual frameworks; guidelines for teaching, assessment and supervision; and various issues of management and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>This is a very thorough and scholarly work that is essential to the development of higher education programmes that seek to integrate with the workplace. The final summary reads:<disp-quote>
<p>The [work-integrated] programme design is complex as it must accommodate the needs of the university, the realities of the workplace, the interest of the community, and, above all, the learning needs of the students. All parties require an understanding of their particular responsibilities, and of the educational and practical frameworks underpinning the programme. (p. 188)</p>
