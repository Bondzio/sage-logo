<p>In this exceptionally direct and data-driven book, Lane Kenworthy argues that increasing employment rates are an ideal solution to the rapidly rising rates of income inequality across countries. He focuses on employment growth because it “enlarges the tax base, allowing tax revenues to rise [and]…reduces welfare state costs” (p. 272), thus reducing income inequality. He argues that citizens and governments should be interested in reducing income inequality for reasons of fairness and because income inequality has adverse effects on social cohesion, health, overall wealth, and the political process. Oddly, this is perhaps the most unconvincing set of arguments in the book, in part, because the existing research on this topic is, as he admits, incomplete and is not a claim for which he provides empirical evidence. Fortunately, this is not a problem that plagues the rest of the book.</p>
<p>In the core part of <italic>Jobs with Equality</italic>, Kenworthy performs aggregate level comparative work on employment rates and growth in twelve welfare states (also called advanced capitalist democracies): Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In particular, he explores the relationship between employment growth and six policies and institutions: high wages in the low part of the wage distribution, strong regulations protecting employment, government benefit generosity, high taxes, job skills, and what he calls “women-friendly” policies (typically called family policies). For the first four areas, he finds that the usually hypothesized adverse effect on employment growth is greatly exaggerated and probably has minimal impact. He finds no association between skills, measured as adult literacy, and employment rates or growth. He also finds that several “women-friendly” policies are associated with high rates of employment among prime working-age women (ages 25–54), but not with employment growth in this population or among younger or older women. While scholars who specialize in the substantive areas described in each of these core areas would find a bone or two to pick with the data and analytical choices made, his arguments and findings are largely consistent with existing literature and, in many places, contribute significantly to it.</p>
<p>Given these findings, what are countries to do if they want to grow “jobs with equality”? Kenworthy spends the last chapter on recommendations along these lines. He first argues that his research reveals that there are multiple paths to high employment growth and that there is no particular policy or institution that countries can implement to become a “high-employment, high-equality” society. Instead, different countries should implement different combinations of policies, while constantly experimenting and adjusting them. In particular, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States should increase the minimum wage, taxes, the generosity of some government benefits, the availability of publicly-funded childcare and preschool, and active labor market programs (with public employment as a “last resort”). Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden should soften protection regulations, shift tax burden from payroll and consumption taxes, reduce long maternity leaves, allow lower wages at the low end of the wage distribution, and implement other employment regulations. The continental European countries should do a combination of these things. Kenworthy carefully weighs objections and alternatives to his recommendations. He concludes with a short discussion of the politics of his “jobs with equality” approach, noting that some of his recommendations are more politically plausible than others, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom. This discussion could have been productively expanded, especially in light of the careful attention paid to the recommendations given.</p>
<p>Like all of Lane Kenworthy’s work, this book is marked by clear writing, an explicit description of all empirical data and decisions, careful data analysis, and a systematic consideration of alternative explanations. In particular, there is substantial, and admirable, attention paid to the measurement and analysis of employment performance. Analyzing comparative data on welfare states and employment, in particular, is notoriously difficult due to small-N problems, correlated data points, and high degrees of collinearity. He has worked around many of these problems in ingenious and methodologically sound ways that are still accessible to the reader not well-versed in statistics. While there are certainly other, more advanced, statistical methods that could have been used in the book, Kenworthy, in many ways, finds a sweet spot in that it is technical and rigorous enough that we can take his conclusions seriously without being so technical that only specialists can understand the findings. This careful analysis and careful attention to solutions and recommendations make this book of use to any scholar or policymaker interested in income inequality and ways to reduce it.</p>
