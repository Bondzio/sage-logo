<title>The demise of nursing?</title>
<p>I find it hard to believe that I am writing an editorial for the beginning of yet another year. These last 12 months have gone by so quickly and have given us cause for concern and also reason to celebrate. Colleagues in near and more distant lands have had to endure catastrophic environmental disasters, political upheaval and even punishment for providing care and treatment to those involved in political action. There have also been painful memorials as anniversaries were marked and those who lost their lives, due to the actions of others, were remembered. Alongside these events, are reports of heroic deeds and self-sacrifice demonstrating the resilience and generosity of the human spirit. There has then also been cause to celebrate with reason for hope and optimism.</p>
<p>In UK nursing, media and research attention continue to focus on the darker dimensions of care practices and it appears that there is little to celebrate. Most recently, a report by the Care Quality Commission<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011431922">1</xref>
</sup> detailed yet more violations of patients’ privacy and dignity. These high profile reports tend to make the headlines and seem likely to challenge public confidence in the health professions, particularly nursing. Such reports and other research studies detailing unethical practice suggest that something is seriously amiss in nursing. I would like to hear from colleagues in other countries as to whether this is purely a UK phenomenon?</p>
<p>In 2007, Linda Shields and Roger Watson published an article entitled ‘The demise of nursing in the United Kingdom: a warning for medicine’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011431922">2</xref>
</sup> They argued that ‘nursing is under threat and could pass away, to be replaced by technicians, minimally educated health care assistants and unqualified health workers’ (p.70). Other practitioners are replacing nurses, according to the authors. It is also argued that ‘nursing is trespassing on traditional medical territory’ (p.71) and cost-cutting may be a contributory factor. They argue ‘[i]f nursing roles are given to technicians, and nurses take on the jobs that doctors do not want, nursing will die, and consequences to the community will be severe’ (p.73). Health care assistants, they say, may be able to make beds and wash patients but would not be skilled enough to observe the formation of a pressure sore. Shields and Watson were critical of the fact that, in 2007, nursing was not an all-graduate profession in England and of much UK nursing ‘research’ as it amounts to audit and evaluation of programmes or initiatives led by the health service. They state that ‘[h]aving universities produce qualified nurses <italic>en masse</italic>, with little regard to standards, resolves nothing’ (p.73). The authors point out that there is a need for education in ethics and philosophy given the challenges from emerging diseases.</p>
<p>Four years on, this critique may seem less potent. As from 2012, nursing will be an all graduate profession across the UK. Those of us who work in universities would challenge the view that larger student numbers necessarily reduce the quality of the educational experience. This does, however, require more creativity and sensitivity to the needs of individuals within larger groups. Ethics education is an essential part of this and needs to be as engaging and relevant to everyday practice as possible. It remains the case that the profession needs to guard against losing its identity as a profession concerned with skilled, knowledgeable and ethical responses to the holistic needs of patients, families and communities. We need also to guard against indifference, powerlessness and buck-passing. Nursing is the business of all of us and we need to regain control: by valuing and articulating what is good about our profession at every opportunity. We need also to do everything in our power, in our different areas of practice and in diverse cultural contexts, to understand and eradicate unethical practice.</p>
<p>We all have some power and we all have choices – registered nurses who observe unethical practice must challenge it and follow the procedures to raise and escalate concerns; teachers must work creatively with students enabling them to build the confidence and courage for ethical practice and leadership;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011431922">3</xref>
</sup> researchers must continue to research the inter-relationship between individual behaviour and organizational culture;<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011431922">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011431922">5</xref>
</sup> and nurse managers must role model ethical practice and challenge aspects of organizations that undermine it. All of us should lobby politicians and policy-makers when initiatives are proposed that undermine the core values and purpose of our profession.</p>
<p>Nursing is potentially threatened by new roles and by taking on the activities of doctors. The death of ethical nursing is, however, avoidable and the demise of unethical nursing practice is to be welcomed. What is more threatening to the profession is for those within its ranks to turn a blind eye to unethical practice. We need to look forward to a Renaissance in nursing – to developing a professional practice that we can all be proud of and that patients and families can have confidence in; a practice that is research-based but does not lose its raison d’etre as a humanistic endeavour committed to the betterment of the lives of individual patients and communities. The articles in this issue of <italic>Nursing Ethics</italic> provide, as always, many fine examples of research and scholarship that contribute to advancing our understanding of ethics in relation to the challenges of everyday healthcare practice and education.</p>
