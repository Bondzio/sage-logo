<p>Geraldine Pratt’s new book is both engaging and troubling. ‘This book’, the reader is told, is ‘an effort to unsettle complacency around temporary labor migration’ (p. 163). In recent years, Gerry notes, the LCP has been more firmly positioned as a <italic>temporary</italic> work program in the context of a growing worldwide trend towards state-sanctioned temporary labor migration. The LCP is located between the ‘colliding and colluding neoliberal projects’ of the governments of Canada and the Philippines. Yet the resultant scattering of families across the globe as ‘a result of the material, concrete timing and spacing of labor migration’ remains ‘fairly invisible to those positioned in the global North’ (p. xxvii).</p>
<p>This is a book about the consequences of the differential valuing of families – the trauma of what amounts to state-mandated family dislocation for one set of families in order to provide care for another set of families. Years of separation and sacrifice, enduring deskilling and long hours of hard work, are described in Chapter 1. Children – ‘migration is so often done in their name, for their future’ (p. 71), but when finally reunited there are stories of divorce, children not bonding with their mothers, resentments and disappointments on both sides. The impacts of the program not only reverberate across the globe back to the Philippines where children are cared for by extended families, but also into the future. ‘What comes before haunts the present and the long-term effects of temporary migration are not so easily erased’ (p. 167). The deskilling associated with the LCP goes on to haunt the next generation. The children of the LCP participants are not doing well in Vancouver’s schools or labor market. The mothers get marked as bad mothers in the Philippines for abandoning their children, and in Canada for the problems associated with their children once reunited.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, a dress made of used overseas telephone cards poignantly represents the women’s efforts to tighten the chains of dislocations. Absent mothers. Children waiting. Disembodied mothering. Mothers financially unable to buy a computer and becoming cyborg mothers emailing and ‘skyping’. Fear that your children will not recognize you, will have transferred their affections to someone else. Children describing their mothers’ infrequent visits to the Philippines as bewildering and stressful. ‘Transnational mothering cannot transcend distance’ (p. 70).</p>
<p>What to do with testimonies of mothers’ sadness, loss, and grief? How can they be circulated so they ‘disrupt Canadians’ passive consent to and complacency about labor export and import and the separation of Filipino families across extensive distance for long periods of time’ (p. xxiv) and ‘evoke an affective and effective response from policy makers’ (p. 76)? In addressing these questions, Gerry and the PWC use various representational strategies and theoretical framings to create spaces of intercultural dialogue and reformulate relations of responsibility. In Chapter 3, for instance, they turn to Kelly Oliver’s concept of <italic>witnessing</italic> that moves beyond the recognition of difference (often based on finding similarities and ‘spectatorship’) to the less hierarchical, potentially more destabilizing act of witnessing – being open to connections and responses across difference (‘response-ability’). Testimonies are made more unsettling by the insertion of photos of Gerry’s son, or by identifying emotionally complex attachments to children <italic>and</italic> employers – ways to highlight complicity and to ‘produce responsible witnesses’ (p. 95). In Chapter 4, testimonial theater becomes another vehicle for circulating testimonies. Interview ‘data’ are transformed into monologues; a domestic worker’s bedroom (‘a tangible container of memory’ – p. 106) is reproduced as part of a theater production which included talkback sessions. An egalitarian space of politics emerged, filled with moments of connection and contestation: ‘the power of performance … The intimacy of witnessing operates in a different epistemological register than facts received from a distance’ (p. 131).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 explicitly addresses the troubling connection between the state-sanctioned ‘export’ of overseas Filipino workers and Canada’s LCP. Many Canadians ‘fail to see the violence of these state policies’ (p. 133). But not all. Nine Canadian human rights activists joined with Filipino counterparts to bear witness to state-sanctioned human rights abuses in the Philippines, including military harassment, terrorizing, and killing. Tracing relational geographies such as these foregrounds connections between people and places across the globe. Witnessing the violence of the LCP ‘opens a radiating set of obligations to witness not only within Canada but beyond’ (p. 133). The concluding chapter offers no tidy closures; there is no petition to sign. Instead, the reader is asked ‘to examine the boundaries of your world’ (p. 172) and take action.</p>
<p>I liked this book, so my critiques are of the sympathetic sort. For example, I found the concept of witnessing that emerges in various places in the book to be really powerful. Yet I was already a long way into the book before I appreciated how promising this idea is in reframing discussions of ethics and responsibility and for re-examining all sorts of boundaries. It would have been helpful to have the concept flagged more clearly in the introduction, perhaps alongside the discussion of testimony and affect.</p>
<p>Much of the book is about practising family in transnational space and the ‘profound rupture of attachment’ (p. 64). But what happens to other familial relations and attachments hinted at throughout the book? The grandparents left crying at the airport as their grandchildren leave, the children who become too old to sponsor? These are other dislocations emerging from the state-induced trauma of separation (in these cases, separation that is likely permanent). Given that it is usually left to women to engage in the kin-work that maintains intimate relationships over distance, how are former LCP participants working through that? Increasingly described as emotional transnationalism, these attachments are further lines of connection that bind together the Philippines and Canada long after the reunification of mothers and children.</p>
<p>Similarly I applaud the skillful way Gerry links together different forms of state violence in Canada and the Philippines and holds ‘the reader to the obligation to witness’ (p. 136). Yet I was looking for more connective tissue between the testimonies of the former LCP participants – given the book’s focus on migrant mothers – and the harrowing narratives from Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog. For instance, are some of the women from these regions? Do they have relatives there? Is it something that they discuss extensively? I imagine the answer is yes to all of these – and, having met people like Maria, John, Jhimmy, Marlena, and Libery, this information would have provided another productive opportunity for me to ‘attach to these issues, question justice of temporary labor migration and consider that lawful government policy can be violent in its effects’ (p. 172).</p>
