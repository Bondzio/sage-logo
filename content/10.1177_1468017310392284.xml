<p>• <italic>Summary</italic>: This article reports findings from an evaluation of the Volunteers in Child Protection (ViCP) pilot study commissioned by Community Service Volunteers (CSV) and conducted in two English authorities. The study examined expectations, experiences and identified benefits for three stakeholder groups – families, volunteers and social workers; and offered an opportunity to explore the implications of developing an expanded role for volunteers, within child protection services. The study sample comprised the first 14 families in the two authorities to be matched with a volunteer, and including the respective social workers and volunteers, in all 21 individuals were interviewed at two points in time.</p>
<p>• <italic>Findings</italic>: Conclusions to be drawn are that the ViCP project was successful at recruiting and mentoring volunteers to work with families with complex needs; and their contributions suggest that local authority social work could draw on such initiatives to provide support functions. Its inputs could mitigate the negative effects of frequency of change of social workers, and help reduce the increasing dominance of a narrow model of child protection.</p>
<p>• <italic>Applications</italic>: 1) There is an inevitable inter-dependent relationship between the culture of local authority children’s services departments, including the point at, and frequency with which, social workers can access supplementary family support services, from a voluntary sector agency such as ViCP. 2) A ‘shared ownership’ model of social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310392284">Laming, 2009</xref>) is explored whereby mentored volunteers help to broaden and enlarge the evidence-base on families to enable improved decision-making and risk assessment.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468017310392284" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>An enduring policy theme across the child care policies of both Conservative and New Labour governments has been the twofold challenge of reconciling the duty to <italic>promote the welfare</italic> of children with the duty to <italic>safeguard their welfare.</italic> There has been a longstanding tension between the task of <italic>assessing need</italic>, including the need for child protection services, with the actual <italic>delivery of services to children and families.</italic> Although the exact nature of the debate will vary slightly in the terms in which it is framed, the challenges remain the same, whether the solutions proffered are expressed in the terminology of the Children Act 1989, or in the aspirations of <italic>Every child matters</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310392284">DfES, 2003</xref>) which led to the ensuing Children Act 2004. A key aim of the latter is to ensure that systems, structures and services neither overlook the importance in children’s lives of ‘safeguarding’ nor of ‘promoting’ their welfare. Both <italic>Every child matters</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310392284">DfES, 2003</xref>) and <italic>Every child matters: Next steps</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310392284">DfES, 2005</xref>) underline the fact that the realization of these outcomes requires radical changes in services. Such changes include more specialized help to promote opportunity, prevent problems and act early and effectively if and when problems arise; dedicated and enterprising leadership at all levels of the system; and the development of a shared sense of responsibility across agencies for safeguarding children and protecting them from harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468017310392284">DfEs, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Following the case of ‘Baby P’ the DCSF commissioned Lord Laming ‘to recommend actions for systematic improvements in safeguarding children across the country’ (2009, p. 3). His report entitled <italic>The protection of children in England: A progress report</italic> issued 58 recommendations – all of which the government pledged to implement – including setting up a National Safeguarding Delivery Unit, improved overall leadership to upgrade the quality of risk assessment, decision-making, onward referrals and multi-agency working; and better social work training, particularly CPD. The latter proposal is consistent with the general approach of the current GSCC Framework which emphasizes a generic consolidation of practice and specific enhanced PQ awards focusing on complex situations, for example, risk assessment and decision-making; networks and multi-disciplinary aspects; and competence in enabling others.</p>
<p>A recurrent theme arising from inspections and child death inquiries is that social work practice needs to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468017310392284">Reder &amp; Duncan, 2004</xref>). The challenge for child care social workers is how to maintain creativity and innovation in a climate of increasing risk awareness, regulation, resource restrictions and limited staff numbers. The recruitment and retention difficulties within the social work profession have been evident for some time and remain a particular challenge within the field of child care social work. The national picture which emerges is challenging. Vacancies for children’s social workers stood at 9.5 percent in 2007 and turnover rates at 9.6 percent. Some 64 percent of Local Authorities reported difficulties in recruiting children’s social workers in 2008, and 39 percent had difficulty in retaining them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468017310392284">Local Government Workforce Survey, 2008</xref>). The combination of highly stressed social workers operating within resource constraints, torn between achieving targets set by the organization and meeting the needs of the child, does not create the optimum environment for innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>Recent policy developments, built on <italic>Every child matters</italic>, put the spotlight on the nature, capacity and calibre of the children’s workforce. The main components of this change process can be found in <italic>The children’s plan</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310392284">DCSF, 2008</xref>). <italic>The children’s plan</italic> contains different explicit and implicit messages for a range of professionals including social work, some positive some less so. For example, while there is concern that social workers spend too little time with children in the looked-after system, social workers themselves are frustrated about the amount of time they have to spend on direct work with children. Pressures are increased by the requirements of new recording systems for example. The Children and Young People’s Workforce Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310392284">DCSF, 2008</xref>) includes a commitment to the ensuring of support for good social work practice alongside other government proposals for the diversification of the wider children’s workforce in the interests of improved outcomes for children. This policy focus on both the <italic>quality of safeguarding services</italic> and the <italic>development of the workforce</italic> comprise the policy context for this project evaluation. The piloting of a Community Service Volunteers ‘Volunteers in Child Protection Project’ offered the opportunity to explore some of the possible implications of developing an expanded role for <italic>volunteers</italic>, as opposed to paid staff, within child protection services. A £three million cross-governmental programme Volunteering for All was announced in March 2006 to identify and remove barriers to volunteering in England. Indeed current political debate within and between the two main parties in respect of the role of the third sector (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468017310392284">Baines &amp; Hardill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468017310392284">Cabinet Office, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468017310392284">House of Commons, 2006</xref>) frequently proffers such strategies as a logical response to the unresolved policy and practice challenges identified above. At the very least, the issues raised by the project evaluation reported here, serve to illuminate specific aspects of the experience of families and social workers of the current design and delivery of safeguarding services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1468017310392284"><title>Risk rationalities in contemporary social work practice</title>
<p>In child protection, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468017310392284">Munro (2008)</xref> has argued that the emphasis on risk has meant that professionals may overestimate risk of abuse, as the dangers to children and to themselves of making a mistake can be so great. The risk of harm through hyper-vigilant good intentions should be as much to the forefront of our thinking as the risk of harm through lack of <italic>watchfulness.</italic> Take, for example, the proposed National Child Database wherein every child in the UK will have a computer file, and ‘incidents’ which might affect their development and ‘circumstances’ regarded as risky or adverse will be entered by the different professionals who come into contact with them. This scheme has raised doubts in the minds of some academics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468017310392284">Munro, 2005</xref>) over what will be the level of decisional accuracy, or indeed, of accurate reading. The aim of this new scheme is that information about children will be easier to ‘share’ – a factor that inquiries regularly throw out as something to be improved upon. But sharing information does not tackle the equally important one of interpreting the <italic>significance</italic> of items in the wash of information that passes back and forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468017310392284">Sheldon &amp; Macdonald, 2009</xref>). <italic>The framework for risk assessment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310392284">DoH, 2000</xref>) provided a shift in professional perspective from a risk-driven approach to one prioritizing prevention, family support services and the consideration of risk within a continuum of the child’s level of need. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468017310392284">Cooper (2004)</xref> suggests that risk is too complicated to quantify and to understand the nature of risk requires risk relations to be measured across and between each category of the domains.</p>
<p>Although signs after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310392284">Laming (2009)</xref> indicate a likely movement away from a ‘tick-box’ approach to risk, currently risk management increasingly requires practitioners to follow procedures and guidelines. The introduction of the Common Assessment Framework (CAF) as an information-sharing system has been to try to manage risk through improved systems of information-sharing and more structured and effective referrals between agencies. One of its intentions is to locate the provision of services to children in need in non-social work agencies at an earlier stage without the stigmatization so often associated with social work intervention. The CAF has been welcomed as a way of giving more control to other agencies such as health and education, and of lessening the need to rely on social work services. Boody, Wigfull, and Simon (2007) in their evaluation of one of the CAF trailblazing sites found that social workers played an invaluable role in providing support and advice to other professionals in the crucial elements of risk identification. However, inevitable differences in perception about what constitutes the need for protection or disagreement regarding the interpretation of risk will continue.</p>
<p>Formal risk tools are not always completed or used and practitioners tend to favour case-based information in their decision-making rather than formal calculations of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468017310392284">Wood &amp; Kemshall, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468017310392284">2008</xref>). Practitioners do not operate risk assessment tools in pure form, but operate subjective overrides where cases make them anxious. They use case-based narratives and ‘storytelling’ to formulate their views of risk, but these narratives of risk are often incomplete and ‘at odds’ with actuarial views of risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468017310392284">Laming (2009)</xref> recommends improved leadership to provide a more strategic approach to risk assessments across all senior levels of public services including health and the police, that is, a single national Integrated Children’s System. He argues that building blocks should include raising the quality and consistency of social work degrees to provide high quality practical skills, for example, in evidence-gathering, decision-making and critical thinking around risk analysis (26: 88). The use of mentored volunteers to support professional practice helps provide a more rounded picture of the circumstances of children and families by enlarging the database. Workers who prefer to see the ‘whole picture’ and strive for more holistic views of users resist the actuarial-based system approach to risk data-gathering as this de-contextualizes the service user transforming them into repositories of risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468017310392284">Hannah-Moffat, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Any service provided will face the challenge of operating against the backdrop of these often conflicting ends and means, and in this the ViCP project was no different.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1468017310392284"><title>The CSV volunteers in child protection project</title>
<p>This two pilot project, established in two sites in two English authorities, broke new ground for volunteer-provided services by focusing on families who were <italic>already within the ‘child protection system</italic>’. The aim was to deliver family support services to families who had at least one child on the Child Protection Register, and were referred to the project by the local authority social worker who had responsibility for their case.</p>
<p>The project was initially supported financially by the Monument Trust, supplemented by additional funding which enabled the establishment of two pilot projects, one in the south and one in the north of England. Two project workers were appointed, a full-time worker in the northern borough, and a part-time worker in the southern borough. The postholders were both physically located, or indeed embedded within the children’s services departments, in order to facilitate close working relationships; information sharing; and the making of referrals across the project staff and the local authority staff.</p>
<p>The project had two overall objectives:
<list id="list1-1468017310392284" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to support families under stress and to help protect children from abuse and harm.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to test out the role volunteers can play alongside local authority professional staff and others in ensuring that children considered to be at risk are visited regularly and their families supported.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>More specific aims of the project were:
<list id="list2-1468017310392284" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to increase levels of contact with support services for families with children on the Child Protection Register;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to support the achievement of positive outcomes for children;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to enable CSV develop its systems for involving volunteers in work with families who have children on the Child Protection Register;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to contribute through the work of volunteers to actualizing the protection of children as a ‘community responsibility’.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The project workers in each of the two local authorities had relevant work experience prior to their appointment, including, probation, mental health, court, and volunteer experience. Their responsibilities included the recruitment and training of volunteers. All volunteers were subject to a Criminal Records Bureau check and efforts were made to maximize the recruitment of representatives from minority ethnic groups in the areas. Volunteers underwent an 18-hour programme of training which included law and national and local child and family policy; the development of specific inter-personal skills and the building of relationships; and their preparation for any contingency they might encounter in the course of their work, including appropriately responding to an event taking place in the course of their visit, which might constitute a child protection concern. They publicized the project by raising awareness of it with all the relevant local key stakeholders. These included the social work managers and front-line staff who would be crucial in referring families to the project, as well as health visitors, GPs, and, where they have existed, other family support provider agencies such as Home Start.</p>
<p>They received referrals and matched volunteers and families on the basis of variables including age, ethnicity, specific personal circumstances (such as both having a child with special needs). Project workers participated in the initial meeting between the volunteer and the family, and provided support and mentoring throughout the match, including the end of the match. By the end of the evaluation, volunteers in the pilots had worked with 29 families who between them had 102 children. The actual implementation cost of the project, including a full time project worker was just under £60,000.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1468017310392284"><title>The knowledge base for the project</title>
<p>The design and delivery of the CSV pilot initiative was grounded in a widely recognized knowledge base, which includes data on both ‘outcomes’ as well as the views of those who use family support services. Indeed the project has had its origins within a challenging period of extensive government policy development intended to strengthen systems capable of addressing the tasks of both the <italic>safeguarding</italic> and <italic>promotion</italic> of the welfare of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468017310392284">DfES, 2005</xref>). The notion of building on family strengths and on the capacity of family members to support each other has been endorsed through a recent Cabinet Office paper: <italic>Think family: Improving the life chances of families at risk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310392284">Cabinet Office, 2008</xref>). The CSV project intersects, directly or indirectly, with all four of the aspired reforms of the Children Act, however the operational challenges it faces are hardly new. The extent and longevity of these challenges is underlined by the consistency of an enduring set of key issues within child protection research literature over a sustained period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468017310392284">DoH, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Outcome-focused studies of interventions on targeted populations of children and families, where problems have already been identified and where selected services are delivered with a view to allowing these particular children to flourish and remain in their own homes have been undertaken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468017310392284">Hill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392284">Mc Neish, Newman, &amp; Roberts, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468017310392284">Quinton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468017310392284">Tunstill &amp; Aldgate, 2000</xref>). Mackay’s study (2003) identifies resilience as a process of adaptation under challenges to well-being, and that all families have the potential for building on current and potential family strengths, moving away from a ‘deficit’ model, where risks and problems are the primary focus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468017310392284">Kalil (2003)</xref> draws on empirical studies to highlight three processes of family resilience: family belief systems, family cohesion and coping strategies. Key themes from recent literature of relevance to the CSV project design include the following: poverty is associated with child maltreatment – the prevention of child abuse and neglect requires economic and social reforms; community based projects may protect children by developing formal and informal networks for parents and by helping professionals to work together; children from lower socio-economic groups seem to benefit most from preventive programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468017310392284">McNeish et al., 2002</xref>); strategies and programmes work best when the community, child and family want to be involved and want the intervention to work; and lastly to be effective, parenting programmes need to ensure that they do not stigmatize or create dependency and last long enough for change to be sustained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468017310392284">Parrott, Buchanan, &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). The overall picture to emerge of the impact of many ‘preventive’ interventions is however less than encouraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468017310392284">Gilbert et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A central focus of the CSV project was on those children whose names have been entered on the child protection register within the <italic>Neglect</italic> category. Neglect has now been acknowledged as being seriously damaging for children, and to represent a significant challenge for child care practitioners, given that the number of children registered for neglect has increased year on year. On the basis of the most recent statistics available, it represents the highest category (41%) of all registrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468017310392284">Turney &amp; Tanner, 2005</xref>). Given these service delivery imperatives it is perhaps hardly surprising that the literature also shows a high profile for voluntary agencies, much of whose work is based on a set of values and principles which are very compatible with these ideas.</p>
<p>Voluntary sector child care agencies are extensively involved in family support provision through both centre based services or home visiting schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468017310392284">Henricson, Katz, Mesie, Sandison, &amp; Tunstill, 2002</xref>). Perhaps the best known and most widely evaluated these are probably Home Start and Newpin. There have been several evaluations of Home Start, which as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468017310392284">Frost et al. (2000, p. 329, emphasis added)</xref> describe as ‘an organisation active in both what we might call <italic>family support</italic> and <italic>child protection</italic>’. Home Start uses parent volunteers, to deliver a home visiting service. Evaluations have concluded that Home Start could mobilize local commitment, both in recruiting voluntary visitors and management committees; contributed to the continuum of local family support services; could work in partnership with local professionals; and were able to deliver a flexible non-stigmatizing service. However, more recent evaluations focusing on child level outcomes have been more cautious (McCauley et al., 2006) showing that mothers appeared to have little social support, and this was often the only non-statutory service available.</p>
<p>Evaluations of government sponsored family support programmes, such as the Children’s Fund (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468017310392284">Mason, Morris, &amp; Smith, 2005</xref>) and Sure Start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468017310392284">Belsky, Barnes, &amp; Melhuish, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468017310392284">Malin &amp; Morrow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468017310392284">Weinberger, Pickstone, &amp; Hannon, 2005</xref>) identified different methods of parental involvement. Many of the services provided under both these ‘funding umbrellas’ engage agencies in the voluntary and statutory sectors in delivering a service to support families so that children can experience enhanced parenting, and so achieve the five <italic>Every child matters</italic> outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468017310392284">Tunstill, Allnock, Akehurst, Garbers, &amp; the NESS Research Team, 2005</xref>). A key finding in relation to outcomes for individual children, though not necessarily children on the Child Protection register, is that families with the most complex needs require a robust outreach strategy, without which they are highly unlikely to access centre based services. In short, home visiting services are both a crucial service in their own right, as well as a means to the end of ultimately accessing other services in the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468017310392284"><title>The evaluation design</title>
<p>This study set out to examine the expectations, experiences and identified benefits of three stakeholder groups: families, volunteers and social workers.</p>
<p>The sample of respondents intended to be interviewed comprised seven families, along with their social worker and volunteer in each of the two pilot boroughs, that is, potentially 21 individuals interviewed at two points in time, in each of the two boroughs, that is, a potential total of 84 interviews/questionnaires. In each borough, the intention was to select the first seven matches, who in the opinion of the project workers, had reached a sufficiently well established point for their participation in the study to be appropriate. However, the overall response rate in both boroughs from all participants, was disappointing, especially in respect of the data intended to be collected at the second point in time, and the difficulties in making contact with social workers in particular.</p>
<p>The two part-time researchers used a range of qualitative methods including the analysis of policy documents; project monitoring data, and the application, at two points in time, of a tailor made semi-structured questionnaire. These were completed electronically by social workers, whereas a set of face-to-face interviews at two points in time, were undertaken with parents and volunteers. The questions were designed to explore questions such as: why did social workers make a referral? What did they hope the project would deliver for their families? How would they know if these aspirations had been realized? What/why did parents like, or not like about the service offered and or received? Why did individuals want to enrol as volunteers? With these considerations in mind, the evaluation design incorporated the following inter-linked elements.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1468017310392284"><title>An assessment at two points in time of the needs of the family/children</title>
<p>The completion, by the social worker for the family, of a questionnaire at two points in time, which explored their perception of the family situation, which, in addition to including the extent to which that situation was capable of meeting the safeguarding needs of the children, focused on the impact of the volunteer input. The first application sought to identify the nature of the input desired by the social worker; and the second application, at the end of the ‘match’, the extent to which these were met. This strategy also explicitly acknowledged the statutory responsibility of social workers for children on the Child Protection Register. The fact that the assessment remained the responsibility of the child’s own social worker was to help avoid complex issues around statutory responsibility, risk, and/or anxiety for social worker/managers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1468017310392284"><title>A set of interviews with parents/carers, at two points in time, including the application of the Parenting Daily Hassles Questionnaire</title>
<p>This phase of the work was undertaken on a face-to-face basis, by the researchers, one based in London, one based in the northern borough. It was intended to enable the collection of data on the circumstances, views, functioning of the parents/carers. It sought to ascertain their own views about the support offered by the volunteers and enabled the measurement of parental well-being across the course of the project through a relatively well-known format, developed in the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468017310392284">DoH, 2000</xref>). The Parenting Daily Hassles Scale aims to assess the frequency and intensity/impact of 20 potential parenting ‘daily’ hassles experienced by adults caring for children. It has been used in a wide variety of research studies concerned with children and families, and it has been found that parents like filling it out, because it touches on many aspects of being a parent that are important to them.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1468017310392284"><title>An interview with individual volunteers at two points in time</title>
<p>This was designed to explore the overall motivation and experience of the volunteers, including areas of satisfaction and/or specific anxiety in respect of visiting families with complex needs. Earlier interviews were undertaken by the researcher in the southern borough to ascertain the relevance and clarity of the questions. The limited researcher resources available precluded this being done more extensively and so volunteers were asked to complete either electronic or hard copies as they preferred, but the majority of follow-up interviews were undertaken face-to-face.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1468017310392284"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All interviews were content-analysed using a framework approach (Ritchie &amp; Spencer, 1994). This involved several stages: first, <italic>familiarization</italic> with the data, and second, <italic>identification of a thematic framework</italic>, developed from <italic>a priori issues</italic>, <italic>emergent issues</italic> and <italic>analytic issues.</italic> The framework was then applied to the data through <italic>indexing</italic> and <italic>charting</italic>. Finally, through <italic>mapping</italic> and <italic>interpretation</italic> of the data, the key themes within the data set were brought together as a whole to answer the research questions.</p>
<sec id="sec10-1468017310392284"><title>Project inputs across the two pilot boroughs</title>
<p>The overall number of families worked with in the two boroughs was 29 (16 in the southern borough; 13 in the northern one). A further 35 families were referred but not matched with a volunteer. The main reasons for this were changes in family circumstances, and to a lesser extent change of social worker. In all 43 parents or carers, for 102 children were involved (69 in the southern borough and 33 in the northern borough). The average age of the children across both boroughs was eight years. In all 60 volunteers were recruited and trained (32 in the south; 13 in the north) the average age of the volunteers was 41, and the great majority, four-fifths were female. The time input to families which they delivered totalled 263 weeks and the average length of contact between a volunteer and a family was 18 weeks.</p>
<p>In terms of general outcomes, 15 of the matches ended in a positive outcome for the family, either being de-registered or en route to deregistration in the eyes of the social workers. At the end of the pilot period 14 matches were ongoing.</p>

<sec id="sec11-1468017310392284"><title>An overview of parents, volunteers and social workers</title>
<sec id="sec12-1468017310392284"><title>Parents</title>
<p>The families almost exclusively lived in the poorer areas in each of the two pilot boroughs, mostly in social housing ranging from <italic>fairly adequate</italic> to <italic>about adequate.</italic> In the northern borough there was a mix of private and social housing. Most respondents painted a picture of very high levels of stress, often of poor health in the family, and in many families the parent identified one particular child as posing particular problems to them in their role as parents. All the families had larger than average families, the majority with four or more children. The majority were reconstituted families, with additional complicating issues around contact. In about a third of families, domestic violence was mentioned by the parents as a current or earlier problem. Three family units were the grandparents of the children for whom they were caring and in one case were in conflict with the local authority on being recognized foster carers, a status which would have benefited them financially. About half the parents identified a particular child whose behaviour caused them concern. The individual children who they did identify had serious behavioural problems, although only one of them was actually accommodated as a looked-after child in the early part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>Most parents were in touch with at least one other agency, in addition to social services. These were largely statutory, and probably unsurprisingly, the most frequently cited contacts were with health visitors for whom they tended to a consistently high level of satisfaction as the perceived source of heath and development advice, but who in addition were often seen as able to offer ‘broader supports’ if necessary. Other statutory agencies included were GPs; in one instance, the Family Court Advisor in a family where there was a major contact issue; and in only six families Sure Start. The (then) relatively rigid <italic>given</italic> geographical boundaries, need to be borne in mind when interpreting the use of Sure Start by families in any large borough, where they may well have fallen outside the eligibility boundary. By contrast with the frequency of visits from formal support agencies, there was far less mention of access to informal supports from friends and family. Less than a third mentioned help from relatives or friends, and in fact, one mother said she thought that her social worker over-estimated the extent to which she could call on her family. All the parents interviewed were clear about the different roles and responsibilities between the various agency workers who visited, including social workers and health visitors, as well as the differences between these workers and the CVS volunteers. Indeed they were particularly clear about the statutory responsibilities of social workers. This clarity applied across individual <italic>registration groups</italic>, that is, where there were concerns of general neglect as well as domestic violence.</p>
<p>All the families primarily saw their social worker as bearing key responsibilities for the protection of the children in the family. Whereas some had little or no problem with this state of affairs, and the explicit nature of child protection work, and this did not appear to have stopped them developing a positive relationship with the worker; others felt they were permanently under scrutiny, and did not associate the social worker with any other ‘support’ functions. Where families did convey a picture of having ‘better’ relationships with their social workers, one example they tended to give was the engagement, by social workers, in addition to the child protection role with practical support issues, including, for example, trying to help with re-housing applications to the council. They could even appreciate the intention to help, even if it did not always produce the desired result. One dominant concern was that of frequency of change of social worker, which recurred as a major source of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Families who were ‘less than happy’ with the relationship with their social worker felt social workers were merely there to inspect their behaviour as parents and often also cited their youth; and/or the fact that the social worker did not have children of their own. About half the parents identified a particular child whose behaviour caused them concern. The individual children who they did identify had serious behavioural problems, although only one of them was actually accommodated as a looked after child in the early part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>From the project itself they wanted help with parenting capacity and generally helping them organize domestic life in a way which would be more pleasant for themselves and their children. Alongside this, while the majority of parents tended to view the arrival of the volunteer as potentially helpful to the family as a whole, in families where a specific child posed a real challenge, they were keen that volunteers would devote specific attention to those children. However, there was simultaneously understandable apprehension about the prospect of an ‘unknown’ person coming into the house, who, for all the families, would be yet another individual engaging with their private lives. There was a considerable overlap about the things they hoped to get from the volunteer with almost universal agreement about ‘wanting someone who will listen to and support me’ and ‘make me feel better about myself’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1468017310392284"><title>The volunteers</title>
<p>The motivations for becoming a volunteer in the scheme varied. They included using experiences and skills to help others; making career changes which focused on entry to the social work/social care workforce; and having the overall satisfaction of undertaking charitable work. The group was entirely white and with one exception they were female. Their ages ranged from a grandmother of 63 to a 26-year-old education worker. Effort was made to match volunteers with families, so they could see for themselves the importance of the ‘fit’ between their own family experiences and the needs of the families.</p>
<p>The picture to emerge from volunteers in both boroughs was of satisfaction with the preparation that they received, qualified inevitably by their sense of anxiety and unfamiliarity with the roles they were about to play. In essence, they gave the impression of feeling they were as well prepared as they could be, in the absence of actually ‘doing’ the task. Examples of aspects of the preparation that were particularly helpful included being given examples of scenarios that may be encountered; being helped to understand why problems around abuse happen; the social work input and the brief by the project manager and family social worker and real case studies to work through with discussion of responses required. The major anticipated issue was the appropriate response required of them should a child protection concern emerge in the course of their visit, and overall they gave the impression of feeling well prepared and not overly anxious about this. The main tasks planned by volunteers were to try and ensure that safety in and around the home was considered, especially for the young children; to help and encourage schooling; to attend school meetings if required; to support the mother and help her to take responsibility; and to build up a relationship with the family and ideally staying in touch when they were no longer on the register.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1468017310392284"><title>The social workers</title>
<p>All the social workers with the exception of one social work assistant were basic grade social workers or senior practitioners, with the longest experience – 16 years – on the part of an unqualified worker, and the shortest two years in respect of half the sample. Half the social workers had little or no experience of working with volunteers, and half had experience of organizations such as Home Start. The length of time they had worked with the families before the project ranged from three years to three months. Half had been working with their families for a year or more, and half for very much less. The main aims of a social worker’s referral to the scheme included assisting and supporting the family in maintaining home conditions; offering support to the mother and boosting her self-esteem; providing a role model for the mother for parenting, including the provision of extra support in helping her keep important appointments; and support to improve the house, including using the table for meals and increasing level of stimulation for children, for example, reading books. Overall they were keen to create additional support to enable mothers to improve the parenting of their children that in the current resource climate could not be provided.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1468017310392284"><title>Perceptions of project service outcomes</title>
<p>There was a high level of overall satisfaction with volunteers on the part of the families and the social workers. Volunteers were seen as delivering a personalized support service which had an impact on the day-to-day functioning of families. After initial apprehension, they were regarded by both families and social workers as making an important contribution to the well being of the children and their families. In line with current policy, social workers saw themselves as ‘outcome focused’, and not merely keen to offer support. The majority of social workers focused on visible improvements in home conditions associated with the original registration for neglect. In addition to staying off the register, these improvements included better school attendance; children being clean and tidy for school; an increase in stimuli, such as seeing books lying around; and mothers reading to their children. Sources of this information included reports/observations of the family; feedback from project manager and other professionals; positive feedback from the mother; questioning the children and discussions with parents and volunteer; observation during visits and discussions with other professionals involved in the family; monitoring home conditions on a regular basis, and unannounced visits to the home.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1468017310392284"><title>A spotlight on two families</title>
<p>Gaps in the data precluded the measurement of outcomes over time for all the families who had received services in the pilot projects. However, these two case studies are based on data collected after an average of three to six months ‘input’ by the volunteers, and give a brief insight into family and volunteer experiences of the project.</p>
<p><italic>Family A</italic> had a relatively diverse professional contact network, including a social worker; a health visitor, and a children’s guardian. The social worker was primarily seen by the mother as ‘there for the child protection functions’, while she saw the health visitor as supportive and singled out the guardian for particular praise. The mother described a high level of stress at the start of the intervention – she explained that ‘having four children is really hard work!’ but was very relaxed and openly affectionate with her children. She was unsure as to what to expect, although she knew her volunteer was male and had children himself. She was aware that the child protection issues, which involved a violent ex-partner, were the primary focus of the social worker’s concerns. She was extremely positive about the experience of having had a volunteer and praised the input highly. She felt she had obtained all the benefits she had wanted, such as being listened to, generally supported, and helped with parenting skills and being facilitated to use other services and organizations. The volunteer had also been very supportive of the two older sons, who much appreciated his knowledge of football, and the mother felt, thrived with the extra attention the volunteer could provide whilst she was occupied with a younger, more challenging child. She also valued the volunteer taking up issues on her behalf with the local authority, including dealing with an apparently unnecessary delay in passing on funding for a new cooker. This parent reported very clear benefit in terms of her own increased personal development, which she attributed to the volunteer’s ability to help increase her sense of confidence. Her optimism and sense of purpose was very obvious and she was enrolling to work as a classroom assistant in the local school, and hoped to take an NVQ in the next year.</p>
<p><italic>The volunteer</italic> had retired from a job in banking and had three children of his own. This family was a second match for him and so he came to the work with some experience and was able to further apply the knowledge and skills he had acquired from the training provided about which he was very positive. He had clearly enjoyed working with this family and was pleased for the mother in respect of her emerging parenting abilities, and proud of the progress she had made, especially her new-found confidence and plans for employment. He described having established a good relationship with both the children and with the mother. He commented extensively, and critically, on what he saw as the domination of the child protection priorities of the social worker and felt that it was useful in terms of his career as a volunteer to be a parent himself, and that the family was clear as to his role with them. He had strong opinions about what he saw as the ‘illogic’ of withdrawing support at the point a family began to improve.</p>
<p>The <italic>social worker</italic>’s main responsibilities were for child protection, care proceedings and looked-after children, and she had no previous experience of using volunteers in a professional social work role. She had worked with the family for four years, and referred them specifically for a ‘male volunteer, who could provide support, someone to talk to and act as a good male role model who could engage with the children’. Her own contact with them was once a month and she saw herself judging the success of the input by the quality of the relationship that develops between the volunteer and the family. She saw the ViCP scheme as very useful, especially its confidentiality:<disp-quote>
<p>this is crucial to its success and usefulness to vulnerable families – they are much more likely to open up and engage if they feel that save for a Child Protection issue, nothing will be reported back … </p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Family B</italic> was allocated their CSV volunteer, at the point they were removed from the register, and the offer of a volunteer was made at the ‘deregistration conference’. The family had been originally registered on the basis of neglect, and their perceived continuing level of need, as ascertained in a core assessment, meant that the referral was made and accepted. The family had six children, were living in a very cramped council flat, and waiting re-housing, in addition to experiencing general stress around parenting. They also faced issues arising from low income. The mother had literacy problems. In terms of levels of support, the health visitor was seen by the mother as ‘very helpful’. Their social worker was also described as ‘excellent’ and she was trying to offer practical help with re-housing and to sort out heating allowances, as well as being ‘good at helping with problems with my son … ’ The social worker had been ‘wary of giving too much idea of what the volunteer would be like’ and encouraged her to talk to the volunteer coordinator who could explain the role. The coordinator’s input had been reassuring, but the face-to-face meeting with the volunteer removed any anxieties, and launched a very successful relationship. ‘A [the volunteer] is lovely! She is very understanding and accessible.’ This parent thought it very important that the volunteer was a parent herself, and was pleased that the volunteer had made this clear on the first visit.</p>
<p>By the end of the evaluation the children were about to be removed from the Register and the social worker was very positive about the impact of the volunteer’s work on the family functioning as contributing to this.</p>
<p><italic>The volunteer</italic>, a woman in her 60 s, had brought up her own children. Motivated by a desire to do something useful in the community for children and families, she had responded to an advertisement in the local free paper. She had found the training and preparation helpful, felt well prepared to work with families in the child protection system, although the issue of domestic violence had been a source of some concern for her at the very outset. She also worried that, for the parent, ‘having a volunteer might be an offer you can’t refuse … ’ As with other volunteers the actual first visit dispelled anxiety and she was very ‘pleasantly surprised and reassured that it would be OK … ’, although shocked at the level of stress engendered by eight people sleeping in three bedrooms in a small flat.</p>
<p>She was very conscious of the difference between her role and that of the social worker, in that she had ‘no statutory right to be there’ and had to be sensitive to the mother’s feelings and negotiate any ‘improvements or changes’ in her parenting behaviour. She and the family were clear about the purposes of the volunteer role, and she was always able to set appropriate boundaries. She endeavoured to be generally supportive and opted for an approach based on suggestion and encouragement. She was very satisfied by the experience of having been a volunteer, and specifically of working with <italic>this</italic> family. Her aspirations to ‘do something useful in the community’ and use her experiences and skills to help others had been completely satisfied and she was looking forward to continuing working with the project. She anticipated having continuing contact with the family: ‘they have asked me to still visit even when my role as a volunteer comes to an end’.</p>
<p>There were two <italic>social workers</italic> allocated to this family over the course of the project input, and happily the original social worker was available to be interviewed as to why she had referred them initially, even though she was no longer working with them. The family had been allocated to her, following a core assessment, while she was working in the children in need team, and she was pleased that they were considered for the project. She had strong and very critical feelings about the ‘perverse gate-keeping of services to people who are already on the register’<italic>.</italic> In fact this social worker was passionate about the task of ‘keeping families off the register and front-loading preventive work’<italic>.</italic> The family had had a long relationship (10 years) with the social services department and the social worker wanted: ‘someone who could come into the home and offer extra support in order to avoid ‘‘them being conferenced’’’.</p>
<p>She was hopeful about the ‘provision of a role model; and of extra support which would help her keep appointments for example … ’ The mother had split from her own family early on and so needed ‘warmth, non-judgementalism, and a positive role model … ’ The worker was sensitive to the anxiety of the family about ‘having a spy in the camp’ and had negotiated in some detail with the family worker as being ‘very good at matching’. She had discussed the referral at length with the family, which she ‘considered time well-invested’, spent considerable time with the volunteer, and visited the family with her several times. As progress was visible she was anticipating that the family would be removed from the Register and ‘believed that with the volunteer’s involvement this is a possibility’<italic>.</italic> She was very positive about the impact of the volunteer’s work on the family functioning: ‘I think that she has given day to day support and guidance when she visited once a week – she has been an emotional support for the family and I also asked her to help advise about going shopping for the special diet of one of the children … ’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1468017310392284"><title>Summary and conclusion</title>
<p>The evidence from this study reinforces a view of risk where volunteers who work directly with families are in a position to contribute to gathering and analysing risk information, and to support the process of risk assessment. The focus on work with risk has become data storage and communicating risk, with less attention to service user engagement or to risk management itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468017310392284">Hemming, Norman, &amp; White, 2008</xref>). The current use of assessment frameworks does not necessarily improve practice nor aid reasoning and decision-making, but perversely they can decrease reasoning by leading to a ‘tick-box’ mentality, and such frameworks are often ‘uncritically aligned with worker compliance to bureaucratic requirements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468017310392284">Crisp, Anderson, Orme, &amp; Lister, 2007</xref>, p. 1073). This has been referred to as the ‘electronic turn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468017310392284">Garrett, 2008</xref>) in social work resulting in a focus on monitoring and information exchange at the expense of understanding, problem-solving and client engagement. This view is endorsed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468017310392284">Shaw et al. (2009)</xref> who argue that the ‘complicated system of electronic documents called the Integrated Children’s System (ICS) and the audit system it supports has distorted social work attention from contact with families to data inputting, with an estimated 80% of social work time taken to complete forms and input data’.</p>
<p>Practitioners operate from a basis of situated rationality with a focus on the situated nature of risk decision-making in specific contexts; but normally act authentically according to their own value base. The evidence is consistent with a ‘shared ownership’ model of social work which involves volunteers and is based on an approach of evidence-gathering embodying family cohesion and external support protective factors characteristic of individual families. The approach is compatible with a mentorship and trans-disciplinary model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468017310392284">Lacey, 2001</xref>) where sharing or transferring information and skills across traditional disciplinary boundaries enables individual team-members to be primary workers supported by others working as consultants. The volunteer or learner moves forward through a process involving ‘self-managed learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468017310392284">GSCC, 2007</xref>) whose underlying principles include reflective practice, collaborative working, observational skills and integration of theory with practice within a specialist area of knowledge.</p>
<p>The ViCP project has been successful at recruiting and preparing volunteers to work with families with complex needs, who with the preparation they receive, are well able to work in the context of child protection, and are not daunted by the range of challenging circumstances in the families they visit and support. There was a high level of overall satisfaction with the volunteers on the part of the families, and the social workers. The volunteers were seen by social workers as delivering a personalized support service which had an impact on the day to day functioning of families. After an initial sense of apprehension, volunteers were regarded by families and social workers as making an important contribution to the well-being of the children and families. There were few examples of differences of opinion between family and volunteer over the intended key function of the volunteer. Mothers appreciated volunteers as advocates, for being good listeners and for the high level of support they offered. Social workers tended to judge success by the quality of relationship developed between the volunteer and the family; their provision of routine, consistency of support and ability to clarify boundaries.</p>
<p>However, the CSV project reflects many of the themes outlined at the outset, for example, a tension between the early allocation of support services on a <italic>preventive basis</italic> and the late allocation of services following registration when <italic>problems had become more acute.</italic> It shows how social workers for the most part both perceived themselves, and were seen by families, to have a role in which they are responsible for child protection and little else. There was also evidence of considerable workforce challenges involving both the turnover of staff, as well as the difficulty experienced by the project workers, in engaging social workers in making referrals to their volunteer projects.</p>
<p>A set of specific lessons for the design and delivery of future similar projects can be identified. The project coordinators were crucial to the viability and success of the scheme, at each stage of the process through from recruitment, training, matching families and volunteers, and mentoring and supporting them while they are in place. Being co-located in the children’s services departments was central to the project credibility and viability, and maximized the referrals from social workers. The role of managers and leadership was critical to the success of the scheme including giving information to their staff; monitoring referrals; and supporting their staff in appropriate decision-making. Most importantly, their explicit support for the scheme can signal to all the staff they manage, the importance of making extra support available to those families who need it. Issues relating to quality, recruitment and retention, and clarity of purpose fall within the remit of the need for improvements in professional leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468017310392284">DCSF, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A conclusion to be drawn is the interdependent relationship between the quality and ethos of local authority children’s services departments, and the activity of a voluntary sector agency such as ViCP, seeking to deliver family support services. Almost certainly, it is the ethos, morale and professionalism of the statutory social work services for children and families which constitute the biggest influence on the work of the ViCP pilots, and which have the potential to facilitate or constrain its potential contribution to the lives of families, and that local authority social work could make more efforts to reduce the increasing dominance of a very narrow model of child protection. In particular, more focus could be put on seeking to change the balance of social work activity in favour of a family support/prevention approach consistent with the government’s <italic>Think family</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468017310392284">Cabinet Office, 2008</xref>) initiative.</p>
<p>With expected future cuts in public services and more localization should come an advance of voluntarism with professionals becoming more risk-taking. There is a growing evidence base within public services delivered by combinations of paid and unpaid workers. An example concerns embedding an awareness of (unpaid) carers as genuine partners in care as volunteers frequently feel that their knowledge and expertise are not valued by services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468017310392284">Glasby, 2007</xref>). Within child protection a volunteer’s contribution is valuable as a form of ‘watchfulness’ and dealing with the kind of protective mechanisms that modify a family and child’s response to a risk situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468017310392284">Daniel &amp; Wassell, 2002</xref>). Risk is hence conceptualized as a product of social interaction, context specific and bounded by group norms and values; and in social work epitomized by volunteer-aided or similar work focusing on ‘building resilience’ in families and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468017310392284">Stepney &amp; Popple, 2008</xref>).</p>
