<abstract>
<p>Computational studies were performed at conceptual design level to investigate the structural implications of changing only the tip fin inclinations on a medium-range box wing aircraft. Tip fin inclination refers to the angle the tip fin makes to the vertical body axis of the aircraft. This study is mainly addressed to conceptual designers. For different tip fin inclinations, flight loads were generated using a vortex lattice tool. These flight loads were then input into finite element simulations allowing the preliminary structural elements to be sized. For the category of aircraft considered, no significant variations in wing structural design drivers as a function of tip fin inclination were observed.</p>

<p>The search for novel solutions to mitigate the negative impact of air travel on the environment has renewed interest in unconventional configurations. Configurations like the box-wing and joined-wing, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011426528">Figure 1</xref>, have been studied by Wolkovitch,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011426528">1</xref></sup> Kroo et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954410011426528">2</xref></sup> Nangia et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011426528">3</xref></sup> and Henderson and Huffman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011426528">4</xref></sup> They highlight the higher stiffness and lower induced drag of the configurations and hence their potential of improved fuel efficiency and reduced direct operating costs. Hajela,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011426528">5</xref></sup> by examining the sensitivity of joined-wing aircraft structural weight to wing sweep and dihedral, shows that a wing sweep of about 17° produces the lightest structure for tip- joined joined-wing aircraft.

</fig></p>
<p>Biplane configurations, from which the box wing isderived, were studied by Prandtl,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011426528">6</xref></sup> Munk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011426528">7</xref></sup> and recently Frediani.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011426528">8</xref></sup> They all highlight the superior aerodynamic efficiency of biplane designs over conventional configurations. As to airfoil section research, Addoms and Spaid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011426528">9</xref></sup> emphasizes the need to use airfoils that account for the induced flow curvature for biplane configurations. Studies by Linet al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954410011426528">10</xref></sup> show that a rigid joint is probably the best in reducing the wing root bending moment andtherefore the optimum joint fixity for a joined-wing aircraft. Concerning the overall relative wing positioning, Bagwell and Selberg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954410011426528">11</xref></sup> posit that a positively staggered wing arrangement is more efficient than the negative one; by positive stagger, they refer to the higher wing being in front of a lower aft wing and by negative stagger the reversed arrangement.</p>
<p>This study derives from a previous conceptual <?tjl?>box-wing design studied in Cranfield University and outlined in Smith and Jemitola.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011426528">12</xref></sup> The study highlighted the beneficial influence of a maximized vertical separation between the fore and aft wings. For a medium-range airliner, the said study had shown that the negatively staggered arrangement benefits from the presence of the tail fin as a natural way of maximizing wing vertical separation; the same is not achievable on the positively staggered arrangement without significant mass penalties and directional stability compensation issues. However, the structural effects of tip fin (TF) inclination on the design of a negatively staggered medium-range box wing airliner are unclear. Studies were therefore performedto evaluate the structural consequences of changing the TF inclinations in the wing assembly structure for an assumed flight loading condition. Changing the TF inclination, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011426528">Figure 2</xref>, requires either displacing the wings longitudinally relative to each other or stretching the fuselage and for this analysis, the former was implemented to change TF inclination.

<sec id="sec2-0954410011426528"><title>Aircraft description</title>
<p>The aircraft of study is taken from Smith and Jemitola.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954410011426528">12</xref></sup> It is a 4000-nautical mile range box wing airliner with a maximum take-off mass of 127,760 kg and wing span of 37.6 m. The fore and aft wing gross areas are 118.32 m<sup>2</sup> each, while the sweep angles are 40° and −25°, respectively. Overall, fuselage length is 46 m and maximum diameter 5.6 m. Due to the conceptual nature of the investigation, the torsion box was modelled as symmetric and, as a result, the elastic axis and geometric centres of the wing models are coincidental and it was along this axis that loads were applied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954410011426528"><title>Aerodynamic loads</title>
<p>The wing load distributions for both wings and the TF, including the contributions to torsion from the airfoil section properties and the moment arm between the lift application point and the elastic axis of the torsion box, were obtained from a vortex-lattice analysis tool called Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011426528">13</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011426528">Figure 3</xref> is a combined chart showing the load distributions for the fore and aft wings and TF obtained from AVL. The fuselage’s effect on the lift distribution was accounted for by implementing 40% of the root chord at the centre line of the model as given in Drela and Youngren<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011426528">13</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011426528">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>AVL is a program that utilizes vortex-lattice theory for aerodynamic and dynamic analyses of a given aircraft geometry. It uses a vortex-lattice model for the lifting surfaces, together with a slender body model for fuselages and by simulating the flow field, it predicts the pressure distribution around the simulated body. To create a model, AVL requires a text file that defines aircraft geometry. The aircraft is defined as a series of sections running parallel to the chord line. The text file also contains wing and tail surfaces defined in Cartesian coordinates. Sections are needed at root, tip, and each end of the wing section or control surface. AVL connects the leading and trailing edges of these sections to create a complete model.</p>
<p>Thus, five TF inclinations of 0°, 20°, 30°, 35°, and 40° were arbitrarily chosen and each model built in AVL. The load condition assumed was a 2.5 -g manoeuvre case limit load at sea level at design diving speed, <italic>V</italic><sub>D</sub> at maximum take-off weight. In a final design analysis, other loading conditions should also be examined, which include various possible combinations of control deflections and gust loadings. However, the conditions that were assumed in this preliminary study are considered adequate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954410011426528"><title>Longitudinal stability</title>
<p>This study is based on Prandtl’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011426528">6</xref></sup> best wing system, which he describes as a biplane where both wings are of equal span and are joined by TFs making it a closed system. He gives the condition for minimum-induced drag as when there is same lift distribution and same total lift on each of the horizontal wings and butterfly-shaped lift distribution on the TFs. The applicability of Prandtl’s best wing system to the box-wing configuration is greatly extended by Munk’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011426528">7</xref></sup> stagger theorem. It states that <italic>The total induced drag of a system of lifting surfaces is not changed when the elements are moved in the streamwise direction</italic> and this can be achieved by adjusting the surface incidences as streamwise position is varied. Thus, the neutral point of the box wing would be at the middle of the distance between the aerodynamic centres of the fore and aft wings.</p>
<p>The longitudinal stability of the model for the study was simulated in AVL by arbitrarily choosing a point in cruise and by optimizing both the rigging angles and the wing twist to achieve equal forces on both wings. The aft wing required a positive correcting angle to compensate for downwash, while the fore wing required a negative correcting angle to compensate for upwash. Both correcting angles were not of significant proportions, thanks to the fact that the net area of the aft wing is larger than the fore wing net area by about 20%. This is because the aft wing does not intersect the fuselage. Additionally, if specialized airfoils that account for the induced flow curvature as proposed by Addoms and Spaid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954410011426528">9</xref></sup> are used, the solution becomes even less dependent on the setting angles or surface incidences.</p>
<p>Prandtl’s best wing system suggests neutral stability for the box-wing configuration but Frediani’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011426528">8</xref></sup> work showed that a box wing can be <italic>stable in cruise flight, the margin of stability can be controlled and modified and at the same time the lift is equal on the front and rear wings</italic>. In the model concerned with this study, aerodynamic centres of the fore and aft wings were 17.99 and 31.34 m from the apex making the neutral point position to be at 24.67 m. In line with competing aircraft, a static margin of 1% was imposed to attain marginal intrinsic stability. This meant that the fore wing had to generate 1% more lift and the aft wing 1% less lift. This in turn caused a fractional deviation from Prandtl’s ideal configuration, according to which the best wing system is the one where both wings generate the same lift. Furthermore, as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011426528">Figure 3</xref>, there is second reason why the aircraft in this study differs from Prandtl’s ideal; the lift distributions on the fore and aft wings are similar but not identical. However, these two reasons together can account for a 0.6% increase in the overall-induced drag of the vehicle, which is close enough to the ideal not to defeat the purpose of the box-wing aircraft. The increase in induced drag is the penalty to pay for intrinsic longitudinal stability and with this static margin, a stability augmentation system is already necessary. Said penalty can be reduced or eliminated by relying entirely on a robust stability augmentation system; such a system is beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0954410011426528"><title>Description of finite element model</title>
<p>Due to the simplicity of the torque box and elastic axis beam-type models used for the stress/strain analysis, only general stress trends were analysed. These trends were determined as a function of the beam span as opposed to a plane stress or shear flow analysis, which would also estimate the stresses around the torque box. Furthermore, as a first approximation, only a linear analysis was conducted.</p>
<p>Strand7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011426528">14</xref></sup> was used for this box-wing finite element analysis (FEA). Basically, the Strand7 model consists of any number of structural elements connected by a common control point grid. Several different Strand7 elements could be used to model an aircraft wing. Only beam, plate, and brick elements were considered for the box-wing finite element model. The beam element was chosen for the box-wing model because of the enormous gain in simplicity over a plate or brick model. Beam is a generic name for a group of one-dimensional or line elements. These elements are all connected between two nodes at their ends and the single dimension is length. Other dimensions can be specified from a range of beam sections available thereby giving three-dimensional (3D) properties. In its most general form, the beam element can carry axial force, shear force, bending moment, and torque. The beam element can also be used to simulate a bar with a non-uniform cross-section by interpolating sections. Strand7 has the capability of applying distributed or concentrated loads to a beam element. It also can apply distributed or point torque or moment on beam elements.</p>
<p>Since the box-wing configuration analysed in this report is non-uniform (having taper, dihedral, and sweep angles), the beam element provides a more practical wing model as opposed to a brick or plate element. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011426528">Figure 5</xref> presents a beam version of the box-wing model. As the analysis targets conceptualists rather than structural analysts, the fuselage is omitted from the idealization but accounted for by the boundary conditions imposed on the model. Wing inertia relief was ignored because its presence or absence was not going to affect the trends observed. In addition, the analysis was conducted with all five TF inclination cases in iso-inertia conditions (equal to zero). Due to the symmetric nature of the torsion box model, the elastic axis and geometric centres of the wing models coincide and it was along this axis that the loads were applied. For this reason, forces and moments are transmitted through the wing-tip joints (a single grid point) by equating the respective translations and rotations of the joint receivers at the joint. The global coordinate system used for box-wing static analysis is defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011426528">Figure 5</xref>. The beam version of the box-wing configuration contains 119 elements.

<sec id="sec6-0954410011426528"><title>Wing cross-section properties</title>
<p>Studies by Wolkovitch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011426528">1</xref></sup> indicate that the optimum wing torsion box cross-sectional profile of the box-wing configuration is one which accounts for the tilted bending axis of the wings by having the <italic>bending-resistant material</italic> concentrated near the upper leading and lower trailing edges. Furthermore, the specific airfoil sections used in this study are not required due to the conceptual nature of the analysis although Wolkovitch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011426528">1</xref></sup> has highlighted the suitability of box wings for thin airfoils. Thus, the torsion box was assumed to occupy 50% of the chord taking advantage of the reduced volume occupied by simplified leading and trailing edge devices.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of simplicity, an idealized wing torsion box cross-sectional geometry, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011426528">Figure 6</xref>, was used in this study. Although this is not the optimum torsion box cross-section for a box wing, it was assumed to be adequate for this study. Furthermore, since the wing cross-sections are perpendicular to the box wing’s elastic axis, the root and tip of the swept wings create modelling problems. However, for slender swept wings and applied loads through the wing elastic axis, an effective wing root and tip may be assumed, simplifying the wing finite element model.
<fig id="fig6-0954410011426528" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Idealized torsion box cross-section geometry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011426528-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Strand7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011426528">14</xref></sup> beam elements require cross-<?tjl?>sectional properties as program inputs and automatically compute properties such as wing cross-<?tjl?>sectional area <italic>A</italic>, the second moments of area <italic>Iyy</italic> and <italic>Izz</italic>, and the polar second moment of area, <italic>J</italic>.

<sec id="sec7-0954410011426528"><title>Structural sizing and FEA procedure</title>
<p>Sizing was done by implementing the algorithms outlined in Howe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011426528">15</xref></sup> Stiffness criteria that ensure adequate wing aeroelastic performance were accomplished following Howe’s approach. The idealized wing structural box model used for the FEA makes the distributed flange construction method ideal for sizing the torsion box skin and web, <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011426528">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
<p>The torsional loads for the study were generated from AVL and included contributions to torsion coming from the airfoil section properties and from the moment arm between the lift application point and the elastic axis of the torsion box. The two contributions above were combined to generate an equivalent torque applied along the elastic (and geometrical) axis of the torsion box. By superposition principle, the said equivalent torque and the lift load (applied along the elastic axis as well) were considered together to achieve a representative FEA model of the physical system.</p>
<p>The structural sizing and FEA procedure for each TF inclination was that a 3D model of the port wing torsion box assembly was built in Strand7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954410011426528">14</xref></sup> with an initial set of values for <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>. The initial pooling set of values for <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> were obtained from historical data. As already mentioned, the loads obtained from AVL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954410011426528">13</xref></sup> were then applied in a distributed manner along the elastic axis of the fore wing, TF, and aft wing. Thereafter, a linear analysis was performed. A second finite element model wing of the same TF inclination was then built but with the results of the previous linear analysis implemented in <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>. Distributed loads from AVL were then applied and another linear analysis performed with results obtained. These results were then implemented in a third model of the same wing and the procedure repeated until there was virtually no change in the model’s <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub> values. This state established the converged solution for that TF inclination wing model. This procedure was performed for all the TF inclinations. The shear, torque, and bending moment outputs for all the converged solutions of the TF inclinations were obtained and compared.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011426528">Figure 7</xref> shows the torsional load trends in the fore and aft wings for each TF inclination. The applied torsional loads were taken at the elastic axis and moments about the elastic axis of one wing were also caused by the applied loads on the other wing transmitted through the wing joints. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011426528">Figure 7</xref> shows that the torsional moment in the fore wing reduces and becomes increasingly negative as the TF inclination increases. The same is true for the torsional distribution within the TF although the changes are marginal. The figure shows that at the fore wing root there is a 90% decrease in torsional loads from the vertical TF to the 40% inclined TF. In the aft wing, the pattern is opposite what obtains inthe fore wing. Here, the change from the vertical to the 40° inclined TF is an increase of 28% at the wing root.
<fig id="fig7-0954410011426528" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Torsional force distribution.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011426528-fig7.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The overall torsional distribution is affected by the behaviour of the wing tips which twist upwards and away from each other under load as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011426528">Figure8</xref>; the fore wing tip twists nose down and the aftwing tip nose up. Thus, the fore wing is subjected to additional torsional strain apart from that due to airfoil pitching moment, while at the aft wing there isan alleviating effect on the wing’s airfoil pitching moment. These, in addition to sweep angle mismatch, account for the significant differences in torsional force distribution of the fore and aft wings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011426528">Figure 7</xref>. The torsional forces put an extra strain on the TF in the form of in-plane shear forces, which is not a very visible effect because what drives the sizing is out-of-plane stresses. However, it would be expected that these torsional forces would affect the design of the TF/wing joints.
<fig id="fig8-0954410011426528" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Wing-tip displacement under load.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011426528-fig8.tif"/>

<p>The dragwise shear force is not usually a factor in sizing load-bearing members in conventional wings. However, it is instructive to note the trend in a box-wing aircraft as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011426528">Figure 9</xref>. In the fore wing, the wing root shear force shows an increase with TF inclination with the 40° inclined TF being 17% greater than that of the vertical TF. In the TF itself, the trend is reversed with the 40° inclined TF being 30% less than that of the vertical. The trend in the aft wing shows a more amplified distribution of shear force as a function of TF inclination. The overall trend in the aft wing is reversed with respect to the fore wing. The aft wing root shear force in the case of 40° inclined TF is 81% smaller than the same force in the case of the vertical TF.

</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011426528">Figure 10</xref> shows the dragwise bending moment distribution. At the fore wing, the wing root dragwise bending moment shows an increase in magnitude of 29% from the vertical TF to the 40° inclined TF. At the TF itself, the changes are marginal, while at the aft wing the trend is more dispersed than in the fore wing. Here, the wing root dragwise bending moment of the 40° inclined TF is just 7% of the value of the vertical TF.

</fig></p>
<p>The out-of-plane bending moment distributions are essentially the same in the fore wing, TF, and aft wing for all TF inclinations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011426528">Figure 11</xref>. The same can be said of the out-of-plane shear force distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011426528">Figure 12</xref>. This little difference between the TF inclination models is also given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011426528">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954410011426528">3</xref>. Here, the fore and aft wing root values of the five TF inclinations were normalized with respect to the respective vertical TF value and the results show little differences.

<p>Howe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954410011426528">15</xref></sup> states that out-of-plane bending moment and shear force are critical to estimate the mass of aircraft wings as they determine the effective end load material for spar web and distributed flanges, respectively, of the primary wing structural box. Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954410011426528">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954410011426528">12</xref> show that there is little difference in these critical sizing parameters for all the TF inclinations. Therefore, it is not surprising that there are only minor differences in the torsion box masses of the various TFs.</p>
<p>An examination of this absence of any significant difference due to TF inclination begins by considering the stresses in the TFs. Several factors contribute to this behaviour but five main contributors are identified as bending moments, shear forces (<italic>YX</italic> and <italic>XY</italic>), axial loads, and torsion (due to airfoil pitching moment and sweep angle mismatch).</p>
<p>The out-of-plane bending moment does not change with change in TF angle because it acts along the global <italic>Z</italic> direction. Similarly, the out-of-plane shear force also acts along the global <italic>Z</italic> direction and so does not necessarily change in TF angle. Torsion changes with TF angle as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011426528">Figure 7</xref> but it is not critical to the sizing of any component of the torsion box. Furthermore, the shear force in the <italic>XY</italic> plane changes with TF inclination as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011426528">Figure 9</xref> but again it is not critical in sizing the torsion box.</p>
<p>Of the five main contributors to the stresses in the TF, three remain essentially the same with change in TF inclination. The only two which change, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011426528">Figures 7</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011426528">9</xref>, do not show this because the stiffness of the section is high enough along the moment of inertia not to provoke an appreciable difference in the deformation of the TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954410011426528">Figure 14</xref>). However, these torsion and dragwise shear force distributions would have significant influences on the wing/TF joint design and suggests heavy joints, an area not covered in this article.

<p>TF inclination significantly affects the torsional force, dragwise shear force, and dragwise bending moment distributions in the wings of a box-wing aircraft. However, for out-of-plane bending moment and shear force distributions, there are only minor variations as a function of TF inclination. The same can be said for the TF torsion box masses, the overall wing torsion box masses, and wing-tip deflections. The changes in torsional force, dragwise shear force, and dragwise bending moment with TF inclination do not affect the structural design of the TF as they are not design-driving parameters. Furthermore, the minor variation in the out-of-plane bending moment, shear force distributions, and torsion box masses suggests that TF inclination has a reduced effect on the structural design of a box-wing aircraft. This deduction is valid from a structural viewpoint but it is the author’s opinion that TF inclination can have non-negligible effects on the dynamic modes, flutter speed, and frequency. Thus, it is recommended thatflutter and divergence analysis of the box-wing configuration be performed for a more complete aeroelastic investigation into the effects of TF inclination. It is also recommended that a separate investigation on the effects of different TF inclinations be performed from a purely aerodynamic perspective. Studies using torsion box cross-sections that account for the tilted bending axis of the wing configuration are further recommended.</p>
