<p><italic>White Kids</italic> is a sophisticated and multilayered analysis of the central role of language in the process of shaping the identities and ideologies (p. 249) of European American students in a California high school that was 10% Asian, 11% Hispanic, 38% Black, and 40% White. In the book, Mary Bucholtz examines how White teenagers “position themselves both stylistically and racially within interaction” (p. 3). Bucholtz conducted the original study in the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12463007">Bucholtz, 1997</xref>), using a variety of methods, including ethnography, interactional analysis, and sociocultural linguistics (pp. 37-38). The 2011 book does a fine job of promoting dialogue about the intersection of language, identity, race, Whiteness, style, and youth culture.</p>
<p>Bucholtz grounds <italic>White Kids</italic> in her fieldwork and, especially, in audiotaped interviews with 26 White students. The analysis divides these students into three primary groups: (a) preppies, (b) hip-hop fans, and (c) nerds. Bucholtz argues that focusing on Whiteness as a particular social phenomenon enables the researcher to “unpack the varied ways in which language works as an integrated whole for creating social identities” (p. 237). To better understand her sociolinguistic approach to Whiteness in <italic>White Kids</italic>, it may be instructive to compare the more fully developed scholarly tradition on gendered identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12463007">Wood, 2011</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12463007">Bucholtz, Liang, and Sutton (1999)</xref> brought together feminist scholars to discuss the role of discourse in constructing gendered identities. Some of the issues and processes that they explored included “narrative construction,” “silence,” and “collaborative opposition.” In <italic>White Kids</italic>, Bucholtz walks a parallel path, this time with a focus on race talk instead of gender and communication, by taking a closer look at “indexicality,” “labels,” “slang,” “coolness,” “quotative markers,” “superstandard English,” and “narratives of interracial violence.” These two traditions of sociolinguistic research, taken together, help provide a more complete understanding of the construction of social identities. But now let us return to Bucholtz’s current project.</p>
<p>The book contains 11 chapters and runs to 249 pages of text. Bucholtz states that the 8 “analytic” chapters focus on two aspects of identity construction through language: (a) the semiotic practices of the three groups and (b) the discursive and referential practices in which the White students engaged when talking about race and Whiteness (p. 18). Chapter 1 serves as an introduction and provides an overview of the book. Chapter 2 presents the local context of the study and also discusses the issues faced by the researcher doing fieldwork in a public school. Social categories and style are the main topics in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. Chapter 5 analyzes the linguistic resources of the preppy students. White, male fans of hip-hop are the subject of Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 is devoted to the nerds (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12463007">Bucholtz, 2001</xref>). Chapters 8 to 10 move beyond the three groups of students to examine race and language issues more generally, including an analysis of friendships across racial lines, fears and resentments of racial others, and how White students self-classified in response to an interview question about “ethnicity.” Chapter 11, the conclusion, is only 13 pages but is well worth reading because of the author’s reflections on broader issues. The front matter equips the reader with transcription conventions and phonetic symbols. The notes in <italic>White Kids</italic> (pp. 250-254) are brief but illuminating. The references are thorough and provide a sampling of the relevant literature from several disciplines. Both persons and topics are included in the serviceable index.</p>
<p>For me, Bucholtz is at her best when she is explaining how interaction helps construct identities. For example, according to Bucholtz, White nerds make stylistic or emblematic use of African American language resources but run the risk of being dismissed as inauthentic “wannabees.” Chapter 9 provides more examples of how adroit Bucholtz is in analyzing and explaining the symbolic dynamics of language and identity. In that chapter, she does an excellent job of exploring the narratives of racial fear and reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>The author’s honesty about her biases and about decisions she made in the course of her fieldwork is another appealing aspect of this book. On one level, Bucholtz acknowledges that her study is quite limited and is designed to help the reader to understand one slice of life at one moment in time (p. 40). On another level, Bucholtz appears to be an idealist, who is reaching for broad social goals, such as “progressive racial agency” (p. 247).</p>
<p><italic>White Kids</italic> is sophisticated in several ways. The linguistic analysis is first-rate. The examples of interview transcripts (see, e.g., pp. 58-65 and pp. 104-115) are detailed. (For someone not versed in linguistics or conversation analysis, they are almost too complex.) The seamless weaving and expert wielding of several research methodologies is praiseworthy, as is the way that Bucholtz incorporates relevant literature into the text. In the debate about whether identity is a fixed entity as opposed to a changing, social construction, Bucholtz comes down squarely on the side of interaction. Nevertheless, I wish that Bucholtz had addressed the issue of “personality” in the psychology literature (e.g., the Big Five personality factors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12463007">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1987</xref>). An analysis of “traits” might complement the sociolinguistic analysis, because it is possible that one group of teenagers might be more influenced by, say, openness to experience (curiosity, adventure) than another group of teenagers. On the other hand, I found especially useful the references to older studies on youth culture by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12463007">Eckert (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12463007">Hewitt (1986)</xref>.</p>
<p>The transcripts provide wonderful examples of <italic>interaction</italic>, albeit a special type of speech event that Bucholtz classifies as a <italic>research interview</italic> (p. 38). From my perspective, the interaction during the interviews might be categorized as a form of <italic>metacommunication</italic> about identities, that is, communication about identity communication. The interaction in a research interview is one level removed from the daily interaction among teenagers. Therefore, a full account of youth culture and the construction of identities might require even more sophisticated linguistic and interactional analyses, not to mention peer participant observation and the use of well-situated informants. Considering that identities are ever-changing, scholars may also wish to do longitudinal studies in this area.</p>
<p>Another suggestion that I offer for future work in this area is to consider the role of media in providing language and nonverbal resources for the construction of youth identities. For example, scholars might try to understand the impact of a show, such as <italic>Gossip Girls</italic>, on the construction of the identities of female teenagers. Bucholtz opens the door to this topic when she explores the discursive formations of “mean girls” (pp. 98-101).</p>
<p>As a scholar in Communication Studies, I am happy that Bucholtz included a reference to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12463007">Ronald Jackson II (1999)</xref> on cultural identities. I applaud her invitation to study identity from multiple perspectives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12463007">Bucholtz &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>) and would like to mention the relevance of Dramatism, with its emphasis on roles and performance, to the study of interaction and identity construction. This tradition runs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12463007">Goffman (1959)</xref> to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12463007">Burke (1966)</xref> to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12463007">Conquergood (1992)</xref>. Then, too, I point to nonoral traditions in rhetoric, the subject of a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12463007">Marshall and Ryden (2011)</xref>, who approach Whiteness from the standpoint of reading and writing.</p>
<p>The book ends with a brief reference to the 2008 election of President Barack Obama. Bucholtz is aware of the changing discourse of race (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12463007">Lacy &amp; Ono, 2011</xref>). She argues, however, that a Black–White polarity remains strong in the midst of the now more robust discourse of “mixed race” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12463007">DaCosta, 2007</xref>). While this topic carries us beyond the scope of the current book review, readers of the <italic>Journal of Language and Social Psychology</italic> might find relevant and intriguing (as I did) the photos and the self-identifications in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12463007">Kip Fulbeck’s (2006)</xref> book, <italic>Part Asian, 100% Hapa</italic>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>White Kids</italic> is an important contribution to our understanding of language, style, Whiteness, and the construction of social identities. The book goes beyond traditional sociolinguistics, both in the effective implementation of several research methodologies and as in the blending of diverse theoretical and critical perspectives. While some of the analysis is a bit complex, <italic>White Kids</italic> is accessible to a broader audience. Bucholtz will have succeeded if the publication of <italic>White Kids</italic> promotes the broader conversations that she invites.</p>
