<abstract>
<p>Issues of insecurity and unruliness on the Kham frontier forced the government of Republican China to adopt a policy of integration. They also provided the impetus behind the work of Republican intellectuals to re-imagine a new geo-space in which frontier peoples were inscribed as co-nationals. As represented by Ren Naiqiang, these intellectuals set out to introduce the Kham periphery to policy makers and Chinese citizens such that the contested Kham region appeared an inalienable part of Chinese national space. To legitimate the civilizing projects sponsored by the state, Ren’s narrative strategies gave new meaning to the Kham periphery. By representing the culture and traditions of Kham as a historical remnant of China’s past, it was no longer an alien “other.” By employing the “rhetoric of privation,” together with elements of the “rhetoric of primitivism,” Ren presented the Khampas as stuck at a lower state of development, deprived materially, culturally, and morally.</p>

<body>
<p>Hovering just across the western border of present-day Sichuan province, the region known by Tibetans as Kham spreads across the eastern edge of the Tibetan plateau. Many of the major rivers of Asia flow from sources in this region. Kham constitutes a unique geographical landmass separating the arid regions of central Tibet and the lowlands of China. In its northwestern parts, it contains highland pastures; in its southern regions the Himalayan range enervates into the lowlands of Asia. Rumored to be the inspiration for the fabled Shangri La in James Hilton’s <italic>Lost Horizon</italic>, today the Kham region straddles the eastern part of modern-day Tibet along with areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces in China.</p>
<p>In 1837, Gönpo Namgyel, a minor chieftain of Nyarong in central Kham, began to expand his domain by annexing large areas of neighboring territories. His ambitions disturbed the balance of power in the region. In a region historically ruled by various local strongmen, the exploits of Gönpo Namgyel nearly succeeded in bringing the entire region under the rule of a single chieftain (Tib., <italic>dpon</italic>) for the first time. With Gönpo Namgyel’s increasing success, Qing authorities realized that Kham could not be dismissed simply as a transit space between Qing China and central Tibet. Although Qing authorities felt compelled to launch a large-scale military expedition in 1849 to curb Gönpo Namgyel’s ascendancy in the region, they were not able to defeat him. Consequently, in the mid-nineteenth century Gönpo Namgyel quickly rose to become the paramount regional power-holder. His strength was sufficient to contest the authority of both the Qing and the Dalai Lama’s government in Lhasa. In 1862, he gained control over Sino-Tibetan trade and communication routes, disrupted the Qing official postal services, and stopped the transportation of provisions and funds supporting the Chinese troops stationed in central Tibet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0097700412464127">1</xref></sup> The Qing’s weakness provided an opportunity for the Lhasa government to assert its authority over the Kham region. To complicate matters, local chieftains also appealed to the Lhasa government to halt Gönpo Namgyel’s advance. In early 1863, the Lhasa government dispatched troops to suppress Gönpo Namgyel and his rule. This resulted in 1865 in his total defeat.</p>
<p>Gönpo Namgyel’s defeat paved the way for the Lhasa authorities to extend their administrative rule in Nyarong by establishing the Office of the Tibetan High Commissioner (Tib., Nyag rong spyi phyab) to govern the region and to assert their influence in other parts of Kham. Using Nyarong as a stronghold, the office extended its sphere of influence into the northern parts of Kham, turning the region into a zone of contestation between Qing China and the Lhasa government. This led some Qing frontier officials to advocate a policy of repossessing Nyarong as a means of strengthening Qing control over Kham. The dispute over Nyarong was closely related to late Qing policy toward not just central Tibet, but the borderlands in Sichuan, including Kham, as well. Lu Chuanlin, the governor-general of Sichuan province, urged the Qing court to repossess Nyarong and to administer the region with Chinese officials. He also suggested a new administrative system aimed at replacing the indigenous leaders with Han officials as yet another way to bring the region under direct Chinese rule. Lu Chuanlin’s proposal was not accepted by the Qing court. Because of the Dalai Lama’s direct appeal to the emperor to place Nyarong under Lhasa’s jurisdiction, the Qing government feared that repossession would strain its relationship with the Dalai Lama and provoke the people of Kham. Rather than press its authority over the region, the Qing recalled both its officials and its army from Nyarong, and returned administrative power to central Tibet.</p>
<p>In this short article, I cannot explore in detail the complex situation that arose in the Kham region in the late Qing period. Rather, my object is to describe the factors that allowed a region historically regarded as merely a transit zone between China proper and the larger prize of central Tibet to assume such prominence. Late Qing concerns about the region were prompted not only by local difficulties; they also sprang from larger issues involving the penetration of Western powers into its frontiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0097700412464127">Ho, 2008</xref>: 210-46). The logic was that if the Qing could not maintain control over Kham, then central Tibet was certainly beyond its reach. Therefore, we will see that for both Qing and Republican era authorities, exerting control over Kham became a critical feature of China’s nationalist imagination.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the rivalry between the British and Russian empires over influence in Central Asia fed the fears of Chinese nationalists of foreign encroachments on China’s frontiers. Problems in Tibetan frontier areas were exacerbated when the British invaded Tibet in 1904, forcing the thirteenth Dalai Lama to flee to Mongolia. The invasion made the Chinese acutely aware of the threat the British posed to the southwestern border of China, and reinforced their anxieties regarding the insecurity of China’s position in both central Tibet and Kham. In response to this heightened sense of a border crisis, the Qing initiated a forward policy in both regions, attempting to restore its weakening position and secure both regions from foreign encroachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700412464127">Wang Xiuyu, 2006</xref>: 351).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0097700412464127">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1906, Zhang Yintang, the assistant <italic>amban</italic>, began to execute the Qing’s new forward policy in central Tibet by vigorously overhauling the local administration. In so doing, he exposed corrupt practices in the administrative system that had been imposed by Chinese residents in central Tibet. In early 1907, he also began to implement the Qing’s “New Policies” (<italic>xinzheng</italic>) in central Tibet by proposing a series of reform measures, including establishing nine new bureaus to develop agriculture, mining, education, finance, and the police force, and replacing traditional Tibetan ideology and customs with Confucian ideals. Zhang’s “New Policies” were meant to spread modern thinking and customs as well as raise moral expectations in central Tibet. Before his work was complete, Zhang was transferred as a result of rivalries with other Qing officials, including the amban, Lian Yu, in central Tibet. In any event, the “New Policies” he had initiated were not fully implemented even during his tenure owing to strong opposition from Tibetan monastic and lay officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0097700412464127">Wu, 1948</xref>: 22). Later, amban Lian Yu continued policies to transform the government in Tibet and to sinicize the elite. He planned to train a large army and secularize the Tibetan government by creating lay government boards. Roads and telegraph lines were planned, and resource exploitation was considered. In addition, on October 7, 1907, the <italic>Colloquial Tibetan Newspaper</italic> started to circulate, and the Bureau of Education was established to promote new learning. And starting in 1908, Lian Yu also vigorously recruited troops for and drilled the New Army in Tibet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0097700412464127">Wu, 1979</xref>: 1.19, 36; 2.75, 103, 111–12; 3.158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0097700412464127">Lamb, 1966</xref>: 169–71). Though Lian was able to put into effect some of his reform measures, his effort was cut short by the revolution in 1911 and the subsequent collapse of the Qing empire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Qing turned its attention to Kham. Qing authorities regarded Kham as an important strategic point and a “natural barrier” for the defense of China’s southwest frontier. It was becoming increasingly clear to the Qing that it could not assert effective control over Lhasa without first securing Kham. For these reasons, the Qing attached great importance to bringing Kham under its control. Consequently, in 1904 the newly appointed amban, Feng Quan, initiated land reclamation programs and measures to reduce the number of monks in major monasteries in Batang, a major trade center in south Kham, where he decided to stay on his way to assume office in central Tibet. The main monastery in Batang, known as Ba Chödeling (Ch., Dingning si; Dinglin si; Dingling si), was a Geluk monastery with strong ties to Lhasa. Feng Quan intended not only to take control of the resources in south Kham but also to reduce the influence of the monasteries, especially those backed by Lhasa. This led to a local uprising led by monks in Batang in which Feng was killed. This in turn caused the Qing to launch punitive campaigns under the command of Zhao Erfeng against the Kham indigenous elites, and eventually ushered in a period of incorporation and intense reform under Zhao. Zhao’s reforms in Kham had three specific aims. First, by subjecting Kham to a policy of administrative reform (<italic>gaitu guiliu</italic>), Zhao aimed at replacing indigenous leaders with officials directly appointed by the Qing government. Second, he sought to restrict the authority of local kings, headmen, and monasteries to collect revenue. Third, he promoted education. The educational reforms were problematic. While these reforms were instituted as a way to change the “barbarian customs” of the local people, reformation of the customs and habits of Tibetans in Kham was also understood as a means to integrate the region culturally into China.</p>
<p>The revolution in 1911, however, completely forced the Chinese out of central Tibet and, with their exodus, they lost their short-lived direct control in Kham. Following the revolution, the thirteenth Dalai Lama was also able to return to central Tibet from his exile in British India. Taking advantage of the chaotic situation in China proper, the Tibetans under the Dalai Lama demanded the withdrawal of all Chinese soldiers and officials from Tibet. Chinese troops were finally removed from Tibet, via India, at the end of 1912. Meanwhile, Zhao Erfeng was forced to cease his policies in Kham, and the indigenous leaders and monasteries in Kham, earlier stripped of their power and authority, quickly regained their former status. In 1912, the thirteenth Dalai Lama called for the removal of all Chinese from all Tibetan regions. He dispatched a monk official to publicize his proclamation, which called on the people to “defend Buddhism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700412464127">Shakabpa, 1976</xref>: 195–96). The local leaders and people in the various Kham polities filled the vacuum left as the weakened Chinese withdrew and began to organize revolts simultaneously across the region. As 1912 drew to a close, the revolts spread to the edge of the Sichuan border, with the result that nearly all indigenous leaders in the Tibetan polities in Kham were able to restore their power and regain control of their regions.</p>
<p>This was the situation in the Tibetan frontier region on the eve of the founding of Republican China. Meanwhile, central Tibet under the control of the Dalai Lama declared itself independent (Tib., <italic>rang btsan</italic>) and began to reassert its authority in Kham, claiming sovereignty over the entire Kham region. The ambitious claims of the Lhasa government had to be matched and countered. For many Republican intellectuals and officials, countering the Lhasa government was not a question of military force alone. In the minds of these Chinese nationalists, Kham needed to be incorporated into China’s national imagination and understood as a core territory of the new China. The integration of Kham became an integral part of the Chinese nationalists’ national imagination. Prasenjit Duara’s theoretical understanding is helpful here. Duara noted that old imperial regimes dispensed with the old binary of “primitive” and “civilized” in favor of “a commonality of co-nationals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412464127">Duara, 2004</xref>: 180). Similarly, the Republic era discourse on Kham projected an image of a commonality of co-nationals that was stressed through common ancestry and historical linkage. Ren Naiqiang asserted that many of the customary practices in Kham could be traced to ancient Chinese practices, allowing him to view the Khampas as co-nationals.</p>

<title>Publications on Kham and Re-imagining China’s Geo-body</title>
<p>The development of knowledge about frontier regions by foreign powers—Japan, Russia, and Western countries—prompted the Chinese at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century to increase their investment in the scholarly study of these regions and develop the discipline of ethnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412464127">Duara, 2004</xref>: 188–92). There was a similar pattern in the Tibetan areas. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the information on Tibet that was either produced by or accessible to the Chinese was remarkably scarce. By contrast, scholarly knowledge about Tibet produced by European and Indian scholars in the same period surpassed the sum total of works produced in the first two centuries of Qing influence in Tibet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0097700412464127">Tuttle, 2005</xref>: 29–30). This discrepancy highlighted the deficiency of knowledge about Tibet in China. As a result, from the late Qing and particularly during the Republican period, there was a rush to study and produce research works on Tibet.</p>
<p>Between 1874 and 1911, over 700 articles were produced about Tibet, but only about 250 of these—including various writings, translations, and reports published in periodicals—deal with their subjects in a serious manner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0097700412464127">3</xref></sup> The majority of these articles are news reports as well as short memorials and discussions by officials. During this period, there was a new effort to translate works by Western authors. Western works were understood as evidence of imperialists’ designs on Tibet and an overwhelming number of the translated articles deal with British and Russian machinations on China’s frontiers. Although new Chinese intellectuals viewed Western works as evidence of Western penetration, they also began to draw on works by foreign scholars as a model for scientific practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700412464127">Wang Yao et al., 2003</xref>: 230). Similarly, between 1912 and 1937, a great number of foreign works, particularly works on Tibet published by colonial officers and travel accounts, were translated into Chinese. As mentioned previously, these works not only provided a rich source of information about Tibet but also often served as models for later writings by Republican officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700412464127">Wang Yao et al., 2003</xref>: 148).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0097700412464127">4</xref></sup> Charles Bell, a British colonial officer who had established a close friendship with the thirteenth Dalai Lama, came to be viewed as an authority on Tibet, and his books were translated into Chinese. In particular, a paper Bell first published in the prestigious journal <italic>Foreign Affairs</italic> with the title “Tibet’s Position in Asia Today<italic>”</italic> attracted a great deal of attention and was translated into Chinese by three different translators. Similarly, works by Tazaknath Das (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0097700412464127">Das, 1928</xref>), Francis Younghusband (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700412464127">Younghusband, 1910</xref>), and David Macdonald (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700412464127">Macdonald, 1929</xref>) were also translated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0097700412464127">5</xref></sup> Travel accounts and adventures by foreigners also accounted for a great number of the translated works. This inventory of translations evidences the degree to which the Chinese lagged behind in the acquisition of knowledge of the region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0097700412464127">6</xref></sup> In particular, Eric Teichman, a British official who took an active role in the Sino-Tibetan borderland in the early twentieth century, received particular notice. His book <italic>Travels of a Consular Officer in Eastern Tibet</italic> was translated into Chinese by two translators and published as a series in two Chinese journals. For decades this book remained one of the most influential accounts of Kham, and is still referred to by scholars today.</p>
<p>In response to their lack of knowledge and sense that they were lagging behind the Japanese and Western imperialists, Republican scholars-cum-administrators saw their task as enriching knowledge of the region as part of the nationalist project to integrate the frontier. Huang Ju’an, the author of an article discussing the British invasion of Tibet, wrote,
<disp-quote>
<p>We still have to read books written by the British if we want to learn about the Tibet issue. Indeed, isn’t this no different from those who must read books written by the Japanese in order to study Manchu and Mongolian issues? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0097700412464127">Huang, 1934</xref>: 19–27)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similar observations were made by Li Yiren, who was dispatched to investigate the society and economy of Kham in 1937 and was transferred to oversee the construction of Xikang in 1938.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0097700412464127">7</xref></sup> Li also acknowledged the lack of knowledge in his preface to <italic>Xikang zonglan</italic> (A General Account of Xikang): “If one would like to learn about the most recent situation in Kham, one will not find any published book that has the most up-to-date and complete information about Xikang. This is most regrettable.” Li stated the purpose of his book was to promote the “Chinese people’s attachment to the importance of the development of the borderlands as means to boost their power to fight the Japanese and to build a strong China” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0097700412464127">Li, 1941</xref>: “the Author’s Preface,” 1, “Introductory Remarks,” 1–2). Another example is provided by the author Hu Jilu, who made an emotive appeal in his own book. On page four of the preface we find a copy of the original handwriting of Yue Fei, the famous Southern Song patriot renowned for his determination to recover north China from the Jurchen Jin invaders. The inscription reads <italic>Huan wo heshan</italic> (literally “Give us back our rivers and mountains”). Hu’s narrative is imbued with the desire to recover the territories lost to Tibet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0097700412464127">Hu, 1928</xref>: “Preface,” 4). In a similar vein, Chen Zhiming, in his work tracing the evolution of the territory and history of Kham, also cites the historical and geographical records of the successive Chinese dynasties with the aim of proving that Kham had been part of China since time immemorial. In particular, by demonstrating that the history, geography, territories, and customs of Kham are different from those of Tibet, he emphasizes that Kham and Tibet are two distinctive regions, and one should not be confused with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0097700412464127">Chen, 1933</xref>: 1, 116–18). In sum, there were so many publications that advocated recovery of lost territory with an emphasis on distinguishing Kham from central Tibet that this feature became one of the hallmarks of publications about Kham during the Republican period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0097700412464127">Teng Jiao, 1936</xref>: 13–18).</p>
<p>The growing interest in frontier research and publication as a means of expanding and acquiring knowledge about the periphery in the Republican period is reflected in the preface to the translation of the Japanese work entitled <italic>A Comprehensive View of Tibet</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0097700412464127">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>To administer and manage Tibet, one should start with a detailed examination of the annals of Tibet. If one intends to promote its advantages, one must understand its disadvantages first. And, if one plans to reform its customs, one must obtain a full understanding of its conditions first. . . . After we know Tibet like the palm of our hand, only then can we find and carry out a strategy to control it permanently. (Cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700412464127">Wang Yao et al., 2003</xref>: 149)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This statement exemplifies the impetus behind acquiring knowledge about the frontiers, i.e., to better control them so as to safeguard them from foreign invasion.</p>
<p>At the national level, writings on frontier peoples proliferated. Moreover, institutional structures were established to facilitate further studies with the founding of journals, including <italic>Xin Yaxiya</italic> (New Asia), <italic>Bianzheng gonglun</italic> (Frontier Affairs), <italic>Bianshi yanjiu</italic> (Frontier Affairs Studies), <italic>Yu Gong</italic> (Tribute to Yu), and the more popularly oriented <italic>Bianjiang tongxun</italic> (Borderland Newsletter) and <italic>Zhibian yuekan</italic> (Frontier Settlement Monthly). This impulse was also reflected at the local level. In 1938, <italic>Kang dao yuekan</italic> (Kham Review Monthly) was founded by the Alumni Association of the Training Institute of Xikang County Administration Personnel in Kangding (Dartsedo). In addition, in Sichuan and Xikang several other journals mainly devoted to the study of Kham, such as <italic>Xin Xikang</italic> (New Xikang), <italic>Kang Zang qianfeng</italic> (The Vanguard of Kham and Tibet), <italic>Kang Zang yanjiu yuekan</italic> (Kham-Tibet Research Monthly), and <italic>Chuanbian jikan</italic> (Sichuan Borderland Quarterly), were also established. Between 1912 and 1948, over 83 books on Kham were published, and about a thousand articles on Kham appeared in various journals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0097700412464127">9</xref></sup> A considerable number of these books and articles were published by the various government institutions of Xikang province. While the books and articles shared similar nationalistic motivations, the authors’ background and training were often very different. A high percentage of the authors were administrators, who perceived the purpose of their articles or books as reports to the government or for the recording of very basic information about the counties or townships they were administrating. Very often, these publications provided a vehicle to advertise the importance of particular regions to distant and ignorant government officials as well as to bring particular regions to the attention of ordinary citizens in inland China.</p>
<p>The authors often lamented the failure of past governments to take proper notice of particular regions and detailed reasons why they deserved more attention. While some understood their work as means of inscribing Kham into the geo-body of China, the rich details they mustered for their argument also enriched the growing science of ethnology in China. Among the authors who went to do fieldwork in Kham, several were prominent scholars recognized for their training and academic background.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0097700412464127">10</xref></sup> In terms of their publications on Kham, two French-trained sociologists are of particular note: Ke Xiangfeng, professor and chair of the department of sociology at Jinling University, and Xu Yitang, professor of sociology also at Jinling University. As members of the Xikang Investigation Team sponsored by the Xikang authorities, these two began the pioneering ethnological study of the Kham region in 1938–1939. Both used the format of travel accounts to publish their findings, which explained what they saw and heard as well as the issues they encountered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0097700412464127">Xu, 1941</xref>: 179–98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0097700412464127">Ke, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0097700412464127">Ke, 1939</xref>). Later, in 1944, Ke also published a book on Kham society, focusing on family life, economic life, religious life, education, ethics, and arts. Compared with some contemporary works on Kham, Ke’s work is not imbued with overly political overtones aimed at proving Kham to be an inalienable part of China. Instead, Ke analyzed the impact of the environment and material conditions on the nature of Kham society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0097700412464127">Ke, 1940</xref>). In fact, by the 1930s Kham had become a site for fieldwork, and the term “fieldwork” (<italic>shidi kaocha</italic>) came to be used to describe investigations by Ke and Xu. The idea of fieldwork had several connotations. Primarily, it was understood as describing a scientific and modern method of gathering information, but it was also one that lent an aura of authenticity.</p>
<p>Publications about Kham during the Republican period thus fall into two categories. One set of authors understood their work as government reports intended to inform not only officials but also the interested public. The intent of these authors was to influence perceptions of the region. They believed that by reading about the territory the public would constitute Kham as a region within their re-imagination of China’s geo-body. In fact these authors repeatedly appealed to readers to think of the frontier not as an alien territory but rather as an integral part of a newly imagined geo-space. The second set of authors produced publications that demonstrate the emergence of the science of ethnology. These authors understood their efforts as part of the institutionalization of “modern” scientific research in China. However, despite the differences of approach, the ideological framing of both sets of publications was the same. The writing inscribed Kham as an undeveloped region rich in resources and described its indigenous population as “primitive.”</p>

<title>The Republican Discourse on Kham: Ren Naiqiang’s Works</title>
<p>One of the most influential figures to emerge during the Republican era was Ren Naiqiang, today regarded as the founding father of Kham studies in China and still very much revered by Chinese scholars as the authority on all things Kham. Ren Naiqiang (1894–1989), who had the courtesy name Xiaozhuang, was born into a peasant family in Nanchong county, Sichuan province, and graduated from the Beijing Advanced College of Agriculture (Beijing gaodeng nongye xuetang) in 1920. Ren wrote about how his interest in Kham arose. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700412464127">1928</xref>, when he was compiling <italic>Sichuan shidi</italic> (The History and Geography of Sichuan), he noticed that information on the minorities in the southwestern borderlands was limited and also that what was available was mostly erroneous. Ren also recognized that discussions of borderland affairs were mostly copied from Western sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0097700412464127">Wei, 1989</xref>). In 1929, when the Sichuan warlord Liu Wenhui, the command-in-chief of Sichuan Borderland Defense (Chuankang bianfang zong zhihui), was recruiting people to do fieldwork in Kham in preparation for carrying out wasteland reclamation projects, Ren Naiqiang was appointed as the inspector of the Sichuan Borderland. For the duration of one year, he traveled throughout nine counties in Kham. During his investigation trip, he married Lodrö Chöntso, the niece of Dorje Namgyel, the indigenous leader of Upper Nyarong.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0097700412464127">11</xref></sup> On returning to Chengdu, he wrote a series of articles based on what he had seen and heard, and published these in <italic>Bianzheng yuekan</italic> (Borderland Affairs Monthly). Later, this work was published as <italic>Xikang zhaji</italic> (Notes on Xikang) by Xin Yaxiya xuehui (New Asia Association) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0097700412464127">Ren, 1932</xref>). Subsequently, he wrote another series of articles based on his diary, which he published in the <italic>Sichuan ribao</italic> (Sichuan Daily) under the title <italic>Xikang guiyi lu</italic> (A Record of Strange Things and People in Xikang).</p>
<p>Judging by their content and style, these articles seem to cater to a popular audience. That he published in popular journals for public consumption was not accidental. Ren understood that reaching this readership was an important means to enhance public identification with the region. More importantly, at this time a sense of urgency regarding the need to alert the public of the importance of the frontier compelled much of the writing about the frontier regions. Indeed, Ren stated that his reason for publishing these articles in an accessible form was to arouse the inland Chinese people’s interest “in studying borderland affairs so that they would fully understand the real situation of Xikang. This would prompt the Chinese people to understand the situation of Xikang and facilitate their aspiration to develop the region” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0097700412464127">Ren, 1933</xref>: “Author’s preface,” 6–7). In addition to these writings, as an appointed official whose trip was funded by a top warlord in Sichuan, Ren also wrote <italic>Xikang shicha baogao</italic> (Reports of an Investigation in Xikang) as a reference for government officials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0097700412464127">Ren, 1930</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0097700412464127">12</xref></sup> It is clear that Ren saw his work as alerting both high officials and the public to the importance of territory that had yet to occupy a significant place in their imagination.</p>
<p>Ren Naiqiang’s personal and academic background is quite different from that of Ke Xiangfeng and Xu Yitang, who were trained as sociologists in France and had university positions. A traditional historical geographer, Ren considered geography as the basis of all the sciences. The driving force behind his inquiry was his interest in the land and its resources coupled with the central idea of the need to develop the land to strengthen China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700412464127">Ren, 1990</xref>: “Author’s preface,” 2–3). His traditional training greatly influenced his choice of subject as well as his narrative style. Ren’s sense of the deficiency of knowledge about Kham propelled him to undertake extensive field research in the geography, geology, hydrology, and boundary issues of Kham. In 1930, he began to work on three books on the territories, folk customs, and geography of Kham. Based on his <italic>Notes on Xikang</italic>, these three volumes were aimed at filling in lacunae in the Chinese knowledge of Kham. At that time, he was appointed by Liu Wenhui to be a member of the Economic Construction Committee of the Headquarters of the 24th Army, which was in charge of planning for the economic construction of the various counties of Sichuan province.</p>
<p>The first book in this series, <italic>Xikang tujing: jingyu pian</italic> (An Illustrated History of Xikang: Territories), was published by the New Asia Association in Nanjing in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412464127">1933</xref>. Dai Chuanxian, a Guomindang leader and theorist who shared Ren’s motive of enlightening the public, wrote a foreword to the book (Dai, “Foreword,” in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0097700412464127">Ren, 1933</xref>: 2–5). The book is divided into ten parts: parts (tribes) of Kham, place-names, territories, the capital of Xikang province, boundary issues, boundaries among various counties in Kham, etc. The section on the parts of Kham describes the past territories of Kham and their divisions; the section on names provides explanations for terms such as Rong, Qiang, Di, Tubote (referring to Tibet in Chinese), Tangut (Tanggute), U-tsang (Wusizang), Xizang (Tibet), and Xikang. The section on boundary issues is divided into the boundary demarcation between Kham and central Tibet during the Qing period, the negotiations over the boundary between Kham and central Tibet in modern times, and the boundary demarcation of the new Xikang province. What differentiates Ren’s geography of Kham from earlier Chinese work is that his descriptions of the topography, geography, boundaries and other aspects were based on the findings of his fieldwork, and not simply gleaned from descriptions of the region found in earlier gazetteers or works by others. A sense of perfecting earlier knowledge and contemporary political concerns always informed Ren’s academic work. Ren recognized that previous publications were full of inaccurate translations of Tibetan place-names. Thus, an entire section of the third book on the geography of Kham is devoted to devising a correct toponymy of Kham.</p>
<p>The second book, <italic>Xikang tujing: minsu pian</italic> (An Illustrated History of Kham: Folk Customs), is divided into two volumes. The first is about Tibetans in Kham and discusses their ethnic classification (race), occupations, housing, food and drink, clothing, character and disposition, customs, festivals, entertainments, language, and assimilation issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>). The second volume is about Han Chinese and other nationalities (ethnic groups), including information about immigrants, biographical sketches of immigrants, the immigration issue, the Yi nationality (known as Luoluo), and the various nationalities on the Yunnan border. Though Ren Naiqiang was not trained as a professional sociologist or ethnologist, his approach to the study of the various customs of Tibetans in Kham has a strong flavor of sociology and ethnology. His classification of the people of Kham and Tibetans in central Tibet as different nationalities (ethnic groups) clearly shows the influence of contemporary political concerns over the territorial disputes between Kham and central Tibet. Here, he is keen to distance Kham from central Tibet and frame the indigenous population as a separate ethnic group, “Kangzu,” that was distinct from ethnic Tibetans, “Zangzu.” Ren uses both the terms <italic>zhongzu</italic> and <italic>minzu</italic> to refer to both the people of Kham and Tibetans in central Tibet.</p>
<p>Another subject of great concern to Ren, and one to which he devoted considerable space, is the question of Han settlement in Kham regions. For Ren, the key to furthering development and integration was the promotion of Han settlement together with an associated denuding of local identity. He also saw the opening of Kham as addressing the issue of population growth in Sichuan. He recalled that in 1928 when he was compiling the book <italic>Sichuan shidi</italic>, he learned that the Sichuan basin had been devastated by three major disasters, which occurred between the Western Jin (265–316) and Eastern Jin (316–420) periods as well as between the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) periods. All three disasters were related to population explosions: simply too many people on too little land. Thus, as a way to prevent a similar disaster from recurring, he maintained that people should first develop the regions of the various nationalities in the Sichuan borderlands, eliminate the estrangement between the nationalities in borderlands and those in the heartland, and close the economic development gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700412464127">Ren, 1990</xref>: “Author’s preface,” 2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0097700412464127">13</xref></sup> Like other administrators, who viewed their articles or books as reports to the government, or as policy pieces with suggestions or as a reference for officials, in the second volume of <italic>Xikang tujing: minsu pian</italic>, Ren listed in detail the various means for immigration and the historical facts concerning immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 240–96).</p>
<p>The third book, <italic>Xikang tujing: diwen pian</italic> (An Illustrated History of Xikang: Geography), is divided into four parts: topography, geology, mountain ranges, and the correct translation of Tibetan place-names (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0097700412464127">Ren, 1935</xref>). Like the two aforementioned books on Xikang, this volume has as its main purpose providing basic geographical information for both officials and common people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0097700412464127">Ren, 1935</xref>). Ren’s use of modern scientific methods to study and describe the topography, geology, meteorology, surveying, and mapping in this book sets his research on Kham apart from earlier works on borderlands geography. Another contribution of the book is the establishment of standard translations of Tibetan place-names, which corrects erroneous translations found in earlier works on Kham. The correct translations and better understanding of the geography and mountain ranges in Kham were very useful to officials and scholars in discussing boundary issues between Kham and central Tibet, which was the focus of contention in Sino-Tibetan relations at the time.</p>
<p>Later, Ren published “Xikang zhi nonglin xumu” (The Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry of Xikang) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0097700412464127">14</xref></sup> Ren’s attention to these subjects is probably related to his training in the College of Agriculture and his concern for industry. In 1935, he became a member of the Xikang Preparatory Committee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0097700412464127">15</xref></sup> In 1940, he became the director of the Preparatory Center for the General History of Xikang. In order to compile the first general history of Xikang province, he collected many historical sources, and wrote <italic>Xikang tongzhi zhuanxiu gangyao</italic> (An Outline of the Compilation of the General History of Xikang) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0097700412464127">Ren, 1940</xref>). During this period, he also wrote <italic>Kang Zang shidi dagang</italic> (An Outline of the History and Geography of Kham and Tibet), which was first published in 1942 and reprinted in 2000. Spanning the Han and Tang periods to 1940s, this book outlines the political relations, nationalities, social conditions, geographical environment, distribution of industries, origins of religions and major historical events of Kham and Tibet. With the aim of elucidating the main points for the Kham and Tibet issues, it closely examines the relationship between Kham and China as well as between Tibet and China. He mainly analyzes the success and failure of the various Chinese dynasties’ rule over Tibet, and points out the origins and crucial reasons for the modern issues surrounding Kham and Tibet. In his last chapter, he has four sections: “the economic construction,” “the cultural construction,” “public security and military defense,” and “the future of the Tibet issue.”</p>
<p>Finally, in 1943 Ren began to work as an academic. He accepted an offer from West China Union University (Huaxi xiehe daxue) and became a professor and research fellow at the Borderland Research Institute headed by Li Anzhai. In 1944, he joined the Investigation Team of West China Union University, which was conducting fieldwork in northern Kham. His research focused on monasteries and indigenous leaders. Based on this fieldwork, he wrote “Lama jiao yu Xikang zhengzhi<italic>”</italic> (Lamaism and the Politics of Xikang), which was never published, and <italic>Dege tusi shipu</italic> (Genealogy of the Indigenous Leader of Derge). In 1946 he became a professor at Sichuan University, where he established the Research Institute of Kham and Tibet and started a monthly publication, <italic>Kang Zang yanjiu yuekan</italic> (Kham-Tibet Research Monthly).</p>
<p>Ren established a new common practice for Chinese Tibetan studies: research ultimately should support the practical utility of governance of the Kham region. For instance, in the 1930s, when the Chinese government was still hesitant about the establishment of Xikang province, he completed his three aforementioned books on the history of Kham. In these books, he analyzed and attempted to demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of the establishment of Xikang province. Thus, his books are understood to have facilitated the establishment of Xikang province in 1939. In addition, when his research revealed that the <italic>ulag</italic> system—a system of corvée labor performed as a tax obligation—had done great harm to people of Kham, in order to relieve the people of Kham from the burden of <italic>ulag</italic>, he proposed the method of “joint operation of animal stations,” and, in 1938, took on the task personally of implementing this method by establishing a transportation company for animal husbandry products. He also conducted an in-depth study of the relationship between Tibetan Buddhism and the politics of Kham and Tibet, and advised the government that the first step in governing Kham should be to guide its religion in a direction favorable to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Interest in his monthly <italic>Kang Zang yanjiu yuekan</italic> brought Ren recognition as the foremost authority on Kham, and his work came to dominate Republican discourse on Kham. His focus was closely tied to the nationalist agenda of transforming the periphery into an integral part of the nation-state. The prevailing tactic for the incorporation of a region was to produce accurate maps. Claim of ownership over a particular region was carried out by charting vast territories and by the symbolic placement of regions on state maps. Since China did not have a complete map of Kham, Ren surveyed the region himself, and drew a <italic>Standard Map of Kham</italic> in the scale of 1:10,000. He also drew maps for the various counties in Kham, which were included in his book on territories of Xikang. Ironically, these later maps served as blueprints for maps used by the People’s Liberation Army to advance to Tibet (Ren, “A Brief Biography of Ren Naiqiang,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700412464127">2009</xref>: 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0097700412464127">Wei, 1989</xref>: 8). His mapmaking was part of his project of incorporating the Kham region into the Chinese national imagination. Certainly Ren was not alone in recognizing the importance of mapmaking. During the Republican period, a great number of maps of the entire Kham region and the various sub-regions were published, which were drawn with modern scientific methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700412464127">Wang Yao, et al., 2003</xref>: 165).</p>
<p>For Ren it was not only insufficient knowledge about Kham that hampered its incorporation into the national geo-space but also an absence of historical identification in the public imagination. Here Ren’s thinking was very close to that of the historian Gu Jiegang (1893–1980), namely, that the fabrication of a deep history is necessary for the production of true national loyalty. In Gu’s words, “we can only eliminate racial prejudices and create the territory of China as an organized federation if we have a notion of ‘past unity’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412464127">Duara, 2004</xref>: 58). Ren struggled to establish “past unity” by understanding Tibetan culture and tradition not as an alien other, but as an integral part of China’s past. Throughout Ren’s work, there are constant references to Tibetan practices as ancient Chinese traditions. In his words, “The customs in present-day Kham can all be compared to the old customs of the pre-Qin period” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 235). In his <italic>Xikang tujing: minsu pian</italic> Ren listed over fifteen Tibetan customs and related these to what he claimed to have been ancient Chinese practices. For example, he points out that the clothing and ornaments of people of Kham are all similar to ancient styles: broad sleeves, round collars, fastened waistbands, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 235–38). Ren employs a narrative of similarity, which is a keystone supporting ideas of unity and common origin, something reflected in the work of other writers as well. For instance, Yao Ying, a mid-nineteenth-century Qing official who was dispatched to deal with a dispute between the two reincarnated Lamas (Hutuktu) of Drayap in Kham, understood the Tibetan custom of greeting guests with a ceremonial scarf (Tib., <italic>kha btags</italic>) as similar to customs practiced in ancient China (Yao Ying, 1990: 16).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0097700412464127">16</xref></sup> What is interesting here is that while these authors find similarities, their analyses remain mere conjecture and lack actual supporting historical evidence, and are clearly motivated by a desire to trace the roots of whatever they saw to China.</p>
<p>As Emma Teng notes in her work on Chinese colonial travel writing on Taiwan, “For Qing writers, Taiwan was a living museum where they could observe customs long ago abandoned in China” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700412464127">Teng, 2005</xref>: 60). Ren had a similar view of Kham. In his own words,
<disp-quote>
<p>Those literati who admire the practices and people of early antiquity (<italic>shanggu</italic>) often consider it as a matter for regret that they are not able to meet people of remote ages. If they would earnestly like to meet them, they might as well visit the borderlands. Except for Lamaism, the rest of the customs in present-day Kham society can all be compared to the old customs [in Chinese societies] of the pre-Qin period. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 235)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The method here to explain the cultural traditions of Kham is to position the local culture as both primitive and a remnant of ancient China. There is no attempt to understand the traditions in themselves. The history of the local traditions is always framed in relation to China. Han culture is the natural condition and the people of Kham are viewed as remnants of the Han past. This is a common feature that runs through all late imperial ethnographic descriptions of non-Han peoples on the Chinese frontiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412464127">Harrell, 1995</xref>: 15–16). Ren’s framing of Kham as primitive and reflecting China’s past invokes a particular image in the reader’s mind, and especially in the minds of the Chinese literati and the well-educated Chinese public. This is a standard image of the people of early antiquity, “who ate fur and smeared blood on their mouths,” as described in Chinese texts such as the Song dynasty <italic>Lushi</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0097700412464127">17</xref></sup> In other words, the image conjured up in the reader’s mind fits into the expected rhetorical model termed by Teng “the rhetoric of privation.” According to Teng, this rhetoric serves to construct “the savage as backward and culturally inferior” (62). It relies on the concept of the “denial of coevalness” noted by Teng as well as Steven Harrell as an important strategy for colonial rule and adoption of the ideology of a civilizing mission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700412464127">Teng, 2005</xref>: 61; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412464127">Harrell, 1995</xref>: 15–16).</p>
<p>Indeed, most customs Ren describes in his list of comparisons fit into such a rhetorical model. For instance, three entries describe people of Kham sitting on the ground and resting their heads on their arms to sleep as if there were no tables or beds; their wood houses with walls made of puncture vines; and their custom of wearing fur in the winter and coarse clothing in summer. These three examples all demonstrate that Kham lagged far behind China in terms of material conditions. In addition, another five items in his list serve to show that Kham is socially, culturally, and morally inferior to China. Ren is particularly alarmed by what he sees as the promiscuity of the primitive Khampas, who lack morals and social values. This apparent lack of Confucian morality allows him to construct an image of an inferior Kham. There are numerous references to sexual behaviors. He conjectures that the people of Kham lack the concept of chastity, and attributes their promiscuity to a lack of prohibitions in Tibetan ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 103–7). He also conjectures that when all family members share a tent it must lead to incest, and he sees incest as a common failing among non-Han people. He draws a historical analogy with the ancestors of the Manchus, who were also nomads and whose family members lived in the same tent, and argues that incest must have been a common practice among them as well. He goes on to comment that even after the Manchus entered China, they continued to have father, daughter-in-law, mother, sons, brothers and sisters all sleep on the same brick bed warmed by a single fire underneath. Later, the Manchus adopted Han Chinese customs, and became ashamed of this practice. According to Ren, the Manchus tried their utmost to avoid mentioning the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 46).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0097700412464127">18</xref></sup> Here, what is interesting is that Ren’s work, far from elucidating the traditions of Kham, provides a pseudo-scientific explanation to support Han prejudice in the guise of scientific fieldwork. It is evident that Ren had not probed into specific incest taboos and kinship customs followed by the local tradition, where strong prohibitions regarding incest were firmly in place. In fact, much of Ren’s writings as well as those of other Chinese authors of the period provide little reference to specific sources or show evidence of having used local literary sources on the subjects they discuss. This is particularly true when they are dealing with history and religious traditions. They resort to conjecture and summarization based on observations of a narrow body of information.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0097700412464127">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ren’s writing also exhibits a certain attraction to his subject and some nostalgia for what has been lost by the Han. In the first item of the aforementioned list of customs said to be comparable to pre-Qin Chinese traditions, he characterizes the nature of the Khampas as simple and unadorned, and directs his readers to the section on the virtues of the Khampas. In this section he recounts in detail four major virtues—benevolence, thrift, calmness of spirit, and courtesy. His description of these virtues is permeated with words of praise and admiration. He writes that even the Han Chinese would be deeply shamed by the benevolent and loving nature of people in Kham, and describes the calmness of the people of Kham in the face of adversities and emergencies as “magnificent,” superior to all other people. In his description of the courteous manner of the people of Kham, he specifically refers to the fact that there are relatively few curse words in Tibetan, and notes that the tone of the few that exist is very mild and not nearly as acrimonious and spiteful as many Chinese curse words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 99–100). Similarly, in another book on the history of Kham and Tibet, he presents the people as indifferent to glory, name, and wealth, and attributes this to their belief in Buddhism. He claims that it is their nature to be happy, to lead a simple life, and to be optimistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0097700412464127">Ren, 2000</xref>: 32).</p>
<p>It is evident from the above discussion that Ren’s “rhetoric of privation” is also marked by what Teng calls the “rhetoric of primitivism,” which romanticizes the savage as the preserver of an ancient righteousness lost among the modern. However, Ren’s rhetoric significantly differs from what Teng describes. Unlike the authors who used the “rhetoric of primitivism” in their discourse of Taiwan as discussed by Teng, Ren does not associate this romanticized image with the Daoist image of a primitive utopia, where people are content, carefree, innocent of vice, and free from both worldly desires and knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700412464127">Teng, 2005</xref>: 62, 64–65). The analogy that Ren draws between the Khampas and the ancient Han conjures up contradictory and ambivalent images that portray both attractive and repulsive aspects. This is interesting in light of Duara’s observations. In his description of the Chinese ethnological study of the Manchu indigenes, Duara noted that in contrast to Western and Japanese framing of primitive peoples, during the Republican era the “primitive” were not romanticized as living in an idealistic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412464127">Duara, 2004</xref>: 201).</p>
<p>Historical analogy was useful for Ren to justify the assimilation of the people of Kham into China. As Harrell has asserted, historical analogy legitimizes the civilizing project of the hegemonic “center” by establishing the possibility that peripheral people can indeed be civilized. The idea that frontier peoples are living in an earlier stage of historical development suggests that civilizing them is simply a matter of bringing them forward in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0097700412464127">Harrell, 1995</xref>: 15–16). For Ren, the people of Kham could be civilized by means of a historical analogy with many “barbarians” in Chinese history, who had long been assimilated into the Chinese population:
<disp-quote>
<p>The ability of the Han Chinese to assimilate others has always been great. As soon as such violent and strong groups with expansive military force as the Eastern Hu, Xianbei, Diqiang, Miaoman, and Nüzhen came into contact with the [Han Chinese], they immediately vanished. It would be all the more so with the Xifan [i.e., the Tibetans in Kham] who are dignified and kind. The indigenes in Yunnan, known to have over a hundred groups, have been under the rule of our Han political and religious authorities for over a thousand years. Except for the Hui, who once rebelled, all the rest turned toward transformation/civilization (<italic>xianghua</italic>), and there have not been upheavals. Let alone such a single and homogenous group as the Xifan. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0097700412464127">Ren, 1934a</xref>: 222)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ren sees the assimilation of other groups as evidence that the people of Kham would be easily assimilated. He articulates assimilation as a natural and unproblematic process of transforming and creating a new geo-space.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The Kham region emerged as a problematic area due to historical circumstances closely related to China’s new nationalistic imagination. First, local unrest together with a perception that there were foreign threats on its borders placed the late Qing’s forward policy in the frontier in the foreground. The rise of the Nyarong chieftain Gönpo Namgyel as the prime figure in the politics of Kham in the mid-nineteenth century compelled the Qing court to pay special attention to Kham rather than dismiss the region as merely a transit zone between Qing China and Tibet. But the defeat of Gönpo Namgyel by Lhasa troops enabled the Lhasa government to gain a foothold in Kham and extend its sphere of influence into the northern parts of Kham. This led to contention over the Kham region between Qing China and the Lhasa government. Sino-Tibetan difficulties were never far from the larger issues of Western imperialism. The British invasion of Tibet in 1904 reinforced the Chinese sense that they had an insecure and weak frontier, which posed a potential threat to China’s integrity.</p>
<p>The larger issue of insecurity and unruliness on the frontier not only forced the government to seek a policy of integration but also provided the impetus behind the desire of Republican intellectuals to map out a new geo-space and foster the re-imagining of geography and space in which the people of the frontier were inscribed as co-nationals. To carry out the intellectual mapping of the Khampas and their region, nationalist officials-cum-scholars and intellectuals first had to produce sufficient knowledge of the region as well as produce a perspective for envisioning the Kham periphery anew within the national imaginary. As represented by Ren Naiqiang’s work, these intellectuals understood their mission as introducing the Kham periphery to policy makers and the Chinese citizens who would then come to see the contested Kham region as an inalienable part of their national being. In addition, contemporary political concerns, for example, disputes over the boundaries between Tibet and Kham, the relationship between the development of Kham and its integration with China, and the question of Han settlement, always informed Ren’s works. In particular, Ren Naiqiang developed narrative strategies to give new meaning to the Kham periphery and to legitimize the civilizing projects sponsored by the state. He used the narrative of similarity to recast the culture and tradition of Kham from that of alien “other” to representing a historical remnant of China’s past. He also employed the “rhetoric of privation,” together with elements of the “rhetoric of primitivism,” to present the Khampas as people stuck in a lower state of development, deprived materially, culturally, and morally. This project of relegating cultural “others” into the past enabled Ren to constitute the people in Kham as primitive, thus paving the way for a civilizing mission to be carried out by the state.</p>

<p>At this time, the Qing government was preoccupied with numerous rebellions in its territories as well as external challenges such as the Opium Wars. This was the chief reason the Qing was unable to counter Gönpo Namgyel. The Qing did not have sufficient available military forces to suppress his insurgency.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700412464127">Xiuyu Wang, 2006</xref>, rightly points out, foreign pressure was not the singular determinant of the Xinzheng in Tibet. Rather, the rise of an expansionist provincial bureaucracy in Sichuan—represented by Xi Liang and others—and a growing sense of a security threat among Qing frontier officials were two important causes for the impetus of the reforms.</p>

<p>Francis Younghusband’s book <italic>India and Tibet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0097700412464127">1910</xref>) was translated into Chinese by Sun Xuchu as <italic>Yingguo qinlüe Xizang shi</italic> (A History of the British Invasion of Tibet) (Shanghai: Shangwu yinshuguan, 1934). Interestingly, the Chinese title for Tazaknath Das’s book <italic>British Expansion in Tibet</italic> goes by the same title as Younghusband’s book. The book was translated by Xue Guilun and published by the Ta Kung Pao News Agency in Tianjin in 1934. David Macdonald’s <italic>The Land of Lama</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700412464127">1929</xref>) was translated by Zhen Baoshao as <italic>Xizang xiezhen</italic> (A Portrait of Tibet).

<p>Two other prominent scholars engaged in the study of Kham and other frontier research were Li Anzhai and Ma Changshou. Li, a sociologist and ethnologist trained in United States, began his research about Tibetans in eastern and northeastern Tibet in the late 1930s. He published a series of articles on the religion of Tibetans in Labrang (in present-day Qinghai) and the history and population of the Derge (Degé) kingdom in Kham. Ma Changshou (1907–1971), a trained sociologist, ethnologist, and historian who graduated from Central University in Nanjing, led an investigation team organized by the National Central Museum and conducted fieldwork in Tibetan areas and Yi regions in the Sichuan border in 1937. He published a couple of articles on the classification of nationalities, somatotypes, and the social structure of Kham.</p>

<p>Ren goes on to say that he maintained frequent contact with the various indigenous nationalities in the borderlands, and had studied their languages, history, customs, production and consumption, culture and arts, religious beliefs and social structure. He also used the methods of historical geography to explore the history of the development of Kham and Tibetan societies. In addition, he claims that he had written down all these strange and mysterious things in a way that goes beyond explanation and understanding.</p>

<p>As an intellectual who was fully dedicated to serving his country, Ren Naiqiang was deeply influenced by the thought that the country could be saved by establishing industries.

<p>In addition to the ceremonial scarf, Yao Ying also listed three other Tibetan practices he considered to be similar to ancient Chinese practices. While the first was the apron, a wide cloth, worn by Tibetan women, the second is the habit of covering one’s mouth when one answers a senior official’s questions. The third is that Tibetans would hunch over and walk on the side of the path whenever they encountered their officials. In Yao’s opinion, this custom is the same as that alluded by Zheng Kaofu, a tenth-generation ancestor of Confucius, who advocated showing great respect to people. Zheng Kaofu left the following inscription on humility: “On my first promotion, I bent my head. On my second promotion, I bent from my waist. On my third promotion, I prostrated myself. I walked close to the walls on the side of the street and no one dared to insult me.” Yao laments that ancient etiquette was lost in China and one had to seek it in uncivilized lands like Tibet. See Yao Ying, 1990: 59.</p>

<p>In the 1940s when Ren Naiqiang worked at the Borderlands Research Institute at Western China Union University and directed the monthly <italic>Kham and Tibet Studies</italic>, he cooperated with Tibetan scholars such as Xie Guo’an. Because Ren had greater access to Tibetan annals and classics during this period, he began to use both Tibetan and Chinese historical sources in his research. It is in this period that he produced articles such as “Tangbo shengjiu hemengbei kao” (A Textual Investigation into the Tang-Tibet Alliance Monument), originally in <italic>Kang dao yuekan</italic> 5, 7–8 (1943), republished in Ren Naiqiang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700412464127">2009</xref>: 3.68–82); “Songzan Ganbu nianpu” (A Chronicle of King Songtsen Gampo) in <italic>Kang dao yuekan</italic> 6, 1 (1944): 4–22; “Dege tusi shipu” (The Genealogy of Native Rulers of Derge [Degé]), in <italic>Kang Zang yanjiu yuekan</italic> 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412464127">1947</xref>): 15–23; 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412464127">1947</xref>): 19–30; 15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412464127">1947</xref>): 19–25; 16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700412464127">1948</xref>): 11–18; “Suitang zhi nüguo” (The Kingdom of Women in the Sui and Tang Dynasties), <italic>Kang Zang yanjiu yuekan</italic> 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412464127">1947</xref>): 12–16; 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412464127">1947</xref>): 1–17; etc.</p>
