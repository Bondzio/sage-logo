Abstract: A method of manufacturing a birefringent film includes stretching a polymer film in a widthwise direction while at the same time shrinking the same in a lengthwise direction so as to satisfy the relational expression: (1/STD)<sup>1/2 </sup>≤ SMD &lt; 1, in which the length in the widthwise direction and the length in the lengthwise direction, of the polymer film before being stretched are respectively designated as 1, and STD represents a change ratio of the length in the widthwise direction of the polymer film due to stretching and SMD represents a change ratio of the length in the lengthwise direction of the polymer film due to shrinking, and make the stretched polymer film have an Nz coefficient of 0.9–1.1. This method achieves manufacturing of a birefringent film with a high production efficiency, while omitting the bowing phenomenon when manufacturing a birefringent film by stretching a polymer film in the widthwise direction, thereby limiting unevenness in birefringence, retardation and orientation angle and hence producing excellent optical characteristics, as well as achieving successive lamination when laminating with a polarizing film.
