<p>Welcome to the second special conceptual issue of <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>! The first special conceptual issue was printed last year, and work is already ongoing for the third special issue, so this aspect of the journal looks to become an annual offering. Given that there are few outlets specifically devoted to conceptual work, we are delighted to showcase some very exciting manuscripts in this issue.</p>
<p>Work on the issue began with the submission of more than 30 high-quality proposals outlining an idea for a conceptual piece, all of them interesting. It was very difficult to narrow this field to finally arrive at the four articles presented in this special issue. Of course, the quality of the articles would not be the same without the contribution of the reviewers, who read and responded to the articles more than once. The reviewers offered their expertise very generously, and the authors and I are very grateful to them for their developmental comments.</p>
<p>The issue begins with a look at the development of trust in swift starting action teams. The article addresses a developing area of research, given that the time span for team development has been compressed as the competitive pressure on organizations has increased. The authors of this article provide a nice overview of what is known about the development of swift trust and offer some direction for future research.</p>
<p>The second article changes the focus from the internal workings of the team to the external environment. While there is certainly literature that includes information on the external environment of work teams, there is little with that specific focus. Based on a review of the literature, the authors of this conceptual piece categorize the treatment of the team environment as it is currently viewed in empirical research. For each category of treatment, they offer a hypothesis that suggests further exploration as well as one that extends current thinking with respect to the category.</p>
<p>The third article for this special issue brings together the focus on the external environment with the internal processes of the team. This article directs attention to the development of transactive memory systems within teams. The transactive memory system allows team members to know <italic>who knows what</italic> within the team and thus to cope better with the challenges that the team faces. Thus, this article suggests that teams may develop their transactive memory system in order to cope better with the trials presented by the external environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the concluding article for the special issue offers a macro perspective on collaboration. This article examines the development of alliance portfolios, combining the structural and the managerial approaches. From this integrated perspective, the authors offer some suggestions for fruitful exploration of the organizational alliance phenomenon.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed reading each of these manuscripts as the authors developed them into their final form. I am very pleased to offer them here to you for further exploration. As I begin my tenure as editor of this journal, I hope that the areas for further exploration outlined in each of these articles will stimulate subsequent empirical and theoretical exploration for future issues of <italic>Group &amp; Organization Management</italic>.</p>
