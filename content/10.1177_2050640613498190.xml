<p>John Atherton, Scientific Committee Chair, reports from the scientific programme meeting that took place in Vienna, June 2013:</p>
<p>The Scientific Committee had one of its most fulfilling and exciting abstract selection meeting this year. Why was it so good?</p>
<p>Firstly, standards were up! The mean score for abstracts rose and most importantly the scores at the upper end were higher. In order to get the best abstracts into oral free paper sessions we have had to increase our cut-off score, and in particular the top scores in every category were improved. Our abstract reviewers are unchanged from the last two years, so this is a real increase – and the Scientific Committee certainly noticed the difference.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most rewarding job for the Scientific Committee was to select the 10,000 Euro prizes for the five top abstracts submitted to the meeting. This was a difficult task with so many high-scoring abstracts to choose from, but we have selected a combination of big clinical trials, new endoscopic techniques and great science. Come to our Monday morning Plenary Session: four of them will be presented there … and they are great!

<p>Finally, it was fascinating to see where people submitting abstract to the meeting originate from. In total, 76 countries are represented. Abstracts from China have more than doubled and Japan – already our top-submitting country – has seen a further increase. Within Europe the UK has seen a small increase and is now our second highest submitting country. More importantly, Germany and France have both seen significant increases, and it is great to see these two powerhouses of quality research in Europe submitting their best work. We are truly international – that is why quality is so high!</p>
