<p><italic>Objective</italic>: To study whether having ever had local low back pain (LBP), sciatica, neck pain (NP), or some combination of LBP and NP, predicts sickness absence among municipal employees. <italic>Methods</italic>: The study sample (<italic>n</italic>=6911, 80% women, response rate 67%) included employees of the City of Helsinki who reached the age of 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 years between 2000–02. Survey data on pain, working conditions, and health behaviours were linked to register data on sickness absence for three subsequent years. Sickness absence was categorised as self-certified (lasting for 1–3 days) and medically certified (lasting for 4 days or more) and the number of spells during the follow up was analysed using Poisson regression analysis. <italic>Results</italic>: In women, medically certified sickness absence was predicted by sciatica (rate ratio, RR, 1.3, 95% CI 1.1–1.6), NP (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.5) and the combination of sciatica and NP (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6–2.1), allowing for working conditions, body mass index, and smoking. In men, the corresponding RRs were 1.5 (95% CI 1.0–2.1), 1.7 (95% CI 1.2–2.4), and 2.2 (95% CI 1.6–2.9). Local LBP did not predict medically certified sickness absence. Self-certified sickness absence was modestly predicted by all pain categories in women (RRs between 1.2 and 1.5) and by NP alone and with local LBP or sciatica in men (RRs between 1.4 and 1.6). <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: Medically certified sickness absence was predicted by sciatica and NP, but not by local LBP. The association was accentuated in those with both sciatica and NP. Pain combinations may have a stronger effect on work ability than pain in one location.</bold></p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Musculoskeletal disorders are frequent work-related health problems and the most common musculoskeletal symptoms are low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494811435490">1</xref>]. Although acute back pain in most cases resolves within a short period without functional loss, prolonged or recurrent pain in the low back [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494811435490">2</xref>] and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494811435490">3</xref>] occurs frequently. Back pain is a major cause of healthcare use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494811435490">4</xref>], sickness absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494811435490">5</xref>], and disability retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494811435490">6</xref>].</p>
<p>There is a large body of literature on sickness absence due to non-specific LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435490">7</xref>]. However, most studies have only included men and employees in the manufacturing industries, while women, white-collar employees, and the public sector have been less studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435490">7</xref>]. Associations of NP with sickness absence are not well described. NP often leads to limited activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494811435490">8</xref>] and seeking care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435490">9</xref>] and could therefore be an important factor in sickness absence. Previous studies have aimed to examine individual and environmental factors associated with sickness absence among persons with NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494811435490">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494811435490">11</xref>], while studies examining the effect of NP per se on the risk of sickness absence are scarce.</p>
<p>Only some studies on the effects of sciatica on sickness absence have been published. An international consensus report recommended that LBP should be categorised as local pain and “pain that goes down the leg” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494811435490">12</xref>]. Sciatica may be more severe than local LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494811435490">13</xref>] and it seems to be associated with a longer duration of sickness absence than local LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494811435490">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Most previous studies on the associations of sickness absence with spinal pain have examined pain in the low back or the neck separately. However, pain which occurs both in the low back and the neck may be more disabling than pain in either location only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494811435490">15</xref>]. A previous prospective study showed that having pain both in the low back and the neck was more strongly associated with sickness absence than pain in one location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435490">16</xref>]. However, the participants of the study were highly selected as only persons who reported LBP and/or NP both at baseline and follow up were included. Also the number of participants was low and stratified analyses by gender were not made.</p>
<p>It has been reported that women, those with heavy physical workload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435490">7</xref>] or high job strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494811435490">17</xref>], the overweight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494811435490">18</xref>], and smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494811435490">19</xref>], have more sickness absence. These factors need to be taken into account when examining the associations between spinal pain and sickness absence.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to examine whether local LBP, sciatica, NP, and combinations of these, were associated with subsequent short and longer sickness absence spells among female and male municipal employees. We took into account the possible confounding effects of age, job control, work demands, social support at work, physical workload, and health behaviour (body mass index, BMI, and smoking).</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494811435490">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort including middle-aged employees of the City of Helsinki, the largest employer in Finland with nearly 40,000 employees. Employment sectors included public administration, social and health care, education, cultural services, public transportation, and environmental and technical maintenance, covering more than 200 occupational titles. The largest branches among women were health care and day care, whereas men more often worked in technical branches and public transport.</p>
<p>The baseline mail survey was conducted among all employees, who reached the age of 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 years between 2000 and 2002 based on information from the employer’s personnel register. The data were collected by independent cross-sectional surveys in 2000–02. Of the 13,344 eligible participants, 8960 (80% women) responded to the questionnaire (response rate 67%). The response rate was slightly lower among men, older subjects, and blue-collar respondents. However, according to a non-response analysis the associations between occupational class and sickness absence were similar among participants and non-participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494811435490">20</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494811435490">
<title>Sickness absence</title>
<p>The number of sickness absence spells during the follow-up period was used as the outcome. This outcome effectively uses the information when one individual has several sickness absence spells and is not dominated by only a few prolonged spells. The follow-up time started when the employee returned the questionnaire and was restricted to a maximum of 3 years. If the employment contract terminated before this, the follow up ended at that point. The mean follow-up time was 2.7 years.</p>
<p>Over the follow-up period, information on the frequency and duration of spells of sickness absence were gathered for each respondent, and all consecutive and all consecutive sickness absence spells were combined. Diagnoses for the sickness absence spells were unavailable. Absence for other reasons than sickness was subtracted (e.g. leave of absence, absence to take care of a sick child).</p>
<p>The sickness absences spells were dichotomised according to their duration. In Finnish municipal workplaces, self-certification is accepted for up to 3 days, but longer sickness absence spells require medical certificate by a physician. Thus, in this study self-certified sickness absence included absences lasting 1–3 days and medically certified those lasting 4 days or longer. Participants could have both types of sickness absence spells.</p>
<p>Information on sickness absence was derived from the employer’s personnel register. The survey data were linked with sickness absence records using the unique personal identification number among those who had given a written permission for the linkage (<italic>n</italic>=6988, 78%). Sixteen persons were excluded from the analysis due to a missing identification number. The final sample amounted to 6934 participants. Participants who consented for data linkage were more often without medically certified sickness absence during the study year, men, older employees, and in higher socioeconomic positions.</p>

<sec id="section5-1403494811435490">
<title>Low back pain and neck pain</title>
<p>The questionnaire asked about the lifetime occurrence of local LBP, sciatica and NP. Local LBP was described as follows: “Non-specific low back pain signifies pain in the low back, without radiation to the shin or foot”. The instruction given for sciatica was: “Sciatica signifies pain in the low back with pain radiating to the shin or foot”. Local LBP was assessed by the following question: “Have you ever had local LBP, and if yes, how long was the longest episode?” Sciatica and NP were analogously assessed. Each response was dichotomised (no, yes). A diagram of the body area in question was not shown.</p>
<p>The respondents were categorised as follows: (1) neither LBP nor NP; (2) only LBP; (3) only sciatica; (4) only NP; (5) local LBP and NP; and (6) sciatica and NP. If a person with NP reported both local LBP and sciatica, she/he was included in category 6.</p>

<title>Covariates</title>
<p>Karasek’s job demand-control inventory was applied to assess work stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494811435490">21</xref>]. The Framingham version with nine questions on job demands (Cronbach’s α 0.75) and nine questions on job control was used (Cronbach’s α 0.76). The job demands and job control scores were classified into quartiles. Social support at work was assessed by Sarason’s Social Support Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494811435490">22</xref>]. This measure includes four items that assess social support from family members, friends, a superior, or fellow employees. A variable of social support at work was created by summing across four items in the subscale including support received from the superior or fellow employees.</p>
<p>Working conditions were assessed by an 18-item inventory of potentially harmful characteristics of work and working environment developed at the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494811435490">23</xref>]. Based on factor analysis a dimension of physical work load consisting of six items, including uncomfortable postures, repetitive trunk rotation, repetitive movements, standing, walking, and heavy physical work (lifting and carrying), was identified (Cronbach’s α 0.82).</p>
<p>Body mass index (BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated based on self-reports of height and weight and categorised into underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), and obesity (≥30.0). Smoking was categorised into never smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494811435490">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>The associations between sickness absence and local LBP, sciatica, NP, and pain combinations were first examined by calculating the number of self-certified and medically confirmed spells per 100 person-years according to the pain categories for women and men. Poisson regression analysis was then used to obtain rate ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals for associations between types of pain and sickness absence during the follow up. Those with no pain were used as the reference group. Possible confounding factors (physical working conditions, psychosocial working conditions, and health behaviours) were adjusted for in sequential analyses to examine whether they affected the studied associations between pain and sickness absence. Finally, a full model simultaneously adjusted for all covariates. SAS version 8.02 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for the analyses.</p>

<p>Women who reported both sciatica and NP had the highest occurrence of self-certified and medically certified sickness absence spells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494811435490">Table I</xref>). Among men, the highest number of self-certified absence spells was observed among those with NP only, but medically certified absence spells were the most frequent among men who reported both sciatica and NP.</p>
<p>Among women, the age-adjusted RR of self-certified sickness absence for pain in one location, independent of whether it was local LBP, sciatica, or NP, was 1.3 (95 % CI 1.1–1.6) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435490">Table II</xref>). The corresponding rate ratio for the combined pain group of local LBP and NP was 1.4 (95% CI 1.3–1.6). A higher risk of sickness absence was observed in the combined pain group of sciatica and NP (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6–1.9). Adjusting for job strain and social support had minor effects on the associations. Adjusting for physical work load attenuated somewhat the associations in the group with sciatica only and in the combined pain groups. The effects of further adjustments for BMI and smoking were minor. In the fully adjusted model, the estimates attenuated further but the associations remained statistically significant.</p>

<p>Among men, local LBP was not associated with self-certified sickness absence. The highest age-adjusted risk for sickness absence was among men with only NP (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.2, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494811435490">Table II</xref>). The corresponding RRs for the combined pain groups of local LBP and NP, and of sciatica and NP, were 1.6. Also for men, the RR for each pain group was attenuated after further adjustments, physical work load having the strongest effect on the associations. In the fully adjusted model, the estimates attenuated further and the association between sciatica and self-certified sickness absence was no more statistically significant.</p>
<p>The pain categories tended to show stronger associations with medically certified than self- certified sickness absence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494811435490">Table III</xref>). Among women, the age-adjusted RR of medically certified sickness absence for sciatica alone was 1.6 (95% CI 1.3–1.9). An equally strong association was observed in the combined pain group of local LBP and NP. The highest risk of sickness absence was observed for the combined pain group of sciatica and NP. Compared to women with no pain, those with sciatica and NP had a more than 2-fold risk for medically certified sickness absence. The adjustment for job strain and social support had small effects on the associations while adjustment for physical workload as well as BMI and smoking attenuated the risk in each pain group. In the fully adjusted model, the estimates attenuated further but the associations remained statistically significant. Overall, pain that had occurred both in the low back and the neck was a stronger risk factor of medically certified sickness absence than pain in one location among women.</p>

In accordance with the RRs for self-certified spells, those for medically certified sickness absence attenuated after further adjustments but the associations remained statistically significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined whether local LBP, sciatica, NP, or their combinations (i.e. LBP or sciatica and NP) predicted sickness absence among middle-aged municipal employees during a 3-year follow-up period. We found that most categories of pain predicted subsequent sickness absence in both women and men. This held true even after taking job strain, social support at work, physical workload, overweight, and smoking into account. The strength of the associations varied from modest to moderate.</p>
<p>In both women and men, sciatica showed stronger associations with sickness absence than local LBP, in particular for medically certified absence spells. Although there are no directly comparable prospective studies, our findings are in accordance with previous prospective studies where sciatica has been associated with more severe consequences than local LBP. Among employees in the metal industry, sciatica was associated more strongly with hospitalisation due to low back disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494811435490">24</xref>] and the symptoms were more permanent than for local LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494811435490">25</xref>]. In addition, compared to non-specific LBP sciatica increased the risk for short-term and long-term sickness absence due to back pain among men working in manufacturing industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494811435490">7</xref>]. Our findings showed that sciatica was also an important predictor for overall sickness absence among employees in the public sector and among women.</p>
<p>We found NP to be a somewhat stronger predictor of sickness absence among men, although women more often than men reported NP at baseline. This finding is discordant with the results of a previous population-based cross-sectional study where women reported more often sick leave due to NP than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494811435490">9</xref>], possibly due to differences in study design and study population. In our study, the reasons for this gender difference remain unresolved. However, as occupations, work tasks, and exposures differ between genders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494811435490">26</xref>], the aetiology of NP may vary between men and women, or, alternatively, NP in men may be more disabling due to the different requirements of work.</p>
<p>The risk for sickness absence was particularly high for those with both LPB and NP, notably if sciatica and NP were present. Comparing our results with previous ones is complicated by different study designs. In a Swedish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435490">16</xref>] associations of sickness absence between concurrent LBP and NP were assessed among middle-aged employees with persistent LBP or NP. The results showed that compared to those with pain either in the low back or the neck those with both LBP and NP had a higher risk of overall sickness absence of more than 14 days during a 5-year follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494811435490">16</xref>]. Our study showed that having had LBP and NP predicted also sickness absence spells of short duration. It may be that having both LBP and NP represents a more severe and long-standing pain condition than having pain in one location.</p>
<p>In contrast to our results, concurrent LBP and NP was not a risk factor for sickness absence in a Swedish study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494811435490">27</xref>] examining those with NP at baseline. Neither did a study among industrial employees find that the concurrent LBP and NP increased the risk of sickness absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494811435490">28</xref>]. However, that study was cross-sectional and information on sickness absence was based on self-reports. Using a prospective design allows the direction of association to be determined and register based sickness absence data avoids drop out and recall bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494811435490">29</xref>] and thus provides more accurate information on sickness absence than self-reports.</p>
<p>In epidemiological studies, retrospective self-reports of musculoskeletal pain are commonly used. However, the validity of self-reported pain has been questioned because people tend to forget past pain. A study among employees in the USA found that 72% of those with pain or discomfort in the upper extremities at baseline failed to remember the pain after 6 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494811435490">30</xref>]. In our study, the questions about the lifetime occurrence of pain showed clear associations with sickness absence. Both LBP and NP often recur, and it is possible that lifetime pain in this study signifies rather recurrent pain than a single episode of pain. To confirm the observed associations, further studies to examine associations between concurrent pain in different location of the spine and sickness absence will be valuable.</p>
<p>Our study included common risk factors for LBP and sickness absence as covariates in the analyses. Adjusting for physical workload attenuated the risk in each pain group among both genders irrespective of the length of sickness absence. Work-related psychosocial factors, body mass index, and smoking were also considered but their effects were minor. The information on the covariates was obtained from the baseline questionnaire. The difference in the time windows between pain and the covariates might underestimate the effects of the covariates.</p>
<p>Our results add to the previous studies by showing the importance of back and neck pain as determinants of sickness absence among women and those working in the public sector. Concurrent or successive neck pain and low back pain, especially if the latter was radiating like sciatica, had stronger effects on sickness absence than pain in one location only. Overall, however, the relationships were rather modest. Yet, when the ailment is very common, as in the current case of spinal pain, even small effects may amount to very significant overall numbers of lost work days. To prevent decreased of work ability and long-term sickness absence, occupational health-care should take account of pain combinations among persons with neck pain or low back pain. Early detection of multisite spinal pain and effective pain relief might prevent loss of work ability.</p>
