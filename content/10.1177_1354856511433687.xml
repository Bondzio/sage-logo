<abstract>
<p>The complexities of archiving digital content, particularly those story forms reliant on multiple platforms, highlights technical, cultural and curatorial issues that remain difficult to reconcile coherently. Seeking to frame the issues within this special Debates section, this essay outlines issues facing the field of digital storytelling; examining narrative form, instantiation and subsequent archival.</p>

<body>
<p>Within an interdependent media ecology of websites, applications, smartphones, walled gardens of content and proprietary platforms, the half-life of digital content becomes shorter by the year. Debating the longevity of videogame platforms has become a pastime for academics and game designers, while emulators recapture the mechanics and affordances of early Atari consoles, Sega devices and arcade machines and text adventures constantly rerun under new operating systems and browsers. Nevertheless, the experiential affordances of digital storytelling are at best preserved on an ad-hoc basis. While the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856511433687">Internet Archive, n.d.</xref>) preserves the web as best it can on a rolling month-by-month basis and the British Library has begun a project to archive the UK web as a deep archive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856511433687">UK Web Archive, n.d.</xref>), preservation and curation of digital content for future generations of scholars and readers remains a secondary concern for most content developers.</p>
<p>Considering digital storytelling as a subset of the broader emergence of online content, the landscape looks even more haphazard. Amongst the earliest examples of standalone hypertext writing (as distinct from commercially constructed hypertext packages) Geoff Ryman’s <italic>253</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856511433687">Ryman, 1997</xref>) is captured as a crawled archive by Wayback and referenced (but not archived in its own right) within UK Web Archive content, but not curated in any cogent manner. That Ryman’s own website remains online is of considerable value to researchers; however, relying on the ongoing largesse of a single author facing annual hosting fees for a work that brings in no revenue in itself is a dangerous policy for the digital writing community to pursue. <italic>253</italic> has been the subject of academic articles (a number are collected in <italic>Close Reading New Media</italic>, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856511433687">van Looy and Baetens, 2003</xref>) and regular commentary from writers since its completion, but this ancillary content – arguably necessary for scholars to appreciate the significance of Ryman’s writing – is only apparent after a process of considered investigation and independent research. <italic>253</italic> may remain for future generations a powerful example of hypertextual fictional form, but is unlikely to be considered as such without the curation of both those materials exploring its significance, and preservation of the website itself.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856511433687">Transcriptions Project (2005</xref>) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, seeks to ‘transcribe’ between past and present, integrating new media technologies into what has traditionally been a humanities discipline. The most impactful output of the Project to date is arguably the archive built around William Gibson and Denis Ashbaugh’s <italic>Agrippa</italic> <italic>(A Book of the Dead)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856511433687">Gibson and Ashbaugh, 1992</xref>). This most impermanent of web artefacts is designed to obsolesce upon reading (the diskette containing Gibson’s poem destroys the file as it is read, Ashbaugh’s etchings were intended to be printed in ‘disappearing’ ink) rendering preservation of the experience of reading the complete text an apparently impossible challenge. While a ‘hack’ of the original poem provides a recreation of the poem’s self-destruction (the precise nature and timeline of the hack itself is also documented within the Transcription archive), the experience of viewing a video of a piece of software intervening in the reading process perversely serves to remind us of the distance between the archive and the original experience. Derrida describes archives as possessing an ontological referent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856511433687">1995</xref>: 2), returning us to the original form of an object, denying its recontextualisation in a contained, preserved form and directing us back to the nominative instance. In the specific case of <italic>Agrippa</italic>, it is impossible to re-experience that first moment, even as an archived remediation, so bound in time, place and now outmoded technology is the artefact itself. The Transcriptions archive for <italic>Agrippa </italic>is staggeringly complete; a resource documenting the release of the book-box, the public performance (by Penn Jillette) of Gibson’s poem, and scholarly texts examining the phenomenon from haptic, digital and historical contexts; all of which draw attention to the empty vessel at its centre – the book cannot be experienced in retrospect.</p>
<p>This single example might call into question our strategies for archiving digital material in all its forms.</p>
<p>At a technical level, an alternate reality game (ARG) might comprise a series of interconnected websites, emails, tweets and physical objects. The experience of playing an ARG though, can be likened to storytelling as archaeology, asking players to reassemble extant material and determine meaning from that process. Addressing Espen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433687">Aarseth’s (1997)</xref> exploration of ergodic literature, one might find respite in Umberto Eco’s description of ‘works in movement’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433687">Aarseth, 1997</xref>: 52) being those objects in storytelling that ‘consist of unplanned or physically incomplete structural units’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433687">Aarseth, 1997</xref>: 51). Despite Eco’s dismissal of transitory experience as possessing value (Eco suggests that despite the text of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856511433687">Marc Saporta’s 1963</xref> <italic>Composition No.1</italic> ‘promising to yield a different story every time it was shuffled’ its ‘only validity lay in its construction’ – in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856511433687">Aarseth, 1997</xref>), digital narrative has, to date, drawn on the experience of immediate moments for its impact. Bob Hughes describes interactive media as possessing pico-narratives – the ‘way things respond to the user’s actions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856511433687">1997</xref>), a subjective methodology he applies to the analysis of programming emergent story experiences. Hughes goes on to describe how we process narrative as a spatial experience, employing physical metaphors to make sense of digital terrain that is anything but physical in its design.</p>
<p>Similar thinking can be brought to bear on the curation of experiential story, if we return to the example of an ARG that begins with a call to action by email and proceeds through items posted to players. Phone messages and online fora populate content and deepen the core ‘story’, after which in-game websites reveal themselves and provide platforms for the next stages of story to be uncovered. A live event punctuates the fragility of the online space, requiring players to organise and role-play alongside actors playing improvised roles in an emergent narrative. All of these elements featured in the narrative arc of <italic>Meigeist</italic>, authored by Hazel Grian and Jonathan Williams in 2007 (and regrettably unpreserved in any coherent form). The story arc was planned and authored in a largely conventional manner; plot reveals, reversals and cliffhangers designed into an emergent story experience. The nature of emergent story, whether such exists as a digital or conventional artefact, is to persuade each player/reader that their experience of the story is not only unique, but that they possess agency within the narrative arc. This manifests as relating a series of linear encounters within an unlinear narrative landscape, each participant assigning a scale of significance to pico-narrative moments according not only to each moment’s authorial provenance, but also by a measure determined by their personal interpretation of the emergent framework. The immediate problem facing the digital archivist is that recreating those personal interpretations in an archive cannot be achieved by simply preserving the base material itself. Too much of the emergent experience is contingent on having participated in the story as it was released and managed; in order to curate an archive of ARG material, a spatial metaphor, transposing the terrain of digital content to something resembling the troughs and peaks of Hughes’ narrative landscape might offer a working model for curators.</p>
<p>ARGs are by no means the only problematic case study though. Considering a taxonomy of digital content, one finds the territory littered with story forms and devices requiring particular attention. Hypertextual narrative objects such as <italic>253</italic> are largely built on an html platform, and easily preserved; Michael Joyce’s <italic>Afternoon, a Story </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856511433687">1987</xref>) requires proprietary software in order to be read (the same is true of Stuart Moulthrop’s <italic>Victory Garden</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856511433687">1992</xref>, Shelly Jackson’s <italic>Patchwork Girl</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856511433687">1995</xref> and other titles authored in publishing house Eastgate’s Storyspace). Projects conceived in Macromedia’s Director have suffered mixed fortunes; at the time of writing a revised edition of Chris Marker’s landmark <italic>Immemory </italic>(Exact Change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856511433687">1997</xref>) is readable on a contemporary Macintosh platform, but no Windows or Linux versions exist. The programming environment has been revived by Adobe, but sadly remains a CD Rom platform in a cloud-computing world. The Electronic Literature Organisation<sup>’</sup>s (ELO) Preservation, Archiving and Dissemination (2003) project (now largely inactive) sought to address the preservation and curation of digital works, whether from proprietary or open source platforms, eventually publishing two framework documents which despite providing a rigorous and well-argued foundation have achieved little traction in the field. Ebooks, whether as enhanced versions of print titles (some with video and audio additions tightly bound to text content) or digitally native applications closer to the App model offered by <italic>The Wasteland</italic> (Faber &amp; Faber, 2011), are bound to devices (iPad, Kindle, Android tablets) whose longevity is subject to commercial market forces and changing trends. In 20 years’ time, will designers build iPad and Android OS emulators for the very same purpose Atari emulation exists on the web today? Umberto Eco sounded a familiar note in 2011: ‘modern media formats quickly become obsolete. Why run the risk of choosing objects that may become mute and indecipherable?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856511433687">Eco and Carrière, 2011</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>Writers and designers, contrarians to the last, continue to explore new forms and structures for telling stories and engaging their audiences. Digital technology expands the problem of archiving, compounds the difficulty of curation, but will continue to do so, despite efforts to rein in its excesses.</p>
<p>In this special Debates section, Kamilla Pietrzyk addresses the instability produced by contemporary society’s drive toward technological acceleration. Within this short framing essay I have focused on the imperative to preserve, alongside introductory illustrations of the specific issues facing curators and archivists when dealing with digital stories. Pietrzyk’s essay addresses the socio-cultural framework in which curation takes place. A companion document to the ELO reports, <italic>Acid-Free Bits: Recommendations for Long-Lasting Electronic Literature</italic> and <italic>Born-Again Bits: A Framework for Migrating Electronic Literature</italic>, her closing observation that a slow crawl toward digital amnesia is entwined in our reliance on electronic platforms speaks to specific misgivings about cultural shifts toward born-digital works.</p>
<p>James Newman’s contribution, an examination of <italic>Sonic the Hedgehog</italic>, demonstrates the effect of platform technologies themselves on the user experience. Emulation is a common and ably executed strategy by which to demonstrate obsolete games. Newman draws out the materiality of each iteration of the game itself though, speculating that the fluidity of coding tweaks necessary to recreate prior experiences remove the nature of a game as a single object capable of preservation.</p>
<p>These short essays reflect current concerns regarding the role of the researcher exploring digital platforms and content. The mutability of content; the ephemerality of momentary, personally moderated narratives; device specific story forms: each provide the writer with a new set of tools and the promise of new forms and shapes with which to tell stories. What seems certain is that the problem of archival and preservation of digital story is far from solved. The issues raised in this Debates section nevertheless begin to outline the oft-neglected complexity inherent in digital archival initiatives, pointing toward a more comprehensive examination to come.</p>
