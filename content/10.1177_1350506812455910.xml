<p>. . . without the economic imbalance between rich and poor regions of the world, initiated through impoverishment processes following system transformation (in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union), natural disasters, wars or poor governance (in Latin America, Asia and Africa), this phenomenon would not exist – at least not on this scale. (p. 188)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The phenomenon that Helma Lutz illuminates in her new book about ‘The New Maids’ is the structurally asymmetrical relationship between employers in western households and their migrant domestic workers. The unequal distribution of power in the world is basically the reason why millions of people worldwide – an increasing number of these being female – are migrating to other countries or areas searching for better living conditions. But when entering the immigration country they may be met by previous migrants, who know what they are likely to experience, with the words: ‘welcome to hell’, as is the case for one of Lutz’s interviewees.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive ethnographic study of migrant domestic work in German households, Lutz provides a thorough empirical and theoretical analysis of migrant domestic workers and their employers. Although using a mixed-methods approach her main data comprise biographical narratives of 27 migrant workers and 19 German employers – many of whom were interviewed several times – living in the German cities Münster, Hamburg and Berlin. The migrants are mainly from Latin America and Poland, the latter being currently the most important country of origin for migrants in Germany. Except for one man, all the study’s migrants are female, reflecting both the fact that approximately 90% of these workers are female and also the difficulties of persuading men within this work area to be interviewed. Overall, calling her work ‘global ethnography’ makes sense, as her analysis all the way through keeps one eye on the interviewees’ lifeworlds and one eye on the global framework conditions. Another central feature of her analysis worth mentioning is that the migrants, although trapped by the restrictive German migration policy at the time of the data collection, are presented as actively engaged in trying to improve their living conditions. Though the migration policy implies that they have no employment contract, no work permit and in many cases no residence permit (with marriage to a German man as the only permanent way out of this trap), Lutz nicely balances their roles of being victims and practising agency at the same time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the analysis also includes a historical perspective in terms of presenting differences between the Polish domestic worker of today, cleaning middle-class houses in a German city, and the servant a century ago. This reminds the reader of the long historical roots of servant use and also of the feminization shift taking place in the nineteenth century. In this perspective, central characteristics of the new maids are that they have a transnational life (going back and forth between the countries), leave children behind, do live-out (rather than live-in) work and, not least, have a middle-class background. The book’s historical perspective also reveals that the disparity between employer and employee today is often not educational but relates to the unequal distribution of power in the world.</p>
<p>Since migration linked to domestic work is now one of the most important global labour sectors, a growing literature covers this field. As well as building on this literature, Lutz also develops it further, suggesting important adjustments. One example is her critique of Barbara Ehrenreich and Arlie Hochschild’s central 2002 work about ‘Global women’ which uses only a gender metaphor, while Lutz suggests that a broader theoretical perspective covering the intersection of gender, ethnicity and class is necessary. However, while these kinds of suggestions contribute to nuancing and broadening the theoretical field on migration and domestic work (which is actually what Bridget Anderson in 2000 called the three Cs: cooking, cleaning, caring) the most important contribution to the field from this book is its close empirical analysis as presented in the book’s middle chapters. These thematize the employer/employee work relationship (theoretically about negotiation boundaries), transnational motherhood (including virtual motherhood as a ‘caring about’ role towards the children left behind) and finally a chapter about the challenges and impact of being illegal (theorizing the informal economy). These chapters make absolutely fascinating reading and add important nuances to, for example, the often one-sided global-care-chain discussions viewing the only loss as mothers leaving behind their children and ignoring the link with the masculinity crisis of the men left behind. Another important empirically based contribution is the analysis of illegal life, which generally shows that restrictive migration policy never works properly but rather produces inhumane situations. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 giving all people the right to freedom of movement, the restrictions are also unlawful. While these and other kinds of restrictions still take place they reveal a deep and unsolved antagonism in EU migration policy overall, including both EU and non-EU member countries. Lutz’s empirical analysis contributes to the understanding of this.</p>
<p>Although the empirical analysis is so fascinating in this book, there is also a problem concerning Lutz’s and other researchers’ work with biographical data. When presenting the analysis of the research project, there seem to be two main roads to walk along. One is to use the ‘ingredients’ from the different stories to construct types or, if more advanced, ideal-types that cultivate and abstract the data. The other is to use one or a few of the stories directly as a window through which the reader is given insight into the analytical findings. Lutz has chosen the second road and the advantage of this clearly is that the reader becomes strongly involved in the stories. After finishing the book, the reader might even feel like they have closed a dramatic novel. For a scientific work, though, this might also cause problems and I want to mention three. One is the danger of recognition when a whole, and continuing, detailed story of an interviewee is revealed. Another concerns respect for the interviewee’s feelings; I wonder how in particular Anna Koscinska from Poland experiences reading about her own (unsuccessful) life story which includes an unfinished university degree, partying rather than studying, an experience of rape, and now no hope for the future? And a third problem concerns the presentation of how the interviewees after several interviews in the end revealed their deepest problems; almost presented as digging into the truth. In other words, there is clearly here a dilemma for the qualitative researcher using biographical in-depth material, though I will leave it to other readers to assess whether Lutz has gone too far in her scientific quest.</p>
<p>Within the academic publishing world today, the writing of books has lower recognition than the writing of articles in acknowledged international journals. Helma Lutz’s book about the new maids shows how important it is to continue resisting this modern ‘rule’ for publishing. In spite of the necessary and continuing discussions of the science of scientific work, the research field of the three Cs needs these empirically based, profound contributions in order to update and develop the field further. Hopefully, as is the intention of Helma Lutz and many others, the book will be read and used far beyond the field of gender research. The time for this has come.</p>
