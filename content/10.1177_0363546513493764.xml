<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>After reading the recent article by Giles et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513493764">5</xref></sup> titled “Do the Traditional and Modified Latarjet Techniques Produce Equivalent Reconstruction Stability and Strength?” we feel compelled to summarize our impressions of this study, particularly since our “modified” Latarjet technique (the one designated as the Congruent-Arc technique in the article) was the one that was compared with the “traditional” operation in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513493764">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513493764"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513493764">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>First of all, the investigators are to be commended on a well-designed testing protocol. Furthermore, we agree with many of their conclusions. However, we are concerned that their conclusion of “poorer stability” in the Congruent-Arc group is misleading because it refers to loading the repair construct in an extreme position of anterior translation and external rotation, which produces rim-loading that is totally concentrated on the graft. This is not a clinically relevant position for testing the strength of fixation at time zero, as any reasonable surgeon would have the patient avoid that position until graft consolidation and healing allowed such loads to be physiologically off-loaded across the repair interface and onto a fully healed graft.</p>
<p>For the first 4 to 6 weeks, we generally protect our patients full-time in a sling, which keeps the humeral head centered on the glenoid and prevents rim-loading of the coracoid graft. In some selected cases, one of us (J.F.D.) will allow some early exercise with the arm fixed in internal rotation so that rim-loading is avoided. Then we slowly rehabilitate the patient after the initial 6 weeks, avoiding positions of rim-loading until the graft has consolidated. In fact, Giles et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513493764">5</xref></sup> noted that central loading yielded no difference between either Latarjet technique and the intact control conditions, yet this conclusion receives scant discussion in comparison with the findings related to the eccentrically loaded construct.</p>
<p>Our point is this: We avoid eccentric loading during the vulnerable, early postoperative phase, but once the graft has healed, both constructs (traditional and Congruent-Arc) will be equally strong. Furthermore, the Congruent-Arc technique has the additional and extremely important advantage of maintaining much better articular-arc congruity and contact-pressure distributions than the traditional technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513493764">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513493764">5</xref></sup> The authors correctly point out that such favorable contact-pressure characteristics may predispose toward a lower rate of late degenerative changes.</p>
<p>The only situation in which we could envision an advantage to the traditional Latarjet technique would be in the unusual case of a very narrow coracoid in which the bone was too narrow for screw fixation unless it were kept in the orientation of the traditional Latarjet.</p>
<p>We congratulate the authors on a well-performed biomechanical study, but we wish to register our concern that they focused their conclusions on a clinically irrelevant extreme loading position that would never be applied at time zero.</p>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>We thank Drs Burkhart and DeBeer for their interest in our study and for bringing their extensive clinical experience with the Latarjet reconstruction to this discussion. We are in complete agreement with the authors’ opinion that 4 to 6 weeks of postoperative sling immobilization is critical in the healing and graft consolidation phase. To this end, we ensured that the final conclusion of our paper emphasized the importance of this rehabilitative protocol, which our data support. We recognize that our discussion makes less reference to the importance of maintaining a centralized humeral head position than it does to the significance of the eccentric loading results. However, this was a conscious choice made because we believed that the centralized loading findings were intuitive and required less discussion as the data were in agreement with current postoperative procedures.</p>
<p>With regard to our findings and interpretation of the Congruent-Arc Latarjet’s stability during eccentric loading, we fully recognize (as noted in our Limitations section) that this testing cannot be accurately extrapolated to the fully healed condition. Further study may be able to clarify the strength of the two healed constructs through the use of computational modeling and patient computed tomography data. However, despite not being able to predict the exact strength and stability in the fully healed condition, the results from eccentric loading in this study are a valid means for determining the relationship between the Classic and Congruent-Arc techniques’ fixation stability at any point in the healing process. We can determine this relationship because it is fundamentally linked to the geometry of the two techniques. For instance, we can unequivocally state that the same joint force applied at the two reconstructed rims will produce (on average) a 30% larger load at the Congruent-Arc’s graft-glenoid interface because it is 30% wider than the Classic based on literature of coracoid geometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513493764">1</xref></sup> We can also state that this 30% larger load will be carried by a base of bone at the graft-glenoid interface that is only 70% that of the Classic Latarjet. Thus, although we cannot predict whether the strength of the healed Congruent-Arc will be problematic relative to typical joint loads, it is likely to be weaker than the Classic technique.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we think it is important to note that clinical reports by Burkhart and deBeer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513493764">3</xref></sup> have shown extremely low failure rates with the modified (Congruent-Arc) Latarjet. Additionally, as mentioned in the letter, fixation is far from the only consideration. For instance, the Congruent-Arc has a favorable effect on contact pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513493764">4</xref></sup> which is critical to preventing long-term degeneration, but this must be balanced with knowledge of its lower fixation stability. Both techniques, however, have been found to be relatively equivalent in their joint stabilization effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513493764">2</xref></sup> That said, the Congruent-Arc technique does allow significantly greater anterior joint translation before reaching a stable endpoint, indicating its beneficial ability to reconstruct a larger glenoid articular defect.</p>
<p>We would again like to thank Drs Burkhart and DeBeer for advancing science on complex shoulder instability and continuing an important discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of these two Latarjet techniques.</p>
