<abstract>
<p>Domestic minor sex trafficking is a complex form of oppression and child maltreatment affecting children and adolescents on both the domestic and transnational levels. In the United States, the statistical account of minors who are affected by commercial sex trafficking varies because of the hidden nature of this criminal activity. Symptoms of trauma can result from such factors as forced subjugation, separation from family, and sexual acts with multiple perpetrators. Treatment relevant to this population is necessary for posttrafficking adaptation to society. In this article, we discuss the possible effects of domestic minor sex trafficking, implications for intervention, and directions for future research.</p>

<body>
<p>Human trafficking, also referred to as <italic>modern-day slavery</italic>, has been perceived as a practice limited to Third World countries. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886109912475172">United Nations Children’s Fund (n.d.)</xref>, each year approximately 2 million children are sexually exploited globally. Statistics further show that sex trafficking of minors is occurring within the borders of the United States with females at a significant risk. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd (2011</xref>) noted that the number of annual U.S. occurrences of exploitation range from 200,000 to 300,000, with her New York City based nonprofit agency, Girls Educational and Mentoring Services, seeing 200–300 female victims annually. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475172">Estes and Weiner (2001</xref>) reported that approximately 244,000–325,000 youths in the United States are at risk for commercial sexual exploitation and that an estimated 199,000 incidents of sexual exploitation of minors occur in the United States annually. Consequently, the estimated number of occurrences and youths who are at risk for sexual exploitation calls for the training of mental health professionals to provide appropriate services. This article provides information that we gained from the professional literature to enhance the competence of mental health professionals with domestic minor sex trafficking, identify the barriers to service, and highlight specific mental health needs of survivors of sex trafficking.</p>
<sec id="section1-0886109912475172">
<title>Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking</title>
<p>In 2000, the U.S. Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), which defined and classified trafficking into two categories: sex and labor trafficking:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>(a) Sex trafficking is when a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age or</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) The recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. (22 U.S.C. § 7101)</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>As was noted by the TVPA (2000), the following definitions further clarify pertinent terms. First, <italic>force</italic> is defined as rape, beatings, constraint, or confinement. Second, <italic>fraud</italic> includes false and deceptive offers of employment, marriage, or a better life. Third, <italic>coercion</italic> includes the threats of serious harm to, or the physical restraint of, any person; any scheme, plan, or failure to perform an act that would result in restraint against them; or the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process. To expand the TVPA, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 was implemented to enhance antitrafficking efforts. This act outlines enhanced methods to confront trafficking in the United States. For example, Section 212 requires:
<disp-quote>
<p>(1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services, upon credible information that a child has been a trafficking victim, to provide 90-day interim assistance to the child and determine eligibility for long-term assistance; (2) federal and state and local officials to notify the Secretary within 24 hours of learning of such a child; and (3) the Secretary and the Attorney General to provide appropriate training for state and local officials.</p>
</disp-quote>Although there are programs that respond to the needs of survivors of sex trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475172">Kalergis, 2009</xref>), they remain limited because providers are not aware of this form of victimization although it is defined in the TVPA.</p>
<p><italic>Human trafficking</italic> is an umbrella term that is used to capture various facets of this crime (sex and labor). Therefore, the TVPA presents the concept of the commercial sexual exploitation of children to transition away from terms, such as <italic>juvenile prostitution</italic>, when referring to child victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475172">Williamson &amp; Prior, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475172">Rand (2009</xref>) noted that such terminology leads to misconceptions about this population as prostitutes rather than as victims. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475172">Shared Hope International (2009</xref>, p. 4) defined domestic minor sex trafficking as “the commercial sexual exploitation of American children within U.S. borders.” Furthermore, because of the age of the minor, evidence of force, fraud, and coercion is not required regarding the victim’s actions. The forms of psychological and physical manipulation that are imposed by the trafficker are recognized by the law as methods of power and control over the minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475172">Shared Hope International, 2009</xref>). The identification of persons aged 18 or younger as victims, regardless of whether force, fraud, or coercion were used in recruitment, is a productive step toward combating perceptions of minors as willing participants in their own exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Sex traffickers, or pimps, can be either male or female and are defined as persons who profit by receiving cash or other benefits in exchange for the sexual use of a minor by another person. The persons who are identified as traffickers can include family members of the victim, entrepreneurs, peers or friends, and delinquents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886109912475172">Agustin, 2001</xref>), thus exceeding the characterized media image of a pimp or organized criminal network. Pimp-controlled commercial sexual exploitation of children has a direct link to escort and massage services, pornography, live sex shows, nude dancing, stripping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475172">Reid, 2011</xref>), and drinking and photographic clubs, as well as such major events as sporting, cultural, and convention occasions that involve tourism and nonlocal visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475172">Estes &amp; Weiner, 2001</xref>). The minors are transported throughout the United States by various methods, including cars and airplanes, and are often provided with false identification documents in the event of arrest. In addition, under federal law, trafficking does not require physical transportation of the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475172">Shared Hope International, 2009</xref>) but can happen within the community of residence.</p>

<title>Psychological Impact of Sex Trafficking</title>
<p>It is important for mental health providers to gain a further understanding of the impact of domestic minor sex trafficking on youths. The child and adolescent population constitutes the most vulnerable group in the United States for becoming subject to sex trafficking, and most women in prostitution actually entered as minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475172">Kotrla, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 70–90% of female victims of trafficking were sexually abused before they are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475172">Williamson and Prior (2009</xref>, p. 1) noted, exact statistics of occurrence “are elusive” because of the criminal nature of this industry. The geographic impact (i.e., transporting) within this crime affects the ability to conduct accurate statistical measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886109912475172">Clawson, Layne, &amp; Small, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475172">Shared Hope International (2009</xref>) reported that 12–14 is the average age of a minor’s initial entry into sexual exploitation, which is a target population for sex traffickers, but some minors enter as early as age 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475172">Rand, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Various factors place female minors at an increased risk for sex trafficking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886109912475172">Soroptimist International of the Americas (2008</xref>), an international organization focused on the life improvement of females, noted that approximately 79% of adult and minor female victims of human trafficking have been forced into sex trafficking. Furthermore, a significant factor that perpetuates this crime is the undervaluing and sexualization of females. The sexualization of girls contributes to the negative societal perceptions of females as objects for sexual use. Reportedly, these social constructions of female sexuality contribute to sexual harassment, the “increased demand for child pornography” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886109912475172">American Psychological Association Task Force, 2007</xref>, p. 4); foster sexual violence or abuse “of up to 15%–25% of women and children” and instigate sex trafficking of minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886109912475172">Egan &amp; Hawkes, 2008</xref>, p. 296). Further risk factors include a poverty-stricken socioeconomic status; a history of physical and/or sexual abuse; deficiencies in social skills; deviant behavior; involvement in gangs; low educational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886109912475172">Twill, Green, &amp; Traylor, 2010</xref>); ineffective city systems; public policy that places blame on victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>); familial dysfunction, such as domestic violence or substance abuse; and the mental illness of caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886109912475172">Reid, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475172">Williamson &amp; Prior, 2009</xref>). A runaway or throwaway status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886109912475172">Mitchell, Finkelhor, &amp; Wolak, 2010</xref>) places children at an increased risk; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886109912475172">Estes and Weiner (2001</xref>) reported that approximately 75% of girls with runaway status and who are sexually exploited are under the control of pimps. Familial collaboration with traffickers and a general lack of familial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>) contribute to the increased risk, as does residence in a vulnerable geographic location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>) affected by a high crime rate and legal corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886109912475172">Salvation Army, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Survivors of sex trafficking have many similarities with survivors of other violent crimes, such as rape, domestic violence, and political oppression. However, the ongoing dynamics of captivity and isolation that are associated with trafficking create a unique set of needs for this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475172">Palmer, 2010</xref>). According to a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475172">Williamson and Prior (2009</xref>), minors may have been recruited into domestic minor sex trafficking in various ways, including “girls, women, young men, and older men” (p. 4) approaching them in various locations, such as malls, corner stores, and their own residences. Furthermore, the trafficker may either be known or unknown to the minor. Williamson and Prior also noted that coercion takes place in various ways, such as the minor dating someone who presents himself as genuinely interested yet has the underlying motive of trafficking. Through manipulation, the trafficker may respond to the emotional needs of the minor or use force, such as beatings, that can result in subjugation. Traffickers also recognize the victim’s natural desire for love, protection, and family, thus using this desire as a source of manipulation. Once the victim is initially drawn by manipulative tactics, more direct forms of coercion and manipulation are applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In certain cases, a significant need is to help survivors break the “trauma bond” they feel with their captors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475172">Kalergis, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475172">Palmer (2010</xref>) noted that a survivor may feel compelled to protect the person who has inflicted the trauma. This trauma bond is often accomplished through dissociative mechanisms and requires that the various components of the survivor’s personality be reintegrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475172">Herman, 1992</xref>). The trauma bond is also referred to as the <italic>Stockholm syndrome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886109912475172">Carnes, 1997</xref>), which is perceived as a psychological response in which hostages become attached to the perpetrators. This attachment can result in the victim supporting the perpetrator when he or she is prosecuted. According to Graham (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>), those who are most susceptible to the Stockholm syndrome are those who perceive a threat to survival and believe that the captor is capable of acting on that threat, perceive the captor to be providing small kindnesses, are isolated from the perspectives of others, and perceive an inability to escape. Persons who experience the Stockholm syndrome may present with a dysfunctional attachment with the trafficker that occurs in the presence of danger, shame, exploitation, seduction, deception, or betrayal.</p>
<p>The implementation of trauma-informed care methods that are relevant to survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking is critical for mental health providers. To inform this practice, the evaluation of findings regarding psychological trauma is needed. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475172">Clawson, Dutch, and Williamson (2008</xref>), the primary mental health diagnoses resulting from human trafficking that have been noted in previous research include mood and anxiety disorders, dissociative disorders, and substance-related disorders. Additional factors that have been commonly noted for survivors include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, antisocial personality traits, and impulse control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886109912475172">Williamson, Dutch, &amp; Clawson, 2008</xref>). A factor referred to as <italic>complex trauma</italic> is receiving increased attention from mental health providers. Complex trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475172">Herman, 1992</xref>) or complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), results in a different form of complexity than PTSD because of the “repeated” and “prolonged” traumatic events experienced while in captivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886109912475172">Cloitre et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Complex trauma can be a result of events that include entrapment; relocation; exposure to the abuse of others; and extended physical, sexual, and psychological abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475172">Courtois, 2008</xref>). These factors are consistent with domestic minor sex trafficking and are distinguishable from maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>). Children and adolescents are neither psychologically nor emotionally equipped to respond to repeated traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475172">Courtois, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886109912475172">Lillywhite &amp; Skidmore, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd (2011</xref>), trafficking victims often develop a significantly altered or damaged, worldview. The psychologically manipulative tactics used by traffickers destroy “the physical and psychological defenses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>, p. 14) of minors and inhibit their ability to escape.</p>
<p>Suicidal ideations can result from prolonged traumatic events and require constant monitoring. Previous research showed an ongoing threat of suicidality among persons who have experienced prolonged abuse, particularly when the traumatic origins of their depression have not received appropriate intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475172">Herman, 1992</xref>). Recognition of inherent worth can be difficult because the person perceives herself as a criminal rather than as a victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475172">Kalergis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475172">Kotrla, 2010</xref>). This self-perception contributes to a decreased sense of empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475172">Herman, 1992</xref>). A related issue is the need to build relationships and support networks. Many survivors have been affected by extended periods of distrustfulness, which preclude the development of relationship-building skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475172">Courtois, 2008</xref>). Victims have a significant need to develop a sense of belonging and connection. Developing such a connection is most successfully accomplished through available individuals in treatment programs, rather than the specific framework of programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0886109912475172">
<title>Implications for Treatment</title>
<p>Introduced March 16, 2011, The Domestic Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2011 (S. 596), was proposed to improve federal and state efforts to address domestic minor sex trafficking and to establish that a child aged 18 or younger who is charged with a prostitution offense is a minor victim of sex trafficking. The minor would avoid the criminal charge of prostitution and be considered the victim of a crime, rather than a defendant or juvenile delinquent. According to Bill S. 596, which is still in committee, these children will require a comprehensive framework of specialized treatment and mental health counseling that addresses posttraumatic stress, depression, and sexual exploitation. Services are to include case management; mental health counseling, including specialized counseling and substance abuse treatment. Yet, current systems (e.g., foster care) are not adequately equipped with specialized services for such complex issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886109912475172">International Organization for Adolescents and the Center for the Human Rights for Children (2011)</xref>, several direct service providers lack awareness of state and federal antihuman trafficking legislation, as well as governmental and nongovernmental resources that are available for survivors of trafficking. This lack of awareness contributes to misidentification and limited preparedness in response to the needs of victims.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886109912475172">Shared Hope International (2009</xref>) noted that misidentification is a major barrier to the rescue, response, and provision of services. Misidentification contributes to negative outcomes and the failure to deliver necessary services. Furthermore, the stigma related to the sex trade affects the victim’s reintegration into the community, in spite of forced subjugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886109912475172">Herman, 1992</xref>). Negative labeling, such as “former prostitute,” affects successful reintegration into the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475172">Palmer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886109912475172">Simkhada, 2008</xref>). Terms used within the legal system (<italic>throwaways,</italic> <italic>prostitutes,</italic> and <italic>trash</italic>) require the replacement with the accurate terminology of <italic>commercially sexually exploited children</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>). Also, the criminalization of the minor contributes to the use of deceptive tactics to avoid delinquency, prostitution, and drug-related charges.</p>
<p>Additional barriers to service stem from the methods that are used to enslave individuals. It is common for traffickers to use narcotics as a means of inducing cooperation from the victim of trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886109912475172">Hoang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886109912475172">Palmer, 2010</xref>), which can contribute to the development of substance use disorders. The trauma of sex trafficking requires a range of appropriate interventions to promote empowerment and address the dynamics of trauma. Therefore, the following considerations for assessment and treatment planning are suggested to address gaps in the delivery of services.</p>
<sec id="section4-0886109912475172">
<title>Assessment and Treatment Planning Considerations</title>
<p>The dynamics of trafficking are complex with an intersection of factors, including familial dysfunctions, socioeconomic status, and the sexualization of females. Given the descriptive statistics and functional definitions of domestic minor sex trafficking, the need for specialized services is critical. When engaging with a survivor of domestic minor sex trafficking, the direct service provider must realize the impact of trafficking on the individual’s perspective of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886109912475172">International Organization for Migration, 2007</xref>). The history of psychological abuse and the trafficker’s portrayal of legal officials and service providers in a mistrustful manner can be obstacles to the building of a therapeutic relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886109912475172">U.S. Department of Justice (2010</xref>), services should be victim centered, promoting factors that include empowerment, community, safety, and comprehensive aspects (e.g., medical, psychological, life skills, and vocational). As a result, a precursor to implementing services is a comprehensive evaluation of the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886109912475172">Williamson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The consideration of complex PTSD when conducting a comprehensive evaluation is an important component. This factor can be compounded by the presence of alcohol and substance use disorders. A framework to guide the assessment process is the screening questions developed by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886109912475172">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008)</xref> through the campaign to rescue and restore victims of human trafficking. The screening questions explore such topics as the level of self-determination, medical care, and use of forceful tactics. Some questions include, Can you leave your job or situation if you want? Have you ever been deprived of food, water, sleep, or medical care? Have you been threatened if you tried to leave? and Has your identification or documentation been taken from you?</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886109912475172">Polaris Project (2011</xref>) provided a comprehensive assessment measure, ranging from safety to trafficking experiences, to evaluate the needs of individuals. Such criteria include the location in which to assess the potential victim, awareness that the individual may not self-identify as a victim of human trafficking, and an exploration of safety dynamics. The Polaris Project also included assessment questions to measure the components of force, fraud, and coercion, such as Did someone control, supervise, or monitor your work and your actions? How did you meet this person or find out about your job? and Did you ever feel that if you left the situation, your life would become more difficult? In addition, assessment items that are focused specifically on sex trafficking include How did you meet your [boyfriend/pimp/controller]? Did the controller have a nickname, street name, or alias? and Did the controller move you around to different locations? If so, how did you travel? How often?</p>
<p>The International Organization for Adolescents partnered with the Center for the Human Rights for Children at Loyola University Chicago to publish an overview of the <italic>Building Child Welfare Response to Child Trafficking Handbook</italic> (2011). The goal of this project is to inform child welfare agencies in Illinois and throughout the United States about methods of responding to the needs of minors who were sex trafficked. While misidentification and the lack of adequate training of service providers are barriers when a minor enters the state child welfare system, it is critical for agencies to integrate a protocol that promotes specialized assessment and the coordination of services. This document supports the training of direct service providers through the use of legal terminology, analyses of case studies, and checklists of indicators. These factors aid the provider in identifying and investigating sex trafficking cases. Next, considerations for the initial interview are noted, such as using open-ended questions, conducting the initial interview over several sessions, and avoiding identifying the minor as a victim. The handbook further includes rapid assessment tools and case management resources. Although child welfare agencies are required to provide services to child trafficking victims, preparation is inadequate, resulting in systemic gaps. As a result, the implementation of educational training to enhance efficiency within the child welfare system is critical.</p>
<p>The integration of screening questions specific to domestic minor sex trafficking that assess for victimization and trauma aids in the implementation of appropriate intervention strategies. Reportedly, females are likely to engage various service systems in response to both trauma based and other types of needs. Therefore, the use of trauma-informed services can enhance the identification of victims and responses to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886109912475172">Clawson, Salomon, &amp; Grace, 2008</xref>). Trauma-informed services integrate an understanding of the impact of violence and victimization on the female’s development into the structural system of the agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475172">Clawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475172">Elliot, Bjelajac, Fallot, Markoff, &amp; Reed, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475172">Macy &amp; Johns, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475172">Elliot, Bjelajac, Fallot, Markoff, and Reed (2005</xref>, p. 462) noted that the lack of understanding of “the impact of trauma on a woman’s life is … the equivalent of denying the existence and significance of trauma in women’s lives.”</p>
<p>Trauma-informed strategies were initially developed within mental health and substance abuse contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886109912475172">Macy &amp; Johns, 2011</xref>) but lack research evaluation with survivors of sex trafficking. Yet, because of the systemic configuration based on the premise of the impact of trauma on the victim, this presents as a promising treatment strategy. Because of the victimization of minors through domestic minor sex trafficking, intervention efforts that promote empowerment methods are critical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475172">Elliot et al. (2005</xref>) highlighted several principles that are pertinent to trauma-informed services with female survivors, including understanding the impact of violence and victimization on the client’s development, noting the process of recovery from trauma as a primary goal, implementing an empowerment model, highlighting the client’s right to self-determination in her recovery process, emphasizing the client’s strength and resilience, recognizing the cultural uniqueness of each client, and consistently involving the client in a collaborative relationship and in the development and evaluation of services.</p>
<p>Trauma-based therapeutic approaches that have shown evidence-based effectiveness with such diagnoses as PTSD or a history of child sexual abuse include cognitive-behavioral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886109912475172">Clawson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886109912475172">Deblinger, Mannarino, Cohen, Runyon, &amp; Steer, 2011</xref>), dialectical behavioral therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475172">Kotrla, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886109912475172">Courtois (2008</xref>) advised that these methods should be implemented in a manner that avoids retraumatizing the client. It is important to avoid replicating factors that are representative of the “trafficking situation” that could result in retraumatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886109912475172">U.S. Department of Justice, 2010</xref>). The integration of trauma-informed care promotes a consistency of response throughout the service agency to the client’s recovery process and decreases the occurrence of retraumatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886109912475172">Elliot et al., 2005</xref>). The assessment of the extent of the original trauma must be made judiciously during the initial interview process as the treatment plan is developed.</p>
<p>The implementation of mental health services includes the development of goals in response to the various systemic components of the individual’s life. As a result, a focus on such aspects as basic living skills and decision making, physical and biological health management, and educational and career decision making are important for assessment and intervention. The awareness and development of basic living skills (e.g., literacy training, financial management, health awareness) is a significant need of survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking. Even basic necessities, such as housing, health care, food, and clothing, must be assessed when considering the needs of survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475172">Kotrla, 2010</xref>). The need for food, clothing, and shelter are three of the primary barriers to victims leaving their circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>). Shelters should provide a haven for the individual to transition from the traumatic experience to reintegration into society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886109912475172">U.S. Department of Justice, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the shelter should not be an environment (i.e., a juvenile detention center) that reflects the traumatic experience (e.g., the loss of freedom).</p>
<p>Child sexual exploitation exposes females to several health risks, including the effects of living in inhumane settings, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and the effects of pregnancy and unsafe abortions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886109912475172">Stotts &amp; Ramey, 2009</xref>). On the basis of the biological risks associated with sex trafficking, it is important to conduct a referral for a medical assessment to identify any medical issues (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases and the effects of unsafe and multiple abortions) that affect mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886109912475172">Maxmen, Ward, &amp; Kilgus, 2009</xref>) of the minor.</p>
<p>The average age of a minor’s first involvement in sexual exploitation is 12–14, while some are forced into sex trafficking as early as age 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886109912475172">Lloyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886109912475172">Rand, 2009</xref>). Thus, many children are enslaved before they have had any opportunity for a formal education. The development of career-related skills is needed because the limited opportunities afforded minors have been affected by trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886109912475172">Rafferty, 2008</xref>). In turn, factors, such as developmental delays, may impede the future economic prospects in which the individuals can engage. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475172">Kalergis (2009</xref>) noted that the ability to perform job skills to pursue gainful employment is necessary. Therefore, career counseling is a method that should be integrated into modes of intervention. Career counseling can be of significant assistance in the posttrafficking community reintegration process. Previous research also reported the need for mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886109912475172">Kalergis, 2009</xref>). The support of a mentor to aid in navigating such complex systems as court and medical appointments can contribute to empowerment and enhance self-sufficiency. Consideration of these psychosocial stressors resulting from domestic minor sex trafficking can have an impact on the mental health of the minor and societal reintegration. Therefore, these are important aspects for treatment planning.</p>
<p>Recent studies have provided insights into the dynamics of sex trafficking among females, and these dynamics must be translated into professional practice. A treatment plan is guided by information that is gained through the initial assessment. Therefore, it is important for mental health professionals to integrate criteria that are specific to domestic minor sex trafficking that are relevant for the provision of services. On the basis of the foregoing information regarding practice implications, the following outline summarizes considerations for service providers. Each recommendation should be considered on the basis of the specific needs and current level of functioning of each client. The recommendations include (1) ensuring that a victim-centered approach guides the comprehensive assessment (e.g., risk of suicide, medical, comorbid diagnoses, spirituality) and treatment planning; (2) integrating screening items to assess the risk for indicators of domestic minor sex trafficking; (3) using terminology that decriminalizes the victims; (4) using open-ended questions and conducting the assessment over multiple sessions; (5) implementing trauma-focused strategies and therapy methods; (6) decreasing the risk of retraumatization by ensuring that the intervention methods and residential location do not reflect the trafficking experience; (7) integrating goals that respond to the health risks of sex trafficking (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases); and (8) including goals that promote empowerment, self-worth, and daily life decision making.</p>

<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>As we reviewed the professional literature for this article, productive information addressing best assessment practices and instruments for use with survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking became evident. The development of a standard assessment battery, with sensitivity to the dynamics of complex trauma among survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking, is recommended. The development of assessment standards and programs requires evaluative methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886109912475172">Kotrla (2010</xref>) identified four programs in the United States (Girls Education and Mentoring Services’ Transition to Independent Living Program in New York City; Standing Against Global Exploitation Safe House in San Francisco; Children of the Night in Van Nuys, California; and Angela’s House in Georgia) whose aim is to provide care for victims of domestic minor sex trafficking and called for an analysis of these programs. Thus, a program evaluation of each curriculum and agency could reveal valuable information for the construction of additional programs. Future programs can build on the “best practices” identified through qualitative research.</p>
<p>Further study to inform clinical practice about the relationship between risk factors and sexual exploitation is needed. Such information would enhance the professional knowledge base and contribute to preventive efforts. As is noted throughout the literature, accurate statistics “are elusive” because of the criminal factors underlying trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886109912475172">Williamson &amp; Prior, 2009</xref>, p. 1). Therefore, it is important to enhance data-collection procedures to gain a better understanding of the demographics of the survivors of domestic minor sex trafficking and traffickers, as well as modes of entry into trafficking.</p>
<p>As we noted earlier, several direct service providers lack knowledge of state and federal legislation on antihuman trafficking. It is critical to create training programs that enhance knowledge of laws, resources available for victims, and applications of theoretical methods. As a result, research is needed to evaluate the integration of laws and how this integration affects the assessment process and treatment planning.</p>
<p>In summary, domestic minor sex trafficking is a severe form of child maltreatment in which the average age of entry ranges from 12 to 14. Risk factors, including physical or sexual abuse, familial dysfunction, poverty status, and social deficiencies, can increase a minor’s susceptibility to the methods of enticement that sex traffickers use for recruitment. The effects of domestic minor sex trafficking can result in psychological trauma, including complex PTSD; major depressive disorder; and substance abuse among female survivors. Therefore, such effects require knowledge building among mental health professionals to respond to the diverse needs of this population. As a result, further research is needed to inform practice on such matters as modes of entry into domestic minor sex trafficking, psychological effects, the evaluation of interventions, and factors related to diversity.</p>
