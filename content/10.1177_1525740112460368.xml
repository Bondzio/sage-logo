<abstract>
<p>The current study compares the productivity (number of responses) and the typical responses to taxonomic and slot-filler prompts in 39 African American children from low-income backgrounds and a diverse group of 21 children from middle-income backgrounds. The authors tested the hypothesis that socioeconomic status would exert a global influence on productivity and typicality responses such that children from middle-income environments would generate higher productivity rates and more sophisticated typical responses. They found support for this hypothesis only in categories that appear to be related to exposure to formal contexts. Several categories that reflect basic life experiences displayed similar rates of productivity and typical responses across socioeconomic groups. Findings from this study have implications for the assessment of semantic knowledge in elementary-school-age children from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds.</p>

<p>Reciprocal relations between children’s semantic knowledge and reading comprehension during the elementary school years have been well documented. Greater semantic knowledge leads to better reading comprehension and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740112460368">Beck &amp; McKeown, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740112460368">Scarborough, 2005</xref>). Given these relations, studying the semantic development of young children living in poverty is important because they are less frequently exposed to advanced language and often enter school knowing drastically fewer words than children raised in middle- and upper-class homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740112460368">Hart &amp; Risley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740112460368">White, Graves, &amp; Slater, 1990</xref>). These developmental trajectories are set early and are difficult to change, placing many children from low-income environments at risk for later reading disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740112460368">Hart &amp; Risley, 1995</xref>). Thus, we need to not only understand which kinds of semantic knowledge children bring to the task of learning how to read but also consider what factors contribute to variation in children’s semantic knowledge.</p>
<p>Researchers have used <italic>category production tasks</italic>, also known as semantic fluency tasks, to expressively measure children’s conceptual and semantic organization. On these tasks, children are presented orally with a category (e.g., fruits) and asked to provide as many related words as they can think of (e.g., <italic>apple, orange, healthy, dessert</italic>, etc.). Exemplars that are produced in response to a category prompt are thought to index children’s event schemas. These event schemas develop according to children’s interaction with their environment, including their dialogue with adults.</p>
<p>Some researchers contend that children as young as 3 years have a preference toward slot-filler or schematic categories. <italic>Slot-filler representations</italic> maintain the temporal order and functional and spatial relations among parts of everyday life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740112460368">Lucariello, Kyratzis, &amp; Nelson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740112460368">Riva, Nichelli, &amp; Devoti, 2000</xref>). For example, to younger children, <italic>boot</italic> is a slot filler to the category <italic>clothing that is worn outside</italic>. These items are grouped together in memory because they are grouped together in everyday life. As children get older, their preference for slot-filler categories shifts toward <italic>taxonomic or hierarchical categories</italic> (Lucariello et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740112460368">Mpofu &amp; Vijver, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740112460368">Nelson, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson &amp; Nelson, 1990</xref>). Representations that are organized taxonomically are stored based on perceptual commonalities among the objects being represented rather than temporal or spatial characteristics. In other words, taxonomic categories are based exclusively on objects or terms that share meaning. For instance, when presented with the category <italic>shoe</italic>, older children may say <italic>slipper</italic> or <italic>tennis shoe</italic>. These items may be grouped together in memory because they represent objects that are inanimate and can share the same general shape.</p>
<p>Although the developmental preference toward slot-filler categories has been replicated, it does not appear to be universal in Western cultures. Researchers have observed children from different experiential backgrounds to demonstrate this preference at relatively similar ages. For instance, in a study with children from low socioeconomic (LSES) backgrounds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson and Nelson (1990)</xref> found that kindergarteners provided the same amount of exemplars when prompted with slot-filler and taxonomic category labels, whereas second graders provided more exemplars to taxonomic than to slot-filler category labels. This pattern has been replicated for bilingual Spanish-speaking children in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena, Bedore, &amp; Zlatic-Giunta, 2002</xref>). In contrast, several researchers have not found any differences in the ability to categorize on the basis of slot-filler and taxonomic relations in 6- to 8-year-old children when the task was implicit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525740112460368">Blewitt &amp; Toppino, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740112460368">Hashimoto, McGregor, &amp; Graham, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, researchers have also found that the quantity of exemplars produced and the organization of exemplars within taxonomic and slot-filler prompts can vary by external factors, such as SES. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740112460368">Bjorklund and Weiss (1985)</xref> demonstrated that upper SES kindergarten and first graders produced more taxonomic clusters for items on a free recall list than did lower SES children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740112460368">Crowe and Prescott (2003)</xref> found evidence that children in the United Kingdom from the lower-middle and upper-middle classes organize the <italic>animal</italic> category according to the environments in which they are encountered. These environments include the <italic>home, zoo</italic>, and <italic>farm</italic>. This experiential ordering is consistent across children ages of 5 through 10 years. Older children show more sophistication in their categories, such that they are able to produce more <italic>nonmammals</italic> and <italic>invertebrates</italic> then <italic>mammals</italic> compared to younger children.</p>
<p>Findings from studies employing category production tasks are somewhat different in non-Western cultures. For instance, the preference toward slot-filler categories does not appear to extend to groups who differ by their socioeconomic status. Mpofu (2002) found that 7- to 11-year-old children who varied by levels of SES did not show differences in their slot-filler category performance. However, as in Western cultures, studies involving children from non-Western cultures have also observed SES differences in the quantity of category productions. For instance, Mpofu also found that children from higher SES backgrounds provided significantly more taxonomic category responses than children from LSES backgrounds. This pattern has also been replicated among Korean children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740112460368">Yu &amp; Nelson, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>The ordering of members within categories has also received considerable attention. It is hypothesized that the order of response to a category prompt reflects one’s underlying conceptual structure. This assumption follows from studies that have demonstrated that items named together are related in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740112460368">Neely, 1991</xref>). Order of responses reflects the relative proximity of items in memory, with first or <italic>typical</italic> responses being most salient in memory. Because categories are assumed to be organized around the most typical members, more typical members are thought to be named first in category production tasks. In contrast, items named toward the end of a list are <italic>atypical</italic> and do not share the same features or characteristics as earlier named items. Moreover, more typical members are generally learned before atypical members of groups. Researchers have not observed a consistent pattern of developmental change in <italic>typical</italic> responses. Some studies have reported a difference in <italic>typical</italic> responses between ages 6 and 8 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740112460368">Nelson, 1974</xref>), whereas others have shown no difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740112460368">Crowe &amp; Prescott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740112460368">Lucariello et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Certain vocabulary items are more or less typical for children, depending on their culture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena et al. (2002)</xref> demonstrated that the category itself influences whether taxonomic or slot-filler organization is preferred and that the nature of the preference is largely experiential. Certain categories like <italic>animals</italic> elicited more exemplars compared to <italic>food</italic> and <italic>clothing</italic> in English–Spanish bilingual 4- to 7-year-old children. When the category referred to <italic>animals</italic>, bilingual children provided more exemplars in response to a taxonomic category prompt than in response to a slot-filler category prompt. The researchers also noted that children produced fewer items in the slot-filler category <italic>zoo animals</italic> than the taxonomic category <italic>animals</italic>, when children were not exposed to a particular event like going to the zoo. This finding suggests two important characteristics of semantic memory organization: (a) event exposure realized in personal experiences shapes stored events in memory and (b) the amount of words known or that exists in a child’s vocabulary influence whether these words are organized taxonomically or not.</p>
<p>In sum, taxonomic categories aid children in organizing and accessing multiple scripts. These scripts allow children to organize the vocabulary they gain across languages and cultures accurately and efficiently. Moreover, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic factors appear to influence the type, amount, and order of category responses produced by children.</p>

<title>Semantic Development of African American Children From Low-Income Backgrounds</title>
<p>Relatively little is known about the semantic and conceptual development of African American children. Despite the heterogeneous nature of the U.S. African American population, African American children tend to experience poorer academic achievement outcomes than White children. These so-called achievement gaps exist on school entry, persist through high school, and are complicated by associated factors such as language, SES, and school context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740112460368">Entwisle, Alexander, &amp; Olson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525740112460368">Fryer &amp; Levitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740112460368">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In the United States, poor African American children tend to enter elementary school with smaller vocabularies than poor White children and children from higher SES backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740112460368">Champion, Hyter, McCabe, &amp; Bland- Stewart, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525740112460368">Duncan &amp; Magnuson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740112460368">Farkas &amp; Bergon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740112460368">Hart &amp; Risley, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740112460368">White et al. (1990)</xref> reported differences in reading vocabulary favoring children from upper-income homes. First grade children from middle- and upper-income environments often enter school knowing approximately twice as many words as their lower-income peers. Although SES differences are implicated in these findings, variation in children’s semantic knowledge cannot be explained fully by SES. In addition to language or linguistic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740112460368">Craig &amp; Washington, 2006</xref>), some researchers have suggested that standardized measures of vocabulary knowledge may not capture all that African American children know about words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740112460368">Champion et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525740112460368">Pence, Bojczyk, &amp; Williams, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740112460368">Qi, Kaiser, Milan, &amp; Hancock, 2006</xref>). Discussing this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740112460368">Pena (2001)</xref> suggested that African American children’s apparent low vocabulary skills may result from a disconnect among performance on one-word receptive picture vocabulary tests, their conceptual knowledge, the links they have formed between these concepts, and the knowledge they have on the multiple meanings that words can convey.</p>
<p>It seems plausible that a category production paradigm would be useful in investigations of African American children’s semantic development because the tasks appear to be sensitive to race, schooling, SES, and language differences among young children. There is evidence that even when there are vocabulary size differences (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740112460368">Hashimoto et al., 2007</xref>) there children demonstrate the ability to categorize using both slot-filler and taxonomic relations. Moreover, performance on a category production task has the potential to replicate previous findings related to vocabulary size differences between children from LSES and middle socioeconomic (MSES) backgrounds but also extend the literature by demonstrating similarities or universal patterns in semantic organization. LSES performance on the category production task also allows one to characterize their semantic knowledge in terms of size (the number of entries per category) and typicality (similarity of prototypes), which is not possible on standardized receptive vocabulary protocols.</p>

<sec id="section2-1525740112460368">
<title>Purpose of the Study</title>
<p>The current study extended previous literature on cultural and linguistic differences in semantic category organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, we investigated whether African American children from LSES and children from MSES backgrounds differed in their semantic category productivity and organizational strategies and, if so, whether differences were related to the category prompts used. We hypothesized that to the extent that SES globally influences category productivity and typicality we would observe higher productivity (number of responses given to a category prompt) and more typical exemplars in MSES children. It was also hypothesized that experiential differences would be maximized on taxonomic categories because this type of category production requires a greater sophistication of semantic knowledge. To address this hypothesis, we examined, both between and within SES groups, the number of responses children provided to slot-filler and taxonomic categories as well as the order of responses.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1525740112460368">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants volunteered as part of a larger ongoing study related to language and literacy in a large urban city in the U.S. Southeast. Children were included if they were administered the oral vocabulary test that was relevant to the current study. This excluded 10 participants from the larger study. Two groups of children enrolled in elementary school were recruited to participate in this study. Parental consent and child (both verbal and written) assent were gathered for each participant according to the guidelines set forth by the institutional review board of the research institution and the governing body of the parochial school. Group SES was determined by average household income level of the neighborhoods or parishes associated with the schools represented by the participants in this study. This information was obtained from publicly available records for each school. Lunch status is a common indicator of SES because only families with low household incomes are qualified to participate in the programs.</p>
<p>A total of 39 African American children (67% female) constituted the LSES group. These students attended one of nine public elementary schools in a large metropolitan area in the Southeast. All of the schools were in high-poverty neighborhoods. The average median household income level was $24,147 (<italic>SD</italic> = $4,668). The mean age of the LSES group was 6 years 2 months (range = 5, 8 to 6, 8). Assessment occurred during the late spring of the academic year.</p>
<p>The MSES group consisted of a diverse group of 21 children (67% female) from middle-income backgrounds. Children in the MSES group attended one private parochial school in the same large metropolitan area in the Southeast and were included in this study as a comparison group. The MSES group was racially diverse and included African American (55%) and White (35%), Asian American (10%) children. The mean age of the MSES group was 7 years 0 months (range = 5, 4 to 8, 4). The average income level was $60,213. The average household size was fewer than three persons. Assessment occurred during the beginning of the fall of the academic year.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1525740112460368">
<title>Category production task</title>
<p>An experimental measure, <italic>KidCategories</italic>, was designed for this study. This category production task was based on the protocols used in previous research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson &amp; Nelson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena et al., 2002</xref>). Form A of <italic>KidCategories</italic> was the slot-filler condition, which included 39 prompts; Form B, the taxonomic condition, included 37 prompts. The order of prompts was randomized within each form to offset any effects that fatigue might have on the participant’s responses. All items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson and Nelson’s 1990</xref> study were retained. Taxonomic prompts from this study included <italic>animals, clothing</italic>, and <italic>food</italic>, whereas slot-filler prompts included <italic>animals found on a farm</italic> and <italic>zoo, clothing worn inside</italic> and <italic>outside</italic>, and <italic>food eaten for breakfast</italic> and <italic>lunch</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1525740112460368">
<title>Oral receptive vocabulary task</title>
<p>The <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition</italic> (PPVT-4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740112460368">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 2007</xref>) was included in this study both as a standardized measure of receptive vocabulary and as an index of breadth of vocabulary knowledge. Prompts from the PPVT-4 are administered in ascending difficulty across sets of 12 items each. Within an individual set, the prompts are arranged so that the first three prompts are the easiest, the last three are the second easiest, and the middle six are the most difficult. The PPVT-4 was administered and scored in standardized format according to test manual guidelines.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1525740112460368">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were tested by a trained team of three professors, three graduate students from the educational psychology program, and three psychology undergraduate students from the research institution. All team members had previous experience administering standardized language and literacy assessments. All research team members received the same training, which was conducted by the first and third authors. Each member of the research team was required to successfully test out of a training session by administering the assessments correctly to another team member. The tasks were all given in a quiet area of the schools at designated times, which spanned the entire school day. Whenever possible, the entire assessment battery was given in a single session. However, some of the youngest children in the study required an additional session to complete the task.</p>
<sec id="section9-1525740112460368">
<title>Kid categories</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Form A or Form B. The researcher introduced the task by saying,<disp-quote>
<p>Today I want to play a word game with you. You may not have played this game before so let me explain it to you. I am going to say the name of some THINGS. After I say a name, you tell me all of the things that you can think of that belong with that name. When you tell me the things that you think of I will be writing them down. When you finish, I will give you the name of something else. I may say TOOLS and you may think of hammers, pliers, screwdrivers, and lots of other things.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Then, the child was given two practice trials. The first practice trial was “toys,” and after the child responded, the researcher followed by saying, “Those are very good. You could probably have thought of ‘blocks, dolls, transformers, cars, trucks, balls, trains’” and other toys that the child did not mention.</p>
<p>The researchers began the trials by saying, “Ok. Now remember each time I tell you a word, you say all the things that you can think of that belong with the word I say. Try to name as many things as you can.” They followed by saying, “This is not a race, so speak clearly so that I can write down the words that you say. Let’s get started. Are you ready?” The researchers then read each of the names from a worksheet and recorded each response given by the participant verbatim. If the participant paused while responding, the researcher prompted the child by saying any of the following: “Can you think of any other ________?” “And?” “And what else?” “ Is there more?” “Yes,” “Uh-huh,” and “Mm-hmm.” Participants were prompted until they said “That’s it or I don’t know anymore.” Participants’ responses were recorded verbatim on an answer sheet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1525740112460368">
<title>Scoring kid categories</title>
<p>To obtain the score for a particular category, we counted the total number of generated words that were representative of each category. For slot-filler prompts the scores are an average of multiple categories (i.e., animals in the park or woods, animals in the zoo, etc.). All responses that were nonwords, repetitions, or unrelated by feature or function were not counted as representative and excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Receptive Vocabulary Performance</title>
<p>Replicating prior findings in the literature, the MSES group had larger vocabularies than the LSES group. LSES participants in the current study obtained a mean standard score of 94.95 (<italic>SD</italic> = 11.36) on the PPVT-4, whereas the MSES participants obtained a mean standard score of 110.87 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.97). The range of standard scores for LSES participants was 75–121. The range of standard scores for MSES was 93–131.

<title>Slot filler versus taxonomic</title>
<p>Composite scores were made for the major subcategorizations of <italic>slot-filler</italic> categories so that comparisons could be made between similar subcategorizations of <italic>taxonomic</italic> categories. We eliminated one outlier for the category <italic>food</italic>, a participant’s score of 45. The mean numbers of responses in each slot-filler and taxonomic category are displayed by group in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525740112460368">Table 1</xref>. Since our participants varied in age, age was entered as a covariate. Age did not have a significant effect and was not considered in any of the remaining analyses. Overall, children produced more exemplars to taxonomic (6.75 items) prompts than to slot-filler (4.73 items) prompts. A 2 (prompt: taxonomic vs. slot filler) × 3 (category: animals vs. food vs. clothing) analysis of variance revealed significant main effects of prompt, <italic>F</italic>(1, 267) = 16.979, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .06, and category, <italic>F</italic>(2, 267) = 7.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .05. Post hoc comparisons indicated that within the taxonomic prompts, the animal (8.70) and food categories (9.00) generated more responses than the clothing (5.57) category. There was no interaction.</p>

The exemplars of the category of <italic>clothing</italic> were similar in productivity and typicality when both taxonomic and slot-filler prompts were used. The advantage in productivity for <italic>food</italic> and <italic>animals</italic> is consistent with previous categorization research with 6- to 8-year-old children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson &amp; Nelson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740112460368">Yu &amp; Nelson, 1993</xref>). The nonemergence of a preference toward slot-filler categories in this sample is consistent with other findings that children can be trained to use taxonomic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740112460368">Deak &amp; Bauer, 1995</xref>). Formal instruction for both groups may have affected their ability to become flexible with taxonomic organization.</p>
<p>The traditional advantageous effects of exposure to middle income environments were demonstrated in the higher productivity and different typicality responses for 10 taxonomic prompts. These prompts included <italic>fruit, vegetables, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, soups, sauces, instruments, utensils</italic>, and <italic>jobs</italic>. For these categories the productivity rates are similar to older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740112460368">Crowe &amp; Prescott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740112460368">Nash &amp; Snowling, 2008</xref>) and children who have been exposed to formal academic training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson &amp; Nelson, 1990</xref>). The typical responses of MSES children are also consistent with typicality ratings in older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740112460368">Nelson, 1974</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740112460368">Heit &amp; Barsalou, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740112460368">Vallee-Tourangeau, Anthony, &amp; Austin, 1998</xref>). In contrast, the productivity rates for LSES children are similar to younger children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740112460368">Nelson, 1974</xref>). The typical responses of LSES children are consistent with typicality ratings in older children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740112460368">Nelson, 1974</xref>), atypical members of adult categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740112460368">Heit &amp; Barsalou, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740112460368">Vallee-Tourangeau et al., 1998</xref>). These patterns taken together suggest that MSES children have expanded their event schemas to incorporate broader structures that occur in natural language than have LSES children.</p>
<p>The rankings of productivity rates in the three widely studied taxonomic categories diverged somewhat from the previous literature with children in Western culture. MSES children displayed a pattern where <italic>food = animals, food = clothing</italic>, and <italic>animals</italic> &gt; <italic>clothing</italic>. LSES children displayed a pattern where <italic>food = animals</italic> &gt; <italic>clothing</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740112460368">Nelson and Nelson (1990)</xref> found that the <italic>food</italic> category produced the greatest quantity of responses across kindergarten and second grade children from low- to lower-middle-class backgrounds, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740112460368">Pena et al. (2002)</xref> observed a pattern in bilingual (64% received free or reduced-price lunch) where the greatest productivity was elicited by the <italic>animals</italic> taxonomic prompt. In addition, the productivity rates of these taxonomic and their corresponding slot-filler categories fell in between Nelson and Nelson’s study and Pena et al.’s study. However, the productivity to taxonomic prompts is similar to data from typically developing children in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740112460368">Crowe &amp; Prescott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740112460368">Nash &amp; Snowling, 2008</xref>). This pattern of productivity suggests that children 6–8 in Western cultures have equally formed concepts for <italic>food</italic> and <italic>animals</italic>. The pattern that fewer responses were generated by <italic>clothing</italic> could be accounted for by lack of exposure to exemplars in both groups. Both LSES and MSES participants in this study attended schools that required them to wear uniforms.</p>

<title>Universal Categories</title>
<p>Children bring a variety of language experiences that they acquired from their cultural environments into their elementary school classrooms. However, our data reflect commonalities among experiential contexts for LSES and MSES children’s development during primary grades. There was no difference in productivity for the following taxonomic categories: <italic>clothing, food, furniture, colors, insects, meats, drinks</italic>, and all slot-filler categories except <italic>animals in the park/woods</italic>. In addition, when given the prompts <italic>meats, drinks</italic>, and <italic>colors</italic>, LSES participants also produced identical first responses.</p>
<p>In response to slot-filler prompts, when LSES participants produced similar mean responses as the MSES children, they produced the different first responses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740112460368">Heit and Barsalou (1996)</xref> propose the instantiation principle for category learning. This principle states that category productions are influenced by an individual’s personalized experiences and events. The pattern of different typical exemplars of slot-filler categories is consistent with this viewpoint.</p>
<p>New findings regarding the similarity between well-formed and poorly formed categories emerged from this study. Both LSES and MSES participants had the greatest rates of productivity to <italic>colors, food</italic>, and <italic>animals</italic>. Both groups also produced the fewest exemplars for two subordinate animal categories, <italic>amphibians</italic> and <italic>reptiles</italic>. Clearly, the well-formed and poorly formed categories reflect similarities in the level of instruction that is provided to children between the ages of 6 and 8 years.</p>
<p>Several other factors may account for the data patterns and the response variability observed in this study. As noted earlier, participants in this study were exposed not only to very different SES backgrounds but also different school contexts. The differences in school contexts probably arose because of SES differences. LSES participants attended public schools, whereas MSES participants attended a private school that required tuition. LSES and MSES participants were thus exposed to teachers with different levels of training, different curricula, and different instructional resources.</p>
<p>Inherent in the differences in school context were also perhaps differences in cultural backgrounds. Our MSES participants varied in their racial/ethnic backgrounds compared to LSES participants. In addition, our LSES participants were on average 1 year younger than our MSES participants. Previous research has focused mainly on the differences between 6- and 8-year-old children. For this age range there is no consensus that <italic>older</italic> means different or more sophisticated. The effects of cognitive maturation between ages 6 and 7 should be explored as a factor in future studies.</p>
<p>These data also further substantiate that categorical knowledge is acquired through social-linguistic sharing. African American LSES children were of particular interest because they provide an insight into the way in which items are categorized by individuals from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. Data from this study showed that African American children from LSES backgrounds had extensive semantic representations for many categories, some of which were as extensive as their MSES peers. Despite the cultural and linguistic differences, common events and experiences influence the development of both African American LSES children and MSES children. These events and experiences appear to be the ones that occur outside of formal settings.</p>
<p>The differences observed between SES groups underscore the ongoing need to conduct vocabulary assessments so that instruction can be tailored to the learner’s needs. Standardized protocols include exemplars of categories that are more likely to be encountered in formal settings. The type of category production task used in this study is easily amenable by practitioners to test children’s knowledge of words experienced in diverse settings. Practitioners can administer the assessment in a brief manner by restricting the time per prompt to 1 minute each and selecting categories that are relevant to the focus of instruction. Future studies can improve on this investigation by administering repeated measurements close in time to gather reliability data for the category prompt assessment.</p>
<p>There is emerging evidence that this type of assessment of semantic knowledge has utility in children with disabilities (e.g., Down syndrome) and is correlated with performance on receptive vocabulary protocols that are commonly administered as part of traditional screening and progress monitoring batteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740112460368">Nash &amp; Snowling, 2008</xref>). The usage of a category fluency test can be made flexible such that it includes various modes of communication such as pointing, gestures, signs, and the selection of symbols. This flexibility may be a more comprehensive way to assess all referents to objects and entities experienced throughout daily experiences. Relations among performance on category production tasks and performance on standardized measures of expressive and receptive vocabulary and standardized measures of reading comprehension should be explored.</p>
