<p>In the last editorial we commented on the rightful focus on child malnutrition but, at the same time, described the remarkable neglect of the mother, on whom the health and ability of the child depends. A primary reason for drawing attention to this focus was the key issue of the importance of maternal nutrition to secure the proper development of the brain of the child growing in her womb. Of all the energy delivered from the mother to her fetus, 70% is devoted to fetal brain growth. Moreover, a highly selective process in the placenta ensures the bio-magnification of the long chain essential fatty acids arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid, which are vital for the growth, structure and functional development of this unique organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1a-0260106012474745">Crawford et al., 1976</xref>). The brain is the priority in human developmental biology: it is largely made of a highly specialized fat. If you get the conditions for optimal brain development right it is likely the rest will follow. These brain specific, essential fatty acids have to come from the food and present day government recommendations for reducing fat intakes do a disservice without informing people about which fats to avoid and which they should eat. Without such information how will they maintain healthy levels of the brain specific fats? The rise in disorders of the brain suggests not all is right.</p>
<p>Developmental brain disorder or brain damage before birth cannot be rectified later in life. Importantly, nothing may appear to be wrong until sometime later. With the extreme case of cerebral palsy, for example, we may not know that child is disabled at birth. The newborn may look perfectly healthy. That is until milestones are missed and noticed. Again, with severe disorders it may not be until 18 months or two years after birth that is realized that the child will be severely disabled for life. With mental ill health the disordered development may not be noticed until school age or even later into adulthood.</p>
<p>Cerebral palsy was commonly considered as a product of obstetric mishap. However, this was shown to be a misconception by the European Cerebral Palsy Study. By using magnetic resonance images of the brain they identified the causative lesions as having occurred well before the time of normal birth. The conclusion drawn was that the cause was likely to be nutritional and or infectious (Bax et al., 2006). Cerebral palsy is, however, the tip of an iceberg of a wide range of overlapping neurodevelopmental disorders leading to cognitive impairment and behavioural pathology. These are often lumped together and described as mental ill-health. However, the fundamental issue is the long-recognized difficulty of correcting a disorder initiated during neurodevelopment.</p>
<p>In 1978, a joint expert consultation of the Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization reviewed the evidence on the nutritional requirements for fats and fatty acids. They recommended that an additional 1.5% of energy supplied by essential fatty acids would be required to support the long chain omega 3 and 6 requirements during pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0260106012474745">IBID, no. 57, 1994</xref>). The long chain omega 6 and 3 needed by the fetus are specifically arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acids. A second joint consultation, in 1994, quantified the needs of the infant. The third, in 2010, recommended 200 mg docosahexaenoic acid/day in pregnancy or 250 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids combined (IBID, no. 91, 2010).</p>
<p>Whilst countries such as Japan and coastal East Asian countries are likely to meet such recommendations, the intensified use of land foods in the West has in recent times diluted the diet and reduced its value as a source of docosahexaenoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0260106012474745">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and greatly enhanced the intake of saturated fats and linoleic acid, with the latter being in direct competition with long chain omega 3 (the brain only uses docosahexaenoic acid in the omega 3 family).</p>
<p>Both the loss of long chain omega 3 from marine sources and the increase in the linoleic acid competitor are considered to be contributing towards major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0260106012474745">Hibbeln, 1998</xref>) and the latter to homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0260106012474745">Hibbeln et al., 2004</xref>). A recent assessment of the dietary intakes of docosahexaenoic acid in French Canadians puts the intake of women at 180mg/day, which is below the recommendation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0260106012474745">Garneau et al., 2012</xref>). Although data are sparse it is likely that more than half the women in the USA and much of Europe as well are eating less than recommended for pregnancy. This conclusion fits with the epidemiology of major depression, diabetes, heart disease and stroke. It also fits with the recent rise in the cost of mental ill-health, which is now the highest health cost in the UK and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0260106012474745">Andlin-Sobocki et al., 2005</xref>) where the numbers have been crunched, and almost certainly in the USA as well.</p>
<p>The recent shootings of children and adults by Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, USA, have raised demands for attention to mental ill-health. The <italic>Daily Advertiser </italic>has just called the ‘US mental health system in desperate need of reform’.</p>
<p>An important issue here is that the seeds for mental ill-health are most likely sown before birth and are a consequence of inadequate maternal/fetal and infant nutrition or environmental effects with a consequent impact on neurogenesis and prenatal neural organization in a similar way to that claimed for the prenatal genesis of risk of diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Before this tragic happening we had in Norway the horrifying killing spree by Anders Breivik, who shot mostly teenage children at a holiday camp on the island of Utøya. There were many other senseless acts of violence of a similar nature before these two horrid events, which evoked the sympathy of the whole world for the bereaved parents, friends and families.</p>
<p>The danger here is that the focus of attention will be on the child and/or young adult, and the role of the brain-specific nutrition and health of the mother will again be sidelined. Much as attention for the child and young adult is needed, we suggest there is a fundamental root cause in the development of brain disorders and it is predominantly prenatal or neurodevelopment. This conclusion will require a major paradigm shift in the way ill-health is dealt with.</p>
