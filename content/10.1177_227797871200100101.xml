<p>We are happy to announce the launching of the <italic>South Asian Journal of Macroeconomics and Public Finance</italic> (SMP). The journal is a revamped reincarnation of an earlier initiative—the India Macroeconomics Annual that came into existence in 2003–04 and the success of which has prompted the publisher to go for a more conventional outlet. We thank SAGE for the support and encouragement.</p>
<p>SMP will be published biannually (June and December) with a focus on macroeconomics and public finance very broadly interpreted. We shall encourage theoretical and applied articles on Macroeconomics, International Trade, Labour Economics, Environment, Public Finance and Public Policy as long as they address certain aggregative issues related to the global and local economies. Survey of the state of the art literature as well as articles on research methodologies will be welcome. The term ‘South Asia’ denotes the location of the journal and seeks to encourage young scholars working in South Asian universities and research institutions to contribute to the journal, but in no way restricts its domain to the typical ‘South Asian’ topics of interest. We aspire to be a global journal. We have a very distinguished international editorial board helping us with the publication of the journal.</p>
<p>SMP is also the official outlet of the dual research programmes of the Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta, the Reserve Bank of India Research Endowment and The Centre for Training and Research in Public Finance and Policy, supported by the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bank of the country and the Union Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Thanks are also due to these organizations.</p>
