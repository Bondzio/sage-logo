<abstract><p>Although Josephus is not overly interested in the topic of children and childhood, his writings do provide some evidence for the ways in which his perceptions of famous children, as well as parent–child relationships, were influenced by or similar to those evident in Greco-Roman literature of his era, as well as the ways in which the Jewish treatment of children, as described by Josephus, became part of his apologetic endeavors.</p>

<p>Mining the works of Josephus for information about children and childhood in first-century Judaism is a tricky matter. First, the sources are sparse; Josephus is not nearly as interested in family matters as he is, for example, in court intrigue, the machinations of the high priesthood, and the grand narratives of biblical history. Second, drawing social history from the comments he does make on this topic can be very difficult. It is often not possible to determine whether his comments reflect his own views, actual practices among first-century Jews, values of Greco-Roman society more generally, apologetic interests, exegetical motifs, or some combination thereof. Nevertheless, the task is not entirely thankless. At the very least, it will be possible to discern the main emphasis of his discussion of childhood and the raising of children, and the degree to which he participates in a number of the child-related conversations and concerns that were apparently current in the broader Greco-Roman world.</p>
<sec id="section1-0008429812441342">
<title>Josephus’s Children</title>
<p>Loquacious as he can be on so many matters, Josephus gives away very little information about his own domestic situation. In <italic>Life </italic>5, he says simply: “I have three sons: Hyrcanus, the oldest, from the fourth year, Iustus from the eighth year, and Agrippa from the ninth year of the imperium of Vespasian Caesar.” Vespasian became <italic>princeps</italic> in 69; thus, if Josephus is correct, these sons were born in 72/73, 76/77 and 77/78 CE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0008429812441342">Josephus</xref> [trans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441342">Mason], 2001</xref>: 10n36–40). At the end of <italic>Life</italic>, he provides some information about the mothers of these sons. Josephus was married at least three times. The first wife he mentions was a captive woman whom he married while under Roman guard after the capture of Jotapata; she left him upon his release (<italic>Life</italic> 414–415). His second wife was an Alexandrian woman, whom he divorced out of displeasure with her habits, according to <italic>Life</italic> 426. With this woman he had three children, of whom only Hyrcanus survived. Later he married a noble Jewish woman from Crete, with whom he had Iustus and Simonides Agrippa (<italic>Life</italic> 427). Given that Josephus was 30 years old when he married the captive woman, it is possible that she was his second wife, and not the first, as <italic>Life</italic> 414 would imply (Josephus [trans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441342">Mason], 2001</xref>: 164n1701). This, however, remains speculative.</p>

<title>Virtuous Children</title>
<p>Reticent as he is about his own children, Josephus waxes eloquent about the famous children of scripture, such as Isaac and Moses. One story that he embellishes at length is the near-sacrifice (“the binding”) of Isaac, found in Genesis 22.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812441342">1</xref>
</sup> In contrast to the famously laconic style of the biblical story,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441342">2</xref>
</sup> Josephus dwells at length upon the love of the father and the virtues of the son, noting that Abraham exceedingly loved Isaac, his only son, born to him “on the threshold of old age,” a gift from God (<italic>Ant</italic>. 1.222). The language used in the Greek to describe Abraham’s old age parallels that of Priam, who also lost his sons “on the threshold of old age” (<italic>Iliad</italic> 24.487–500; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441342">Feldman, 2004</xref>: 84n677). Josephus’s use of this phrase may therefore be an allusion to the plight of famous Greek fathers, in order to evoke sympathy and understanding for Abraham’s plight.</p>
<p>Isaac deserved his father’s love. Like the model Roman citizen, he practiced every virtue; though these virtues are not enumerated here, the reference may well be to the well-known Greco-Roman list of virtues that included dignity, honesty, refinement, industry, piety and dutifulness, prudence, self-control and truthfulness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441342">3</xref>
</sup> Isaac also showed attention to his forebears, and exhibited “zeal for the worship of God,” thereby winning even more the affection and love of his parents (<italic>Ant</italic>. 1.222). Philo similarly emphasizes Isaac’s practice of the virtues (<italic>De Abrahamo</italic> 168). That Isaac showed attention to his forebears may refer to his careful observance of filial piety, in fulfillment of the commandment to honor one’s parents; similar values are evidenced, for example, in the <italic>Enchiridon</italic> 30, in which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0008429812441342">Epictetus</xref> states that a child’s duties to his or her father include taking care of him, yielding to him in all things, and submitting to his reproaches and blows. Feldman suggests that Josephus’s comment may also be intended to appeal to Hellenistic Greek and Roman audiences, as an allusion to the veneration of ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441342">Feldman, 2004</xref>: 85n680–681).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441342">4</xref>
</sup> Josephus therefore portrays Isaac as an ideal offspring in the Hellenistic mode.</p>
<p>Despite his anguish at sacrificing his beloved and long-awaited son, now twenty-five years old, by the command of God and the action of his own hand, Abraham submitted bravely to God’s demand. After preparing the altar, Abraham said to his son:<disp-quote>
<p>My child, having asked with myriad prayers from God that you be born to me, when you came into life, there is nothing that I did not take trouble with regard to your upbringing, nor was there anything that I thought would bring me greater happiness than if I should see you grown to manhood and when I died, I should have you as the successor of my realm. But since it was by God’s wish that I became your father and again since, as it seems best to Him, I give you up, bear this consecration nobly, for I concede you to God, who requires now to obtain this honor from us, in return for the fact that He has been a benevolent helper and ally to me. (<italic>Ant</italic>. 1.228–231)</p>
</disp-quote>
Far from protesting his tragic fate, Isaac “received these words with joy; and saying that it was not even right for him to have been born in the first place” if he could not obey both his father and God, “he rushed to the altar and the slaughter” (<italic>Ant.</italic> 1.232). Isaac’s eagerness to be sacrificed may reflect the Greek notion that the sacrifice to the gods should be a willing participant, often given by the animal “nodding its assent” when sprinkled with water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0008429812441342">Burkert, 1985</xref>: 56). It is also a motif in Greek drama; in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441342">Euripides’</xref> <italic>Iphigenia at Aulis</italic>, Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, rushes to be sacrificed for the sake of Greece, although, in contrast to Isaac, she has initially been misled as to her role in the ritual (<italic>Iph. Aul.</italic>, 1375–1377, 1398–1399). In <italic>Targum Pseudo-Jonathan </italic>on Genesis 22:10, Isaac tells his father: “Bind me properly lest I tremble from the affliction of my soul and be cast into the pit of destruction and there be found profaneness in your offering.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441342">5</xref>
</sup> Similarly, 4 Maccabees 16:20 speaks in praise of Isaac for not flinching when he saw his father’s hand descending upon him with a sword. Josephus is unique, however, in noting the joy with which Isaac rushed to his death. Therefore, Isaac’s willingness to undergo the sacrifice—without being bound—may be an apologetic framing that attempts to present the situation as a noble sacrifice instead of a pointless, bloodthirsty murder to appease a hungry, foreign deity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429812441342">6</xref>
</sup> Luckily, God intervened, brought the ram, reiterated the covenant promises, after which Abraham and Isaac embraced one another, brought the sacrifice, returned home to Sarah, and lived happily ever after (<italic>Ant</italic>. 1.233–236).</p>
<p>Josephus embellishes the biblical text by adding details such as Isaac’s age and the relieved embrace after the reprieve. Some of these changes are certainly exegetical, in that they fill in the gaps or correct problems in the biblical story, for example, by specifying that both father and son returned to Sarah, and not the father alone as implied in Genesis 22:19. Most striking, however, are the speeches of father and son. They not only reflect the idea that there is a natural love between parents and children,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429812441342">7</xref>
</sup> but also that this love is connected in some way to the virtues of the child, such as piety, obedience and devotion. Nevertheless, Josephus’s interest is not so much in describing parent–child devotion as in enhancing the emotional impact of the story.</p>
<p>The same can be said for his treatment of the infant Moses. In his retelling of Exodus 1 and 2, Josephus speaks eloquently of the feelings of Thermoutis, the Pharaoh’s daughter, upon finding Moses in the river, and includes an account of Moses’ interactions with the Pharaoh which led the king to fear for his crown, an account also present in rabbinic literature. In contrast to Philo, Josephus does not use the story of the infant Moses as an occasion to engage in a polemic against the practice of infanticide or the exposure of infants (cf. Philo, <italic>De Vita Mosis</italic> 1.11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0008429812441342">Reinhartz, 1992</xref>: 42–58). The theme may be present indirectly, however, in <italic>Ant</italic>. 2.225: “For God exhibited such great concern for Moyses that <italic>he was deemed worthy of nurture and care</italic> by the very ones who because of his birth had decided to bring about the annihilation of the others from the race of the Hebrews” [emphasis added]. One indication that a child might be fit enough to be raised by the parents—as opposed to being exposed on account of failure to thrive or some disability or blemish—was the physical beauty of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429812441342">Garnsey, 1991</xref>: 54–55). Given that the infant Moses’ trip down the Nile superficially resembled exposure, it was important that Greco-Roman audiences understand that he was both fit to be raised, and of such beauty that an unknown, and highborn, woman would be moved to adopt him and raise him as her own.</p>
<p>Moses’ beauty captivated not only his adoptive mother but everyone who saw him, to the point that “many people who happened to meet him as he was borne along the road turned back at the sight of the child and left aside their serious affairs and used their time to view him” (<italic>Ant</italic>. 2.231). Moses was not only beautiful but intelligent and mature far beyond his age: “His intelligence did not grow comparably with his age, but it far exceeded this criterion, and he showed clearly its more mature superiority in his childish amusements; and the things that were done then furnished promise of greater achievements that would be done by him as an adult” (<italic>Ant</italic>. 2.230). Intellectual superiority was the hallmark of a special child; this is evident in Luke’s depiction of the twelve-year-old Jesus teaching other teachers in the temple (Luke 2:46–47). Hence Josephus’s description of Moses as precocious may be intended to underscore how special, indeed, exceptional, he was from a very young age. Excellence at games was another such trait; it is also attributed to Cyrus, the king of Persia (Herodotus 1.114; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0008429812441342">Feldman, 2004</xref>: 196n646).</p>
<p>Related to his beauty and intelligence was his physical stature: unlike most children, who have a growth spurt in their early to mid-teens, God gave Moses a “wondrous increase of stature” at the mere age of three (<italic>Ant</italic>. 2.230), presumably after he had been weaned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0008429812441342">8</xref>
</sup> The emphasis on Moses’ childhood beauty may also be a response to gentile claims that Moses was a diseased, crippled leper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0008429812441342">Hata, 1987</xref>: 183–184). The image of the precocious Moses is also echoed in Philo’s <italic>De Vita Mosis</italic> 1.5.18ff, although Philo tends to focus on the intellectual rigor and piety of the young Moses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0008429812441342">
<title>Less-than-Virtuous Children</title>
<p>Josephus was well aware that not all children were as virtuous as Isaac and Moses. In <italic>Ant</italic>. 4.245, Josephus indicates that Jewish law forbids marriage with a prostitute, on the grounds that children resulting from shameful marriages will not be inclined towards virtue. Yet even virtuous parents can give birth to corrupt children, as the story of Samuel’s reprobate sons makes amply clear (<italic>Ant</italic>. 6.33): “They themselves [Samuel’s errant sons], however, were an example and a proof that some children are not similar in character to their parents; rather, kind and moderate ones stem from vile parents, just as those born from good [parents] show themselves depraved.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0008429812441342">9</xref>
</sup> Josephus does not speculate as to how it is possible for virtuous parents to give birth to unvirtuous offspring, or vice versa, but simply observes that children do not always resemble their parents with regard to their character.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0008429812441342">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Samuel’s sons dishonored their father, a terrible crime in a system governed by the divine commandment to honor father and mother. As Josephus notes in <italic>Apion</italic> 2.206, the law “ordered honor of parents, second to honoring God, and if anyone does not reciprocate the gifts he has received from them—however little he may fall short—it hands him over to be stoned. It gives instruction that the young should honor everyone who is older, since God is oldest.”</p>
<p>The commandment to honor father and mother (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16) is a frequent topic of discussion in Hellenistic Jewish literature. Sirach enjoins:<disp-quote>
<p>Listen to me your father, O children; act accordingly, that you may be kept in safety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441342">2</xref>
</sup> For the Lord honors a father above his children, and he confirms a mother's right over her children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441342">3</xref>
</sup> Those who honor their father atone for sins,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441342">4</xref>
</sup> and those who respect their mother are like those who lay up treasure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441342">5</xref>
</sup> Those who honor their father will have joy in their own children, and when they pray they will be heard.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429812441342">6</xref>
</sup> Those who respect their father will have long life, and those who honor their mother obey the Lord;<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429812441342">7</xref>
</sup> they will serve their parents as their masters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0008429812441342">8</xref>
</sup> Honor your father by word and deed, that his blessing may come upon you. (Sirach 3:1–8)</p>
</disp-quote>
Philo, like Josephus, connects the honoring of parents to piety, not simply because God commanded it but because parents share in the divine nature by virtue of their generative capacity: “parents by their nature stand on the border-line between the mortal and the immortal side of existence, the mortal because of their kinship with men and other animals through the perishableness of the body; the immortal because the act of generation assimilates them to God, the generator of the All” (<italic>Decalogue</italic> 107). The requirement to honor one’s parents is present, however, in Greek philosophy as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429812441342">Epictetus</xref>, a first- and second-century Stoic philosopher, admonished his male readers:<disp-quote>
<p>Now bear in mind that you are a son. What is the profession of this character? To treat everything that is his own as belonging to his father, to be obedient to him in all things, never to speak ill of him to anyone else, nor to say or do anything that will harm him, to give way to him in everything and yield him in precedence, helping him as far as is within his power. (<italic>Discourses </italic>2.10.7)</p>
</disp-quote>
Similarly, Seneca comments:<disp-quote>
<p>Even the power of rhetoric and the subtlety of the mind cannot fully express how great an achievement it is, how praiseworthy, and how eternally memorable, to be able to say: “I obeyed my parents; I deferred to their authority, whether it was fair or unfair or even harsh; I showed myself compliant and submissive. In only one respect was I unyielding: in refusing to let them do me more kindnesses than I did them.” (<italic>De. Ben.</italic> 3.38.2)</p>
</disp-quote>
It may be that such views underlie Josephus’s contention that a crime against one’s parents is on the same level as a crime against God; the same is true even of the intention to commit such a crime: “even if someone [merely] intends it, he dies instantly” (<italic>Apion</italic> 2.217). The reference here is to Deuteronomy 21:18–21, which describes the case of the rebellious son: “If someone has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father and mother, who does not heed them when they discipline him, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of that place. They shall say to the elders of his town, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.’ Then all the men of the town shall stone him to death. So you shall purge the evil from your midst; and all Israel will hear, and be afraid.”</p>
<p>In <italic>Ant</italic>. 4.260–264 Josephus amplifies this biblical passage at length:<disp-quote>
<p>In cases in which young men disdain their parents and do not grant them their honor—whether because of shame or lack of understanding—demeaning them, let the parents first of all warn them with words, for they are autonomous judges over their sons, saying that they came together with each other not for the sake of pleasure, nor of increasing their wealth by placing in common what the two of them had, but in order that they might have children who would tend them in their old age and who would have from them whatever they needed: “When you were born, we raised you with joy; and giving the greatest thanks to God we reared you with devotion, sparing nothing of what seemed to be useful for your well-being and education in the best things. Now, however, for it was necessary to grant pardon for the failings of youth, you have sufficiently disregarded the honor toward us. Change to the more reasonable way, considering that God is also annoyed with those who commit an outrage against parents, because He Himself is also the father of the whole human race. He thinks that there is dishonor at the same time for those who have the same title as Himself when they do not obtain from their children what is fitting for them; and there is the implacable law, the punisher of such acts, which you should not put to the test.” If the rebelliousness of the youths is cured by such means, let them be excused from censure for things they did not know, for thus the lawgiver would be good and the parents fortunate, in seeing neither son nor daughter punished. However, should these words and the teaching from them about moderate behavior seem worthless, and should one make the laws implacable enemies for himself through such constant boldness toward his parents, let him be brought forward by them themselves outside the city with the masses following, and let him be stoned. After remaining during the whole day in the sight of all, let him be buried at night.</p>
</disp-quote>
In this discussion, Josephus fills a gap in the biblical passage by amplifying on what the parents would have said to the son while disciplining him. To be sure, the tone of Josephus’s speech does not exactly match the highly emotional situation being envisaged, but the content does express some of the core values that are present in other passages: procreation as the only goal of sexual activity,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0008429812441342">11</xref>
</sup> parents’ love for their children, the connection between parenting and divine love, and the reverence for Torah. In doing so, the speech adumbrates the hierarchical understanding of the family and the notion that filial obedience is an aspect of piety that is evident in early Christian literature, such as Ephesians 6:1, which urges children to “obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.” Josephus’s comments suggest his familiarity with the Roman concept of <italic>patria potestas</italic>, the view that gave the father absolute power over the other members of his household, especially his children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0008429812441342">12</xref>
</sup> According to Roman law, <italic>patria potestas</italic> included the father’s power to imprison, whip, or kill the son, or to sell him into slavery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0008429812441342">Dionysus of Halicarnassus</xref>, <italic>Roman Antiquities </italic>2.26–27). Similarly, Philo (<italic>De Specialibus</italic> <italic>Legibus</italic> 2.233) justifies the absolute power that parents have over their children: “For parents pay out a sum many times the value of a slave on their children and for them to nurses, tutors, and teachers, apart from the cost of their clothes, food, and superintendence in sickness and health from their earliest years until they are fully grown.” Philo is writing in Alexandria; the writings of Josephus suggest that <italic>patria potestas</italic> was an ideal for Jewish families in Judea as well.</p>
<p>More difficult to discern is whether Josephus’s extended statement is apologetic. To be sure, the passage does soften the scriptural text by implying the lengths to which parents would go before resorting to an extreme punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441342">Altshuler, 1977</xref>: 136). Nevertheless, it should be noted that in contrast to Deuteronomy 21:18–21 Josephus includes daughters as well as sons in this admonition (<italic>Ant</italic>. 4.263). Furthermore, in <italic>Apion</italic> 2.216–217, which is certainly apologetic, the law which states that mere intention of wronging one’s parents is grounds for the death penalty is stricter than in <italic>Ant</italic>. 4.264, where the death penalty is inflicted only after repeated actual misdeeds by the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0008429812441342">Goldenberg, 1978</xref>: 221).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0008429812441342">
<title>Children and Apologetics</title>
<p>Josephus’s treatments of biblical children are shaped in large measure by his highly developed flair for dramatic narrative, but also testify to an apologetic agenda. Other passages that mention children and childhood are even more explicitly apologetic, and seem intended to defend Jews and Jewish practice against various accusations or to emphasize the superiority of Jewish practices to those of other nations. This tendency is most apparent in Josephus’s treatise <italic>Against Apion</italic>, in which Josephus engages in a polemical and apologetic response to an anti-Jewish tract written by the Roman grammarian and Homeric commentator, Apion.<sup>

<p>In <italic>Apion</italic> 1.60, Josephus describes the Jews as an agricultural people that take pride “in raising children, and make keeping the laws and preserving the traditional piety which accords with them the most essential task of our whole life.” Later, in 2.202, he amplifies that the law “gave orders to nurture all children.” In both of these passages, Josephus is engaging in an apologetic against the Greco-Roman practice of exposure of infants or infanticide, by stressing that this practice is anathema to the Jews. That Jewish law forbade the exposure or killing of infants is stressed by other Hellenistic Jewish writers. Pseudo-Phocylides declares that “a woman should not destroy the unborn babe in her belly, nor after its birth throw it before the dogs and the vultures of prey.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0008429812441342">14</xref>
</sup> According to Philo, the “holy law” detests those who “gird themselves up to conspire” against infants, and “pronounces them worthy of punishment” (<italic>De Specialibus Legibus</italic> 3.119).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0008429812441342">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Like all aspects of life, the raising of children required sober modesty, piety and obedience on the part of both parents and children. Josephus is critical of excessive feasting and celebrating, in which Jews do not indulge:<disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, not even on the occasion of the birth of children did [the Torah/Law] permit laying on feasts and making pretexts for drunkenness, but it ordered that from the very beginning their upbringing should be in sober moderation. And it gave instruction to teach reading, in relation to the laws, and that they know about the exploits of their forebears, in order that they imitate the latter and, being brought up with the former, neither transgress nor have an excuse for ignorance. (<italic>Apion</italic> 2.204)</p>
</disp-quote>
Furthermore, Jews, in contrast to “the Greeks and some others,” do not paint portraits of their children (<italic>Apion</italic> 2.74).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0008429812441342">16</xref>
</sup> This was surely not the case for all Jews, for in <italic>Ant</italic>. 15.26–27 he refers to Alexandra’s portraits of her children, and in <italic>Ant</italic>. 19.357, to the statues of Agrippa’s daughters, though it certainly may be argued that Alexandra and Agrippa were not typical of Jews in general.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>If Josephus were a character in the Gospels, filmmakers would long have used or perhaps misused his comments on children to imagine his family life: his late marriage (at the age of 32 or thereabouts); his longing for sons finally fulfilled; his sadness at the death of two children, and joy at the birth of two others with his beloved third wife; the beauty, intelligence, talent and strength of these children; the many hours spent at the fireside teaching them Torah; then a dramatic and tragic turnabout: the rebellion of his oldest son, and the heartrending decision about whether or not to take him to the authorities, and then the sincere repentance and return of this prodigal son. The movie would have ended with a tearful but dignified deathbed scene, in which Josephus utters some final philosophical words and dies peacefully surrounded by his loving wife and children. In keeping with the ideal of modesty, the visuals would reveal no family photos on the walls or fireplace in Josephus’s household.</p>
<p>That scenario is certainly more exciting than what we can actually say about Josephus’s own family or the families of other Jews of his time, place and class. Indeed, his treatises provide very little information about social history, including childrearing practices. Josephus’s comments, however, do convey some general ideals about children: children, or at least, sons, are a positive good, and, once one has them, one hopes that they will be virtuous and obedient. The connection of physical and moral beauty, and the ideals of modesty, are commonplace in the works of Greek and Roman writers, and the parallels are well-documented in the footnotes to the new Brill translation and commentary. These and many other details seem designed not to provide social history but to amplify biblical narrative, respond to anti-Jewish polemics, show the compatibility of Judaism with Greek and Roman philosophy, and to demonstrate the superiority of Jewish law and custom to other ways of life. Josephus’s writings therefore do not contribute to social history as such, but they, along with other writings from the New Testament and other sources, show the role of the household—or to be more precise, talk about the household—in ancient apologetics and self-definition.</p>

<p>The virtues play a major role in Greek and Roman philosophy. The four classic cardinal virtues of Aquinas, namely, temperance, prudence, fortitude and justice, originated in Greek philosophy.

<p>Ramsey MacMullen has recently discussed the likelihood that Christians continued the practice of veneration of the ancestors well into the fourth century CE; it is possible that Jews in the first centuries CE similarly valued such veneration, perhaps under the influence of their Greco-Roman context.

<p>An excellent reference for the Roman idea of filial affection is Seneca’s <italic>De Consolatione ad Marciam</italic>, which deals both narrowly with Marcia’s grief over the loss of her father, and with examples of parents losing their children (e.g. the story of Livia in 3.1–2). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0008429812441342">Cicero’s letters</xref> to his family (14.1–14.4) explore the depth of his grief at being separated from his wife and children.</p>

<p>Josephus supplies this “moral” to the story of Samuel’s reprobate sons. It serves to preclude readers blaming Samuel himself for the way his sons turned out (as they might well be inclined to do in light of Josephus’s previous story of Eli and his reprobate sons in <italic>Ant</italic>. 5.338–362). The pattern to which Josephus calls attention here has already been exemplified in the case of the liberator Gideon who engendered the tyrant Abimelech (see <italic>Ant</italic>. 5.239) and will further be illustrated in the succession of Israelite monarchs where good kings have bad sons and vice versa. See, for example, Amnon, the son of King David, attacking and raping his half-sister Tamar (<italic>Ant.</italic> 7.162–173), or the wicked Rehoboam’s son Abijah giving a pious speech immediately before Abijah’s triumph in battle (<italic>Ant</italic>. 8.264, 274–285).</p>

<p>The question of why some children resemble their parents and others do not was a preoccupation for Aristotle and other ancient philosophers who attempted to explain the process of reproduction (<italic>De Generatione Animalium </italic>722a–724a). Aristotle refutes the theory of pangenesis, especially on the grounds that it cannot adequately account for the fact that children do not always resemble their parents. For further discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0008429812441342">Tress (1996</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0008429812441342">Preus (1970</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0008429812441342">Reinhartz (1999</xref>).</p>

<p>This comment too may be apologetic, as it is in sharp contrast to the behavior of upper-class Romans during the Republic and the early Empire, as epitomized in the idea of marriage being <italic>liberorum quaerendum gratia</italic>, translated as “for the purpose of producing children.” That phrase “recurs often enough, with minor variations, to suggest that it was a legal or ritual formula” that accompanied the (public) ritual of marriage and epitomized the (public) virtue of producing children. However, there was often some private reluctance about having children. Similarly, procreation was far from being the goal of the sexual act itself, as evidenced by the quantity of rules and love poems written to, or about, mistresses or concubines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441342">Rawson, 1986</xref>: 9–11, 14–15, 25, 29).</p>

<p>Such apologetic protestations, however, must be seen as prescriptive rather than descriptive. Philo’s discussions of infanticide, in particular, can be read as invective against this practice, rather than a straightforward description of Jewish values and behavior.
