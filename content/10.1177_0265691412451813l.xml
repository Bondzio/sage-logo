<p>Marx once claimed that everywhere and in everything the mind limps after reality. This excellent collection of essays surveys various attempts by Russian thinkers to understand their homeland’s political, economic, social and cultural aspects, and their impact on the country’s likely future development. The period covered is ambitious, from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries, with a focus on the ‘Golden Age’ of the mid-nineteenth century. Each chapter can be read with profit as a succinct summary of its particular topic; an editorial introduction and a ‘think-piece’ (afterword) point to broader continuities.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four sections. Part One (‘Context’) explains the political and social order in which intellectuals worked. An obvious continuity was autocratic and authoritarian regimes that aimed at shoring up and expanding state power over a vast territory. There was a dilemma between the need for a vibrant and creative intelligentsia to serve the government and the economy, and the tendency of thinkers to be critical, not least of the political order. There was thus an uneasy relationship between rulers and intellectuals, with sections of the creative elite sometimes privileged but with the threat that privileges could be withdrawn. Over the longer term it is likely that Russian governments suffered as a result – the problem of ‘backwardness’ was never satisfactorily resolved.</p>
<p>Parts Two and Three examine several intellectual currents (Enlightenment, Conservatism, Nihilism, tradition and counter-tradition in literature) and themes (West, East, people, the intelligentsia and capitalism, natural science). Part Four looks at peculiarities of the Soviet period (dialectical materialism) as well as continuities from Classical thought. The extent to which the Enlightenment had an impact on Russia highlights the tension between rulers who wanted Russia to participate in broader European trends and the need to suppress thought when it became troublesome for the state. Tsars after Catherine were wary of the Age of Reason, but its values remained embedded within educated circles. Intellectuals debated the possibilities for human perfection, arguing over its likelihood and desirability, and whether Russia was best conceptualized as part of the West or as a Eurasian power. While these were important and interesting issues, it was the pioneers of science that triumphed: ‘Dostoyevsky could not inveigh against science from any position of strength. The wishful thinking indignation of his Underground Man is readily to be regarded as petulant, feeble and ultimately pathetic’ (304). It is in scientific achievement that the continuity can most be felt from Tsar to General Secretary. As Lenin remarked, communism was the combination of ‘Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country’.</p>
<p>One can have few gripes with the contributors’ erudition and mastery. There is the occasional slip. As James D. White long ago demonstrated it was Bukharin, not Lenin, who argued that imperialism had its ‘weakest link’ in capitalist Russia (281). The chapter on the intelligentsia and capitalism could have made more mention of Russian economic thought. Here the work of Vincent Barnett could have been usefully drawn upon.</p>
<p>The volume’s strengths include an extensive bibliography and 22 pages of biographical details of thinkers and writers. The final chapter lauds the ‘growing prosperity’ of post-communist Russia that is a ‘function of the western-inspired privatization and acceptance of capitalist-market mechanisms’ (369), as well as providing a balance sheet of how well thinkers have fared with regard to their powers of prediction. Some can claim the correctness of a general vision (Russia as a great power). But few if any were right on the detail (the human cost). As engaged as Russian intellectuals undoubtedly were, the extent to which they shaped the nation, or were shaped or ignored by Russia and its government is not so easily resolved in the thinkers’ favour. There may be something in what Marx said after all.</p>
