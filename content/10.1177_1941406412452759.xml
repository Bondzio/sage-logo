<abstract>
<p>Infants born prematurely are at risk for metabolic bone disease and may need increased minerals for normal bone mineralization. In these situations, supplementation of human milk with calcium and phosphorus is common in the United States. The interaction of these nutrients and their carriers with other nutrition components of human milk has not been systematically investigated. The primary goal was to study the effect of calcium and phosphorus supplementation on the digestibility of protein, free fatty acids, and calcium in preterm donor human milk (DHM). An in vitro model of the premature infant’s gastrointestinal tract was used to simulate digestion. Protein, free fatty acids, and ionized calcium were measured before and after in vitro digestion in milk with and without added calcium glubionate and sodium potassium phosphate. Calcium and phosphorus supplementation did not negatively affect total protein, protein breakdown, protein digestibility, or fat breakdown when compared with unfortified DHM. Supplemental calcium increased ionized calcium, which may replace ionized calcium lost during milk expression, storage, and processing. Supplemental calcium glubionate and sodium potassium phosphate do not affect protein or fat breakdown in vitro. DHM contains less ionized calcium than fresh human milk because it loses CO<sub>2</sub> during expression and processing. Adding supplemental calcium increases ionized calcium in DHM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The preterm infant is a nutritional emergency. As the age of viability decreases and the survival rates of preterm infants improve, more attention is being given to providing the best possible quality of life through nutritional interventions. There are minimal scientific data and conflicting guidelines for feeding premature infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412452759">1</xref></sup> Many clinicians aim to mimic growth to achieve the intrauterine growth rate and shorten hospital stays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412452759">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Approximately 30% of infants who weigh less than 1500 g and 55% of infants who weigh less than 1000 g will have bone disease of prematurity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412452759">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452759">4</xref></sup> Infants less than 28 weeks’ gestation, weighing less than 1500 g, receiving total parenteral nutrition for an extended period of time, and who receive steroids and diuretics are most at risk of developing bone disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412452759">5</xref></sup> The purpose of the calcium and phosphate recommendations for premature infants is to provide postnatal accretion equal to the intrauterine growth of a fetus. For premature infants, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends supplementation of human milk with calcium and phosphorus or a formula with a high mineral content,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412452759">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412452759">7</xref></sup> whereas the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (ESPGAN) recommends phosphate supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412452759">7</xref></sup> During the period equal to the third trimester, feeding premature infants human milk at 200 mL/kg/d supplies approximately 25% of their calcium and phosphorus needs for normal bone mineralization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412452759">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412452759">9</xref></sup> Meeting the needs for calcium, phosphorus, and other nutrients would require an unrealistic volume of human milk. Though a greater amount of these minerals can be ingested by premature infants fed special formulas, calcium and phosphorus are less bioavailable in formula and thus may still not meet the need.<sup>10-13</sup> However, mineral needs may be met by using donor human milk (DHM) as a “base” and adding required nutrients back into the milk through supplementation. This practice attempts to conserve the components of human milk that are essential to normal growth and development and that are not present in formula, such as immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, lysozyme, growth factors, enzymes, anti-inflammatory factors, cytokines, and oligosaccharides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412452759">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many studies show that feeding premature infants unfortified human milk during hospitalization leads to decreased growth and bone mineralization during and after infancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412452759">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412452759"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412452759"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412452759">18</xref></sup> Studies show that fortification with calcium and phosphorus lead to improved indicators of mineral homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412452759">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412452759"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412452759"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412452759">21</xref></sup> However, other studies show that when markers of bone mineralization of premature infants fed human milk (DHM or mother’s milk), preterm formula, or human milk fortified with calcium, phosphorus, or preterm formula were compared, there were no significant differences between groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412452759">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412452759">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412452759">23</xref></sup> A study by Fewtrell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412452759">23</xref></sup> showed that bone mineral content improved as the amount of human milk in the diet increased. According to a Cochrane review of human milk fortifiers, although fortification of human milk with multicomponent fortifiers is associated with short-term increases in rates of gain in weight, length, and head circumference, it is not clear if there is an effect on bone mineral content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412452759">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>When high-calcium, preterm formulas were used, the calcium absorption was low, which resulted in increased fecal calcium excretion, impaired fat absorption, decreased gastrointestinal transit time, and increased stool hardness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452759">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412452759">25</xref></sup> all of which may increase the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412452759">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412452759">25</xref></sup> Supplementation with excessive calcium and phosphorus has led to calcium and phosphate bezoars, nephrocalcinosis, and abdominal distension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412452759">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412452759">26</xref></sup> Calcium and phosphorus can be added to human milk in several different forms (eg, fortifiers, formula, and mineral supplements). However, little is known about how these additives differ in the bioavailability of the added minerals or their potential impact on the bioavailability of other milk components.</p>
<p>The primary goal was to study the effect of calcium and phosphorus supplementation of DHM on markers for the digestibility of protein, free fatty acids, and calcium in preterm DHM. We hypothesized that fortification of DHM with minerals according to current hospital protocols would decrease the digestibility of calcium, protein, and fat.</p>

<title>Preparation and In Vitro Digestion of DHM Samples</title>
<sec id="section4-1941406412452759">
<title>Samples</title>
<p>Preterm DHM was shipped from the San Jose Mother’s Milk Bank (San Jose, CA) to our laboratory. Mothers who donated the milk gave signed consent that their milk may be used for research purposes, as is policy for all donations to milk banks of the Human Milk Banking Association of North America. The study was approved by the institutional review board at North Carolina State University. A total of 10 batches of preterm DHM were used in the study and treated according to standard fortification protocols used in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). It is standard protocol for Human Milk Banking Association of North America milk banks to pool milk from 4 to 5 mothers to reduce variability of the nutritional composition. Therefore, milk from 40 to 50 mothers was included in the analyses. Each milk sample was divided, and the aliquots were treated 3 ways, which are representative of current hospital protocols: (1) no treatment, to serve as a control; (2) addition of 0.15 mL calcium glubionate (3.45 mg elemental calcium) per 1 mL milk; and (3) 0.23 mL sodium potassium phosphate (sodium phosphate and potassium phosphate, 2.2 mg phosphate) per 1 mL milk, resulting in a 1.6:1 Ca:P ratio. Calcium glubionate and sodium potassium phosphate were not added together in the current study in order to examine the effects of the additives individually. The DHM samples with added minerals were prepared according to current hospital protocols, and amounts of calcium and phosphorus similar to those added with commercial human milk fortifiers were added.</p>

<title>In vitro digestion protocol</title>
<p>An in vitro digestion model was developed to simulate the gastrointestinal tract of the premature infant. The model was modified from methods of previous investigators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412452759">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412452759">28</xref></sup> In the gastric phase, 0.2 g pepsin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in 5 mL of 0.1 N HCl, and 0.25 mL was added to each 4 mL sample of DHM. Additionally, 1.7 g lipase with similar specificity as human milk lipase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412452759">29</xref></sup> (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was dissolved into 15 mL 0.1 N HCl, and 1.5 mL was added to each DHM sample. Lipase was added in the gastric phase because it has been shown that there is a high degree of gastric lipolysis, even in premature infants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412452759">30</xref></sup> and one objective was to model lipid digestion. The low pH optimum (2.5-6.5), the absence of requirements for cofactors or bile salts, and resistance to pepsin digestion enable gastric lipase to remain active in the infant’s stomach and contribute significantly to fat digestion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412452759">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412452759">30</xref></sup> The DHM samples were adjusted to pH 5.0 by addition of HCl or NaOH and then placed in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 2 hours. They were then placed on ice for 10 minutes to stop digestion.</p>
<p>In the intestinal phase, 0.05 g pancreatin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and 0.3 g bile extract (Sigma, St Louis, MO) were dissolved in 25 mL of 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 1.25 mL of this solution was added to each DHM sample. To add 17.2 mU of lactase (Sigma, St Louis, MO) to each DHM sample, 0.25 g of lactase was dissolved in 200 mL H<sub>2</sub>O, and 2 µL was added to each DHM sample. DHM samples were adjusted to a pH of 7.0 by 1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and to a final volume of 10 mL by addition of cell culture–grade water (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The DHM samples were placed in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 2 hours. They were placed on ice for 10 minutes to stop digestion, and they were then adjusted to pH 7.0.</p>
<p>After the gastric and intestinal phases, the samples were centrifuged at 3500<italic>g</italic> for 1 hour at 4°C. Aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to tubes and stored at −80°C until further analysis, unless samples were analyzed within 24 hours, in which case they were stored at 4°C.</p>

<title>Total Protein</title>
<p>Before in vitro digestion, the apparent protein content of DHM with added calcium and DHM with added phosphate was significantly greater than DHM without added minerals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941406412452759">Figure 1</xref>); however, it was only greater by 0.52 to 0.77 mg/mL, which is clinically insignificant, and this difference could have been a result of analytical variation in the protein assay. Another possibility is that the added calcium and phosphate could increase ionic strength or other parameters leading to increased reduction of Cu<sup>+2</sup> to Cu<sup>+1</sup> in the BCA assay, causing increased BCA chelation with Cu<sup>+1</sup> ions, which would increase the intensity of the purple complex that absorbs light at 562 nm.</p>

<p>Although the results demonstrate that calcium supplementation does not increase fat breakdown in vitro, some clinical studies have shown that calcium supplementation may decrease fat absorption. The effects of calcium from dietary supplements or dairy products on fecal fat excretion in healthy adults were examined in a meta-analysis performed by Christensen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412452759">35</xref></sup> They estimated that increasing calcium intake by 1241 mg/d resulted in an increase in fecal fat of 5.2 g/d and concluded that dietary calcium has the potential to increase fecal fat excretion and aid in weight loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412452759">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies show that calcium supplementation also decreases fat absorption in preterm infants. In metabolic balance studies of 35 healthy premature infants, Chappell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412452759">36</xref></sup> found that oral calcium supplements significantly changed the efficiency of lipid absorption in preterm infants fed enterally. In metabolic balance studies of 6 term infants, DeVizia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412452759">11</xref></sup> found that absorption of fat was significantly decreased by calcium intake, although the small decrease observed may not be relevant clinically.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that calcium increases fat excretion through an interaction of calcium and fatty acids, which results in the formation of insoluble calcium fatty acid soaps, leading to reduced fat absorption. When analyzing the products formed from a lipase reaction as a function of time, Patton and Carey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412452759">37</xref></sup> found that when high levels of calcium (10 mM) were present in the reaction, the amount of fatty acids ionized were increased and a pellet was formed, whereas at low levels of calcium (1 mM), the amount of fatty acids ionized were decreased, and no pellet was formed. Their research supports the observation that calcium promotes the ionization of fatty acids, rendering them unavailable for absorption.</p>

<p>During the processing of DHM, there are many steps that allow for loss of ionized calcium. The mother expresses her milk and it is exposed to air. She then freezes the milk, and it is shipped to the milk bank. The milk bank thaws the milk, pasteurizes it, cultures it for bacterial growth, freezes it again, and ships it to the recipients. As a result of the milk processing, the ionized calcium was negligible in the DHM without added calcium. However, when calcium glubionate was added to the DHM, the amount of ionized calcium returned to the level that is present in freshly expressed milk collected in a way to minimize the loss of ionized calcium. However, in the fresh milk collected by Allen and Neville,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1941406412452759">38</xref></sup> the ionized calcium to total calcium ratio is 1:2.3. In the DHM fortified with calcium, the ionized calcium to total calcium ratio is 1:16.2, indicating that calcium must be added in a much greater amount than that naturally present in human milk to obtain physiological levels of ionized calcium.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The prevention and treatment of metabolic bone disease in premature infants is a major problem. Because human milk has a relatively low calcium and phosphate content, some NICU protocols call for the addition of calcium and phosphorus to DHM, although there are few data on either the chemical or biological effects of this modification. To understand the impact of calcium and phosphorus supplementation on the digestibility of protein, free fatty acids, and calcium in DHM, we performed in vitro digestion of DHM, DHM with added calcium, and DHM with added phosphate as well as analyses of total protein, free amino ends, free fatty acids, and ionized calcium. All analyses were performed according to industry standards. Data from the present study indicate that calcium and phosphorus supplementation do not have a negative impact on total protein, protein breakdown, or protein digestibility. However, added calcium tends to make fat breakdown more difficult as compared with phosphorus supplementation, but this effect was not statistically significant. Added calcium increases ionized calcium, which may replace ionized calcium lost during milk expression, storage, and processing of DHM. Because there are many different possible dosages of calcium and phosphorus and because they may be added in different chemical forms, these data may not apply to all possible regimens. This study did not examine the effect of adding calcium and phosphate together on the components of DHM, so a conclusion cannot be made at this time about whether calcium and phosphorus should be added together or separately in the same feeding. However, it would be impossible to study all possible variations imaginable. Also, an in vitro model may not adequately mimic the digestion of premature infants over a broad range of gestational ages and gut maturity. Nevertheless, these data are somewhat reassuring, in that, in the fairly large doses studied, adding calcium and phosphorus to DHM did not have an appreciable negative impact on the predicted digestibility of macronutrients.</p>
