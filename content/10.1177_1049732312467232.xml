<abstract>
<p>Medical advances in recent years have led to an increased life span for children with progressive, neurodegenerative illnesses. The purpose of this hermeneutic inquiry was to explore the experience of families caring for their child at home. In-depth, audiorecorded interviews with six families (13 interviews) living in western Canada were transcribed and analyzed. The illness journey was revealed to be complex and unpredictable. We discovered many metaphors that spoke to the child’s/family’s life and explored the paradox of duality, such as holding both joy and sorrow, and containing both suffering and love. We outline implications for policy development within the area of respite care and coordination of services for families. The voices of families must be a vital component to influence and guide education and service development within the emerging specialty of pediatric palliative care.</p>

<body>
<p>In spite of advances in medical technology, there remains a group of children for whom cure is not possible; in fact, there are a growing number of children who live for many years with complex, progressive illnesses. Advances in medical care over recent years have led to an increase in life span for these children, who in earlier times would have died from premature birth, congenital anomalies, injuries, and other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467232">Himelstein, Hilden, Boldt, &amp; Weissman, 2004</xref>). When the child and family are considered as the unit of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312467232">Lewis &amp; Prescott, 2006</xref>) and the goal of health and well-being is for all family members, there are a significant number of people affected by the serious illness and death of a child.</p>
<p>Children with progressive neurodegenerative illness (PNDI) can benefit from palliative care from the time of diagnosis of their illness. Less than a third of the children requiring palliative care have a cancer diagnosis, and the remainder have a range of often rare conditions including congenital abnormalities, genetic conditions, and neurodegenerative conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467232">Lenton, Goldman, Eaton, &amp; Southall, 2006</xref>). The population in this study were families who were living with and caring for a child with PNDI. Children with neurodegenerative illness experience a loss of neuromotor skills and experience symptoms arising primarily from the central nervous system. These symptoms include developmental and cognitive delays, seizures, and problems with feeding and mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312467232">Perszyk &amp; Perszyk, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although each condition within the category of neurodegenerative illness is individually rare, as a group, neurodegenerative illnesses are a significant cause of death in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467232">Lenton et al., 2006</xref>). Many of the children with these illnesses live for years, requiring specialized, complex medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467232">Hynson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312467232">Steele, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312467232">2005</xref>). Palliative care for children can be described as
<disp-quote>
<p>the active and total approach to care embracing physical, psychological, and spiritual elements. Care focuses on the enhancement of quality of life for the child and support for the family. This includes the management of distressing symptoms, provision of respite, and support during bereavement. Palliative care may be combined with therapies aimed at reducing or curing the illness or it may be the total focus of care. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312467232">Drake, Frost, &amp; Collins, 2003</xref>, p. 594)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Palliative services for children are in much earlier stages of development than palliative care for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312467232">Liben, Papadatou, &amp; Wolfe, 2008</xref>). The slow and sporadic development of these services is linked to the diverse illness conditions and trajectories of illness.</p>
<p>Much of the pediatric palliative care literature has focused on the population of children who have a cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467232">Hinds, Schum, Baker, &amp; Wolfe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312467232">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>). There is very little research on the population of children and families requiring palliative care services where the child has a diagnosis other than cancer. This paucity of research might be because of the complexity and rarity of many of the conditions, the many variables involved with research of vulnerable children, the difficulty of assessing children with communication problems, and the ethical dilemmas concerning research with this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312467232">Steele et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The chronic illness literature in pediatrics is helpful to consider because the trajectory of illness for children with a noncancerous condition includes periods of relative stability interspersed with times of exacerbation of the illness. This population is also referred to as children who are medically fragile, children with complex medical needs, or children who are technology dependent. Research into chronic pediatric illness has been focused on the complexity of care, demands of caregiving, parental feelings of isolation, and challenges in access to and involvement with the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312467232">Knafl &amp; Deatrick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312467232">Rehm &amp; Bradley, 2005</xref>). This research is applicable to pediatric palliative care because many of the children do experience periods of chronicity in the illness progression. The research literature related to chronic illness, however, does not necessarily address the pervasive grief that families face with the progression of the illness and the impending death of their child. Research studies have begun to reveal the complexity of the experience of families who are living with and caring for a child with PNDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312467232">Steele, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312467232">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312467232">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312467232">Steele &amp; Davies, 2006</xref>). It is important to look deeply into the experiences these families face to understand more fully this area of palliative care practice.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to uncover the experience of families living with a child with PNDI; thus, the methodology of hermeneutic phenomenology, as described primarily by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312467232">Gadamer (1989)</xref>, was well suited to the investigation. The topic of families living in the midst of serious progressive illness is difficult and complex, involving struggles between life and death, joy and sorrow, and suffering and love of the child. Hermeneutic phenomenology is suitable to venture into the contingent understandings that are situated in lives, relationships, contexts, and histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467232">Moules, 2002</xref>). It is through the capturing of experience, by narrative and subsequent interpretation, that a deeper understanding of the families’ experience can be generated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312467232">
<title>Setting and Participants</title>
<p>This study was conducted in western Canada. Participants were family members of children with PNDI. The family was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312467232">Wright and Bell (2009)</xref> as a group of individuals bound by strong emotional ties, a sense of belonging, and a passion for being involved in one another’s lives. Family members in the study included parents, siblings, the ill child, and other significant individuals that the family identified as their family. Families met the criteria for the study if (a) the ill child was no more than 17 years of age and had been diagnosed with PNDI; (b) at least one adult in the family lived with the child and provided care; and (c) the participants were able to speak, read, and write English. In addition to parental consent, minor children aged 7 and older gave their assent. Because of potential stress, a family was excluded if the child had been diagnosed within the previous month or if the child was expected to die in less than a month.</p>
<p>Families were recruited from the palliative care service and the metabolic clinic of a tertiary care facility. Hospital staff made the initial contact with the families to explain the study. If the families agreed, we contacted the parents by telephone, described the study, invited them to participate, and followed up by obtaining written consent at the time of the first interview. Over the course of 7 months, six families—comprised of 27 family members—participated in the study. A total of 6 ill children were observed. There were siblings in four of the families, and one family was also caring for two grandchildren. In one family, two caregivers who were considered family were included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732312467232">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The families gave their preference as to where to meet, and if they preferred to meet together as a family, separately, or both. Sensitivity to the developmental age of the children was considered. The families consented to have the researcher interact with and observe the younger children and the ill children who were not able to participate in the study because of age, the progressive nature of the illness, or verbal communication limitations. We recorded this contact in field notes.</p>
<p>Each adult read and signed the adult consent form agreeing to the use of audiotape and to the transcription of the tape to written text. Parents signed a consent form for siblings 7 years of age and older, and the children signed to give their assent. One ill child was interviewed, and both he and his mother signed the consent form. Ethics approval for this inquiry was granted by the local health research ethics board. Families provided demographic information at the first interview through the development of a genogram. A genogram is a family tree depicting internal family structure, and is very useful as an engagement tool to provide rich data about the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312467232">Wright &amp; Leahey, 2009</xref>). Each participant received a copy of the written consent and contact information for counseling should that service be desired. Within the week following the interview, a phone call provided information concerning the well-being of the respondent. All participants declined the need or desire for follow-up counseling and expressed positive affirmation regarding the interview experience.</p>
<p>Throughout the data collection period we completed 13 interviews, including 4 couples, 4 mothers on their own, 2 siblings, 1 ill child, and 2 caregivers who were considered family. Nine interviews took place in family homes, one took place in a restaurant, and two took place in the hospital. There were eight opportunities to observe and interact with the ill children and younger siblings, and these participant observations we recorded as field notes. We included all data in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312467232">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis of the text began following the first interview and continued throughout the course of the inquiry. Interpretations from each interview informed the preparation and questions for the next interviews. The interpretative analysis called for reflective writing, which is sometimes referred to as journaling or interpretive memo writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467232">Moules, 2002</xref>). This writing began with the initial interview and included writing of field notes and initial interpretations. The reading of previous interviews assisted in this process, as did the listening and relistening to the audiotapes. The audiotapes provided powerful nuances, such as the sound of a 3-year-old child who was unable to speak, but could make sounds that her mother interpreted as they cuddled together on the couch throughout the conversation with the researcher.</p>
<p>The interviews and interactions with the families were colored by great sadness, tears, and feelings of being overwhelmed. In the midst of this suffering, the laughter, love, and joy that the children brought to the families was also evident. We approached the analysis of the topic with some preunderstanding from our experience as nurses in palliative care. Our particular interpretive lens (foresight) oriented us to search for a deeper understanding of families living in the midst of progressive illness and the impending death of their children. This allowed us to enter the hermeneutic circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467232">Moules, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The hermeneutic circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467232">Moules, 2002</xref>) is often used to provide a sense of what is called for in the analysis. The shape of a circle suggests fluidity and repetition, tracing of movement between the whole and parts, continually expanding the circle as new understanding emerges. We entered the circle, into the dynamic process of looking at particulars, turning over knowledge of the topic, acknowledging the continual evolution of knowledge, and eventually finding language to hold the interpretation. We explored Greek mythology, the sacred writings of the Sufi mystics, Buddhist writings, and Judeo-Christian writings to further understand the tension of duality and the human experience of holding ambiguity and uncertainty. Together, through discussions and writing, we developed conceptualizations into interpretations that led to new understandings and insights into the experience of families caring for a child with PNDI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312467232">
<title>Rigor</title>
<p>Our combined backgrounds of experience conducting qualitative studies, and extensive nursing backgrounds working with seriously ill children and their families, contributed to the rigor of this study. We compiled and made available for audit audio recordings of interviews, transcript records, written records of the evolution of data analysis, field note recordings, and reflexive journaling. More than 26 hours of participant interviews provided for prolonged engagement with participants and information-rich data. We reviewed the transcripts separately, and discussed preliminary interpretations following each set of family interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312467232">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>The local ethics review board granted permission to conduct this study. We were particularly sensitive to conducting research with such a vulnerable population. Experience in interviewing children and families mitigated the potential for families’ distress during the data collection process. Strategies to diminish the possibility of participant identification included the use of pseudonyms, careful selection of narrative examples, nondisclosure of individual diagnoses, and alteration of specific information that could increase the likelihood of breaching confidentiality.</p>

<sec id="section8-1049732312467232">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In this section we present the interpretations that emerged from the analysis of families’ experiences of living with and caring for a child with PNDI. The three main discoveries were the families’ experiences of holding predictability and unpredictability, the complexity and relentless care in the home, and the spiritual journey of the families.</p>
<sec id="section9-1049732312467232">
<title>Holding Predictability and Unpredictability</title>
<p>Families began to realize early in their child’s life that the child they had hoped for was ill. The excitement of welcoming a new child into the family became suspended into a world of medical decision making, hospitals, surgeries, tubes and tests, poking and prodding. A father described the early months of his child’s illness as living in a fog, wandering aimlessly and not being able to see clearly. Shock, sadness, and despair descended when illness darkened the hope for a new life, a new child in the family. A sense of helplessness and guilt pervaded the family, a sense that as parents they had somehow failed:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I first had Katie I was very excited and had all these ideas about what it was meaning to be a mom. Because she was sick, it wasn’t really that way. It didn’t turn out to be what we expected at all. In fact, I could never have imagined what it was going to be like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When their child became ill, families faced a long and arduous search for a diagnosis. Sometimes it took months or years, or the specific diagnosis was never found. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312467232">Gadamer (1989)</xref> reminded us of experiences when we are shocked by things that do not concur with our expectations. The arrival of the unexpected in our lives can influence our thinking and bring us to a new understanding of something (Gadamer). Families experienced an overwhelming sense of fear in the early days of living with their ill child:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was afraid. She didn’t roll or anything, but I was afraid of her dying in her sleep and I was afraid of her vomiting and dying . . . It is like living in fear. It is really like living in fear, because if I do something wrong or she is in pain, and I can’t stop it, if she hasn’t gone to the bathroom that day, or if her fluid is in her bladder while she is sleeping and she is going to wake up with an infection or distension or gagging, then she is going to die, or have an infection, be sick, have seizures, and maybe die. She stops breathing while she is having her seizures. . . . I feel like it is up to me to save her, and it is up to me to find out how to save her life. That is the fear, and that is what I live in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This mother could not leave her child’s bedside for fear that her child would die. The overwhelming fear could quickly lead to exhaustion. All of the families spoke of exhaustion, of the relentlessness of caring for their children, which left little time for sleep. The early days of illness were about survival—the physical survival of children and families. Time was no longer measured in terms of days, months, and years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312467232">
<title>A Change in Time and Space</title>
<p>In modern societies, time is conventionally considered as being linear or historical. This kind of time, which can be referred to as <italic>chronos</italic> time, is chronological, measured in mundane units such as minutes, hours, and days. The ancient Greeks acknowledged two notions of time. One was chronos time, and the other was <italic>kairos</italic>, a Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467232">Bruce, 2007</xref>). Time slowed down and was suspended for these families. A mother said, “You live for each day. You look for the future but you don’t look far.” In spite of all the difficulties and challenges, she said, “His life has been full; he has probably lived more life in seventeen years than somebody has in fifty years.” The conventional understanding of time gave way to an ability to treasure the moments that were there. Families began to live in a liminal space where they were able to hold uncertainty.</p>
<p>The word <italic>liminal</italic> has its roots in the Latin word <italic>limen</italic>, meaning threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467232">Mish, 2007</xref>). The times of living in the threshold, of being in the in-between, have been referred to as transitional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312467232">Hockey &amp; James, 2002</xref>). There is a dying of the old; that which was has passed away, and there is waiting for the new to arrive. This period of transition was not a one-time experience; there was a returning to this liminal place, this time of transition, over and over again. In this liminal space many families found an uneasy acceptance of the illness:
<disp-quote>
<p>You come to terms with that. As soon as you come to terms with that and have a sort of acceptance, then it is easier for you. You are more readily willing to accept the fact that, okay, yes, you need a breathing tube, and yes, you need a wheelchair. Each time you accept one of those steps it is enforcing that you know that yes, my child is ill, and those things are much easier to deal with. You can make the best life for your child when you do this. It is easier when you come to terms with it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Families gradually learned to appreciate the quality of their children’s lives, letting go of the idea that quality was measured in the length of the child’s life.</p>
<p>As the families came to terms with the illness, they trusted that the professional staff at the hospital were the experts who would be able to answer questions and offer guidance. Slowly and painfully, the families began to realize that this was not so. Often health care professionals had never heard of these rare conditions and did not know what to do, what to expect. A parent said, “Sometimes you try and find somebody to go to and hope that you have some answers, and you never have those answers, and that’s hard.” The families of these children struggled to find someone who could help guide them. They began to trust themselves, to realize they could listen to their intuition, learn from their child, and trust their own experience of caring for their child:
<disp-quote>
<p>It took me a while to realize that I was the expert on Katie, and what the doctors knew about her really wasn’t anything. . . . In the beginning I expected that we would come there, and she would have symptoms, and they would know what was wrong and know how to fix it. But that wasn’t the case, and that was very, very hard for me to come to terms with.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312467232">
<title>Frozen in Grief</title>
<p>There were many losses along the way: the loss of the child’s physical and cognitive abilities, the loss of the family’s hopes and dreams for their child, the loss of what they anticipated for family life. The loss was in front of them as their child gradually lost neurological ability:
<disp-quote>
<p>[He] peaked at about two and a half years with his abilities. He was able to cruise around [crawl], pull himself up on furniture, and walk around. He never spoke, but he was quite interactive in many ways . . . he went from being able to crawl and walk, lift himself up on furniture, and things like that, and play with toys and things, to not being able to do anything like that.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This type of grief, of living loss, is not well understood. There is a component of grief that might be considered anticipatory, anticipating the eventual death of the child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467232">Rando, 1999</xref>). It was, however, more than this; the grief that pervaded the families was paralyzing.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312467232">Roos (2002)</xref> referred to living loss as chronic sorrow and described it as a natural grief reaction to losses that are not final, but continue to be present in the life of the griever. Chronic sorrow is a set of pervasive, profound, continuing, and recurring grief responses resulting from a significant loss or absence of crucial aspects of oneself (self-loss), or another living person (other-loss) to whom there is a deep attachment (Roos). The loss is ongoing and requires continual energy and adaptation. Eventually there can be many rewards and unexpected pleasures in this living loss, such as survival, self-discovery, growth, and transcendence. Perhaps this is so, but in the early days of the illness the families were frozen in their grief.</p>
<p>The nature of the loss is disenfranchised, a loss that is not socially sanctioned, openly acknowledged, or publicly mourned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312467232">Doka, 2002</xref>). For these families, the disenfranchised grief was largely because of the social stigma of recognition that a child could possibly die before adulthood; it was not socially acceptable. The child’s journey toward death was lengthy, filled with ups and downs, times of crisis, and times of stability. Death was inevitable, but when and how the death would occur was uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312467232">Steele, 2000</xref>). This lengthy and uncertain trajectory of illness led to a lack of open recognition for the grief that families experienced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312467232">
<title>Settling Into the Unexpected</title>
<p>Life began to settle a little. The medications were in place, the seizures were manageable, and the children experienced some stability within the trajectory of illness. One mother described this time as “a breath of fresh air,” a time when the family could let down their guard and relax. When the child was doing well, the family was able to breathe more easily: “For the most part, things were pretty steady, and we were able to do a lot of things, and go a lot of places, and enjoy times as a family.” There was a sense of thankfulness during this time; however, there was also uncertainty, not knowing how long this stability would last.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312467232">Steele (2000)</xref> described the trajectory of progressive, neurodegenerative illness as one of leveling off and stability, a crisis, dropping off the plateau, and leveling off again, rather than a steady, predictable decline. The periods of stability were times to relax as a family, but there was uneasiness. One family described these times as having a false sense of security, when the family was able to let down their guard, to think of other things, to pursue their own interests, and not to be so intensely involved with their child’s illness. In the midst of tentative security, there was a lurking dread that there would be a crisis ahead.</p>

<title>Moving Closer to Death</title>
<p>When the anticipated death is that of a child, it is particularly difficult to comprehend. One father said, “A child dying before you is not acceptable; that in itself, people can’t imagine how to deal with it.” The death of a child seemed inexplicable with the natural cycle of life. The families did not know when death would arrive, but they began to sense changes in their child. The stress and fears of the early days of the illness returned to haunt the family:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now the last couple of months, Len [father] and I have both been very worried, because I had been thinking that he [ill child] is not responding the way he should, and the way he normally would. He isn’t recuperating as quickly, or like he should, or used to. His care needs have significantly increased with his suctioning and constant monitoring. I have been thinking whether this will be the last year or not, and Len, independently of me, was thinking the same thing. We were both kind of afraid to talk to each other about it. What if we’re wrong bringing up all these issues? The stress of these last couple of months has definitely . . . we are definitely going through the bad times right now. They aren’t as bad as they could be, but they are definitely not the good times. So the stress level has risen because of that. We have checked out some funeral homes, and thought about some of the things that we would like to do, end-of-life things. That obviously raises the stress level.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This couple realized individually and then together that they were facing the end of their child’s life. The long plateaus of stability were over. The stress of the early days returned as they faced the unknown, the uncertainty of the future.</p>
<p>There were internal questions that the families wrestled with when they looked into the future. One mother spoke of her mixed feelings, of wishing the end would come quickly, and yet also not wanting to lose her child. There was an intermittent quality of wanting the suffering to be over and not wanting it to be over, of holding on and letting go:
<disp-quote>
<p>My hope is that she would go more suddenly than have to face ongoing deterioration, and yet I see a child who very much loves her life and what she is doing right now, and so I don’t wish for that. I don’t want to see interventions, like she couldn’t have CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] because of her osteoporosis. I don’t want her to have a g-tube [gastrostomy tube]; I think it would just be a place of obsession and worry, and I know that about her. And Shelley is a worrier; she worries about everything and I guess I worry about her losing that sense of herself and who she is as a person, and I hope she doesn’t lose that connection between her and I. That would hurt a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another family spoke of the importance of family relationships. The mother hoped “that he has had a good strong sense of family, and he feels that.” Her hope was that he would know that he was loved, that he belonged, that he was connected. As in other research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312467232">Contro, Larson, Scofield, Sourkes, &amp; Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312467232">Wolfe et al., 2000</xref>), the fear of the child experiencing pain was foremost in the family’s mind: “My greatest fear is that his passing will be painful and hugely traumatic.” The family desired choice; they had definite ideas about what interventions they believed were appropriate for their child. They had thoughts about the preferred location of their child’s death—at home or in hospital. Some of these decisions shifted and changed as the situation shifted and changed, but having the choice was most important to the family:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our hopes are that his passing . . . the hospital will let us bring him home so he can pass [die] where he is comfortable. He will have that sense of love and belonging, whereas in a situation filled with pain and he has to be hooked up to a bunch of different things at the hospital and we can’t take him home, he wouldn’t be comfortable. I think he deserves to be comfortable when he does pass.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents worried about other family members, their other children, and the extended family. One family spoke of their worry that their other children could be carriers of the disease. Because of the rarity of the condition, they had been waiting for years to determine whether their teenage daughter could be a carrier, and what that would mean for her. Another mother spoke of her concern for her younger child, who lived a sheltered life so as to protect the ill child:
<disp-quote>
<p>And Robbie, for that matter, too. I haven’t put him in any daycares or any play groups because I am worried about him bringing home germs and getting Sean sick. I’m sure he has suffered socially as a result of that. And he doesn’t have friends and that. And so, how am I going to integrate him socially? That kind of thing. Robbie all of a sudden will have a totally different life after Sean is gone, and how will he adjust to that? Children are resilient, right? So hopefully it will be good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section14-1049732312467232">
<title>The Complexity and Relentlessness of Care in the Home</title>
<p>The children in the study required intensive caregiving support. Only 1 of the 6 ill children was able to walk, and she required assistance. The other 5 children required considerable help with mobility, including lifting and the use of wheelchairs. Four of the 6 children required tube feeding, and 3 were supported by breathing machines through the night, such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Four of the children experienced seizures, and 4 were incontinent and required regular diaper changes. Only 2 of the 6 children were able to communicate verbally. Five of the children were cognitively delayed; the sixth child was a teenager who was able to keep up intellectually with his peers and was attending Grade 12 at a local high school, with the assistance of a nurse.</p>
<p>One mother hesitated when we inquired about the care needs of her child:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you first asked me about this question I kind of hesitated, because I just do it, I don’t think about it, I just do it. I don’t think it is anything difficult, but if I had to write it all down, it is pages and pages and pages, and I realize it is more complicated than I think, but I’m just so used to doing it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The intensive care became part of the normal routine for the family. There was a taken-for-granted quality that unfolded, and it was only when this mother stopped to reflect that she realized this level of care was out of the ordinary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312467232">Heidegger (1962)</xref> wrote about situations out of the ordinary realm of things as unready-to-hand situations, as opposed to ready-to-hand, which are usual situations in which we are comfortable and at home. Even in the difficulty of caring for seriously ill children, when life became smooth and more-or-less unreflective, these situations fit Heidegger’s description of ready to hand. For this mother and others, the complex caregiving became a part of the everyday life for the families.</p>
<p>A mother described her teenage son’s care as “total care, one hundred percent total care.” At night he required a caregiver at his bedside: “He cannot be left in bed alone. Wayne wears a full face mask with a breathing machine, right? A BIPAP. If he was to choke, he cannot get the mask off. He needs somebody with him.” Children in general are expected to gain independence and require less and less physical care, but for these children the care requirements became more and more challenging as the disease progressed, and as the children grew physically.</p>
<sec id="section15-1049732312467232">
<title>Juggling the finances</title>
<p>The cost to the families of caring for the children was significant. Expenses included the cost of medications, supplies, special equipment such as wheelchairs and breathing machines, and modifications to houses and/or vehicles. Families received funding from various sources such as the government, insurance coverage, and local service clubs. Many families spoke of inconsistencies in funding, and much of it was dependent on the family’s ability to write proposals and to lobby for funding. It seemed that those who were better able to put forth their case received more funding.</p>
<p>There were hidden costs such as the loss of income from one of the parents, usually the mother, who needed to stay home with the child and assume the majority of caregiving. Of the six families in the study, five of the mothers were not employed outside of the home; one of these worked part time from her home, and another worked in the family business primarily from home. The mother in the sixth family was a single mother who worked full time to support the family. Even though there was funding available from a variety of sources, there were many costs that were not covered. One father said, “On average, we spend about a thousand dollars on him a month.” The funding agencies covered a percentage of the costs, but the remainder was the responsibility of the family. Families struggled over many years to juggle finances, lobby for funding, and make ends meet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312467232">
<title>Sharing the care of the children</title>
<p>The intensity of care in the homes often resulted in families becoming housebound. Home became a cage rather than a castle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312467232">Yantzi, Rosenberg, &amp; McKeever, 2006</xref>) where family members, especially mothers, were restricted in their ability to come and go. The taken-for-granted activity of getting out of the house became problematic and difficult. Gradually families came to the realization that they could not sustain the responsibility for the 24-hour care of their child. Trusting others to share the care of the children was challenging. Many families struggled to find information about available resources: “So I really looked into what I could do, and every parent I met I was asking what they were doing, and every social worker I met I would ask what are my options.”</p>
<p>Families eventually discovered that funding was available for respite care. Research has identified the provision of respite as an important component of pediatric palliative care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312467232">Liben et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312467232">Steele &amp; Davies, 2006</xref>). Respite is considered “the provision of appropriately trained individual(s) to care for terminally ill children (for a specified period of time), so that the usual caregiver may have a complete break from the demands of care” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312467232">Horsburgh, 2002</xref>, p. 99). Most families wove a tapestry of shared care, which included a blend of respite care that included paid and unpaid caregivers, family members, and others. Each solution was creative, and differed for each family. In the words of one mother, parents never totally experienced a break from the demands of caregiving:
<disp-quote>
<p>You never really get a break, you never get a break from the weight of the responsibility. . . . It is there and it remains present whether you are with your child or not. And to not acknowledge that is to deny part of yourself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Five of the six families in the study had some form of live-in assistance with the 24-hour demands of caregiving. One family employed three women who had been educated as nurses in another country but were not licensed to practice in Canada. The funding for their services was provided through a program of self-managed care, with additional funding from the father’s work insurance plan. With caregivers in place, life began to open up other possibilities, other ways to be as a couple, as a family:
<disp-quote>
<p>I see that she is less stressed, too. I think she picks up on when we are tired and stressed, and trying desperately to help her, and I’m exhausted. My care for her isn’t as good as when I come home happy and want to play with her. She knows that, and she knows when I am able to help her more.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The caregivers hired by the families often stayed with them for many years, and close relationships developed with all family members. Two of the interviews in this research study were with hired caregivers, individuals the respective family had determined were like family, and therefore requested that they be included in the study. Both of these caregivers were involved with the same family. One was a licensed practical nurse who had worked with the family for 16 of the 17 years of the child’s life.</p>

<sec id="section17-1049732312467232">
<title>A Spiritual Journey of Mystery and Gift</title>
<p>Living with a seriously ill child is indeed a mystery, in many ways beyond understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467232">Mish, 2007</xref>). Something emerged in the midst of all the families that became larger than themselves, something that helped them to live amid great suffering. This invisible presence held them up and was universal regardless of the religious tradition they professed, if any. There is a universality of the spiritual experience that seems fundamental to all human life. One mother described her son as having “a special aura around him. He is like an angel given to you. And he is, he’s just . . . I don’t know, he is special.” Another mother spoke of her daughter as “a sacred being who is in my life as my teacher, to keep me on the path that I am supposed to follow.”</p>
<p>The language of spirituality is increasingly used to capture the presence of the divine. No longer rooted within formal religion, spirituality is described as the universal search for meaning, connectedness, energy, and transcendence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467232">Pesut, 2008</xref>). This connection is about issues of the soul that concern our deepest values and meaning. Spirituality is a dimension of humanness that is unquantifiable, mysterious, and individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312467232">Byrne, 2007</xref>). It is an ongoing dynamic process that reflects and expresses the human spirit and integrates all human dimensions, the mind, body, and spirit, for a sense of wholeness and well-being.</p>
<p>The inability to fully explain what it is to live with such ill children resonated with the families as they struggled to find words to describe the mystery of their children’s lives and their experience as a family in the midst of such suffering. There were things left unsaid that were beyond words. One father pondered his questions and wonderings:
<disp-quote>
<p>Our understanding and vision is so limited. We don’t know what’s behind this, but I’m sure that there is something behind this. It is not because of a mistake or something—no, I don’t believe in that. There is a philosophy behind this. We might find out, we might not; we are going to know one day, but not right now, or for a long time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Family members discovered that their faith, their trust in this invisible presence, helped them to face and live with whatever came their way. A live-in caregiver spoke poetically of the spiritual connection he believed would continue even following the death of the child:
<disp-quote>
<p>The spirit is a collective thing and is always ongoing. That spirit is part of our loving, and when that child passes away, a piece of the heart of that child becomes a piece of our own heart, and we have to sit there and hang onto that, and that becomes a part of us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section18-1049732312467232">
<title>The circular nature of a gift</title>
<p>A gift is not something we acquire by our own efforts. It is not merely something we purchase; it is bestowed on us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312467232">Hyde, 1983</xref>). The giving of a gift is not static. A true gift must not be held tightly, but the spirit of the gift, the giving, must be passed on and on. Whatever we are given is meant to be given away again. A gift must always move, and it moves in a circular pattern (Hyde). What these children brought to their families over and over again, the courage to become something more than they thought they could be, was not only returned in full to the care and love of the child, but also passed on to others, to other family members and to the community.</p>
<p>Family members were profoundly influenced by the children. One sibling planned to seek a career as a respiratory therapist, a role she learned through her experience at home with her sick brother. A mother commented that her son had taught her what was truly important in life, and that this experience had an impact on the whole family. She had grown as a person and had become more than she thought she could be:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sean has taught me so much on an individual basis. He has taught me confidence in myself. . . . People respect me. He has taught me how to take care of my own emotional well-being and learn how to live a healthy emotional life, because up to this point I didn’t know how to do that. Teaching me what the significant things in life are.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many families explained how the experience of living with an ill child in the family had influenced other children in the family, and they had become more caring. There is, however, a danger in romanticizing this experience of families, and of considering these children, parents, siblings, and caregivers as heroes or martyrs. The families did what they had to do in the midst of pain and great suffering. They survived; they lived day to day, mostly in the moment, not looking too far ahead.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312467232">
<title>Living with duality</title>
<p>Families were eventually able to live with the paradox of holding the duality of joy and sorrow. They were able to hold happiness, love, courage, grief, extreme sadness, and particularly fear. One mother eloquently described this holding of duality:
<disp-quote>
<p>I live in a constant state of desperate happiness. I always want to be with my baby and cherish every moment with her. I try to hang on to every happy look and smile, while at the same I live in fear of her death. . . . I try so hard not to be depressed because when I’m upset I miss the good that is happening right now. But I’m living with fear and sadness every moment of my life, while at the same time allowing myself to be happy and smile and enjoy life. It takes some practice to live this way. . . . It is possible to have sadness, fear, and happiness coexisting in you at one time, though. I know, because I am doing it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Living with joy and sorrow is part of the human condition. There was the sense of an invisible strength holding this tension of duality in the midst of suffering and hope. Holding of paradox brings change and transformation. The word <italic>paradox</italic> comes from the Greek <italic>para</italic>, meaning contrary to, and <italic>doxa</italic>, meaning opinion. A paradox is a statement or tenet contrary to received opinion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312467232">Hoad, 1986</xref>). It is something that is contradictory or opposed to common sense, and yet it is perhaps true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467232">Mish, 2007</xref>). Throughout the illness trajectory, families lived in the in-between, where they learned to hold this duality.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The intent of this inquiry was to gain a deeper understanding of the experience of families who are living with and caring for a child with PNDI. Existing literature on this topic does not focus sufficiently on the family experience. A better understanding of the uncertainty, joys, sorrows, and everyday challenges these families experience will lead to more comprehensive care and support for them through the many months and years of the child’s illness.</p>
<sec id="section21-1049732312467232">
<title>Support of Children and Families</title>
<p>Families in this study spoke of the importance of their relationships with care providers. Unlike children with a cancer diagnosis, the majority of the children and families in this study were not connected with a consistent interdisciplinary team with whom ongoing, long-term relationships could be forged and fostered. Children with PNDI are cared for primarily in the home by their family members. Their care is supported by a variety of agencies including community services, the family doctor, and several specialty clinics at the tertiary center. Research findings have confirmed the need for a key worker or case coordinator in the care of children with complex needs, to be a consistent presence throughout the long journey of connection with the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312467232">Carter, Cummings, &amp; Cooper, 2007</xref>). Many adult oncology centers are beginning to develop a system of nurse navigators who assist individuals and families as personal guides in the health care system and function as liaisons between health care providers, services, and patients, enhancing both the quality and continuity of their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467232">Case, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A key coordinator can assist with equitable access to resources and perhaps lessen the burden of completing complicated application forms and seeking resources. Key coordinators can also help to promote seamless relationships between agencies. Connecting families with a key coordinator, however, is not a straightforward matter, but rather depends on the context of the family situation. Families in this study connected with a variety of key individuals, including a family doctor in a rural community, a primary nurse in an ambulatory care clinic, a home care nurse, a community social worker, and a hospital chaplain.</p>
<p>There are many ways that nurses, together with an interdisciplinary team, can be helpful in listening to the family’s hopes and fears, offering choices, and realizing that what might be the right decision for one family might not be the right one for another. In a culture in which technology and cure promotion can offer endless possibilities, decision making requires careful consideration. Open dialogue is vitally important and must include attention to power dynamics. The voices of the family have often been ignored or silenced, and at times decisions are made without their input and expertise. Regular team meetings and case conferences that include representation from all specialty areas, as well as the family, are helpful because care priorities shift and new challenges arrive. The use of ethics consultation teams can also assist health care providers and families to wrestle with moral and ethical decision making.</p>
<p>Keeping the entire family unit in mind is of great importance. A small gesture of inquiring about the siblings at home can be helpful to parents while they juggle the multiple responsibilities of caring for ill children and the entire family. Family members, especially fathers, are sometimes unable to attend the appointments with health care professionals, and feel left out, like outsiders looking in. The responsibility of caregiving, attending appointments, and being with the ill child in hospital often rests with mothers. Siblings, fathers, grandparents, and extended family can feel disregarded, and must be included creatively in the care of the family.</p>
<p>The terminology of palliative care is at times troublesome, because it is still linked to end-of-life care, with the belief in minimizing treatment interventions. This is especially worrisome for this population with lengthy illness trajectories, where there is a need for intense care in areas such as seizure management, nutritional support, and respiratory challenges. The findings from this study indicate that families are well aware that their children will likely face an early death, and they welcome the opportunity to have conversations about difficult topics such as death and dying. Some teams have identified themselves as supportive care teams or advanced care teams to avoid the terminology of palliative care. The relationship between palliative care teams and children, families, and other care providers requires further research.</p>
<p>Families often live in isolation from friends and extended family members. Parent support groups and sibling groups can be powerful ways to support families. These groups provide an opportunity for families to connect with other families who are undergoing a similar experience. They can provide a forum for discussion, sharing of resources, mutual support, and education. Children with PNDI are living longer because of advances in medical care. Some children will live into early adulthood, and they must make the transition from pediatric services and funding sources to adult services. Findings from this research confirm that this is a painful and frustrating experience for families who are so closely connected to pediatric health care providers over a lengthy period of time. Further research and strategies to help guide this process are required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1049732312467232">
<title>Nurturing the Spirit</title>
<p>The findings from this research reveal that nurturing the in-between space includes the acknowledgment of the spiritual journey of the family as well as those who walk with them. No longer can this spiritual work be allocated only to the church, faith communities, and chaplains. Health care providers who are in relationships with children and families must all accept the responsibility to support the spiritual journey of the family. Acknowledging their own mortality is helpful in supporting children and families.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312467232">Wright (2005)</xref> offered an approach for nurses as a nonreligious, practical guide for negotiating the crossroads where spirituality, illness, and healing meet. In the care of persons with serious illness, interventions can be utilized that include acknowledging suffering, inviting, listening to, and witnessing stories of suffering, recognizing and challenging our own constraining beliefs. Included in this approach is creating a healing context to reduce suffering, inviting reflections about suffering, reverencing, and prayer. These interventions can be helpful for health care professionals in the practice of spiritual care.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312467232">Rushton (2005)</xref> conceptualized an integrated model of pediatric palliative care that addressed clinical, moral, and ethical uncertainties. This model integrates attunement and presence as capacities for being with children and families. Strategies for integrating palliative care into pediatric practice across settings include listening, respect for children and parents, collaborative connections, management of uncertainty, accepting ambiguity, and commitment to self-care. A focus on spirituality is an integral part of interdisciplinary education for health care professionals. This focus shifts from a concern primarily with epistemology to one that considers the ontological dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467232">Doane &amp; Varcoe, 2008</xref>). Such a shift concerns how we are; our ways of being and relating to ourselves, to knowledge, to one another, and to our environments in complex moments of practice. It is more about being than doing; it is about setting aside the worry about what to say, being present and willing to stand in the midst of suffering.</p>

<sec id="section23-1049732312467232">
<title>Relational Ethics in Program Development Education</title>
<p>Relational ethics is not only concerned with individual relationships between care providers and family members, but also about broader systems issues such as policy development, interdisciplinary education, and collaboration within interprofessional teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467232">Bergum &amp; Dossetor, 2005</xref>). Families must be included as equal partners to wrestle together with the difficult ethical questions of what ought to be done and what can be done to ensure the well-being of the entire family. Societal attitudes, the diversity of conditions and trajectory of illness, and the complexity of care contribute to the challenge of establishing cost-effective, comprehensive palliative care services for children and families.</p>
<sec id="section24-1049732312467232">
<title>Raising awareness of pediatrics within palliative care</title>
<p>The Romanow report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312467232">2002</xref>) recommendations for home-based palliative services up to a limited 6-month period showed a lack of insight and understanding of the needs of dying children and their families. Children with PNDI might require palliative care services their entire lives, and palliative home care services—including grief support—should be in place to support them throughout the lengthy trajectory of illness. There must be a strong pediatric voice within an overall national strategy for palliative care to ensure that the population of dying children and their families is not lost within the broad palliative care umbrella. There are many commonalities in the philosophy and principles of palliative care for both adults and children. There are, however, unique perspectives regarding children and their families that must be considered.</p>
<p>In a recent report of a national strategy, Senator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467232">Carstairs (2010)</xref> acknowledged that quality palliative care is the right of every Canadian. The needs of dying children and their families must be articulated at the national policy level to have a voice amidst the pressures and needs of growing adult palliative care demands. Palliative care for children requires consideration of a distinct approach involving those groups already experienced in children’s services, such as the provincial ministries of education, health, and children’s services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1049732312467232">
<title>Raising awareness of palliative care within children’s services</title>
<p>Although the funding and strategies for a national palliative care framework are decided at a federal level, there is a provincial mandate in Canada for the provision of health and health care services. Reform must occur at the provincial and subprovincial levels of government to support children with PNDI and their families. This population is hidden within the broader services for children with complex needs or children who are medically fragile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312467232">Alberta Children’s Services, 2006</xref>). Many of these children could benefit from coordinated palliative care services in the sense that they have a life-limiting or life-threatening illness, and there is a strong likelihood that they will die before adulthood.</p>
<p>Policies pertaining to respite care are also in urgent need of review and reconsideration. Funding for this important service seems to be readily available to families; however, there are challenges in getting access to adequate respite. Families are often responsible for recruiting, hiring, and training caregivers, and overseeing all aspects of care provision. Both in-home and out-of-home respite are urgently required to truly provide families with a break from the overwhelming responsibility of caring for their child over a lengthy period of time, to ensure the well-being of all family members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1049732312467232">
<title>Palliative care education and research</title>
<p>Education related to the care of seriously ill and dying children and their families is required across all areas of pediatrics, including acute, chronic, and community care. Palliative educational programs must be far reaching and embedded in undergraduate and graduate curriculums. Opinions of families must be incorporated into interdisciplinary education using videotapes and panel discussions. There is also a need for increased ethics education and more interdisciplinary discussion of complex cases.</p>
<p>There are many areas for potential research in the field of pediatric palliative care, including ethical and clinical decision making, grief and bereavement, family caregivers, existential and spiritual concerns, and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312467232">Straatman, Cadell, Davies, Siden, &amp; Steele, 2008</xref>). Outcome measures relevant to the child and family are needed to measure the effectiveness of palliative services and interventions. Research to improve the understanding of the relationship between palliative teams and families and other primary health care teams might assist in diminishing the barriers to the referral processes. Further research in the areas of respite support for families and transitioning of children to adult services is required. There is a need to understand more deeply the experience of hired caregivers in family homes. The expansion of research in these areas will increase understanding of the family experience and contribute to better care for children and families.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Families in this study illuminated the everyday experience of living with a seriously ill and dying child. A better understanding of the uncertainty, the joy, the sorrow, and the everyday challenges that families experience can lead to more comprehensive care and support for families through the lengthy trajectory of the child’s illness. The findings bring to light many pragmatic considerations for nurses and other clinicians. Health care professionals need to integrate a system of care that bridges hospital and home, with the recognition that families are experts in the care of their child. Policy development primarily in the area of respite must be reconsidered creatively to meet the needs of families. Further research and education is essential to contribute to the optimal care and well-being of these children and their families.</p>
