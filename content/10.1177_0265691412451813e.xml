<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813e"><title>Jason Philip Coy, Benjamin Marschke and David Warren Sabean, eds, <italic>The Holy Roman Empire, Reconsidered</italic>, Spektrum: Publications of the German Studies Association, Volume 1, Berghahn: New York, 2010; 328 pp., 6 figs; 9781845457594, £70.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>There is a strong sense of <italic>Aufbruchstimmung</italic> about this book, that is a readiness to explore pastures new, both in terms of launching an interdisciplinary publication series and in presenting an Anglophone audience with a survey of new departures in the historiography of German-speaking Europe. The result is a very welcome collection which will be useful for a range of purposes, be it general orientation about an innovative field of scholarship, framing new research questions in late medieval and early modern studies or adding fresh materials to courses for advanced students.</p>
<p>The conceptual umbrella for this project is the ‘new’ political history, a branch of the ongoing ‘cultural turn’ in the humanities and social sciences. Virtually all contributors, a majority of which are based in German academia, see it as a major new paradigm. As André Krischer emphasizes in his concluding remarks: ‘The cultural approach ... is not restricted to certain topics, but can be used for the interpretation of all subjects’ (269). The volume grew out of a German Studies Association meeting, but it is above all indebted to the methods and approaches pursued by two research clusters at the universities of Münster and Constance. In different, if interrelated ways, they explore the meanings of symbolic communication and the transformative impact of new media (like script and print) on human interaction, which remained dominated by face-to-face exchange well into the early modern period. The editors, who have ensured that all translations are of a very high standard, structure the 14 brief contributions into four sections. Rather more relevant than these somewhat tenuous groupings is the fact that few essays deal with the empire <italic>as such</italic>, but rather with aspects of the political culture at various levels <italic>within</italic> its highly differentiated structure. Cities are the primary point of reference for Philip Hoffmann-Rehnitz, Patrick Oelze and Alexander Schlaak; nobles and princes for Elizabeth Harding, Michaela Hohkamp, Benjamin Marschke, Michael Sikora and Werner Trossbach; confessional groups for Ralf-Peter Fuchs, Andreas Kalipke, David M. Luebke and Michael Printy; and territorial diets for Tim Neu. The examination of the visibility of monarchy by Len Scales is most closely focused on the empire, although the other contributions – ranging thematically from media change, collective memory and group identities via dynastic marriages, eccentric rulers and depositions of princes to legal conflicts, the search for consensus and nation-building – all help to sharpen our understanding of the complex interplay between central, regional and local dimensions in the pre-modern German lands.</p>
<p>Only a few of the many interesting features of the volume can be highlighted here. In line with the overall historiographical trend of the last few decades, the Holy Roman Empire appears as a dynamic polity commanding considerable prestige, in stark contrast to the ‘failed nation’ consensus shared by earlier generations of scholars and it spite of its limited tangible powers. The single most prominent argument relates to the significance of ritual and ceremony: rather than mere reflections of rank and power, issues such as precedence, seating arrangements and voting sequence are credited with constitutive roles in the generation and continuous re-negotiation of political entities. Imperial and territorial diets, for example, should not be seen as mere legislative instruments with a little pomp added for ornamentation, but as platforms for symbolic communication between the different parties involved in the forging of territorial units. Forms produce order and – as Jason Coy stresses in his introduction – historical analysis of communication networks and processes can be much enhanced by recourse to Niklas Luhmann’s ‘social systems theory’ (3).</p>
<p>The clear conceptual focus provides this anthology with unusual coherence, but as with all programmatic statements, some notes of caution might be sounded. Scholarly reservations about the hegemonic claims of the cultural turn are relegated to footnotes and there is little acknowledgement of other ways in which the Holy Roman Empire has been reconsidered in recent scholarship. No one book can hope to provide a comprehensive survey, of course, but it is fair to say that spatial theory or musicological approaches have provided further fruitful research frameworks in the last few years and that a series of more ‘conventional’ fields – republicanism, <italic>gute Policey</italic>, military history, <italic>Gutsherrschaft</italic> – have been advanced in imaginative fashion, too. Overall, though, this collection offers an excellent introduction to a stimulating area in early modern German studies and an auspicious start to the new ‘Spektrum’ series.</p>
