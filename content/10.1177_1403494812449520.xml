<title>Aims:</title>
<p>Social benefits aim to bring marginalised citizens back into the labour force. As benefits constitute a burden for tax payers, attention has been given to measure the effect. We used register data to assess the employment effect of rehabilitation benefit; the most liberal social benefit in Denmark.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812449520">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We used data on rehabilitation benefits paid during 1994–2004. In the study design, special care was given to overcome selection bias. We identified municipalities with most frequent (generous) and least frequent (stingy) use of rehabilitation benefit, controlling for confounders (step 1). From the generous municipalities, population subgroups where ≥10% received rehabilitation benefit (vulnerable group) were identified based on age, sex, education, cohabitation, children, and health (step 2). Outcome measure was employment rate in 2005 for vulnerable groups in generous municipalities compared with vulnerable groups in stingy municipalities, controlled for municipality employment rate, i.e. a ratio of ratios (step 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494812449520">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Use of rehabilitation benefit varied 10-fold across the 271 Danish municipalities. The employment rate in 2005 for vulnerable groups was lower in generous than in stingy municipalities. The ratio of ratios was 0.915 (95% CI 0.888–0.945) for men and 0.919 (95% CI 0.896–0.942) for women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812449520">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p><bold>No positive employment effect of generous use of rehabilitation benefit was found. Although residual confounding cannot be excluded, it is nevertheless remarkable that the possibly positive effect of rehabilitation benefit was not sufficiently large to become visible, even in a study particularly designed to eliminate selection biases and to control for confounding.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Denmark is famous for its flexicurity system, which is a combination of flexibility for the employers, social security for the employees, and an active labour market policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449520">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449520"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449520">3</xref>]. One of the most generous and long-term, government-paid supports is the so-called rehabilitation benefit. Rehabilitation may serve three purposes: primary rehabilitation aimed at keeping the client on the labour market, secondary rehabilitation aimed at re-establishing the client on the labour market, and tertiary rehabilitation aimed at improving the client’s quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449520">4</xref>]. Provision of rehabilitation benefit falls within primary and secondary rehabilitation, and it fills two roles in the flexicurity triangle: a social security aspect in providing living expenses, and an active labour market aspect in upgrading qualifications. To qualify for this benefit, the recipient must have an impaired ability to work due to physical, mental health, or social problems or a combination. The rehabilitation benefit covers living expenses at a much higher level than the normal student grant during a period of education/training for a new type of job and it is a precondition for entitlement that a rehabilitation plan has been agreed upon between the recipient and the municipality administering the benefit. The rehabilitation plan has its outset in the resources of the individual recipient and the potential labour market requirements, it lists the obligations accepted by the recipient and the municipality, and it is used to keep track of the recipient’s progress during the rehabilitation process.</p>
<p>The flexicurity system has overall been successful in generating a flexible labour force and a low unemployment rate. The generous benefits are, however, a burden on the tax payers, and there has been an increasing political demand for thorough evaluations of the outcomes. We report here on an evaluation of the outcome of the rehabilitation benefit.</p>
<p>A valid epidemiological evaluation of the outcome of rehabilitation benefit is difficult to undertake. Persons receiving rehabilitation benefits are by definition disadvantaged in one way or another. A random selection of non-recipients is likely to result in a group of individuals not disadvantaged to the same extent as the recipients. Direct comparison of the two groups would thus be biased in favour of non-recipients because they have a “head start” over recipients. However, the rather eclectic nature of the service opens for different practices, and in this analysis, we took advantage of the fact that the close to 300 municipalities in Denmark throughout the 1990s and early 2000s administered rehabilitation benefits very differently.</p>
<p>From the generous municipalities, we identified population subgroups with a high proportion of recipients. We identified the same population subgroups in the stingy municipalities. As the desired effect for the rehabilitation benefit is self-sustainability, we defined our effect measure as labour market participation after end of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449520">5</xref>]. In the evaluation, we compared the labour market participation of identified population subgroups in the generous municipalities with the labour market participation of the same population subgroups in the stingy municipalities. We thus tried to overcome the selection problem in the effect evaluation by focusing on potential recipients of rehabilitation benefit instead of actual recipients and by using municipal practice instead of individual reception of the benefit as the exposure variable.</p>

<title>Legislation</title>
<p>A prerequisite for being granted the rehabilitation benefit is that no other social welfare service is sufficient for helping the recipient. The potential recipient must have an impaired ability to work and there must be a realistic chance that the effort will increase future self-sustainability. The evaluation of potential recipients is focused on the job functions that he/she is able to undertake at the present time and the job functions that he/she might be able to undertake after rehabilitation. This means that the purpose of the evaluation is not to document ailments and/or degree of impairment. The evaluation process is therefore highly individualised, which makes it impossible to list a formal set of requirements for eligibility. In order to receive rehabilitation benefit, a rehabilitation plan has to be agreed upon between the municipality and the recipient. The plan includes the specific aims and the time schedule for job testing, clarification of future employment possibilities, upgrading to pass entry exams, education, training, or help to start own business. The time schedule is used to keep track of progress. The monthly rehabilitation benefit corresponds to the highest allowance for insured, unemployed persons and it is independent of the recipient’s financial situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494812449520">
<title>Analysis and data</title>
<p>The analysis included three steps. First, we estimated the probabilities of municipalities granting rehabilitation benefits. Second, characteristics of recipients in the 10 most generous municipalities were analysed in order to identify population subgroups with the highest coverage. These population subgroups from the 10 most generous and the 10 most stingy municipalities were selected for the third step in the analysis, which involved examination of later labour market participation.</p>
<sec id="section9-1403494812449520">
<title>Step one</title>
<p>Recipients of rehabilitation benefit were identified from the register on Benefits under the Act of Active Social Policy located at Statistics Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449520">6</xref>], which started in 1994. Despite the legal requirements of a rehabilitation plan, many benefits turned out to have been paid for short periods and/or with interruptions. Examination of the register showed that early in the study period, rehabilitation benefits had been accounted together with less costly rehabilitation contributions such as books. We therefore restricted the analysis to payments of at least 9000 DKK (~1200 Euro) per month and lasting a minimum of 3 consecutive months. Furthermore we limited the study to people aged 20–49. By linkage to other registers in Statistics Denmark, we added information on municipality of residence and highest attained education at the start of rehabilitation benefit. We calculated probabilities of receiving rehabilitation benefit by sex, age, education, and municipality by dividing the total number of recipients in 1994–2004 by the total number of inhabitants in 1999. Age was divided into 5-year age groups and education into basic education, vocational training, and secondary/tertiary education, and there were 271 municipalities.</p>
<p>For each sex in every municipality, we collected data on potential confounders: mortality 1997–2001; employment 1999; average income 1999 all for persons aged 30–59; and criminal rulings 1999 for persons aged 30–49. Logistic regression was used to identify the top 10 and the bottom 10 municipalities with the highest/lowest probability of granting rehabilitation benefit controlled for sex, age, education, municipal mortality, employment rate, income, and criminal rulings, using Copenhagen as baseline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812449520">
<title>Step two</title>
<p>Data from the 10 most generous municipalities were merged into one group and similarly for the 10 least generous municipalities. By linkage to other registers in Statistics Denmark, we added information on cohabitation and children at start of rehabilitation benefit, and health defined as use of service related to muscular skeletal and/or psychiatric disorders. Age and education were classified as in step one. Cohabitation was dichotomised into living single or with somebody, having children was dichotomised into yes/no. For men and women separately, and for the top 10 and bottom 10 municipalities, we calculated the probability of being a recipient of rehabilitation benefit for all population subgroups characterised by age, education, cohabitation, children, and “health”. The probabilities were calculated by dividing the total number of recipients in 1994–2004 by the total number of inhabitants in 1999.</p>
<p>This gave, in total, 288 (6 × 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2) population subgroups for both the top 10 and bottom 10 municipalities. Population subgroups with a probability of being a recipient of rehabilitation benefit of at least 10% in the top 10 municipalities were selected for step three in the analysis. We labelled these population subgroups the vulnerable groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1403494812449520">
<title>Step three</title>
<p>Our outcome measure was employment rate in 2005, comparing vulnerable groups in the top 10 with vulnerable groups in the bottom 10 municipalities, controlled for the employment rate for the remaining population in the top 10 municipalities compared with the remaining population in the bottom 10 municipalities. A 95% confidence interval for this ratio of ratios was calculated by the use of bootstrapping in the form of case resampling in 1000 iterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449520">7</xref>].</p>
<p>SAS version 9.1.3 Service Pack 3, Solaris version provided in remote access by Statistics Denmark was used for data processing.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>During the period from 1994 to 2004, 81,149 persons aged 20–49 in Denmark received rehabilitation benefit of minimum 9000 DKK/month for 3 consecutive months. In 1999, Denmark had 2,284,563 inhabitants aged 20–49 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812449520">Table I</xref>). Women were overrepresented among recipients, as were younger persons, persons with basic education only, parents, and single living persons, and persons prone to physical and psychological problems.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Entitlement to social benefits is legally regulated in Denmark by laws passed by the national parliament. Nevertheless, our analysis showed that the probability of being granted rehabilitation benefit varied 10-fold from a relative risk of 0.17 to one of 1.69 across the 271 Danish municipalities. This reflects that the rehabilitation benefit is not a service all citizens meeting certain criteria are entitled to but a service provided only after an individual evaluation of the potential recipient. Our study was set up to test whether or not a generous use of rehabilitation benefit in a municipality had a beneficial effect on employment. The study showed no positive impact of generous use of rehabilitation benefit on later employment rate. In fact, vulnerable inhabitants in generous municipalities had a slightly lower employment rate than vulnerable inhabitants in stingy municipalities. Consequently, generous use of rehabilitation benefit could either be a limitation for later employment, or additional differences not captured by our confounder analysis could exist between the top 10 and bottom 10 municipalities. Although we find the latter explanation to be most likely, it is remarkable that a possibly positive effect of rehabilitation benefit was not sufficiently large to become visible even in a study design particularly aimed at eliminating selection bias and controlling for population and municipality differences.</p>
<p>The present study was based on a nationwide, comprehensive registration of all recipients of rehabilitation services from 1994 to 2004. Our effect measure, employment rate in 2005, was based also on a nationwide, comprehensive registration. The data files could be linked using the unique personal identification numbers. Our data were therefore not affected by reporting biases. We wanted to focus the study on the core group of persons receiving living expenses via the rehabilitation service. A number of decisions had to be made in identifying this core group. We set the cut-off point for living expenses to 9000 DKK per month for at least 3 consecutive months. However, the use of other cut-off points and analytical approaches as standardised employment rates did not change the results. Our results were therefore robust.</p>
<p>The study has though also some weaknesses. First, the 10 most generous and the 10 most stingy municipalities may have differed not only in their use of rehabilitation services. In the first group, six municipalities had 10,000 or more inhabitants, while this was the case for only one of the municipalities in the last group. Second, based on the criteria we used, about half of the female recipients of rehabilitation services should be identified as belonging to the vulnerable groups, but this was the case for only a quarter of the male recipients. In particular for men, one therefore has to keep in mind that the results may have turned out differently if we had been able to expand the number of criteria based on which we could identify the vulnerable groups. Third, we had no information on the rehabilitation plans and it was not possible to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful termination of rehabilitation. Fourth, while the register-based study allowed for analysis of socio-demographic variables it was not possible to include subjective variables like attitudes of rehabilitees. Finally, the data come from a single country affecting the generalisability of the results to other countries with different rehabilitation systems.</p>
<p>The variation across municipalities in use of rehabilitation benefits has been studied with different approaches. A Danish project focused on characteristics related to the municipality’s social service administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449520">8</xref>] and showed that the total number of welfare recipients in the municipality and the number of rehabilitation case managers were predictors for use of rehabilitation service. In our view, characteristics of the municipality social administration may, however, very well in itself be a reflection of the municipality policy leading to a circular argumentation.</p>
<p>A US study found clients’ education to be the best individual characteristic in determining the probability of being granted rehabilitation service. Nevertheless, the majority of the granting process remained unexplained, indicating that the process was largely governed by subjective assessments by the individual caseworker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449520">9</xref>]. This observation is supported by data from Finland showing that selection of participants for rehabilitation was not based on the participants’ risk profiles for early retirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449520">10</xref>]. According to the authors of the US study, this selection process may fall into the following prototypes. First, people with the most potential gain from the service may be favoured: referred to as optimising the economic efficiency. Second, people most likely to succeed, even in the absence of the service, may be favoured: referred to as creaming. Finally, people in most severe need of the service may be favoured: referred to as equity redistribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449520">9</xref>].</p>
<p>A Danish study mapped the municipalities’ attitude towards initiation of rehabilitation. The study was based on questionnaires and 235 municipalities (81%) responded. Practically all municipalities stated that great emphasis was put on the perceived resources of the potential recipient to complete the proposed rehabilitation sequence, and the perceived ability of the recipient to fill the future job function. The average duration of rehabilitation sequences was reported to be 2.5 years. On average, every fourth rehabilitation sequence was reported to end unsuccessfully. The municipalities estimated that three out of four recipients were fully self-sustained after completion of the rehabilitation sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449520">11</xref>]. The reported strong emphasis on potential success could point to creaming, when the Danish municipalities initiated rehabilitation.</p>
<p>A Danish register-based study on rehabilitation benefit used a fixed-effect method, where the difference between the recipient’s public support prior to and after rehabilitation was used as the effect measure, and found a slight reduction of 3.6% in public support after end of rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449520">12</xref>]. Norway has a 5–20 week labour market training programme with an allowance below unemployment benefit. Participation is voluntary, but the capacity is limited so not all applicants are accepted. A study compared accepted applicants, rejected applicants, and a random sample of unemployed non-applicants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449520">5</xref>]. The effect measure was working income in the 2–3 years after the training. Small positive effects of the training were found when accepted applicants were compared with rejected applicants. Rejected applicants had higher earnings than non-applicants and the authors therefore argued that comparison of recipients with non-applicants would have skewed the results in favour of the training.</p>
<p>Researchers have thus tried various ways to overcome the selection problem in measuring the effect of services aimed at marginalised unemployed. The fixed-effect method may lead to interpretation problems as rehabilitation is initiated at a point in time, where the recipients are out of work or at the margin of the labour market. The fact that recipients received less public support after than prior to rehabilitation may therefore be a true effect of the rehabilitation, but it may also result from “regression towards to mean”, meaning that there would have been a change even in the absence of rehabilitation. Comparison of accepted with rejected applicants is valid only if acceptance is allocated randomly, which is hardly the case for rehabilitation in the Danish context. An individually matched group of recipients of other social services also has its limitations as a control group because of the heterogeneity of the rehabilitees. None of the studies has thus come up with an ideal model for overcoming the selection problem in measuring the effect of rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Studies on the effect of active labour market policies, including services similar to the rehabilitation benefit, have been reviewed by various authors. A meta-analysis of 100 evaluations of active labour market policies included 23 studies on training of long-term unemployed persons including services similar to the rehabilitation benefit. The authors stressed that non-scientific evaluations tended to overestimate the effect of the service. Scientific evidence suggested that training programmes can have a positive impact, but this is not always the case and the impact is usually small. A general conclusion was that positive effects of training of long-term unemployed persons depended on macroeconomic factors, in particular labour demand, as positive outcomes often coincided with general improvements in the national economy. The services studied tended to help women more than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449520">13</xref>]. A review of active labour market policies in OECD-countries found mixed but generally positive results – in particular when the training was specifically targeted towards the individual, small in scale, and with strong ties to the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449520">14</xref>]. A review of microeconomic studies on training of long-term unemployed persons in Sweden showed mixed effects, the general conclusion being that the effects of labour market training in the 1990s were either insignificant or significantly negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449520">15</xref>]. A recent Finnish study of public sector employees evaluated vocationally oriented multidisciplinary early rehabilitation and found that it had no impact on long-term disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449520">16</xref>], a finding supporting the outcome of the present study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recipients of rehabilitation benefit constitute, by definition, a highly selected population group and it is therefore difficult to measure the employment effect of rehabilitation. To avoid selection bias, we focused on potential recipients of rehabilitation benefit instead of actual recipients and municipality practice instead of individual behaviour as exposure variable. To avoid a reporting bias, only register-based data were used. Following this stringent methodology, we found no beneficial employment effect of rehabilitation. It should be taken into account, however, that some residual confounding deriving from differences between municipalities and some residual selection bias deriving from incomplete capture of potential recipients could have affected the results.</p>
