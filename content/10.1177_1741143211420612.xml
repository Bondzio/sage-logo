<abstract>
<p>The use of networks as a means of communicating knowledge and ideas and in promoting innovation among schools has emerged globally over the past decade. Currently, inter-school collaboration is not only at the fore nationally in England, but also has become integral to the school improvement agenda. However, networking theory is a disparate field and its application in education is very variable. Nevertheless, there seems to be consistent policy support at government level for school collaborative working arrangements as a key means for promoting the standards agenda. This article explores the effectiveness of one such initiative—Primary Strategy Learning Networks (PSLNs). This is a qualitative study of two PSLNs in England over the course of the first year of the initiative. The research not only seeks to understand the term ‘network’ and what it means methodologically, but also what the implications are of a centrally directed model of networking. The findings of this research offer (1) an alternative model for productive networking and (2) a different perspective to planning for success. These findings will add to the national and international debate on networks as power bases for school improvement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Primary Strategy Learning Networks (PSLN) initiative was launched in 2005. It initially involved one-third of all primary schools in England, with an expectation that the vast majority of primary schools would be involved in the initiative by 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420612">Moore, 2008</xref>). The idea was based on a government commitment in England to a particular model of collaboration involving groups of 5–8 primary schools working together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004a</xref>) with the purpose of raising standards in literacy and numeracy. The aim of the research reported here was to explore the effects of an imposed model of collaborative working for raising standards in English primary schools. The key research questions were ‘what are the benefits and challenges of school networking arrangements as perceived by headteachers?’ and ‘how can school networks contribute successfully to educational reform?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1741143211420612">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The pressure on politicians globally to intervene in state education has resulted in an attempt in England to modernize school cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143211420612">Wallace, 2003</xref>). The impact of the Education Reform Act 1988, which introduced financial delegation to schools, along with active promotion of competition among schools, had led to system fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143211420612">Glatter, 2003</xref>). Secondary school collaborative working arrangements, such as the 14–19 Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143211420612">DfES, 2005</xref>) and primary school networking initiatives such as the PSLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004a</xref>), could arguably be considered as purposeful moves toward ‘a new search for integration, coherence and systematic change’ (Wallace and Hall, 1994, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143211420612">Glatter, 2003</xref>: 17). Undeniably, inter-school collaborative working practices have become an integral part of government initiatives in England to improve educational practice, academic standards and pupil achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420612">Connolly and James, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>This potentially significant shift in primary school working, from isolation to collaboration, saw the launch of the PSLN initiative in the wake of <italic>Excellence and Enjoyment</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143211420612">DfES, 2003</xref>). <italic>Excellence and Enjoyment</italic> was a national policy document that placed considerable emphasis on encouraging every primary school to be part of a network. The government commitment was further endorsed with the launch of <italic>The Five Year Strategy</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004b</xref>: 42), which stated that effective learning networks of primary schools:<disp-quote>
<p>… can build the capacity of primary schools to continue to develop and improve, and in particular to offer better teaching and learning and a wider range of opportunities to pupils and to their communities.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, this commitment to encouraging networks seemed to be ideas based rather than evidence based as it was unsubstantiated in the DfES documentation by any research into the benefits of primary school networking as ‘the single most important way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004b</xref>) to move primary education forward. This article attempts to assess the role of networks as a power base for educational reform through empirical research of the PSLN initiative in one local authority in London, England.</p>
<sec id="section3-1741143211420612">
<title>Networks and Learning Networks</title>
<p>A <italic>network</italic> was defined for the purpose of this research as a group of schools coming together for a common purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143211420612">Lieberman and McLaughlin, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420612">Lowndes and Skelcher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143211420612">Mullen and Kochen, 2000</xref>) that is beneficial to each individual school, while also adding value to the network as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143211420612">Connolly and James, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A <italic>learning network</italic> was defined in this research as a collaborative group of educational practitioners, sharing relationships ‘based on trust, loyalty and reciprocity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143211420612">Lowndes and Skelcher, 1998</xref>: 318), engaging with one another ‘to enquire into practice, to innovate, to exchange knowledge and to learn together’ (Jackson, 2004, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143211420612">Earl and Katz, 2005</xref>: 28) in order to impact on pupil learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420612">Hopkins and Jackson, 2002</xref>). The types of network studied in this research were learning networks.</p>

<title>Large-scale Educational Reform</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420612">Fullan (2000)</xref> defines large-scale reform as affecting an entire system. His research reviews large-scale reforms in both the Canadian and English education systems over the last 50 years and he explores three different types—whole school, district and national reform. From these, the author identifies a number of insights into the success or failure of large scale reform and considers why these must be addressed in order to ensure successful change. Fullan’s work on large-scale educational reform was of particular interest in this research as the PSLN initiative involved one-third of all primary schools in each local authority (LA) in England in the first year with a second year offered to remaining primary schools—a proposed significant reform in the English primary education system in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420612">Fullan’s (2000)</xref> terms and a significant commitment in terms of government funding.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420612">Fullan with Stiegelbauer (1991)</xref> concentrate on the change agents' roles in the change process and acknowledge that a number of stakeholders are involved in change at school, provincial and federal level in the Canadian education system. The critical factor suggested by the authors is that change will not be successful without the engagement of the primary stakeholder—the practitioner in the classroom—and without the support of all stakeholders at other levels. According to Fullan, ownership is a key element, in order to encourage enthusiasm for and commitment to the change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143211420612">Fullan (1992</xref>: 7) also acknowledges that:<disp-quote>
<p>Educational change fails many more times than it succeeds. One of the main reasons is that implementation—or the process of achieving something new into practice—has been neglected.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He argues that change processes cannot be stage managed with rigidity of rules and structures, as there is often no clear way to proceed. The change process itself is particular to the organization and not a ‘one size fits all’ process.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420612">Pawson (2006)</xref> also warns against assuming any one set of criteria that work in all circumstances and argues the importance of considering all the features that explain just how interventions such as the PSLN initiative work or do not as the case may be when reviewing the evidence. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420612">Arnold (2005</xref>: 21) recommends keeping ‘under constant review what is proving successful and what is not’ in any ongoing evaluation of a new initiative.</p>
<p>This research explores these ideas to determine if networks can succeed in driving forward educational reform and argues (1) the need for practitioner involvement in the change process and (2) a flexible approach to change management in order to ensure successful outcomes. The research concludes that (3) a realistic approach to networking will determine a greater degree of success in driving forward educational reform.</p>
<p>It is intended that lessons learned from this research will be used to inform practice at a senior level in the local authority where the research was conducted. It is also intended that this research will add to a wider educational debate, both nationally and internationally, on government introduced initiatives for educational reform, in order that they have more chance of success in ensuring impact in the classroom and on ‘the hearts and minds' of school teachers and their pupils (Hopkins et al., 1994).</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>The data reported here were drawn from a qualitative study of the perceptions of headteacher participants in two PSLNs over the course of a school year. The findings were also supported by those from an initial smaller scale study of a learning network of eight schools researched in the previous year. It is acknowledged that this selection did not offer a broad view from all network stakeholders including teachers and students. However, at this early stage in the initiative, the key participants in PSLN meetings were the headteachers themselves.</p>
<sec id="section6-1741143211420612">
<title>Data Gathering</title>
<p>The field work began in the autumn term at the start of a school year and the data were gathered both through observations and semi-structured interviews in the first year of the life of the two London based PSLNs. These two networks comprised five schools and seven schools, respectively. The field work ceased in the summer term at the end of the same school year.</p>
<p>There were two sets of interviews held with participating headteachers during the period of the research. The first set of interviews took place at the start of the academic year. These interviews were audio-recorded and all 12 interviews were based on questions regarding headteachers' previous experiences of collaborative arrangements; and headteachers' perceptions of benefits and disadvantages of the PSLN initiative. The interviews were semi-structured and additional sub questions posed in order to clarify, investigate further and summarize.</p>
<p>The same 12 headteachers participating in the same two networks were then re-interviewed at the end of the first year of the initiative. Again, the interviews were semi-structured and were audio-recorded. The interviews concentrated on comparisons between participants' perceptions of the PSLN initiative at the start and again at the end of the academic year. These second set of interviews were based on seven questions capturing the perceptions of the headteachers one year into the initiative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143211420612">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The written transcripts of the both sets of interviews were read and each of the comments made by participants was analysed, numerically coded and referenced to an arising theme. The benefits of this were twofold. First, the number of responses on any one theme could be easily counted and noted. Second, any responses on a given theme could be easily referenced back to any one of the 24 transcripts at a later date.</p>
<p>Data were then summarized and conclusions were drawn on the emerging themes. Although this research was not developed and is not presented as grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143211420612">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>), it is acknowledged that some elements of a grounded theory approach are evident in the data analysis and, in particular, the themes arising from the data on the requirements, benefits and disadvantages of networking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143211420612">
<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>The position of the researcher as a local authority employee at the time of the research should be taken into account. Although every effort was made to address the issue of bias, it could not be totally eliminated in this research. Also, the position the researcher held within the authority may have influenced participant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143211420612">McQueen and Knusson, 2002</xref>). These facts are stated so that the reader can make balanced judgements on the findings.</p>
<p>All interviewees were appropriately notified and had the opportunity for voluntary informed consent to their own and their school’s involvement in the research. The intention was to be open and transparent, and the right to withdraw was made explicit in all initial communications to participating headteachers. This is described in the main report of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420612">Moore, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1741143211420612">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>In order to explore the research questions: ‘what are the benefits and challenges of school networking arrangements as perceived by headteachers?’ and ‘how can school networks contribute successfully to educational reform?’, it was necessary to determine the characteristics of successful networks. These, as perceived by headteacher participants in the research, fell into two categories: what networks need in practical terms in order to function successfully—that is, the <italic>requirements</italic> for successful networking; and what networks offered the participants in order to be deemed successful—that is, the <italic>benefits</italic> of successful networking. These are described in more detail below.</p>
<sec id="section10-1741143211420612">
<title>Requirements</title>
<p>The requirements that supported successful networking were described by participant headteachers mainly in terms of <italic>structure</italic> and funded <italic>time</italic>, acknowledging that ‘collaborative ventures require strong organisational structures' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420612">Woods et al., 2006</xref>: 61).</p>
<p>Structures, as perceived by respondents, not only pertained to the internal structure of the network but also to the external structures that supported or constrained the network. There was some opposition to imposed external structures:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s why I’m talking about [jumping through] ‘hoops' with the initial structure … its one size fits all, this is the template folks!<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741143211420612">1</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>It is true that care needs to be taken in prescribing the structure of a network so as not to inhibit its organic growth, and the organization of any network ‘should be characterised by <italic>structuring the fluid’</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143211420612">Veugelers and O’Hair, 2005</xref>: 220). Indeed, the organic nature of a network can be supported and enhanced by systems and structures that are adaptable to change.</p>
<p>Allocating <italic>time</italic> to networking activities was also seen as an important success criterion within the frenetic nature of school life by all headteacher respondents:<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve got so little time, we’ve got so little money, we’ve got a limited amount of energy … and we need to make sure that we get the best possible return for it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Additional to this was the requirement that time be allocated during the working day rather than as a ‘bolt-on’ to an already busy and overloaded work schedule. In order for this to occur, adequate <italic>funding</italic> needed to be available to schools already working within tight budget constraints. ‘The money side of it has really, really helped … we longed to do things like this, but being in deficit budgets, you can’t.’</p>
<p>Furthermore, to support networks through the stages of change from initiation to outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420612">Fullan with Stiegelbauer, 1991)</xref>, it was argued by participants in the research that the funding needed to be sustained over a significant period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143211420612">Rutherford and Jackson (2006</xref>: 449) when writing about networks in secondary schools, agree:<disp-quote>
<p>It is also clear that partnership working is not cheap and, in times of plenty, schools are keen to be involved but, in leaner times, there is retrenchment. The key theme, then, is that of sustainability and especially of funding.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The PSLN initiative itself had acknowledged the need for structure, focus, management, time scales and action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004a</xref>). Therefore, in this respect, it seemed to be successful as a model for networking. Certainly, in comparison to the smaller scale study of the learning network a year earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143211420612">Moore, 2008</xref>), the external impositions of a prescribed model were not viewed by most of the PSLN headteacher respondents as excessively demanding, controlling or inhibiting. ‘It’s given us the opportunity to look quite closely at something that was one of our [school] concerns.’</p>
<p>However, the funding for the PSLN initiative was short term, with financial support in the first year only but the expectation of at least two years' commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143211420612">DfES, 2004b</xref>)—thus disregarding the need for continued external support through all stages of the change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420612">Hopkins et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1741143211420612">
<title>Benefits</title>
<p>The most important benefits noted by all respondents in both networking initiatives in this research were the reciprocal arrangements in terms of <italic>sharing</italic> a rich and varied pool of resources, and the professional <italic>support</italic> available from within and beyond the network from others with the same issues and a key common purpose. As one headteacher stated:<disp-quote>
<p>When I was talking around that at the meeting, there were other people with the same problem … [I thought] it would be good to journey together.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The PSLN initiative had insisted on a common purpose based on a pupil focus for raising standards. And yet, the participants in the research commented more on investing in staff development than on the benefits on pupils' learning. The opportunities given for professional development at all levels within schools were highly valued as one headteacher acknowledged:<disp-quote>
<p>The learning network is probably the most powerful vehicle that I’ve experienced for a long time … because it’s actually cascaded to [other] staff as well, [and] to teaching assistants.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other benefits expressed by participants included the empowerment of individuals in leading the learning of colleagues and learning from other colleagues. This was also highly valued:<disp-quote>
<p>I think, in essence, the idea of actually reaching out, opening up the school and opening ourselves to new ideas and new possibilities has probably turned out to be the most beneficial aspect of the whole process.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Additionally, the power of the network in the local authority in terms of corporate voice and legitimacy was a further noted benefit. Corporate voice was defined and acknowledged in the literature where headteachers were seen to use the power of networking to be ‘the voice of state education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143211420612">Busher and Hodgkinson, 1996</xref>: 62). It was also noted in this research that:<disp-quote>
<p>It [the network] is going to give us more power to say the things that we want to say to the LA. Because there are five schools saying [it] … it’s a very powerful message to say ‘This is an issue across our network.’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Legitimacy, in terms of professional validation of practice, occurred as practitioner confidence developed and was closely linked to the power of corporate voice. Although this empowerment of individuals and groups was viewed positively, power was also regarded as an inhibitor to networking or as a disadvantage if misused.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741143211420612">
<title>Challenges</title>
<p>In researching the benefits of school networking, a number of challenges were also expressed by participant headteachers. These challenges were concerned with competing school and network priorities. The mobility of staff was also seen as an issue by many respondents as:<disp-quote>
<p>Continually shifting membership means a continual need to reassess and renegotiate others' agendas. Hard-won compromises can suddenly be reopened. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143211420612">Huxman and Vangen, 2000</xref>: 799)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Other perceived challenges included a loss of autonomy by headteachers and the issue of sustaining engagement of the network participants as the network progressed. Managing all these issues took a toll on network participants: ‘You can only channel your energies really productively into a limited number [of initiatives].’</p>
<p>Unnecessary bureaucracy was another perceived challenge and the frustration that this created:<disp-quote>
<p>Filling in the wretched paperwork was one step too far … that’s another three or four hours of a head’s time. That’s when you question whether it’s worth it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Power was also perceived by respondents as a main inhibitor to the networking process when it took the form of autocratic network leadership which inhibited rapid decision making, or where it promoted hierarchical structures and excessive accountability to others such as the local authority or the government. This, in turn, affected headteachers' willingness to include other staff in the network’s decision-making process:<disp-quote>
<p>We still feel the need to keep a hold on it [the network plan]. We did talk about letting the lead staff get on with it, but we thought ‘No, we can’t’. We just felt we needed to check up … what if they met and changed it?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Equally, where decisive leadership was acknowledged by respondents in this research as critical to the network’s success, it was also expressed as stifling to the network if overly controlling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143211420612">Hopkins and Jackson, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1741143211420612">
<title>Productive Networking—An Alternative Model</title>
<p>In summary, there were many elements of networking that were expressed either positively or negatively by headteacher participants in the research. Positive features included: a clear structure for networking; the support and professional development available for staff; time (and funding) to network with colleagues; a sharing of resources, ideas and issues; and a feeling of empowerment and legitimacy. Features that were perceived negatively or seen as barriers by headteacher participants included: staff mobility and staff engagement; diary restraints; competing priorities; loss of autonomy; power struggles; lack of expertise; hierarchical structures and unnecessary bureaucracy. These positive and negative features were not always diametrically opposed, but were interrelated in that a number of features of successful networking had their associated challenges. For example, time to network was seen as a positive aspect of the PSLN initiative. However, having the time to network due to headteachers' diary constraints was seen as a negative aspect of networking.</p>
<p>The typology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143211420612">Figure 1</xref>
is presented to map these features and their interrelatedness within and beyond the networks studied. This typology is offered as a tool for stimulating reflection on how some aspects of networking can become barriers or distractions from the main goal or purpose of the network. Furthermore, at a later stage in this research, a realistic approach is offered to support networks in addressing these barriers.</p>

<p>As a further explanation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741143211420612">Figure 1</xref>, the elements included in the left section of the typology are the positive features found within the networks in this research and the elements included in the right section are the associated challenges as perceived by participating headteachers. Networks, it is suggested here, should flourish when positioned in the left hand sections of the typology or could stagnate if positioned predominantly within the right-hand sections. However, tensions around the same aspects of networking are inevitable, ‘for networks exist as complex organisations of already existing complex organisations (the schools themselves) which in turn are composed of complex groups and individuals' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143211420612">Moore and Kelly, 2009</xref>: 396). Both positive features and their associated challenges were seen to co-exist within the PSLNs as long as a healthy balance was maintained. But, getting the balance right for productive networking was not the only key factor to the success of the PSLN initiative. The second, and equally important, factor to success in the initiative involved positive planning to maintain the focus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1741143211420612">
<title>Planning for Success—A Different Perspective</title>
<p>To revisit the purpose of the PSLN initiative, it was to be very much focused on pupil learning and an improvement in standards of literacy and/or numeracy in schools. An obvious issue arising from the findings was the notable lack of responses in follow up interviews with headteachers on the benefits for pupils. Indeed, the benefits for staff in terms of support, colleagueship, shared workload, corporate voice, professional development, motivation, challenge, engagement and so forth arising from the findings far outweighed the few examples given of direct impact on classroom practices and improvements in learning opportunities to raise standards.</p>
<p>One could assume that the chosen sample of headteacher participants rather than that of classroom practitioners may have had an impact on these finding and that a research focus on the teachers themselves may have revealed examples of impact in the classroom. However, local authority evaluations also showed limited evidence of any significant impact on standards at the end of the first year. In this respect, the aims for this initiative to produce a quick or short-term effect in the classroom or on pupil outcomes seemed too ambitious and was not seen by headteacher participants as the main benefit of networking.</p>
<p>However, pupil achievement and attainment should remain the core purpose of any educational reform. If change is to have any meaning at all, it needs to impact in the classroom and ‘on the hearts and minds of teachers and students' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420612">Hopkins et al., 1994</xref>: 24).</p>
<p>Maintaining a network focus on pupil achievement and managing the tensions of networking as discussed earlier suggests the need for an explicit plan for success when implementing networking initiatives for school improvement. Therefore, the purpose of suggesting the model set out below is to offer an alternative approach to planning in order to maximize the chances of a successful outcome that remains focused on impact in the classroom.</p>
<sec id="section15-1741143211420612">
<title>Realistic Intervention</title>
<p>Generally when a new initiative is seized upon at the ‘ideas' stage, the view taken, understandably, emanates from a positive orientation. So, for instance, ‘Networking will raise standards in schools because …’. However, consideration needs to be given to the contrary in order to plan successfully. Thus, when introducing a new national initiative such as PSLNs, government officials and educationalists should first consider that ‘Networking will <italic>not</italic> raise standards in schools because …’. This is the basis of a realistic approach to evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420612">Pawson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420612">Pawson (2006)</xref> challenges established methods for the evaluation of public sector initiatives. He (2006: 11) argues that the focus on whether or not an initiative has ‘worked’ is flawed and suggests that:<disp-quote>
<p>To understand why there is inconsistency of outcomes we need to ask the rather different question of ‘why’ or ‘how’ the measure has its effect. We need a method which seeks to understand what the program actually does to change behaviours and why not every situation is conducive to that particular process.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420612">Arnold (2005</xref>: 21) agrees and argues a number of common principles for monitoring and evaluating public service initiatives, including the need to:<disp-quote>
<p>Make monitoring, evaluation, and measurement an integral part of every aspect of the strategy; learn from mistakes, and keep under constant review what is proving successful and what is not.</p>
<p>Collect and analyse feedback from all users; take action on their suggestions wherever possible, and report back to them, particularly when their proposals cannot be realised.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420612">Pawson (2006)</xref> has argued, if all stakeholders are aware of the main aims of any new initiative and they are involved at all stages in the on-going evaluation through exploring such questions as—Is it working? How is it working? Why is this bit working? What is the barrier to that bit not working?—adaptations to the programme can be actioned along the way to enable greater success in reaching understood and agreed goals. In order for this to happen, a number of actions are important to consider here. First, a systematic review needs to be undertaken in order to tap into the ‘the collective wisdom of successes and failures of previous initiatives' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143211420612">Pawson, 2006</xref>: 11). Then, participants need to understand the process of the change taking place as well as the change itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143211420612">Hopkins et al., 1994</xref>). Additionally, on-going review and evaluation is necessary throughout the duration of any new initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143211420612">Arnold, 2005</xref>) in order to incorporate necessary changes. And, finally, participant involvement is recommended in any on-going evaluation as this will ensure a cohesive identity with the reform from those directly affected and maximize success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143211420612">Fullan, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1741143211420612">
<title>A Realistic Approach to Evaluating Success and Failure</title>
<p>Realistic evaluation assumes both the possibility of success and failure in any new initiative. It then seeks to determine for whom and in what circumstances it has been successful or unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143211420612">Pawson, 2001</xref>). The focus in a realistic approach is on the programme mechanisms or each part in order to provide a better chance of addressing these as they occur. A realistic approach is not an evaluation technique as such, but ‘a framework for the whole enterprise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143211420612">Pawson, 2001</xref>: 4). In adopting this method to explore the main Government aim of raising pupil standards through the PSLN initiative, a clear picture is produced of where and why it failed. In using Pawson’s method in this research, the following diagrammatic analysis gives a clear indication of where and how intervention throughout the initiative may have provided more chance of success. And, in focusing on the relationship between different elements in that causal chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143211420612">Huberman, 1992</xref>), issues might have been addressed at an earlier stage in the initiative to ensure successful outcomes.</p>
<p>The set of diagrams and explanations below draw directly on examples of the themes arising from the initial PSLN research as discussed earlier in this article. To recall, the arising themes on negative aspects of networking were: staff mobility and staff engagement; diary restraints; competing priorities; loss of autonomy; power struggles; lack of expertise; hierarchical structures and unnecessary bureaucracy. These contributed as barriers to achieving the ultimate goal of the PSLN initiative in terms of impact on students. The dotted arrows in the diagrams below represent the steps planned along the path of the PSLN initiative and the solid arrows represent the steps taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1741143211420612">
<title>The Limitations of the Primary Strategy Learning Networks initiative</title>
<p>The basic idea behind the launch of PSLN was that money (M) would be offered as an incentive (I) to impact on standards (S) in schools—namely, improved results in maths and English scores in national testing for 11-year-olds. Thus:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig2.tif"/>
</p>
<p>The model chosen to fulfil this central government aim offered schools ‘ring-fenced’ funding for networking (N) on condition of an agreed focus (F) on raising pupil standards in literacy and/or mathematics. Thus:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig3.tif"/>
</p>
<p>However, what happened was that schools within the networks experienced a number of barriers, difficulties and other issues which deterred them from the main government objective. In theory, the additional money did offer more time (T) for networking in terms of funding additional personnel to ‘free up’ practitioners for networking tasks. However, in practical terms, issues such as ‘where you have to do things on certain days or at certain times', lack of personnel available for duty cover in small schools, ‘trying to make our diaries match’ and other school-based priorities distracting the schools were the first set of barriers that the networks had to overcome:<disp-quote>
<p>It took quite a bit of time to set up in the first place and for five heads to be out [of school] for that amount of time probably is pushing it a little bit in some schools.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Hence, the first barrier to overcome was making time to network:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig4.tif"/>
</p>
<p>The second set of difficulties arose from not knowing ‘how’ to network. So, issues such as lack of network structure, organization and management impacted on their success with some feeling that there were ‘too many chiefs' with ‘an awful long time [spent] getting nowhere actually’. Additionally, lack of experience (E) to manage these and to work cohesively with colleagues from partner schools created fragile groups in terms of professional confidence, mutual trust, power partnerships, staff mobility and stable dynamics: ‘In a way it’s a disparate group with some [participants] way ahead of others.’</p>
<p>Therefore, the next barrier to overcome was ‘learning how to network’:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig5.tif"/>
</p>
<p>Systems and procedures that were developed both internally and externally to manage some of the issues created bureaucratic (B) difficulties in terms of work overload and hierarchical structures impacting on the organic nature of networking and the synergy that is produced from this:<disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t got the time to invest in a blow-by-blow account of what we’re going to do with £2,000 [each] when I’m dealing with a £1 million budget, you know.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>So, another barrier to overcome was the associated bureaucracy to the PSLN initiative:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig6.tif"/>
</p>
<p>Individual and school players also saw the network as an opportunity for their own personal gain (G) in terms of support, professional development, opportunities of advancement and additional resources: ‘If they [the networks] are discussing something that is a burning issue to me, then I would find a way of going.’</p>
<p>Hence, a further barrier to overcome was lack of focus due to personal agendas:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig7.tif"/>
</p>
<p>Problems also arose with agreeing and maintaining a pupil focus in the networks due to varying school curriculum priorities (P) and the lack of both internal and external expertise to impact on the main pupil focus.<disp-quote>
<p>What happened was the Holy Grail wasn’t out there. We were seeking something that wasn’t as tangible as we hoped it would be.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Therefore, an additional barrier to overcome was the curriculum expertise and subject knowledge required to impact on pupil success:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig8.tif"/>
</p>
<p>Finally, tight government timescales and lack of on-going funding meant that the durability (D) of the network had not been considered centrally in order to allow practice to embed throughout all necessary stages of this major change process for schools from traditional ways of working: ‘I’ve said funding is very, very important which it is.’</p>
<p>So, the last barrier to overcome was sustaining the network over time in the absence of a long term commitment of central funding:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig9.tif"/>
</p>
<p>All these barriers, difficulties and other issues side-tracked schools and networks along the way and ultimately prevented the main government aim of raising pupil standards from being achieved. And, what are clearly displayed diagrammatically above are the causal relationships. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143211420612">Pawson et al. (2004)</xref> argue that a <italic>realistic approach</italic> to interventions such as the PSLN initiative offer a further understanding of that causality.</p>
<p>One might argue that on-going realistic evaluation in the case of the PSLN initiative would have acknowledged arising issues and addressed them—encouraging convergence rather than divergence thus:
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1741143211420612-fig10.tif"/>
</p>
<p>The example illustrated above would arguably have ensured that the participants in the initiative remained focused on the ultimate goal of raising standards rather than being hindered by issues such as time restraints (T) or lack of experience in networking (E).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Recent Labour governments in England have seemed intent on promoting a myriad of networking initiatives for schools and local authorities. And, although there has been a change of government since this research was completed, networking for school improvement remains on the political agenda through the introduction of the Academies Act 2010 and a commitment to partnerships between schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143211420612">DfE, 2010</xref>). The intention of this research was to explore the success of one initiative for driving forward a government agenda. That agenda was focused on raising standards in literacy and numeracy in primary schools nationally.</p>
<p>The first lesson learnt in this research was that, ideally, networks have many positive features. But, because of the complexity of networks and their diversity in terms of human relationships and power tensions, there are associated challenges that display as negative features. Both sets of features can co-exist but these challenges need to be recognized and addressed to promote a healthy balance. Additionally, all stakeholders need to acknowledge negative aspects and ensure that these do not side-track the network from its main purpose.</p>
<p>The second lesson learnt in the research was that the Government’s aims for the initiative nationally were not realized in the short term at a local level. This was due to a number of factors as noted diagrammatically above, which prevented the change from filtering down quickly into the classroom for maximum impact. Fullan, as early as 1991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420612">Fullan with Stiegelbauer, 1991</xref>), was arguing that change can not be successfully implemented without the engagement of the primary stakeholder—and that is to say the practitioner in the classroom. This is a theme that is seen repeated in later literature. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143211420612">Woods et al. (2006</xref>: 56) note the ‘challenge of penetration’ in the Diversity Pathfinders Project where impact on staff below senior management level and on students in the classroom was not met. The value of networking, however, was acknowledged by headteacher participants in this research in terms of the mutual benefits and the professional support it offered. This ensured commitment to the network.</p>
<p>Therefore, the final recommendation in this article is quite simple—to put the emphasis for the implementation of educational policy on the people involved in putting policy into practice. And, to invest time in ensuring that participants are aware of the process of change from implementation through to impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143211420612">Fullan with Stiegelbauer, 1991</xref>) in addition to focusing on the change itself. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143211420612">Lieberman and McLaughlin (1992</xref>: 676) note that ‘those in leadership positions in networks are not usually knowledgeable about the process of change’. Yet, without this knowledge, system-wide change may not be achieved.</p>
<p>This article argues that: by investing in the participants; listening and responding to their views and concerns through all stages of the process; through actively involving them in the local adoption of the policy and the process of the change; and through supporting them with on-going funding, resources and training at every stage through to outcome; a greater degree of success will be achieved for system wide reform in education and for raising standards in our schools.</p>
