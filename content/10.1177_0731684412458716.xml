<abstract>
<p>Polypropylene composites reinforced with jute fabrics (Hessian cloth) were fabricated by heat-press molding technique. Mechanical properties of the composites such as tensile strength, tensile modulus, bending strength, bending modulus and impact strength were measured with reference to fiber loading in polypropylene matrix. Jute fabrics were treated with potassium permanganate in oxalic acid media in order to investigate the oxidizing effect on the properties of the composites. Solutions of oxalic acid were prepared in water as 1.0–10.0% w/v, where percentage of potassium permanganate was maintained at 0.01% w/v. Among the treatments, potassium permanganate in 5.0% oxalic acid treated jute composite showed better mechanical performance. Thermogravimetric data of polypropylene, jute fabrics and composites showed that thermal degradation temperatures of composites shifted to higher temperature regions compared to polypropylene or jute fabrics. Treatment of jute fabrics improved the thermal stability of the composite. Degradation characteristics of the composites were studied in soil, water and simulated weathering conditions. Water uptake of the composites was also studied. Treated jute composites were found less degradable as well as less water sensible compared to control composite.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412458716" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growing environmental awareness and rising global waste problem prompt the development concepts of sustainability and reconsideration of renewable resources. Natural fibers are renewable and can be incinerated for energy recovery in an environment-friendly way. During handling fiber products cause a little concern in terms of health and safety. The use of natural fibers as reinforcing materials in polymer matrix composites provides positive environmental benefits with respect to ultimate disposability and best utilization of raw materials. In addition, they exhibit excellent mechanical properties, low density and are cheap. Natural fibers like jute, flax, hemp, coir and sisal have already been exploited as reinforcing material for various purposes such as in automotive, construction as well as in packaging industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412458716">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412458716">9</xref></sup> Among all the natural fibers, jute appears to be the most useful, economical and exhibits moderately higher mechanical properties. Jute is a commercially available fiber, which is cultivated almost exclusively in Bangladesh and India. It has high cellulose content and low microfibril angle which are the desirable properties of a fiber to be used as reinforcement in a polymer matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412458716">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412458716">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jute fiber consists of three major chemical constituents such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Jute fiber is hydrophilic in nature as it contains strongly polarized hydroxyl groups and other oxygen-containing groups. The hemicelluloses are mainly responsible for hydrophilic character, but the accessible cellulose, noncrystalline cellulose and surface of crystalline cellulose also play major roles. This fiber, therefore, is inherently incompatible with hydrophobic thermoplastics, such as polyolefins. The major limitations of using jute fiber as reinforcements in such matrices include poor interfacial adhesion between polar-hydrophilic fiber and nonpolar hydrophobic matrix and difficulties in mixing due to poor wetting of the fiber with the matrix. This in turn would lead to composites with weak interface. So, a strong adhesion at the interface of two different phases is needed for an effective transfer of stress and load distribution throughout the interface. This situation leads to development of strategies for surface modification of natural fibers or polymer matrices. Many attempts such as physical and chemical treatments have been adopted to improve the interfacial adhesion. Khan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412458716">12</xref></sup> explored the role of potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) and urea on mechanical and degradable properties of photocured coir (<italic>Cocos nucifera</italic>) fiber with 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate. Coir fiber treated with KMnO<sub>4</sub> alone and together with 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate and urea produced improved mechanical properties. For better mechanical performances of jute-PP composite, jute fabrics (hessian cloth) were treated with KMnO<sub>4</sub> solution in acetone of different concentrations and at different soaking times. Optimized KMnO<sub>4</sub>-treated jute fabrics were again treated with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) solution along with urea and promising improvement of mechanical properties of the composites was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412458716">13</xref></sup> Moharana et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412458716">14</xref></sup> used KMnO<sub>4</sub> as initiator on graft copolymerization of methyl methacrylate onto defatted jute fibers and found no improvement in the tensile properties of the fibers. Jute fabrics reinforced urethane-based thermoset composites along with optimized KMnO<sub>4</sub> treatment improved fiber/matrix adhesion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412458716">15</xref></sup> Woven bamboo mats were chemically modified with maleic anhydride, permanganate, benzoyl chloride, benzyl chloride and used as reinforcements in epoxy and polyester matrices. The tensile strength and modulus of permanganate-treated bamboo polyester composite were found to be increased significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412458716">16</xref></sup> Various surface treatments such as alkali, isocyanate, stearic acid, peroxide, permanganate and acetylation were carried out on the sisal fibers to improve interfacial bonding with low-density polyethylene (LDPE).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412458716">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412458716">18</xref></sup> The treatments enhanced the tensile properties of the composites considerably, but to varying degrees. Paul et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412458716">19</xref></sup> investigated the effect of KMnO<sub>4</sub> on dynamic mechanical properties of banana fiber and polypropylene (PP) composite.</p>
<p>In all cases, KMnO<sub>4</sub> (in acetone) initiates grafting of Mn<sup>3+</sup> ion onto the fibers, which increases the fiber/matrix adhesion. On the other hand, KMnO<sub>4</sub> in acid and alkali media acts as an oxidizing agent. As the structural unit of cellulose contains three hydroxyl groups, one primary and two secondary, it undergoes chemical reactions typical of hydroxyl groups. The susceptibility of cellulose to oxidizing media depends upon the nature of the oxidizing agents and the conditions applied. The rate of formation of oxidized cellulose is also influenced by temperature, concentration of oxidant and the nature of the oxidizing agent itself. Oxidation promotes roughness of fiber surface and causes brittleness in fibers depending on the nature and strength of the oxidizing agent. The primary oxidized products of cellulose (aldehyde, ketone and carboxyl group at C-6 position of cellulose unit) can be further oxidized to dialdehyde by scission of bond between C2 and C3, which can again transform into carboxyl groups depending on the strength of the oxidants and reaction time. Thus, various oxidized products can be formed during oxidation of cellulose with oxidizing agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412458716">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412458716">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present research work deals with the treatment of jute fabrics with KMnO<sub>4</sub> in oxalic acid (OA) medium as oxidizing agent. PP is used as a matrix material. The prime objective of this work is to study the effect of KMnO<sub>4</sub> on mechanical and thermal properties of jute fabrics and its composites. The investigation also involves in determining the degradation characteristics and water uptake of the composites.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0731684412458716" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Jute fabrics (Hessian cloth) were supplied by SADAT Textile Industries Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh. Average area weight of each sheet of jute fabric is 223.72 g/m<sup>2</sup>. KMnO<sub>4</sub>, OA and PP pellets (trade name: Cosmoplene) were procured from Merck, Germany, and the Polyolefin Company (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., respectively. The materials were used as received.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412458716"><title>Surface modification of jute fabrics</title>
<p>OA solutions of different concentrations (1.0–10.0 %w/v) were prepared in distilled water. In these solutions, concentration of KMnO<sub>4</sub> was maintained 0.01 %w/v. Jute fabrics were soaked with these solutions for 2 min at room temperature. The soaked jute fabrics were washed with running tap water for about 30 min to remove the unbound oxidizing agent. After soaking, jute fabrics were dried in an oven at 105°C for 6 h and then kept in a desiccator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412458716"><title>Fabrication of composites</title>
<p>PP sheets of desired size (15 cm × 13 cm) were prepared by compressing PP granules in the heat press (Carver, INC, USA, model 3856) at 190°C for 5 min under 5 tons pressure. PP sheets of different thicknesses were used for fabrication of the composites of different weight fraction of jute fabrics. Average area weight of each PP sheet for control composite is 237.66 g/m<sup>2</sup>. Jute fabrics were cut into small pieces of 15 cm × 13 cm size. Before composite fabrication, jute fabrics were dried in an oven at 105°C for 6 h and then kept in a desiccator. For composite fabrication, sandwich was made by alternately placing four layers of pre-weighed jute fabrics inside five layers of PP sheets. The sandwich was then placed between two steel plates with a composite fabrication mold which maintains the thickness of composite about 2 mm. The sandwich with this arrangement was compressed in the heat press at the same conditions which were applied for PP sheets preparation. After being heat pressed, PP sheets and composites were cooled to another press (Carver: model 4128) operated at cooling mode.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412458716"><title>Mechanical testing</title>
<p>Tensile test of composite samples was carried out by a universal testing machine using a gauge length of 20 mm and cross-head speed of 2 mm/min. Three-point bending strength of the composite samples was measured in the same machine with a span length of 58 mm and cross-head speed of 2 mm/min. The tests were carried out according to DIN 53455 and DIN 53452 standard methods, respectively. Impact strength (Charpy) of the composites and PP was carried out in an impact tester (MT-3016, Pendulum type, Germany) following ASTM D 6110-97. All the results were taken as the average value of five samples.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0731684412458716"><title>Thermal analysis</title>
<p>Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA 6300, USA) have been used to simultaneously perform TG and DTA measurements. Temperature was maintained at the range of 30 to 600°C with a heating rate of 20°C/min in a nitrogen (purged at 100 ml/min) environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0731684412458716"><title>Water uptake</title>
<p>Specimens (60 mm × 15 mm × 2 mm) of the composites (control and treated) were immersed in the static water of glass beaker at room temperature for different time periods (up to 30 days). Before immersion, weight of the samples was taken. At certain time intervals, samples were taken out from the beaker and wiped smoothly with tissue paper and then weighed immediately. Percent water uptake was then calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0731684412458716"><title>Water degradation test</title>
<p>Composite samples were completely immersed into the static water glass beaker at room temperature for a period of 30 days. At certain time interval, samples were taken out of water and dried in an oven at 105°C until the samples reached a constant weight and kept at room temperature for at least 24 h. Mechanical properties of the composites were then measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0731684412458716"><title>Soil degradation test</title>
<p>The composite samples were buried in soil at about 6 inches depth for different periods of time. After a certain period, samples were taken out carefully and washed with tap water to remove the soil particles from the surface of the specimens. Samples were then dried in an oven at 105°C until the samples reached a constant weight and kept at room temperature for at least 24 h. Mechanical properties of the samples were then measured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0731684412458716"><title>Simulated weathering test</title>
<p>Specimens of composite (60 × 15 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup>) were exposed for aging in simulated weather to an Accelerated weathering tester (model Q.U.V, the Q- Panel Company, USA). The test was carried out with alternating cycles of sunshine over 4 h (65 ± 2°C) and dews and condensation for 2 h (45°C ± 2°C). This treatment was carried out for a maximum period of 600 h.</p>

<sec id="sec13-0731684412458716"><title>Effect of fiber content</title>
<p>Incorporation of jute fabric in PP matrix greatly influences the mechanical properties of the composites. Tensile strength (TS), bending strength (BS), tensile modulus (TM), bending modulus (BM) and elongation at break (Eb) of the composites were measured as a function of jute content. Jute content in the composites varied from 28 to 52% by weight. It is clear from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412458716">Table 1</xref> that weight fraction of jute fabrics in composite up to 45% results in the increase of strengths and moduli of the composites. Further addition of jute fabrics (such as 50% fiber content) causes a reduction in strengths and moduli. So, the highest TS, BS, TM and BM of the composite were found for 45% wt. of fiber content.

<p>The highest values of the mechanical properties of composites at 45% fiber content may be explained in terms of orientation and homogeneity of fibers within matrix. At this stage, fibers get maximum level of orientation and mixed homogeneously within the matrix. As a result, when load is applied, stress is uniformly distributed among the fibers; hence, mechanical properties of the composites increase. At lower fiber content (such as 35% jute content), poor mechanical properties of the composites are attributed to nonhomogeneous fiber-matrix interaction. This results in low load transfer capacity among the fibers. As a consequence, stress gets accumulated at certain points of the composite and strains are also found highly localized in the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412458716">22</xref></sup> But at high level of jute contents (such as 52% jute content), fibers get agglomerated within the matrix which causes nonuniform stress transfer. Also, too many fiber ends promote microcrack formation in the interface. As a result, strength and moduli of the composite again decrease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412458716">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412458716">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eb of the composite is found to be decreased gradually as jute content increases. It is generally believed that elongation decreases with the increase of moduli of the composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412458716">24</xref></sup> It is notable that, after 45% fiber content, the value of Eb is further reduced with the decrease of strength and moduli of the composite. It may be explained that jute fiber has much lower value of Eb than that of PP matrix and nonhomogeneity of interfacial adhesion predominates gradually with increase of fiber content. Furthermore, the formation of microcracks at higher fiber content might have been responsible for the reduction of Eb. So, at first, up to optimum fiber content, modulus is likely to play the key role for the reduction of Eb. Secondly, above the optimum level, decrease of Eb is mainly guided by the higher fiber content.</p>

<p>Composites prepared with KMnO<sub>4</sub>-treated jute fabrics in OA medium are denoted here as “C<sub>KM(OA)</sub>” and jute fabrics as “J<sub>KM(OA)</sub>”. The effect of KMnO<sub>4</sub> in OA medium on TS and BS of the composites is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412458716">Figure 1</xref>. It is observed that TS and BS increase up to 5.0% OA treatment after that there is a decrease in strengths. The similar behavior is also recorded for TM and BM of the treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412458716">Figure 2</xref>). It is observed that all the mechanical parameters achieve the highest values for 5.0% C<sub>KM(OA)</sub>. TS of the treated composite (5.0% C<sub>KM(OA)</sub>) increases from 52 to 69.8 MPa, which is 34.2% higher than that of the control composite, and BS increases from 63.0 to 80.2 MPa, which shows 27.3% improvement. On the other hand, TM and BM increase to 24.27% (from 1.03 to 1.28 GPa) and 45.3% (from 3.27 to 4.75 GPa), respectively, than that of the control composite.

<p>The changes in mechanical properties of the treated composites may be explained on the basis of oxidizing effect of KMnO<sub>4</sub> in OA medium onto jute fabrics. During oxidation, many changes happen into the cellulosic materials. The chemical and physical properties of the oxidized celluloses depend upon the nature of the oxidizing agents, oxidizing medium and the conditions applied. The rate of formation of oxidized cellulose is influenced by the concentration of oxidant, and the nature of the oxidizing agent itself. The rate of oxidation of the cellulose may be greatly accelerated by the simultaneous oxidation of a third substance in the system. When cellulose is treated with potassium dichromate and OA, both the OA and the cellulose are oxidized and the oxidation of the latter takes place much more rapidly than when cellulose is treated with potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid. Oxycelluloses of the extreme reducing type are conveniently prepared by treatment with potassium dichromate and OA. During oxidation cellulosic materials may undergo the attack on the surface of the crystallites which causes roughness of the fibers. On the severity of the action, the penetration into the amorphous and crystalline areas may also occur that degrades the fiberous materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412458716">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412458716">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412458716">25</xref></sup> So, at lower concentrations of OA treatment (up to 5.0%), it can be assumed that the oxidized jute fabrics experience surface roughness and a reduction in compactness of the fiber bundles, which enhance effective surface area available for contact with the matrix. The additional sites of mechanical interlocking promote more interpenetration between fibers and PP matrix. As a result, mechanical properties of the composites increase upon treatment of jute fabrics with KMnO<sub>4</sub> at lower concentrations of OA. At higher concentrations (such as 8.0% OA), KMnO<sub>4</sub> may penetrate and attack into the amorphous regions and some of the crystalline regions that may degrade the fiberous materials. This morphological change causes agglomeration of fibers in the matrix or inhomogeneous stress transfer when load is applied. This resulted poor mechanical properties in the composites.</p>

<p>The mechanical and thermal behavior of jute fabric/PP composites was studied with special reference to fiber content and fiber treatment. The mechanical properties of the untreated composites were found highest at 45% fiber content. Treatment of jute fiber with KMnO<sub>4</sub> in OA medium brought an important change in the properties of the composites. Thermal analytical data showed that thermal stability of the composites either treated or untreated was higher than that of PP or jute fabrics. Treatment of jute fabrics increases the thermal stability of the composite. Treated jute composites exhibited lower tendency of water uptake compared to control composite. For better fiber–matrix adhesion, KMnO<sub>4</sub> (in optimized OA concentration)-treated jute composites retained much of its mechanical properties in different environmental conditions compared to control composite.</p>
