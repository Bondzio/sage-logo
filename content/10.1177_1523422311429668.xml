<p><bold>The Problem.</bold></p>
<p>Postsecondary institutions are struggling more than ever before to find qualified, effective leaders to move into key administrative positions. One reason for the continued lack of prepared leaders is that there still remain few women in higher education positioned to take on such critical roles.</p>
<p><bold>The Solution.</bold></p>
<p>This Issue overview introduces the importance of and connections among HRD, leadership development, higher education, and leadership programs for women in higher education. It highlights the Issue’s overall problem, purpose, the approach used, and its relevance to practice. Concerns around the shortage of women in leadership positions in higher education settings are introduced, and the unique features of this particular Special Issue are outlined along with a brief introduction of each article.</p>
<p><bold>The Stakeholders.</bold></p>
<p>This Issue will provide researchers and practitioners in various fields of study with frameworks to use in developing, evaluating, and researching leadership programs for women in higher education and beyond.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422311429668">Bennis and Goldsmith (2003)</xref> argued that “immediate demands for leadership confront us daily. Our cities are in crisis, our communities face turmoil, our political, religious, and business leaders are repeatedly charged with ethical violations, and the world’s multiple demands require our immediate attention” (pp. xi-xii). With such critical needs in society today, leadership development has become an important area of inquiry within human resource development (HRD) and is now emerging as foundational to our field. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422311429668">Rosser (2007)</xref>, leadership development is a unique aspect of HRD “because it is important to both scholars and practitioners and is a common thread among the foundational areas of the discipline” (p. 236). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422311429668">Callahan, Whitener, and Sandlin (2007)</xref> stated that “leadership development is arguably one of the most important activities undertaken by HRD professionals” (p. 146). They purport that the process of leadership development has implications for career development, training and development, and organization development—the three core categories of action that characterize the field of HRD. In fact, it is now commonplace to find leadership development articles published in most HRD journals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422311429668">Fambrough &amp; Hart, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422311429668">Kormanik &amp; Rajan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422311429668">Manderscheid, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422311429668">Muyia &amp; Kacirek, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422311429668">Simmonds &amp; Tsui, 2010</xref>). As a field dedicated to improving learning and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422311429668">Stanley, 2009</xref>), it makes sense that leadership development is now central to HRD theory, research, and practice.</p>
<p>Developing leaders has become critical for organizations of all kinds and in all sectors (e.g., corporate, education, not for profit, government), and therefore generating theory, research, and practice in each sector is important as well. A decade ago some researchers and practitioners believed that the field of HRD was only focused on studies and practice in corporate settings; however, this limited view has since been dispelled as there are a plethora of HRD journal articles and conference proceedings that focus on leadership research and practice in all industries, including higher education. In fact, Richard J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422311429668">Torraco’s (2005)</xref> seminal Special Issue of <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resources</italic>, titled “Organization Development and Change in Universities,” highlighted the importance of HRD research and practice in postsecondary institutions.</p>
<p>Within higher education, leadership development programs and interventions have now reached a critical level of importance. According to Brent D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422311429668">Rubin (2004)</xref>, author of the book <italic>Pursuing Excellence in Higher Education: Eight Fundamental Challenges</italic>, “Extraordinary challenges face higher education nationally, and leaders with exceptional capabilities are needed to help institutions meet these challenges” (p. 288). Within this constantly changing higher educational environment, leaders must now have an exceptional set of capabilities and competencies to help their institutions rise to new levels of excellence and innovation. Hence, postsecondary institutions are now struggling more than ever to find qualified, effective leaders not only to take the helms of their colleges and universities but also to move into other important leadership positions. One reason for the continued lack of prepared leaders is that there remain fewer women positioned to take on such critical roles (e.g., president, provost, vice president, dean, director, and department chair; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311429668">Airini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311429668">The White House Project, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1523422311429668">
<title>Women and Leadership in Higher Education</title>
<p>Recent literature continues to highlight the gender discrepancies in academia. For example, in the United States, the <italic>White House Project Report</italic> highlighted the following four key findings:</p>
<list id="list1-1523422311429668" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Nationally, women are 57% of all college students but only 26% of full professors, 23% of university presidents, and 14% of presidencies at the doctoral degree–granting institutions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The number of female presidents has not changed in the past 10 years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Women account for less than 30% of the board members on college and university boards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Female faculty have not made any progress in closing the salary gap with their male counterparts. In 1972, they made 83% of what male faculty made: today they make 82% of what male faculty make. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311429668">The White House Project, 2009</xref>, p. 10)</p></list-item></list>
<p>Report authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422311429668">The White House Project, 2009</xref>) argued that there is much more at stake than just the number of women who have reached top ranks in academia. They believe that “the presence—or absence—of female academic leaders can have far-reaching influences not only on the institutions themselves, but . . . on the scope of research and knowledge that affects us all” (p. 16). For example, when female academics are involved in research, it affects the nature of the questions that are asked as well as the findings. When successful women leaders work with students (male or female), faculty, and staff, it is more likely that others will have positive experiences that help change their perspectives toward women in leadership positions. In addition, these women can serve as “powerful role models and mentors to younger women starting out on the path to leadership themselves” (p. 16).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311429668">Airini et al. (2011)</xref> argued that although women do advance to leadership roles in universities, “gender imbalance among senior university academics is an acknowledged problem in many countries” (p. 44) and that only slow progress has been made. They found five themes that focus on what helps or hinders the advancement of women in university settings: work relationships, university environment, invisible rules, proactivity, and personal circumstance (p. 59). Many authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422311429668">Airini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422311429668">Bornstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422311429668">Dominico, Fried, &amp; Zeger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311429668">Ramsey, 2000</xref>) have discussed in detail these and other themes; they have then recommended how to fix or address these <italic>leaks in the pipeline</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311429668">Ramsey (2000)</xref> stated that “without efforts to dismantle existing barriers to women’s progression . . . the result may well be yet more highly skilled women who nevertheless remain on the margins of the leadership and management of their institutions” (p. 16). Researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422311429668">Ramsey, 2000</xref>) have also acknowledged that women’s leadership development cannot be pursued in isolation if successful institutional changes are to occur. Yet one thing remains clear: Leadership development programs for women continue to be a critical element in teaching and supporting women in higher education to prepare for, attain, and maintain positions of influence within their institutions. The bottom line is that we need to help prepare (e.g., increase aspirations, develop skills and competencies, obtain mentors and coaches) more women for leadership in higher education.</p>
<p>For decades, there have been both established and emerging leadership development programs for women in higher education. Directors and boards of these successful programs have worked hard to create various types of programs and experiences that will help develop, network, and prepare women to move into positions of influence. Researchers, scholars, and practitioners in this field are only beginning to publish in this area. Information and research about these programs, efforts, and strategies have not been widely shared, so scholarly articles on these programs are difficult to find. Thousands of institutions across the globe are struggling with how to design programs to help their own female faculty, staff, and administrators develop leadership skills. There is a need for scholarly articles that can provide information on programs that will be helpful to these postsecondary institutions. These types of articles could assist women interested in personal and career development as well as be helpful to educators, administrators, and consultants who will be designing future leadership development interventions (e.g., training, development, individual preparation, mentoring, career management, and self-directed learning). It could also provide important directions for future research.</p>

<title>Special Issue: Purpose and Information</title>
<p>The purpose of this Special Issue of <italic>Advances</italic> is to examine the topic of women and leadership development in higher education. Specifically, the intent is to link theory, research, and practice together to assess the current state of leadership development programs for women in higher educational contexts and also offer suggestions for future leadership development programs, strategies, and research. It provides researchers and practitioners in various fields of study (e.g., HRD, management, leadership, business, organizational psychology, education, women’s issues) with frameworks to be used for developing, evaluating, and researching leadership programs for women in higher education.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this journal Issue will be the first of its kind, from any discipline, focused exclusively on women’s leadership programs in higher education. By filling this gap, this Issue directly contributes toward HRD, leadership development, and higher education research and practice. This Issue has a set of multidisciplinary authors, from a host of different areas (e.g., HRD, human resources, management, leadership, law, higher education, faculty development, educational policy and administration, assessment, student affairs, external relationships, and ethics and philosophy). Because this Issue will be of interest to scholars, researchers, and practitioners from a variety of disciplines and fields—not just HRD—readership will be varied. With this in mind, it is best to keep this Issue as inclusive as possible. Therefore, because I have already presented the case that leadership development is a core foundation to HRD, authors will highlight how their articles have relevance to leadership development, potential for advancing theory of leadership development, and potential for advancing the practice of leadership development.</p>
<p>This is a unique Issue in that it is written by many scholar-practitioners, not solely researchers. Although most have terminal degrees, these authors are women who are directing and/or advising programs, centers, and/or initiatives related to helping women in higher education develop leadership. Yet for this Special Issue, they have put on a reflective historical lens that has helped them in thinking critically about the journeys of their programs in a way that has assisted them (and their readers) in understanding how we might create and evaluate effective programs. Scholarly voices do come from different places—including practitioners—and it is important for researchers to value experience from the field that can inform the literature and theory. These <italic>tales from the field</italic>, often in the form of nontraditional scholarship, can provide insights that can actually catapult the work of researchers. Overall, this is a collection of historical program perspectives, including changes and improvements made throughout the years based on in-depth evaluation—a type of action research. It also serves as a collection of practitioner insights and experiences as they <italic>learned by doing</italic>.</p>
<p>This Issue is based on studies that may be more evaluative in nature. Some purport that evaluation is not a scholarly research method. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422311429668">Denzin and Lincoln (2000)</xref> stated that some researchers have built their approaches to qualitative research upon evaluation research models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311429668">Martineua, Hannum, and Reinelt (2007)</xref>, authors of the Center for Creative Leadership’s, <italic>The Handbook of Leadership Development Evaluation</italic>, wrote that both evaluation and research are multifaceted and can be very similar. They both depend on “empirical inquiry methods and techniques, but often differ in their purpose,” and the distinction blurs between the two when complex initiatives are evaluated (p. 7). In fact, the purposes of evaluating leadership development (e.g., to figure out the benefits of leadership development programs for individuals and organizations, to refine and improve programs, to make connections between leadership development and organizational performance, and to discover what leadership competencies are most appropriate in various settings; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422311429668">Martineua et al., 2007</xref>) blur with many of the purposes of related applied HRD research. The point is that there is definite value in articles written about programs that report improvements based on evaluative data.</p>

<title>Article Descriptions</title>
<p>Contributions to this Issue of <italic>Advances</italic> were by invitation. Authors were invited based on my knowledge of the top leadership programs for women in higher education and a few were referred by those who direct these top programs. This Issue consists of this introductory article and then six articles that serve as cases of leadership development programs in higher education for women. The first four articles are based on national-level programs for women in higher education, whereas the final two highlight specific university-based centers and programs that provide excellent cases of implementing comprehensive leadership development programs and initiatives at the campus level. The concluding piece provides a brief synthesis of Issue findings and contributions to HRD research, theory, and practice; it also offers tables that highlight sample leadership programs for women in higher education.</p>
<p>The first article, “HERS Institutes: Curriculum for Advancing Women Leaders in Higher Education,” written by Judith S. White, reports on one of the oldest, largest, and most intensive programs dedicated exclusively to leadership development for women in higher education—Higher Education Resource Services (HERS). She provides a history of the program, structure, curriculum, assessment and evaluation, strategic changes, and plans for the future. HERS actually reaches beyond the United States to include development for women in other countries as well.</p>
<p>The second article focuses on leadership programs in New Zealand. Candice Harris and Sarah I. Leberman’s work, titled “Leadership Development for Women in New Zealand Universities: Learning From the New Zealand Women in Leadership Program,” argues that women are underrepresented in senior academic and general positions in New Zealand as well as other countries. This article adds to the literature by describing and discussing the outcomes of the national New Zealand Women in Leadership program. A longitudinal case study approach was used to study the program at both the individual and organizational levels, and findings have implications for program development for women at other universities and in other countries.</p>
<p>The next article, “Moving Beyond the Stained Glass Ceiling: Preparing Women for Leadership in Faith-Based Higher Education” by Karen A. Longman and Shawna L. Lafreniere, focuses on issues faced by women in higher education through the <italic>gendered realities</italic> they experience in evangelical higher education. A women’s leadership development initiative sponsored by the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities is discussed and includes the findings of a survey of participants regarding the perceived impact of various elements of the program. Implications for HRD and higher education professionals are also outlined.</p>
<p>The final national-level program discussed in this Special Issue is titled “Networking to Leadership in Higher Education: National and State-Based Networks for Developing Women,” by Josefina Castillo Baltodano, Susan Carlson, Leah Witcher Jackson, and Wanda Mitchell. It first presents current literature on leadership issues in the United States for higher education. They then outline the leadership programming of the Office of Women in Higher Education at the American Council on Education and its related state-based volunteer organizations. The article provides a few case studies of state networks in addition to sharing assessment data for this volunteer, loosely affiliated set of networks. It concludes with implications for stakeholders and opportunities for further research.</p>
<p>The next two articles focus on leadership programs at two universities in the United States. The first is an article, titled “Developing Women Leaders on Campus: A Human Resources—Women’s Center Partnership at the University of Minnesota,” was written by Denise Bonebright, Anitra Cottledge, and Peg Lonnquist. It focuses on the University of Minnesota Women’s Center, which is the oldest campus-based women’s center in the United States, and its partnership with the Office of Human Resources. This article briefly outlines the fifty-year history of the center while discussing its original mission and guiding principles. It then highlights the partnerships’ leadership development programs for women and future challenges. This includes information and evaluation of key programs that can be applied to the work of any entity that seeks to develop women leaders in higher education.</p>
<p>The Ohio State University has also developed a program that has assisted many women, particularly women of color, prepare for leadership positions in their institution. Eunice Ellen Hornsby, Hazel A. Morrow-Jones, and Deborah Ballam, in their article titled “Leadership Development for Faculty Women at The Ohio State University: The President and Provost’s Leadership Initiative,” discuss a program created specifically to develop a pool of women and underrepresented minority faculty. Their article reviews the institutes’ development, curriculum, evaluation, and subsequent changes. They argue that leadership development and succession planning in higher education present special challenges that may help inform other environments where professionals operate with autonomy. Implications to leadership development and research questions moving forward are also outlined.</p>
<p>In the final article, “Women’s Leadership Development in Higher Education: Conclusion and Implications to HRD,” my colleagues (Karen A. Longman and Jessica R. Daniels) and I provide some key conclusive insights and then highlight six particularly important findings and implications to HRD research and practice. We conclude with three tables that highlight sample leadership development programs for women in higher education at the international/national, state/regional, and institutional levels.</p>
