<abstract>
<p>Theories of policy and institutional reform are of major interest to numerous disciplines in the social sciences. The main question motivating this study is under what circumstances is dramatic reform possible. It is argued that theories of reform formulated within two central heuristic frameworks—historical institutionalism and punctuated equilibrium—fail to satisfactorily explain reform dynamics in small policy domains, which are characterized by having program constituencies with little political clout. In small policy domains, dramatic reform is facilitated by the political weakness of the opposition. Policy makers are able to pursue reform successfully in small domains without resorting to obfuscation strategies or reliance on slow-moving institutional mechanisms. This argument is illustrated in a study of mental health care privatization in two American states: Massachusetts and Texas.</p>

<body>
<p>On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the health care bill into law, and thus, the tumultuous campaign for health care reform ended successfully. Despite what appeared to be relatively favorable conditions for reform (e.g., Democratic control of Congress, public sense of crisis), this result was far from a given and surprised numerous political commentators who predicted health care reform failure only a couple of months before (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711412911">Khan, 2010</xref>). The interaction of government institutions and economic interests created formidable obstacles that foiled reform repeatedly in the past and were very close to doing so once again. American health care reform is one of many examples of difficult policy reform. It is little wonder therefore that social scientists seem to treat policy reform as the holy grail of public policy.</p>
<p>This article investigates the conditions for reform but not for the entire policy universe. Instead, it draws on the insights of the policy sector/domain literature and explores policy dynamics in a specific policy sector or more accurately a number of policy domains that share a common characteristic that sets them apart from other domains. Specifically, the study investigates reform in the shape of privatization of delivery in mental health care in two American states: Massachusetts and Texas. This work’s main goal is to assess whether privatization of this type is constrained by institutional obstacles, as has been shown to be the case in studies of much larger policy domains (e.g., general health care) or whether the relatively small size of this domain—small primarily in terms of budget, clientele, and workers—leads to different policy dynamics and outcomes. It is argued that policy domain size indeed plays a role: The marginal political position of small program constituencies implies that policy makers’ intent on reform need not be overly concerned with the political implications of public program constituency opposition. Hence, they could implement dramatic reform—a type of reform that most studies of large policy domains view as unlikely. Moreover, in contrast to what has been found in larger policy domains, policy makers are not forced to resort to obfuscation strategies or reliance on slow-moving institutional mechanisms to overcome opposition.</p>
<p>This study argues that small domains tend to be politically marginal, and this leads to a very different policy evolution dynamic than that which pertains to large domains. However, the claim that small domains are “politically” marginal should not be confused with a claim that they are “substantially” unimportant. Although small domains impact a small number of people, these individuals could be affected in a very intense way. Furthermore, small domains add up. Program constituencies in small domains do not necessarily overlap and, in the aggregate, the number of people who are affiliated with small domains is large. Students of public administration, for these reasons, would do well to pay attention to small domains and a study of the distinct political dynamics that underpin small domain policy evolution is an important contribution in this respect.</p>
<p>In the next section, different theories of reform are discussed. This is followed by a discussion of why reform in a small domain does not follow the standard theoretical blueprints. After a brief discussion of the case selection, the article turns to a survey of mental health privatization in Massachusetts and Texas. This article focuses on theory building; hence, privatization in these two cases is intended as an illustration of the main argument regarding small domains and not as a test. The final section analyzes the two states’ experience and situates it in a broader empirical and theoretical context.</p>
<sec id="section1-0095399711412911">
<title>Reform, Historical Institutionalism (HI), and Punctuated Equilibrium (PE)</title>
<p>As a preliminary to the consideration of reform dynamics in small domains, a brief discussion of the object of analysis, privatization of delivery in small domains, is required.</p>
<p>This study’s unit of analysis is the privatization of service delivery but not necessarily funding. In the United States, as is true of most other countries, the government (federal, state, or local) funds services for the seriously mentally ill. However, the delivery of publicly funded services could be contracted out to a host of private providers—whether they are for profit or nonprofit. Privatization therefore implies that the delivery of publicly funded services is transferred from public to private hands.</p>
<p>Mental health care is treated as a distinct policy domain in this article. The definition of policy domain—which largely overlaps with policy subsystem, policy sector, or program—is comprised of two main components. First, a policy domain includes its own bureaucrats, professionals, program constituencies, and economic interests. All of these comprise a policy network that deals with a finite number of issues, which tend to be distinct from those of other domains. In general, policy domains are self-contained: They have a history separate from that of other domains, and they deal with different issues and often do so in a fashion different from that of other domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711412911">Freeman, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711412911">Kim &amp; Roh, 2008</xref>). Second, a policy domain has a formal government administrative organization that is dedicated specifically to formulation and implementation of policy pertinent to the domain. In fact, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711412911">Freeman (1985)</xref> points out, separate government institutions—departments or agencies—often are the cause for the formation of the domain in the first place because program networks tend to develop around formal institutions.</p>
<p>The main questions asked in this work are what outcomes can we expect in terms of the pace and scope of reform in a small domain and what means are used by policy makers to promote reform. Two nonmutually exclusive theories, or heuristic frameworks, will be discussed below with respect to the possibility, contours, and methods of reform: HI and PE. These two theories are prominent in the recent policy literature, especially in their application to policy change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711412911">Capano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711412911">Howlett &amp; Rayner, 2006</xref>). Moreover, HI and PE represent different strands in the policy process literature in terms of the nature of the factors that drive dramatic change: PE, as discussed further below, relies primarily on endogenous mechanisms, whereas HI appeals to exogenous factors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399711412911">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>HI directs attention not only to the significance of institutions in shaping actor incentives and policy but also to the way that institutional legacies influence current preferences and constrain present action by government or others. Closely related, the concept of “path dependency” connotes stability that is brought about by endogenous factors that reinforce the status quo. A relevant example is the way that the establishment of public welfare programs has generated public program constituencies, which include both producers and consumers, who protect the program from which they benefit from retrenchment and major overhaul. Hence, it is difficult to initiate major reform because the program has engendered constituencies that are attached to the program in its current form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412911">Pierson, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412911">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711412911">Thelen, 1999</xref>). This is an example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412911">Pierson (2000)</xref> calls “positive feedback loops” that reinforce the status quo. These loops could also rely on other mechanisms, such as ones that involve significant economic costs for switching systems (e.g., moving from a pay-as-you-go pension system to a funded one) or coordination effects (e.g., interdependence of incarceration and mental health reform in the United States). Path-dependent systems have a clear status-quo bias and whatever change does occur is constrained in its direction and pace by the extant institutional architecture and associated policy arrangements. Dramatic change is viewed as a very rare event that is likely to result from an exogenous shock, which creates a relatively short critical juncture in which dramatic reform could happen (e.g., how regime change in Eastern European countries enabled dramatic welfare state reforms).</p>
<p>The HI literature features another institutional property that inhibits change in addition to path dependency. Although path dependency is commonplace in all countries, some states are more resistant to reform than others because the political system’s structure allows numerous institutional and political actors to use their position to block reform. Hence, reform is less likely when there are more “veto players” in a system. For example, all else being equal, it is more difficult to pass reform in the United States, which has multiple veto players (e.g., president, Congress, courts, and different levels of government) than in England, a unitary political system with a single veto player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711412911">Huber &amp; Stephens, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711412911">Tsebelis, 1995</xref>). In the HI framework, differences across political systems are often explained with reference to cross-country variation in veto players, whereas continuity within the system has been analyzed in terms of path dependency. HI has been applied to a range of policy domains, notably among them general health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711412911">Gildiner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711412911">Hacker, 2004b</xref>), pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711412911">Béland, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711412911">Myles &amp; Pierson, 2001</xref>), and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711412911">Fusarelli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711412911">Klitgaard, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>What types of change and reform are possible in a path-dependent and veto-ridden system? Numerous articles have criticized HI for lacking a satisfactory theory of endogenous change and instead relying on exogenous shock as the primary reason for reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711412911">Kay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711412911">Peters, Pierre, &amp; King, 2005</xref>). Path-dependent theories, according to some critics, impute increasing returns that enforce the status quo with no opportunity for change until an exogenous shock comes along and dramatically transforms institutions and policy in one fell swoop. Path dependency, therefore, implies either “no change” or radical change with no options in between—an unrealistic representation of the policy world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711412911">Peters et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711412911">Ross, 2007</xref>). However, such an understanding of path dependency seriously misconstrues the theory as expounded by its leading theorists. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711412911">Pierson (2000)</xref>, perhaps the central proponent of the HI perspective, argues that<disp-quote>
<p>Asserting that the social landscape can be permanently frozen hardly is credible, and that is not the claim. Change continues, but it is bounded change-until something erodes or swamps the mechanisms of reproduction that generate continuity. (p. 265)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, there is an increasing emphasis within HI literature on the exploration of strategies that allow policy change even if this is slow-paced change. First, different strategies are used by policy makers to achieve blame avoidance—strategies that compromise the effectiveness of opposition to reform. Among these, one can include shifting responsibility (but not budgets) to a lower level of government so that it will shoulder the blame for cutbacks; compensating those potentially hurt by the policy and applying a “divide and rule” strategy or defusing the opposition by reframing issues (e.g., use of the term “personal accounts” as a euphemism for “privatization” in reference to proposed Social Security reform in the United States; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412911">Pierson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0095399711412911">Weaver, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, recently, several authors have shown how change can occur by the use of a host of institutional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711412911">Hacker, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412911">Streeck &amp; Thelen, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711412911">Hacker (2004a)</xref>, for instance, discusses three mechanisms that underpin change: Conversion occurs when existing institutions are reoriented to achieve new goals and/or to promote the interests of other, nonintended actors. Policy drift takes place when existing policy is not adjusted. Sometimes this is done intentionally to address a changing reality, thus creating a mismatch between policy and its context. Finally, policy makers resort to “layering”; that is, when they cannot alter existing institutions, they add additional layers on top (or alongside) of them. This creates a distinctly separate institutional arrangement that reflects their preferences. If the growth of the new layer outpaces the established institutions, then it could eventually come to dominate the policy field. Despite criticisms to the contrary, path dependency does not imply that without a rare exogenous shock there is no movement from the status quo. By using strategies of blame avoidance or through small-scale institutional tinkering, policy makers are able to affect change that might be incremental but in the long run could accumulate into a significant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711412911">Pierson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412911">Streeck &amp; Thelen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Some commentators argue that PE overlaps with HI because it predicts long periods of policy stability—if not stagnation—and then a sudden lurch to a new policy equilibrium point: a dramatic change that is equated with the function of critical junctures in path dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711412911">Ross, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711412911">Streeck &amp; Thelen, 2005</xref>). However, what is overlooked is that although PE might overlap, or complement, path dependency, unlike classical path dependency, it does not rely on exogenous shock for an explanation of policy breaks and transformations. According to Baumgartner, Jones, and True, change in a PE framework is provoked by the accumulated “errors” of institutional policy arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711412911">Baumgartner &amp; Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711412911">Jones, Baumgartner, &amp; True, 1998</xref>). Theories such as HI or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0095399711412911">Wildavsky’s (1964)</xref> incrementalism, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711412911">Baumgartner and Jones (2009)</xref>, are correct in arguing that there is an inbuilt status-quo bias in the system that allows for only very limited change, if that, during long periods. However, this could lead to a growing mismatch between stagnant policy and a changing policy environment. At some point, the growing inadequacy of the policy would be significant enough to merit media and public attention, and policy makers, due to public criticism, would react—perhaps even overreact—with a major reform that would shift the policy point of equilibrium. Thus, policy reform is ultimately a response to accumulated error that has suddenly risen to the top of the public agenda and not exogenous shock. It is worth noting that PE allows for radical reform, and for such reform to happen, policy failures must attract considerable public attention and condemnation.</p>

<title>Reform in Small Programs</title>
<p>The rich, welfare state literature includes empirical studies of both large-N econometric analysis and detail-rich case studies. These studies have focused almost exclusively on either macro-level variables (e.g., social expenditure levels as a dependent variable) or on large policy programs (large in the sense of large budgets, numbers of clientele, and, often, also a large number of workers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711412911">Pierson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711412911">Starke, Obinger, &amp; Castles, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0095399711412911">Wilensky, 1975</xref>). The focus on macro-level variables has often been criticized for omission of important changes that can only be discerned at program level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711412911">Amable, Gatti, &amp; Schumacher, 2006</xref>). In quite a different manner, the present study draws attention to the limitations of inferring from the analysis of large policy programs to other cases.</p>
<p>To appreciate why this might be a problem, it is beneficial to reconsider the logic of HI and PE in the context of a small policy domain. To do this, we should take a step back and ask how size might matter. It is argued here that size correlates to a great extent with a program constituency’s political power. The political importance of a policy program is obviously not determined by one single factor. Properties such as program constituency’s resources, organization, and political connections all contribute to the political standing of a policy program. Nevertheless, the focus on size is understandable given the centrality of numbers in electoral politics and the positive correlation likely between program size and program constituency resources. Stakeholders of a large program tend to have more political muscle than stakeholders in a smaller program. Furthermore, the main issues on the agenda in a large policy program are more easily transformed into issues that concern the media and the general public. Thus, clearly, numbers do make a difference, at least in democratic political systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0095399711412911">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the HI framework, the political power of program constituencies has a central role. As presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711412911">Pierson (1996)</xref>, program constituencies are able to fight off privatization and retrenchment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0095399711412911">3</xref></sup> If, for example, a policy maker promotes market-based reforms in the U.S. Social Security program (e.g., individual accounts), then the program constituency (anchored by the AARP) would mobilize against him or her and his or her party in the coming elections because such an act would most likely increase future benefit uncertainties for beneficiaries. The electoral loss could be devastating given the number of people affected. But would this logic apply to market-based reforms in programs in which the program constituency has far less political clout? It would appear that this central obstacle to reform is far less formidable in a small than a large policy domain. Even the institutional barriers associated with veto players are likely to be less significant where small domains are involved. This might appear puzzling at first given the fact that the general political structure remains constant across all domains. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711412911">Immergut (1992)</xref> argues that group’s size matters little in explaining successful resistance to reform: It is the group’s ability to use veto points that ultimately determines political outcomes (pp. 15-20). However, what Immergut appears to ignore is that a certain threshold of political power must be passed to activate veto players. The fact, for example, that privatization measures must be approved by both the governor and the legislature becomes less significant if public program constituencies have little access to, and influence over, either of these two institutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tactics and mechanisms by which change is made possible in large programs appear almost superfluous in small programs. Blame avoidance, framing, and compensation are unnecessary tactics in the context of a low-risk political environment. Similarly, conversion, drift, and layering are no longer political imperatives, although they might occur due to cost-containment reasons. Instead, market-based reform in small policy programs could be conducted in a direct and dramatic manner, not incrementally, and without any smoke or screens. This is precisely what is not supposed to happen according to the common view in the HI literature.</p>
<p>The PE reform logic is affected no less significantly by domain size than HI. According to PE, a shift in policy equilibrium is the result of accumulated error that quite suddenly attracts media and public attention and requires political action. But what if most of the public, and in turn policy makers, show little interest in the domain and its problems? In a recent book, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711412911">Baumgartner, Berry, Hojnacki, Kimball, and Leech (2009)</xref> stress that different issues vie for political attention and small issues—defined as issues that affect a small number of people—are at a clear disadvantage and are unlikely to generate reform. The implication is that small domains lack attention and therefore policy makers have little incentive to invest in small domain reform.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0095399711412911">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>What does this imply for the pace and extent of reform in small domains? Reform, unchecked by the political pressure exerted by influential program’s constituencies, could proceed quickly. Hence, despite the implicit and explicit (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711412911">Immergut, 1992</xref> above) view in the HI literature that size does not matter, it is plausible to argue that given the relative absence of breaks, greater reform could be achieved in small programs than in large programs: there will be more retrenchment and, in general, more restructuring. However, this conclusion should be tempered by the possibility that market-based reform in small domains might be absent due to a lack of political interest in the field. Policy makers in small domains are not spurred into action by widespread public outrage, as is anticipated by PE. Thus, in small domains, we might witness a bifurcated reform reality: Once reform is on the agenda, it could spread like wildfire but, in other instances, hardly anything happens because there is not enough political interest to ignite the process.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is a lively debate about the contours of (market based) welfare state–related reform: its extent, pace, and the methods of its expansion. It has been argued above that the main approaches to reform should be applied, if at all, in a different way to small domains than to large ones. Electoral risk will be of minor concern to policy makers because prospective political fallout involved is small due to the weak position of program constituencies. There will be minimal use of compensation, blame avoidance and issue-reframing tactics, and reliance on friction-minimizing institutional mechanism to advance reform. Interest-based motivation for reform might be weak but if initiated, the pace and extent of reform could be quite significant. In short, reform in small policy programs is expected to involve different motivations, politics, and means and leads to different results than is the case in larger policy programs.</p>

<title>Case Selection and Method</title>
<p>The policy domain selected for study is mental health care. Although around the world, for professional reasons, efforts are made to integrate mental health care with general health care, this effort underlines the fact that mental health care is still largely a self-contained policy domain with distinct institutions; professional, client, and producer organizations; and above all, a policy that is formulated separately from that of general health care (in contrast, say, to oncology; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711412911">Becker &amp; Vazquez-Barquero, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711412911">Horvitz-Lennon, Kilbourne, &amp; Pincus, 2006</xref>). In the two states in which the study was conducted, separate state-level departments dedicated to mental health operate (Massachusetts) or operated for 40 years until a recent consolidation (Texas).</p>
<p>Why consider mental health care a small domain?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0095399711412911">5</xref></sup> The language of “small–large” domain misleadingly suggests a dichotomy, but clearly, we are dealing with a multidimensional (e.g., budget, clientele, and workforce) continuum, not a one-dimensional dichotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0095399711412911">6</xref></sup> Mental health care is small relative to the domains that receive most of the academic attention: general health care, K-12 education, pensions, and so on. If, for example, the budgets, workforce, and number of clients served in Massachusetts and Texas’ mental health care are compared with the corresponding categories in the K-12 school domain in the same states, the difference is roughly one order of magnitude across the board. Furthermore, the mental health care domain is often characterized as politically marginal by practitioners and academic studies, a fact that ties in well to the main argument of this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412911">John Kingdon (1984)</xref>, for example, reports that survey respondents in the health field viewed mental health as being least prominent on the public agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412911">Kingdon, 1984</xref>, Table 1-1). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711412911">Baumgartner et al. (2009)</xref> in their discussion of small constituencies that fail to impact the public agenda make specific mention of mental health care as an example.</p>

It has been argued above that once reform in a small domain has been initiated, in contrast to larger domains, it could spread quickly. The choice of American case studies constitutes, in this context, a choice of critical case studies because fast-paced change in the American veto-ridden policy environment is considered unlikely according to HI theories. Hence, the case selection has set a difficult test for the argument: If dramatic reform takes place in veto-ridden American states, then it is certainly possible in more permissive institutional environments. However, the two cases represent two American extremes in terms of investment in mental health as captured by expenditure figures: Massachusetts is one of the top spenders in the country, whereas Texas is among the lowest (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Statehealthfacts.org">Statehealthfacts.org</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711412911">2009</xref>). Also, Massachusetts is a relatively left-of-center state with strong unions, whereas Texas leans to the right and its unions are weak. This might suggest that mental health stakeholders would carry more weight in Massachusetts than Texas because of greater political attention, better organization, and superior funding. If this is the case then we should anticipate Massachusetts’ mental health care dynamics to more closely resemble larger policy domain dynamics than that of Texas.</p>
<p>As this is mainly an exercise in theory building, the study design does not include a larger number of case studies that would strengthen external validity. Nevertheless, in the discussion, reference is made to other case studies in mental health care and other domains, which lend additional support to this work’s conclusions.</p>
<p>The empirical foundation of this project is based on government and nongovernment document analysis, newspaper analysis, and interviews. The study is informed by about 50 semistructured interviews with politicians, bureaucrats, union officials, and private contractors involved in different aspects of privatization. These interviews constituted an invaluable tool for process tracing.</p>

<title>Mental Health Care Privatization: Deinstitutionalization, Managed Care, and Contracting Out</title>
<p>Mental health care for the seriously mentally ill was never wholly public in terms of either funding or delivery. Nevertheless, in the 1960s, in both states, and in most others, publicly funded delivery was by and large public and took place in large asylums.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0095399711412911">7</xref></sup> The two narratives below are intended to illustrate how and why publicly funded mental health care delivery has moved in the direction of private provision.</p>
<sec id="section5-0095399711412911">
<title>Massachusetts</title>
<p>In Massachusetts, privatization of mental health started in the 1970s, and by the mid-1990s, most services were already privatized. During the 1970s and 1980s, public mental hospitals were closed down and many of the patients were transferred to the care of private, nonprofit community providers. Opposition to privatization was, in general, weak during that period (C. Cohn, SEIU Local 509, personal communication, February 23, 2003). The relative weakness of the opposition could be attributed to two factors. First, although patients did move from public to private care, the number of public employees did not decrease significantly (P. Trilling, Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, personal communication, April 24, 2003). Hence, public sector unions were not overly concerned about job loss. Second, privatization was coupled with deinstitutionalization that appealed to both professionals and patients. The philosophy of the deinstitutionalization movement called for moving the mentally ill from mental health hospitals to community settings to reintegrate them into society. From a population of close to 23,000 patients at the end of the 1950s, the state inpatient mentally ill population decreased to around 6,000 by 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412911">Governor’s Special Commission, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711412911">Hogarty, 1996</xref>). Many of these patients were placed in community settings. As a result, the share of patients treated in the community grew and with it, the share of publicly funded patients treated by private sector organizations.</p>
<p>In 1991, Governor Weld, a republican, spurred by a major budget deficit, called for further closings of state mental health hospitals. Privatization appealed to Weld—a proponent of small government and an avowed opponent of public sector unions. A Governor Commission’s Report recommended closing four state hospitals and moving the patients to other—predominantly private—settings as a cost-containment measure. These closings were thought to be cost-effective because the hospitals were well below full capacity. Furthermore, by moving patients to small private establishments, the state could leverage new Medicaid funds from the federal government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711412911">Governor’s Special Commission, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the closing of state hospitals, the state placed a private, for-profit company in charge of running a system of managed care. Mental Health Management of America received the first government contract to run the system in 1992. With the closing of four state hospitals, the greater share of the state’s mental health budget was now allocated to the private sector. Nonprofits now treated most patients, and a for-profit companies administered case management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711412911">Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, 1998</xref>; P. Trilling, personal communication, 2003).</p>
<p>These initiatives were explicitly couched in the language of privatization, and, in contrast to the privatization initiatives of the previous decades, they entailed major cuts to the public sector workforce. Unsurprisingly, opposition to privatization was much greater. The largest mental health advocacy group, the Massachusetts Alliance for the Mentally Ill, opposed Weld’s policy, as did homeless advocates and some parent groups (S. Fendell, Massachusetts Mental Health Legal Advisors, personal communication, March 13, 2003). Unions, such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), were up in arms against privatization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0095399711412911">8</xref></sup> The Democrat-dominated legislature was critical of Weld’s privatization initiative, especially representatives from districts with mental health hospitals (E. Elias, Former Massachusetts mental health commissioner, personal communication, February 28, 2003). Some legislators feared the loss of public sector jobs in their district. Others were concerned that privatization would make services less accessible to patients and that the for-profit managing company would drain money from public coffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711412911">Bass, 1996</xref>; Fendell, personal communication, March 13, 2003).</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, the targets specified in the governor’s committee report were fully implemented in less than 4 years. The number of employees in the Department of Mental Health was more than halved, from 8,500 to 4,200; half of the state inpatients were moved out of state hospitals and four state hospitals were closed by 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711412911">Massachusetts Taxpayers’ Budget, 1995</xref>; P. Trilling, personal communication, April 24, 2003). The administration found it unnecessary to make any compromises. Weld was undeterred by the opposition to privatization of mental health care. As a leading mental health advocate pointed out, although not completely without influence, as a political constituency, the mental health community is too weak to block a determined executive (T. Fisher, Massachusetts Alliance for the Mentally Ill, personal communication, December 17, 2003).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0095399711412911">
<title>Texas</title>
<p>Mental health privatization in Texas is relatively modest, but this is misleading because recent legislation and policy initiatives have prepared the ground for a dramatic increase in the share of publicly funded private providers. Unlike Massachusetts, deinstitutionalization was not coupled with privatization in Texas. Mental health hospitals were indeed closed but mental health patients were subsequently treated by public, community-based centers, not private ones. During initial deinstitutionalization (mid-1970s to late 1980s), the private provider network, nonprofit and for profit, was near nonexistent, a fact that ruled out the private option for policy makers (G. McKimmey, Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, personal communication, January 27, 2004). Interest in mental health privatization grew in the 1990s. In 1999, the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation transferred the mental health care management of seven Dallas-area counties, in which more than three and a half million people live, to a private, for-profit Behavioral Health Organization (BHO). As a result, the share of private providers in the area increased from 10% to 40% in 4 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711412911">Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>What is likely to be the starting point of a major leap forward in the history of Texas mental health privatization happened during the 2003 legislative session. Republican legislators sponsored a bill that proposed a massive reorganization of human service departments and services and a reformulation of eligibility criteria (H.B. 2292). Many human service advocacy groups strongly opposed the proposed legislation for reasons that go beyond privatization (M. Gantt, Mental Health Association of Texas, personal communication, December 17, 2003; S. Skelton, Texas Council of Community Mental Health and Mental Retardation Centers, personal communication, February 2, 2004). The bill that passed included an amendment (Section 2.74) that designated public Mental Health and Mental Retardation Centers (MHMRCs) as providers of last resort. The public centers, which provided the majority of mental health services in the state, were obliged, in their capacity as local mental health authorities, initially, to seek private contractors to provide services. Only in cases in which an appropriate private provider failed to emerge were the local mental health authorities authorized to deliver the service themselves. The amendment was intended to create provider competition and to prevent conflict of interest problems that existed as long as MHMRCs operated as both mental health and mental retardation authority and as service providers. Most Democratic legislators opposed the bill (E. Shapleigh, Texas state senator, personal communication, February 4, 2004). In addition, numerous mental health stakeholders—among them the Mental Health Association of Texas, the Texas Council of MHMRCs, and the SEIU—opposed the bill’s privatization component (J. Branson, Texas SEIU, personal communication, January 16, 2004; M. Gantt, personal communication, December 17, 2003; S. Skelton, personal communication, February 2, 2004). Nevertheless, the bill passed.</p>
<p>The application of the “last resort” amendment to mental health care was bogged down for legal reasons for a couple of years: It was unclear whether the amendment should be applied to mental retardation alone or to mental health care as well. After the attorney general decided in favor of an all-encompassing interpretation, the implementation stage began. Although legislation was enacted with little consideration for opposition, the implementation process, which began with the establishment of a formal negotiated rulemaking process, was far more consensual. A diverse set of parties participated in negotiated rulemaking, among them actors that initially opposed “last resort” such as the Local Mental Health Authorities (previously MHMRCs). The end result was an interpretation of “last resort” that allows for considerable variation in the pace, form, and extent of implementation across different local authorities. Nevertheless, the general understanding of the implementation goal is that Local Mental Health Authorities would ultimately create a network of providers wherever feasible (T. Allen, Texas Department of State Health Services, personal communication, August 11, 2009). Furthermore, although contracting out was quite common before the new legislation, it focused primarily on support services. The new policy encourages contracting out for both support and routine services. Circa 2009, the implementation process is in its first round and Local Mental Health Authorities have drawn out local network development plans that indicate the extent of present and future contracting out. At least according to the plans drawn out, the share of contracted-out dollars out of total service expenditure could jump by 9% in 1 year: from 42% in fiscal year 2009 to 51% in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711412911">Texas Department of State Health Services, 2009</xref>). The implementation of “last resort” constitutes a major shift from public to private provision of community mental health services in Texas.</p>

<title>Low Hurdles and Substantial Reform</title>
<p>Privatization of mental health care delivery in Massachusetts and Texas is not identical, but there are a number of similarities that standout in sharp relief to what much of the literature anticipates regarding policy reform. In both states, governments have adopted policies that have pushed privatization dramatically forward or are in the process of doing so. In Massachusetts, in the early 1990s, the governor initiated the closing and consolidation of public mental health hospitals, their replacement with private community-based treatment, and the hiring of a BHO to administer case management. In Texas, the state contracted with a BHO for the management of mental health services in seven counties and is in the process of implementing a new policy that promotes the replacements of public with private provision in all other counties. What should be stressed is that these significant and dramatic reforms were approved despite considerable stakeholder opposition prior to reform. Interestingly, in contrast to what one might expect, it was politically right-leaning Texas that took the more consensual route to the implementation of privatization policy. Relatively left-leaning and unionized Massachusetts did little to engage or appease opposition to privatization. Massachusetts and Texas represent a more general phenomenon. The figures that do exist suggest that since the 1970s, the role of private providers and private BHOs has increased dramatically across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711412911">National Mental Health Information Center, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>From a HI perspective, this is a surprising result. The literature speaks of major obstacles to reform that imply at best slow-paced change. A comparison with cotemporary efforts at introducing privatization in the form of school vouchers in Texas, and similar past efforts in Massachusetts, helps throw the theoretical abnormality of the mental health care case into sharp relief.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0095399711412911">9</xref></sup> In Texas, efforts to establish publicly funded vouchers that could be used in private schools began in the 1990s and continued into the 2000s under a republican leadership that was supportive of the scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711412911">Fusarelli, 2003</xref>). Voucher supporters did their best to weaken opposition by proposing a very limited voucher pilot program that applied only to “at-risk” children (K. Grusendorf, Chair of Texas House Public Education Committee, personal communication, January 21, 2004). Nevertheless, the opposition prevailed despite the weakness of the Democratic Party and the even weaker position of unions in Texas, in general, and teacher unions, in particular. The Coalition for Public Schools, an umbrella organization, led the attack against voucher legislation. The Coalition was comprised of parent organizations, unions, civil right groups, and religious congregations with millions of members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711412911">The Coalition for Public Schools, 2004</xref>). In 2007, after a number of noncooperative republican legislators lost their seats due to the Coalition activity, the voucher campaign came to an ignoble end when the legislature passed an amendment that banned the use of state funding for vouchers by a huge margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711412911">Fikac, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, several efforts, during the 1970s and 1980s, to abolish a constitutional amendment that made vouchers for religious schools unconstitutional were stymied. Opposition was led by Citizens for Public Schools, an umbrella organization composed of many different stakeholder associations that proved to be very effective in mobilizing ballot voters against any amendment changes (M. Segal, Citizens for Public Schools, personal communication, October 19, 2004). In the larger policy domain—education—privatization of delivery was categorically defeated by large and politically powerful public program constituencies. These two cases provide a stark contrast to mental health care privatization: Voucher initiatives were introduced time and again only to be beaten back by public program constituencies comprised of both consumers and producers (and other interested parties).</p>
<p>Mental health care privatization in the two states does not conform to expectations of slow and gradual path-dependent reform—expectations that are especially pertinent to the veto-ridden American policy environment. Furthermore, despite the intense opposition to privatization, policy makers did not take the circuitous path indicated in studies of other domains. There was no use of obfuscation strategies, nor the utilization of institutional engineering (e.g., institutional layering) in support of slow-moving change. Politically, at least, policy makers had no need to expand any energy on these opposition-weakening techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0095399711412911">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The two cases of reform presented here are no more compatible with a PE framework than with a HI one. In PE, as expounded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711412911">Baumgartner and Jones (2009)</xref>, a dramatic shift in the policy equilibrium is preceded by a public crisis to which politicians respond. To the extent that a crisis initiated the two main reforms in both states then, it was fiscal and not specifically related to the mental health field. (Although there is always a sense of crisis in mental health!) Neither does the formula “no attention–no reform” work in these cases. Although it is true that the general public shows little interest in mental health care, this did not entail lack of political interest. It is famously difficult to discern motivation, but privatization in both states was initiated by republicans (i.e., Governor Weld in Massachusetts and Representative Heflin in Texas) that shared a belief in the virtues of the private sector and the market. Ideology, probably more than narrow political interest, can explain the movement down the road of reform in a field where the potential political gains (or losses) are small.</p>
<p>One can question the validity of conclusions drawn from two American cases, which belong to a single policy domain. Obviously, mental health privatization does not happen everywhere in the same way and to the same extent. However, external validity can be bolstered by a cursory examination of other cases. England represents a very different political system than that that of the American states: unitary with a single veto point. Nevertheless, privatization dynamics in mental health care are strikingly similar to the American states. In contrast to the well-known difficulty of reforming general health care in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711412911">Bevan &amp; Robinson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711412911">Hacker, 2004b</xref>), privatization in mental health care has been staggering. The National Health Service and Community Care Act of 1990 mandated that 85% of the transitional grants to local authorities would have to be spent on private sector provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711412911">Lewis &amp; Glennerster, 1996</xref>). Although in the mid-1980s there were nine public psychiatric beds for every private one, by 2000 there were considerably more private beds than public beds in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711412911">House of Commons, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>External validity is strengthened to an even greater degree by testing against a different class of cases than by adding additional cases from the same domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711412911">Levi-Faur, 2006</xref>). If we examine child welfare services, we find a policy domain that was traditionally dominated by public delivery and experienced rapid privatization in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711412911">Greene, 1996</xref>) despite controversy over whether trust in the private sector was justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711412911">Rosenthal, 2000</xref>). In Texas, for example, privatization of foster care had expanded by an impressive 34% between 1999 and 2003 with an explicit goal of gradually eliminating public foster care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711412911">Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, 2004</xref>). As is true of mental health care, many stakeholders strongly oppose child welfare privatization, but it proceeds nonetheless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711412911">MacLaggan, 2009</xref>). Opposition in a small domain is not powerful enough to turn the tide of privatization.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>To conclude, in small domains, much of what we know about reform—either from HI or PE—does not apply. Policy makers do not have free rein, but institutional and public opinion constraints are much lighter than in large domains, and so, if reform is chosen, it could go forward at a faster pace, in a direct fashion, and might be ultimately more extensive. This hitherto overlooked difference in policy dynamics between large and small policy domains should inform future analysis of policy evolution: especially analysis dedicated to small domains.</p>
<p>This study opens avenues for future work. Obviously, there is need for more studies that evaluate the arguments presented here that were developed deductively and are supported by the experience of one type of program. Above all, the argument regarding the relationship between policy domain size/political efficacy and reform dynamics should be tested against additional cases. In addition, future work should address midrange cases—in terms of domain size—to see if reform characteristics correspondingly fall somewhere in between the extremes described in this article.</p>
<p>Finally, the proposed relationship between domain size and political efficacy hints at what is possibly an important implication of administrative reorganization. As mentioned above, program constituencies (or policy networks) usually form around, and depend on, distinct government organizations. The unintended consequence of government reorganizations in which small departments are consolidated into larger ones (e.g., mental health care integrated with general health care) could be a gradual consolidation (or breakup in opposite cases of administrative fragmentation) of program constituencies. This could lead over time to a change in program constituency political power, which in turn is likely to alter reform dynamics and outcomes.</p>

<p>Two other important theories, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711412911">Kingdon’s (1984)</xref> Multiple Streams (MS) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711412911">Jenkin-Smith and Sabatier’s (1994)</xref> Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) view “dramatic” policy change, much like historical institutionalism (HI), as primarily driven by exogenous factors. Although both theories have much to commend them, they are not discussed in any length here because they do not offer straightforward predictions and insights in the context of this study. In MS, change occurs when the three streams (problem, policy, and politics) converge, and this development, in turn, depends on the impact of underspecified exogenous factors operating within the political stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711412911">Real-Dato, 2009</xref>). This is a major theoretical disadvantage because policy evolution is primarily shaped by political dynamics in the case studies presented here. Although the ACF does a better job than MS at specifying what type of exogenous factors might lead to dramatic change (changes in socioeconomic conditions, public opinion, government coalitions, or the impact of other policy subsystems), under what conditions and how exactly a specific factor would exert its influence is left largely unaddressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711412911">Kim &amp; Roh, 2008</xref>). In addition, unlike HI, the main source of policy stability in ACF is the dominance of an advocacy coalition that is based on shared core beliefs. As several commentators have argued, although beliefs are important, an assumption that shared beliefs underpin most coalitions, and therefore stability, vastly understates the importance of institutional dynamics and political interests as determinants of stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711412911">Kim &amp; Roh, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Admittedly, a program constituency’s motivation to fight privatization of delivery appears less certain than its motivation to fight full privatization. Although budget cuts are a net negative, delivery privatization could actually make a service more effective. However, public program constituencies are comprised of both producers and consumers and producers tend to have a strong stake in preventing privatization of delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399711412911">Belfield, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711412911">Wated, Sanchez, &amp; Gomez, 2008</xref>). Producer, in turn, could use their closeness to clients to turn consumer opinion against reform. Indeed, there is a growing emphasis on public campaigns as part of union activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711412911">Schiavone, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>A closely related explanation for why small domains might be less subject to reform than large ones is that savings from cost-containment-intended reforms would be significantly smaller in these domains because of their small budgets. Policy makers would prefer, according to this rationale, to target the large programs where the cost-saving potential is highest. However, a survey of agency heads, which asked about privatization motivation, produced results that are incompatible with such a prediction. For example, more than 42% of mental health agency heads mentioned cost containment as a major motivation compared with only 22% in education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711412911">Chi &amp; Jasper, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>This study addresses privatization of delivery in welfare state type services (education included) and not municipal services (e.g., street cleaning). The reason is that several essential differences between social and municipal domains are likely to produce very different reform dynamics. Among these differences, one should mention the intensity of individual consumer interest (usually considerably higher in welfare state services) and the ability to individualize service (zero in pure public goods, a category that includes most municipal services).</p>

<p>The difference between large and small programs is undoubtedly context sensitive. For example, the fact that a program constituency is highly concentrated might offset its small size, but this depends on political system structure. Geographical concentration is far more important in district-based electoral systems than in systems in which the entire country is a single electoral zone.</p>
