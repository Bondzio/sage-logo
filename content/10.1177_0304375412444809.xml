<abstract>
<p>Contemporary research on the international relations of Southeast Asia has neglected the latent possibilities of reading non-western indigenous forms of international relations as a contribution to worldwide debates on the nature of international politics. Drawing on one precolonial account of Southeast Asian political practices in the Malay Archipelago, the <italic>Sejarah Melayu</italic>, this article proposes that Southeast Asians have previously philosophized about “intersocietal relations” in ways that privilege noble prowess, knowledge quests, and hierarchical justice through the interdependence of trade and culture within the region, and with India, China, and the Arab world. These features can still speak to contemporary relations between peoples rather than states and to security issues within borderless regions.</p>

<body>
<p>Historians and philosophers often claim that the records of the ancient past are as much a repository of civilization as are the writings of the present. As such, myth history can be interpreted in ways that offer insights into contemporary international relations. Inspired by this sense of historical–sociological continuity, this article aims to read one prominent Malay politicohistorical text, the <italic>Sejarah Melayu</italic>, as an indigenous Southeast Asian contribution to theories of international relations.</p>
<p>This text is especially interesting in that it engages with relations between peoples without reference to conventional nation-state boundaries and offers a way of understanding security within borderless regions. It challenges the pervasive argument that most indigenous voices tend to reproduce Western frames of international theorising.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412444809">1</xref>
</sup> It also challenges the view expressed by many “Asia specialists” that Southeast Asia is unique and cannot be understood within the supposedly universal categories of “Western theory”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0304375412444809">2</xref>
</sup> (a view that is often made by peoples who nevertheless embrace forms of modernization imported from the West). In this way, it responds to difficulties that arise when attempts to analyze post-1945 international relations in Southeast Asia try to account for the presence of culturally non-Western traits in war, economics, and diplomacy among the nascent states.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412444809">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the specific Malay and Southeast Asian cultural baggage of the <italic>Sejarah Melayu</italic>, I will argue that the geopolitical and geodemographic settings of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> can shed light on how heterogeneous peoples in an increasingly postinternational world might interact among themselves hierarchically. James Rosenau’s well-known conceptualization of a postinternational world order has already provided us with elementary observations about a growing rivalry between sovereignty-bound and sovereignty-free actors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412444809">4</xref>
</sup> Rosenau suggests that the latter, encompassing nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), terrorist entities, and individuals, are increasingly empowered to push their agendas against sovereign interests because of capability revolutions in electronic communication and education. Internet-based political activism is certainly one manifestation of this phenomenon, and so are the issues of human security generated by the accessibility of transnational travel. Encounters at regional and international forums between states and nonstate representatives have likewise taken an increasingly caustic turn. The intensity of transnational civil society protests signaled by the “Battle of Seattle” in 1999 through to the populist anger at the World Social Forum associated with the NGOs that founded the roundtable at the “alternative” site of Porto Alegre in Brazil suggests escalating contestations of normative world order. Sovereign states have lost some of their legitimacy as monopolies of knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p>The world of the <italic>Sejarah </italic>does not address sovereignty per se. Instead, the problems of cross-border insecurity are explained as a consequence of maladjusted relations between leaders and populations, and other issues of governance. The polities of the <italic>Sejarah </italic>cannot be read retrospectively as constituting a security community in the sense popularized by Karl Deutsch, Emmanuel Adler, and Richard Barnett, but they do regard the rendering of justice as sufficiently important to justify mediation and demonstrations of superior moral prowess, even if some degree of selective violence has to be employed as a cautionary precedent. In this way, the interpersonal application of private personal morality is extended to intersocietal relations predicated upon porous geography. Although the perspectives of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> cannot be considered fully amenable to liberal concepts, they offer an alternative to the avoidance of public attributions of blame for the exodus of refugees or economic weaknesses arising from poor governance of domestic arenas. Ongoing debates about the implementation of a “responsibility to protect” suggest the need for a richer and less culture-bound way of addressing the moral dimensions of governing peoples in a collectively responsible fashion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412444809">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To read indigenous traditional political and literary texts like the <italic>Sejarah </italic>may contribute to the recent interest in “post-Western critical international relations theory.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412444809">6</xref>
</sup> This does not imply any simple denigration of the Atlanticist origins of modern international relations theory, but it does affirm the need to explore encounters with culturally filtered international practices in a much richer manner. Western approaches to some kind of more humane visions of international relations could greatly benefit from alternative visions of how non-western peoples have ordered their relations in spite of the recurring condition of war and rival claims to political superiority. In fact, superiority could be legitimized between peoples and governmental leaders in a civilized intercultural setting of permeable borders through demonstrations of normative nobility. Thus David Kang has suggested that an East Asian international order could well be structured hierarchically, though he did not sketch the operational aspects of such an order beyond a critique of neo-realist interpretations of East Asian international order.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412444809">7</xref>
</sup> Reading the <italic>Sejarah</italic> will go some way toward addressing this aspect of inquiry into hierarchical relations.</p>
<p>The argument will proceed as follows. First, the selection of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> will be justified as a representative, indigenous historical and cultural text. In the process, I will provide a brief sketch of the precolonial Malay political context. I will then offer a thematic textual analysis of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, suggesting that the common themes that arise from the <italic>Sejarah</italic> can be clustered around the two concepts of “prowess and prestige.” In the conclusion, I will argue that the precolonial Malay world provides us with a qualified model of intersocietal political relations as an ideational alternative to the modern international system of sovereignty-bound states.</p>
<sec id="section1-0304375412444809">
<title>The Context of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>
</title>
<p>There is a clear consensus in most of the secondary literature commenting on the text to be examined here that the ancient Malay world (roughly, from the twelfth to seventeenth centuries) was a representative swathe of the contemporary Southeast Asian region of ten states along with their attendant transnational nation-building problems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412444809">8</xref>
</sup> This is roughly analogous to a localized version of a fledgling “world international society,” to use Hedley Bull’s term,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412444809">9</xref>
</sup> through which one can observe political relations on a “laboratory scale” for extrapolation toward broader and more complex forms of international relations theory. As a historical category, the Malay world stretched from the island of Penang and the present day southern Thai province of Patani in its northwestern extremity to large parts of Kalimantan, the Moluccas and Mindanao in the southeast. It also encompassed the entire Malay peninsula, the island of Sumatra, and Java.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412444809">10</xref>
</sup> Both archaeological artifacts, and references in the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, indicate that Malay political entities interacted with kingdoms in South Asia (the lands of Kalinga), Arabia, Siam, China and, from the late fifteenth century, the Portuguese, Dutch, and English. It was characteristic of the period that references to these entities<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412444809">11</xref>
</sup> in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> identified them as the collective “other” conducting intercourse with the Malay polities on a broad continuum ranging from voluntary assimilation, to friendship and to extreme hostility. Furthermore, the Malay world was constructed with a unique blend of Hindu–Buddhist cultural styles, layered more recently with thick Islamic associations in matters of piety, education, and diplomacy.</p>
<p>This feature of culturally synthesized continuity, coupled with the absence of specific date references in the text, may even allow the contemporary reader to project the characteristics of the Malay world backward into the synchronized time of the Greco-Roman empires. Indeed, the <italic>Sejarah</italic> makes passing references to Alexander the Great and the land of Macedonia. These intercultural contacts may be relevant to contemporary research, given the frequency of religious and cultural frictions in an increasingly borderless world.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many scholars have cautioned that claims of Malay primordial identity cannot be taken at face value since historical investigation reveals an entrenched pattern of identity formation through incremental syncretization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412444809">12</xref>
</sup> This pattern of cultural synthesis is also “typically Southeast Asian” in its comparability to the political and social processes in the rest of the region. Likewise, Indochina experienced waves of Indianization and Sinicization from its demographically larger Asian neighbors, and exhibited these syntheses in sculpture, language, warfare, monarchic form, and religious worship. The Malay world can be regarded as a political sphere for study insofar as it captured a time-and-space-specific synthesis of multidimensional cultural influences from both the local and abroad. Indeed, it has been widely pointed out that the <italic>Sejarah</italic> inscribes the foundational possibility of fruitfully identifying what it is to be <italic>Melayu</italic> (i.e., Malay).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412444809">13</xref>
</sup> This is attributable to the fact that Malay political centers between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries believed that their political legitimacy was grounded in legendary texts put together either by their predecessors or by their own royal line. A venerated scholar of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> had observed that the text that is available for modern readers is “primarily a book of tales and anecdotes of the past and not so much a historical work, although it contains a wealth of historical material.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412444809">14</xref>
</sup> Unsurprisingly, the identity of their original authors remains a mystery. The <italic>Sejarah</italic> will come across as a blend of the hagiographic<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412444809">15</xref>
</sup> and a subjective rendering of the past, but this is far from being a fatal flaw in its value to modern scholars. The text’s color and tone amount to an artifact that captures an existing mentality as much as historians try to piece together the actual past by reading an assortment of primary documents in spite of their respective “veracities.” It has been estimated that some thirty versions, including fragmentary ones, exist. This article will mostly employ the authoritative scholarly translation done by C. C. Brown<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412444809">16</xref>
</sup> in the twentieth century, supplemented selectively by the more dated nineteenth-century translation by John Leyden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412444809">17</xref>
</sup> Nonetheless, Leyden’s translation enjoys the status of being the pioneering translation into English made in 1821, two years following the British acquisition of what would become their most-prized and most-centrally located possession in the Malay world at the time—the island of Singapore.</p>
<p>One might then also adopt the same care toward objectifying the use of “indigenous” texts that have been approved for translation by the existing colonial authorities. Indeed, translations of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> have been encouraged by the British colonial power at the time with the purpose of burnishing their respect for carrying the “civilizing” burden on their subjects’ behalf in British Malaya. Following the scholarship of Edward Said and Walter Benjamin, any number of critics might label this enterprise an exercise of power through “orientalization.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412444809">18</xref>
</sup> But the purpose for which they are read here begs to differ greatly. The fact that the British saw normative value in translating indigenous texts at all signals that they clearly exhibited a reasonable level of curiosity about the ancient, precolonial world of their subjects—the <italic>Melayu</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412444809">19</xref>
</sup> Indeed, there should not be any ideological opprobrium attached to treating the <italic>Sejarah</italic> as synonymously precolonial and indigenous vis-à-vis the impact of British colonialism itself. Following the approach of the Cambridge School of philosophical contextualists, this article believes that while texts are to some degree context-bound, and should be duly acknowledged as such, they are not necessarily irrelevant texts for <italic>our</italic> age if one treats authorial intentions in terms of the need to initiate conversations with future generations with a view toward imparting useful lessons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412444809">20</xref>
</sup> Indeed, as it will be shown in the following pages, the world of cross-border interactions among ancient Malay polities, and between them and the “other” kingdoms, appears very different from the contemporary secular rationality of western approaches to the international. This is an important reason why one ought to study it as an intellectual contribution to “post-Western critical international theory.” Chiefly, prowess and prestige motivated interactions much more than notions of fixed territoriality, equality of states and Weberian bureaucratic strictures.</p>

<title>The <italic>Sejarah Melayu—</italic> Intersocietal Relations as Exercises in Noble Prowess, Quests for Knowledge and Justice</title>
<p>As a set of legitimating histories blending liberal doses of fiction with fact, the <italic>Sejarah</italic> is remarkable for disregarding any sense of generating a neat chronology. The unnamed author avers that he had encountered the inspirational “command” for composing the annals while in attendance at a Sultan’s court. Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah, “shadow of God upon earth,” addressed his audience with a wish for leaving something to posterity: “It is my wish that the Treasury [i.e. his body of ministers] shall make a chronicle setting forth the genealogy of the Malay Rajas and the ceremonial of their courts, for the information of my descendants who come after me, that they may be conversant with the history and derive profit therefrom.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412444809">21</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, the unnamed author invokes his chronicle’s normative authority through overt Islamic references: “Let not him who reads it concern himself with it to the exclusion of all else: for thus saith the prophet (may God bless him and give him peace) <italic>tafakkaru fi ala’i ‘Lhahi wa la tafakkaru fi dzati ‘Lhahi</italic> that is to say, concern thyself with the Majesty of God and trouble not thy mind over the Essence of God.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412444809">22</xref>
</sup> Clearly, this sets out a claim to a distinctive form of local pride through its portrayal of dignified ancestry as well as its cautionary tales. For the purposes of the task at hand, the author will not perform a consecutively paginated reading of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, but instead highlight some representative threads to the fractured chronology and multiple protagonists of the text. These themes are relations of noble prowess; relations of knowledge quests; and relations of justice.</p>
<sec id="section3-0304375412444809">
<title>Relations of Noble Prowess</title>
<p>The tales in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> often center on a reigning monarch’s pursuit of recognition of supremacy by fellow rajas (kings), subordinates at court, champions (strong men, or warriors) and commoners, in that order. Conversely, aspirations by commoners, and even slaves, to ascend the political hierarchy required demonstrations of extraordinary bravery. Alternatively, one could earn the Raja’s conferment of elevated status by acquiring supernatural powers through dealings with spirits in the wild. In these ways, the limits of the exercise of the equivalent of “sovereignty” are hardly exclusively territorial; they are sustained through trials of merit.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 opens with the story of a Raja Iskandar [Alexander] of Macedonia whose desire to see the rising of the sun led him and his armies to arrive at the borders of the kingdom of India (Kalinga). Sensing a threat, the Raja Kida Hindi of India mounted a preemptive attack on Raja Iskandar’s forces. The former lost the battle and was captured. Instead of an exacting surrender, Iskandar ordered Raja Kida Hindi to embrace “the True Faith . . . the religion of Abraham, the Chosen Friend of God”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412444809">23</xref>
</sup> and allowed him to keep his kingdom. It came to be known that Raja Kida Hindi had a beautiful daughter “whose beauty was such that she had no peer at that time: brilliant as the light of the sun was the light of her countenance, and she was endowed moreover with great wisdom and understanding.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412444809">24</xref>
</sup> As a sign of his full conversion to friendship with his erstwhile enemy, his daughter was voluntarily offered in marriage to Raja Iskandar. According to the narrative, Raja Iskandar’s acceptance of the bride was preceded by the advice of both Raja Kida Hindi’s chief minister and Iskandar’s confidant Nabi Khidlir.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412444809">25</xref>
</sup> The postnuptial details need not concern us here, but the point about noble prowess is served through Raja Iskandar’s military victory, his conversion of his captive, and the addition of beauty and intelligence to his realm through marriage. Several generations later, it fell to one of Raja Iskandar’s many great grandsons, the Raja Chulan, to reprise his military glory in several spectacular wars including one with Siam. Furthermore, Raja Chulan burnished his illustrious ancestor’s reputation for brave adventures by descending to the bottom of the sea to discover an inhabited kingdom called Dika where he made the pacific acquaintance of a Raja Aftabu’l-Ardl. The latter was sufficiently impressed by the knowledge carried by his visitor from the upper world that he likewise offered his beautiful daughter in marriage to Raja Chulan.</p>
<p>Subsequent tales lead off from the royal descendants of Raja Iskandar and Raja Chulan. One such sighting of these descendants by peasant widows resident at the foot of the mountain Si-Guntang Mahameru in the land of Palembang, occasions a magical transfiguration of the rice fields into grains of gold, leaves of silver, and stalks of gold alloy. This is emblematic of the glory of the Iskandar-Chulan royal line. Upon learning of the spectacle and its confirmation by the accounts of the two widows, who subsequently married a few of the handsome descendants of Iskandar-Chulan, rulers from every part of Palembang came to pay respects to them. Some of the awestruck populations proclaimed these handsome descendants of Iskandar-Chulan their rajas in an automatic gesture of homage to their ancestry. Since the youngest of the three rajas (now given the title, Sri Tri Buana) from the mountain desired marriage, the tribute-bearing local rajas all paraded their daughters before him. Sri Tri Buana dated, and married, up to thirty-nine eligible ladies, one after the other, but each lady was in turn “abandoned” by Sri Tri Buana after a night of marital bliss simply because every one of them was stricken with chloasma<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412444809">26</xref>
</sup> the morning after. The conventional wisdom had it that each of these women was demonstrably unworthy of the legendary descendant of Iskandar-Chulan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412444809">27</xref>
</sup> Ultimately, the former Raja of Palembang, who had abdicated his throne for Sri Tri Buana out of respect, had a worthy daughter whom the latter fancied. The former Raja of Palembang feared the fate that would befall his daughter should the cosmological match prove negative. Therefore, he proposed that the union between his royal household with that of Iskandar-Chulan-Sri Tri Buana be made conditional upon the voluntary subordination of the present and future generations of the Palembang royal family to Sri Tri Buana. This came with the corollary that should the Palembang royalty commit misdeeds, they should not be shamed unless their crimes were of the magnitude mandating death sentences under Islamic law. In return, Sri Tri Buana wanted the Palembang royalty to pledge eternal obedience to him and his descendants; and “that your descendants shall never for [the] rest of time be disloyal to my descendants, even if my descendants oppress them and behave evilly.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412444809">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Both sides agreed and swore their agreement under the oath of divine retribution should either party act in violation of it. Following upon this tale, the author of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> inserts this description of governance of honor that applies on both intra- and intersocietal levels:<disp-quote>
<p>And that is why it has been granted by Almighty God to Malay rulers that they shall never put their subjects to shame, and that those subjects however gravely they offend shall never be bound or hanged or disgraced with evil words. If any ruler puts a single one of his subjects to shame, that shall be a sign that his kingdom will be destroyed by Almighty God. Similarly it has been granted by Almighty God to Malay subjects that they shall never be disloyal or treacherous to their rulers, even if their rulers behave evilly or inflict injustice upon them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412444809">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Honor, its profound levels of reciprocity, and its associated demonstration of prowess consistently characterize other accounts in the rest of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>. It is helpful to highlight three additional stories to substantiate more fully the relations of honor. First, there is in chapter 6 the story of a man named Badang, the slave made good. Badang was frequently dispatched by his master to clear the nearby jungle. While doing so, he would seize the opportunity to lay overnight fish traps in the river which ran through the jungle. On several successive mornings, Badang discovered that his catch had been eaten, leaving only evidence of bones and scales. Badang therefore set himself on a night watch to snare the culprit. It was pure serendipity that he discovered a red-eyed specter stealing his catch for food. Badang fortified his courage and seized the specter with the intention of killing it. The specter “pleaded” for its life promising to grant Badang a special gift in return. Badang cleverly asked for “power and strength in order that I may have strength for my master’s work” having reasoned aloud that neither riches nor the gift of invisibility would do him any good. The specter granted him superhuman strength on the condition that Badang consumed the specter’s vomit! Badang complied and as a result, manifested immediately the strength to uproot trees “with one hand.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412444809">30</xref>
</sup> Easily, he cleared the whole jungle till it resembled a plain. From afar, his master was astonished at the sight and granted Badang his freedom after hearing his explanation. The Raja of Singapura,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412444809">31</xref>
</sup> Sri Rana Wikerma, received news of this man’s feat and straightaway invited him into his kingdom to assume the prestigious position of a war chief. At his new superior’s behest, Badang performed incredible feats to gather exquisite foods from across the seas for his Raja’s satisfaction. On one such mission, Badang single-handedly launched a heavier version of the oar-powered vessel—called the prow—where many ordinary men failed in strength. Consequently, Sri Rana Wikerma decorated Badang with the title of Champion.</p>
<p>The Raja of the land of Kalinga consequently received news of Badang’s prowess and desired to test his own champion against him. The Kalinga champion, together with his overlord, had an intersocietal reputation to protect too. The Raja of Singapura welcomed the contest and the Raja of Kalinga’s wager of seven ships filled with stores and ordered Champion Badang into the competition. In wrestling, both men seemed unable to prove decisive against the other, with Badang demonstrating minor advantages. Finally, the Kalinga champion suggested to Badang that they each try to lift a large stone lying in front of the hall belonging to the Raja of Singapura. In this final tryst, Badang again bested his rival from Kalinga by not only lifting the stone clear off the ground but also throwing it into the mouth of a nearby river. The Kalinga champion surrendered the seven ships and “departed for his own country grieving under the disgrace of the defeat that Badang had inflicted upon him.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0304375412444809">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The Raja of Perlak had another Champion named Benděrang whose reputation was at risk from the reports of the Raja of Singapura’s champion. Benděrang likewise desired that his overlord dispatch him to a trial of strength with Champion Badang in Singapura. The wager this time was a warehouse worth of goods. The Raja of Singapura had every confidence in Champion Badang and warmly welcomed the delegation from Perlak. When summoned by his overlord to ready himself for the impending contest, Badang conveyed his awareness of Benděrang’s indomitable reputation and humbly suggested that his rival be invited to an evening of entertainment whereupon Badang would discreetly test his strength against Benděrang. Badang expressed his worry that the Raja of Singapura would be shamed if he lost against the challenger from Perlak. Indeed, while the diplomatic festivities consumed everyone’s attention, Benděrang secretly attempted a knee press against Badang, who managed to extricate himself quickly. When Badang reciprocated the same test against his rival, Benděrang failed to raise his knee. Afterward, Badang quietly informed his raja that he was ready for a successful challenge. Benděrang, in turn, reported to his chief of delegation that his rival was superior and was likely to win. The Perlak ambassador found a perfect excuse the next morning to avoid a loss of face for his king. He said to the Raja of Singapura, “it would be better not, your Highness: the defeat of either might mean pitting your Highness against your Highness’ younger brother.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412444809">33</xref>
</sup> To this, the Raja of Singapura smiled and assented. Honor in saving the face of a kindred Malay prince was more important than drawing rivalry into open contest. The case with Kalinga was apparently quite different where the loss of face for the nonrelated other was acceptable to the victor. Nevertheless, one might argue that the presence of a betting stake saved some official face for the Raja of Kalinga.</p>
<p>In the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, the Melaka sultanate’s relations with both Siam and China appear to be also subject to the exchange of honor. Siam had a long history of conflict prone relations with Melaka arising out of envy and imperial ambition. Nonetheless, Siam never succeeded once in conquering Melaka. During the reign of Sultan Muzaffar Shah, he attempted to offer an overture to the Raja of Siam, Bubunnya. In doing so, the Sultan ordered his ministers to compose a letter to accompany a delegation of royal appointees to be dispatched to the court of Siam. Sultan Muzaffar directed that “it must neither be a letter of obeisance nor one of greetings nor one of friendship.” After some procrastination over the unenviable task, the Sultan’s chief minister, the Bendahara, composed the following: “A struggle between us can only result in heavy loss of life; and although in such a struggle we have the greatest respect for the might of the Lord Bubunnya, yet because of our confidence in his gracious consideration we send to him our envoys Tun Telanai and Mentri Jana Putra . . ..”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412444809">34</xref>
</sup> The Raja of Siam was reported to be gratified by this tone of diplomacy, but nevertheless ventured to ask the delegation from Melaka to explain why their kingdom could not be conquered by the Siamese. The delegation chief, Tun Telanai, proceeded to summon a display of martial art from a member of his entourage. The highlight of this display lay in the demonstration by an old warrior suffering from “elephantiasis in both legs” of throwing a spear into the air and receiving its landing on his back, whereupon the spear was completely deflected without even wounding the warrior.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412444809">35</xref>
</sup> Feeling only partially satisfied, Lord Bubunnya invited the Melaka delegation to join his military campaign against a country in the vicinity of Siam. He deliberately arrayed them against the strongest of the enemy forces, facing west. Tun Telanai consulted with his Mentri and both decided to approach the Lord Bubunnya with a counterproposal for a different deployment, explaining that Islamic devotion required his men to face west, therefore making it inconvenient to fight in this position. Lord Bubunnya assented graciously and allowed the men from Melaka to attack facing east.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412444809">36</xref>
</sup> Nonetheless, the Melaka men acquitted themselves gallantly in the eyes of the Raja of Siam by initiating the offensive, following which the battle was ultimately won by their combined forces. The Melaka delegation was granted rich rewards, and their leader Tun Telanai, a wife of Siamese extraction. Upon their return to Melaka, Sultan Muzaffar Shah was delighted at the results. According to the John Leyden translation of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, the Sultan declared “now my heart is at rest, for my enemy is converted into my friend.”<sup>

</p>
<p>In the case of China, it was written that reports of the greatness of Melaka inspired the Raja of China to dispatch a delegation accompanied by a ship full of needles as a gift to Sultan Mansur Shah. The accompanying letter from the Chinese Emperor was recorded in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> as such:<disp-quote>
<p>This letter from His Majesty the Raja of Heaven [sic] is sent to the Raja of Malaka [Melaka]. We hear that the Raja of Malaka is a great raja and we desire accordingly to be on terms of amity with the Raja of Malaka. Of a truth there are no rajas in this world greater than ourselves, and there is no one who knoweth the number of our subjects. We have asked for one needle from each house in our realm and those are the needles with which the ship we send to Malaka is laden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412444809">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>Clearly, there was a tone of inequality to this letter with evident self-serving references by the Chinese emperor to his mandate from heaven. But the subsequent narrative of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> related the tale of an embassy from Melaka being received with suitable pomp and ceremony at the Chinese court. There was also a revelation that upon recognizing that Sultan Mansur Shah had supervised a reciprocal gift of sago grains as numerous as the subjects of Melaka, the Raja of China exclaimed that the Raja of Melaka must obviously not be inferior since he controlled a large population as well. The <italic>Sejarah</italic> records an exchange of gastronomic practices and other personal gifts between the Chinese court and the officials from Melaka. The Melaka officials were reported to have been in awe of the pomp and pageantry at the Chinese court. Before the Melaka delegation departed, the Raja of China offered the hand of his daughter Princess Hang Liu to Sultan Mansur Shah. Along with the Princess, the Raja of China provided an escort of 500 youths of noble birth led by a senior ranking official, and these were accompanied by a large Chinese fleet that conveyed the Melaka delegation home. This fleet arrived in Melaka to a warm welcome by Sultan Mansur Shah. Impressed by the beauty of Princess Hang Liu, Sultan Mansur Shah directed that she should convert to Islam before he would marry her. As a favor toward the rest of the Chinese delegation, the Sultan reserved a hill for their exclusive residence. This was Bukit China, or Chinese hill. Sultan Mansur also gifted the highest ranking official of the Chinese delegation with “robes of honour.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412444809">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the question of equality of honor continued to bedevil the relationship between Melaka and China. Having married Princess Hang Liu, the time came for Sultan Mansur Shah to dispatch a mission of “‘obeisance’ to the Raja of China.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412444809">40</xref>
</sup> Two high officials from the Sultan’s court, Tun Telanai and Mentri Jana Putra [respectively a Lord and a Minister equivalent], were sent on the voyage to China to handle this delicate issue. As the <italic>Sejarah</italic> records it, a storm intervened during the voyage forcing the two Melaka envoys to shelter momentarily within the friendly Malay kingdom of Brunai (presently, Brunei). The Raja of Brunai, who was a son of the Melaka Sultan queried the envoys as to how the Raja of China was to be greeted in the official letter. The following exchange is worth quoting as exemplifying the delicacy of relations between noble prowess:<disp-quote>
<p>And Tun Telanai replied, “The servant, Raja of Malaka’s [Melaka’s] obeisance to His Majesty the Raja of China.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said the Raja of Brunai, “so the Raja of Malaka sends obeisance to the Raja of China?”</p>
<p>And Mentri Jana Putra answered, “Not so, your Highness. The meaning of the word <italic>sahaya</italic> in Malay is ‘servant’, and the senders of obeisance are we, the servants of the Raja of Malaka, not your Highness’ father, the Raja of Malaka himself!”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0304375412444809">41</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The Raja of Brunai fell silent upon hearing this. This awkward conversation was recorded without resolution in the above passage in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> but it reached an enigmatic conclusion afterward.</p>
<p>When the letter conveying “obeisance” from Melaka to China arrived and was read out to the delight of the Raja of China, the latter developed chloasma over his whole body. None of the Chinese emperor’s doctors could diagnose nor cure their master’s malady. It was then that “an aged doctor” suggested the following explanation: “Your Highness, the cause is that the Raja of Malaka sent ‘obeisance’. That, your Highness, is a judgement upon you. Your Highness must drink water used by the Raja of Malaka for washing his feet and you must bathe in that water, or this sickness that afflicts your Highness will not be cured.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0304375412444809">42</xref>
</sup> The Chinese emperor reportedly performed the necessary ritual and was cured. Interestingly, the <italic>Sejarah</italic> records that Sultan Mansur Shah had received a slightly humbler letter from the Raja of China worded as follows: “This letter comes from the royal father to his royal son. If the royal son wishes to do his royal father a great service, his royal father would ask as a favour for water that has been used for washing the feet of Sultan Mansur Shah.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0304375412444809">43</xref>
</sup> Consequently, the Chinese emperor vowed that for posterity there was to be no more decorum for unequal salutations between the monarchs of Melaka and China.</p>
<p>These tales suggest a pattern to the relations of noble prowess, subsuming many elementary notions of relations of honor. The object is not abstract <italic>raison d’etat </italic>but the prestige of nobility and its cultural extensions. To live well, and govern well, is to treat one’s relations, whether from the Malay world or outside it, with equanimity of respect and enlightenment toward living the truth of one’s innate good character and strength. An enemy conquered in war can be imbued with proper Islamic piety. Heroism in war, exploration, and bravado accumulate their reservoir of positive reputation. Taken together, these constitute a righteous royal line with near supernatural powers. Even in relations with non-Malay kingdoms in Siam and China, the Malay representations of relations of noble prowess are portrayed as helpful socializing examples for the Other. The story of the Chinese emperor’s skin disease is handled as a lesson in substantive equality of nobility in spite of the inequalities retained in formal speech. At the other end of the social spectrum, a slave made good also becomes a credit to the kingdom recognizing his talents, enhancing overall the honor of kingship. Curiously, Islam is inconsistently invoked in the <italic>Sejarah</italic>’s narratives, given the polytheistic supernatural invocations in the various stories. Nonetheless, it exists on the level of being an integral component of the universal culture under which all Malay rajas exist in relation to their subordinates. What this informs the student of International Relations is that when peoples relate within a borderless <italic>milieu</italic>, sociological concepts of hierarchy take precedence in organizing human interaction for better, or for worse. Inevitably, most of these instances of relations of noble prowess throughout this premodern world simultaneously feature what <italic>our</italic> modern consciences would call a “dark side.” The weak are conveniently discarded as “unheroic” in the dominant narrative unless they can find some manner of redeeming their volume of prowess by some equivalent measure. Given the earlier-mentioned context of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> as a genealogy of kings, it is to be expected that the text is biased toward the Malay world, especially of the Sultanate of Melaka (Malaka), but its depiction contains some relevant warnings about the possibly unequal pattern of intersocietal relations without the cages of statehood.</p>

<title>Relations of Knowledge Quests</title>
<p>Through the privileging of the pursuit of honor and advancement of human merit, the relations of peoples and kingdoms in the Malay world necessarily manifest simultaneously as quests for knowledge. As the tale of Raja Chulan illustrated early on, the enlightened kings of the upper world desired to comprehend the conditions of polities and societies in the “underworld” beneath the seas. Raja Chulan’s aspiration was to see “all the manifold works of God Almighty.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0304375412444809">44</xref>
</sup> In his sojourn in the mystical undersea land of Dika, the curious Raja merely observed that the population of the land were classifiable in two categories: “only half were Muslims, the rest were unbelievers.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0304375412444809">45</xref>
</sup> Yet no attempt was made to condemn the population of the land for being incomplete converts to Islam. In an expression of humane solidarity, Raja Chulan introduced himself to his host, the Raja Aftabu’l-Ardl of Dika, as follows: “I am come from the world. I am the Raja of all mankind, and my name is Raja Chulan . . . In truth this universe is manifold, and manifold are the kinds that dwell in it.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0304375412444809">46</xref>
</sup> In a clear acknowledgment of a mutual respect for diversity among peoples and rulers, Raja Aftabu’l-Ardl of Dika exclaimed, “How perfect is God, the King Omnipotent!” It is recorded that Raja Chulan decided to stay awhile in Dika, married his host’s beautiful daughter and produced three sons. At the end of three years, Raja Chulan decided that he could not leave his earthly kingdom unattended and bade Raja Aftabu’l-Ardl dispatch his three sons to the upper world when they attained manhood so that the Chulan royal line would continue. Upon his return to land on the back of a “winged stallion,” Raja Chulan summoned his scholars and artificers and ordered the account of his descent into the sea to be recorded and a monument to be built for posterity and the learning of future generations. But strangely, the verdict of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>’s narrator on Raja Chulan’s undersea adventure hinted at an imperialist design to his quest for knowledge:<disp-quote>
<p>When they heard the command of Raja Chulan, the artificers split a rock in two and they made a record in writing in the Hindustani language. When this was done, Raja Chulan ordered a quantity of precious things—gold, silver, jewels, gems and rare stones of every kind—to be put into (the rock chamber?), saying, “There shall come a day when a prince of my line shall possess this treasure, and it is that prince who shall make all lands below the wind subject to him.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0304375412444809">47</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The implication of the storage and transmission of knowledge is to unite the majesty of power to that of knowledge. This is a recurring theme in the way the various rajas went about the consolidation of their kingdoms. In the nineteenth-century Leyden translation of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, it is further recorded that, in the wake of his undersea adventure, Raja Chulan himself manifested the power-knowledge nexus by founding the city of Bijnager [or Bija Nagara] with gates of “steel adorned with gold and gems.” Furthermore, “within its circumference are contained seven hills, and in the centre a lake like a sea, and so large that if an elephant be standing on the one shore he will not be visible on the other; and this lake contained every species of fish.” In the center of this artificial lake, an island was created where a large variety of trees, flowers and fruits were planted for the Raja’s enjoyment. A forest on the shore was also deliberately populated “with all sorts of wild beasts, and whenever Raja Suran [Chulan]<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0304375412444809">48</xref>
</sup> wished to hunt, he mounted his elephant and proceeded to this forest.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0304375412444809">49</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>As has been described, the city of Bijnager was fashioned in the image of an earthly Eden. It was a geographical attraction intended to project royal and civilizational glory to peoples near and far, and onto the annals of time. Much in the same vein, the ornate architecture, cultural and mercantile geography of Melaka takes up the entire chapter 11 of the John Leyden translation of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, revealing significant British admiration for the projection of a theatrical-like protocol. The following description of Melaka’s diplomatic protocol certainly brings to mind the nascent ambassadorial practices of fifteenth century Europe:<disp-quote>
<p>Whenever an ambassador came or took his departure, the raja’s slaves were to bring them out of the palace and deliver them to the head <italic>bantara</italic>, who was to set them before the <italic>bandahara</italic>. The salver, with a yellow shoulder cloth, was to be given to the person who brought the letter. If at any time a letter was brought from Pasei or Haru, the ambassador was ordered to be met with all the regal apparatus, drums, flutes, trumpets, nagarets, with two white umbrellas carried close together, but the bugles were not to accompany them. Also, the <italic>mantris</italic> were to go mounted on elephants’ necks, and the <italic>bantaras</italic> and <italic>sedasidas</italic> mounted on the elephants’ hinder parts, while the latter was to be carried by the chief of the little <italic>baduandas</italic>, (servants whose business is to run at the side of the elephant, opposite the <italic>howder</italic>) for the rajas of both the aforesaid countries are to be considered of equal rank with the Raja of Malaca [Melaka], and whether old or young, to be saluted in the same manner. When the embassy reaches the hall of the audience, the letter was to be received by a <italic>hulu-balang</italic> of high descent, and the king’s answer was to be returned to the ambassador by the head <italic>bantaras</italic>, on the right and on the left.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0304375412444809">50</xref>

</p>
</disp-quote>The narrative of a “flourishing” Melaka derives its substance from the mixed appeal of pomp, circumstance, and dramatic revelations of grandeur. Melaka’s fame was portrayed as the apex of civilizational attainment in the Malay world. All rajas reportedly came to Melaka to be introduced to its Sultan “who received them all with the highest respect, and invested them with honorary dresses of the highest value.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0304375412444809">51</xref>
</sup> Throughout all versions of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> consulted by the author, there were plentiful references to neighboring kingdoms resorting to the good offices of Melaka’s sultan and his ministers for the mediation of various disputes while also reveling in Melaka’s celebration of their relations with elaborate protocol. Such was Melaka’s reputation as a center of civilization, that “in ships bound for Malaka from above the wind it was the custom, as the anchor was being weighed, for the master of the ship, after reciting the usual prayer, to say, “May we reach Malaka safely and see Pisang Jeram, the stream of Bukit China and Bendahara Sri Maharaja [the Prime Minister equivalent of that time]!” And the crew would answer, “Ay, ay, sir!”’<sup>

<title>Relations of Justice</title>
<p>The notion of justice in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> is not delineated in any definitive passage. It exists by extrapolation from the shared understandings of honor and the quest for knowledge. On an elementary level, it is a discourse of identity stemming from the agreement between the earlier mentioned Sri Tri Buana and the Palembang royalty over a nuptial arrangement. In this imputed source of Malay political good conduct, recognized superiors were to be rendered total obedience by their subordinates, while the former were bound never to subject their populations to shame and opprobrious language. In other words, the social contract between monarch and subject was one of benevolent rule reciprocated by complete submission. It was assumed that the kingdom was imperiled in the eyes of God, should this contract ever be broken. There are countless episodes in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> where this had occurred, but where the breach was repaired by some conciliatory gesture by the raja, his nobles or his subjects, the ruling royalty lived out its normal span of existence. As has also been alluded to above, the Melaka Sultanate established its civilizational status in the Malay world <italic>primus inter pares</italic> precisely because its leaders enacted a system of just rule. By default, the narrator of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> extended its judicial sway across its political boundaries through the text’s many thick insinuations of Melaka as a center for cultural and political norms. As it has also been recounted in the preceding sections, just relations are extended to historic non-Malay diplomatic partners such as the kingdoms of Kalinga (India), Siam, and China. Both Raja Iskandar’s and Melaka’s parleys with non-Malay entities through evangelization, goodwill missions, and offers of marriages are recognizable attempts to socialize others into comparable standards of societal ethics. In this regard, the relations of justice in the Malay world manifest a simultaneous intra- and intersocietal dimension. It was only with the Portuguese interloper’s demonstration of material avarice that this harmonious culture of relations was brutally interrupted.</p>
<p>In one case, the Raja of Pahang’s henchmen carried out an assassination against a Trengganu noble, Tun Telanai, on the grounds that the latter had visited Melaka to pay homage without his Raja’s consent. Trengganu was a satellite of Pahang at the time. It aggravated the moral gravity of the crime when Melaka’s Sultan learnt that the Raja of Pahang had sent a fellow noble to kill Tun Telanai. The Raja of Melaka at the time, Sultan Alla’u’d-din, was enraged by these reports. He interpreted the assassination as an act of arrogance against him by the Raja of Pahang and expressed the intention to invade Pahang to teach its raja a lesson. Wiser counsels prevailed in Sultan Alla’u’d-din’s court. The chief minister, the <italic>bendahara</italic> [also spelt <italic>bandahara</italic>] convinced his Sultan that he should instead repay like for like instead of destroying the kingdom of Pahang whose raja was Alla’u’d-din’s elder brother. Heeding this counsel, Sultan Alla’u’d-din of Melaka decided to dispatch a secret assassination squad masked as a formal delegation led by an official who was both an esteemed champion and a war minister (<italic>laksamana</italic>). Their target was the family of the assassin who murdered Tun Telanai. As soon as this Melaka delegation was seated according to protocol at the court of Pahang, one of their members seized the opportunity to slay the brother of the assassin who had also been seated in the same hall. The Raja of Pahang queried the Melaka visitors on such a provocation. The <italic>laksamana</italic> feigned surprise to learn that a member of his delegation had indeed committed such an act and even owned up to it. The <italic>laksamana</italic> quickly preempted the Raja of Pahang’s next move by arguing that although one of his men had committed a murder, he “cannot consent to any account being taken of this, for the Sri Akar Raja [the Raja of Pahang’s assassin] himself offended against the Raja of Malaka in killing the Telanai of Trengganu without obtaining sanction from Malaka.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0304375412444809">53</xref>
</sup> The Brown translation of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> merely records that the Raja of Pahang fell silent when faced with this intrepid statement. The Leyden translation added that the Raja of Pahang finally confessed<disp-quote>
<p>I ordered this Talani [spelt ‘Telanai’ in Brown’s translation] to be put to death, on account of his disrespectful language, and asserting that the country was under his influence; but this matter rests entirely between the <italic>laksamana</italic> [from Melaka] and Sri Agra di Raja [spelt ‘Sri Akar Raja’ in Brown’s translation]; and nobody else has anything to do with it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0304375412444809">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>In this way, the violation was considered a closed matter. Satisfaction had been attained on the part of the victim’s family under the auspices of Melaka’s prestige; while the Raja of Pahang found a way to avoid direct responsibility for the feud between the families of the two slain victims. The narrator did not pursue the matter of Sri Akar Raja’s loss of dignity in his narrative but wrote that upon returning to Melaka, the <italic>laksamana</italic> was congratulated and rewarded for his wise discretion.</p>
<p>In yet another demonstration of the Melaka Sultanate’s expansive influence in defining justice, the Raja of Siak on the island of Sumatra was held to account for imposing the death sentence on a presumed traitor without informing the Raja of Melaka.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0304375412444809">55</xref>
</sup> The latter, Sultan Alla’u’d-din, was sufficiently affronted by such an act of independence that he sent his <italic>laksamana</italic> Hang Tuah to query the Raja of Siak. It became known that the death sentence was carried out by one of the ministers at the Siak court by the name of Tun Jana Pakibol. Following the completion of arrival protocol in the presence of the Raja of Siak, <italic>laksamana</italic> Hang Tuah turned directly to Tun Jana Pakibol and asked if it was he who put to death a certain Tun Anu. Tun Jana Pakibol answered in the affirmative and explained that he carried out the order of his sovereign. The <italic>laksamana</italic> made a symbolic gesture of rolling up his sleeve and turning his back to the Raja of Siak, then, jabbing his left hand at Tun Jana Pakibol, he commented loudly: “There is a man so unwise, that he is little better than an <italic>orang-utin,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0304375412444809">56</xref>

</italic> and who knows not how to demean himself in polite conversation. Is it true that you have killed a person without communicating the fact to Malaca, or do you think to make yourself independent in Siak here?”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0304375412444809">57</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This is construed by the Siak court as an admonition from the moral center at Melaka. Several codes of honor are employed here: the labeling of the morally wayward person as uncivilized; the inability of the offender to express remorse for impropriety in enlightened language; and the implications of a brazen usurpation of cultural norms through unthinking deeds. According to the narrative, the Raja of Siak and his whole court sat in silence “hanging their heads down.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0304375412444809">58</xref>
</sup> The <italic>laksamana</italic> had fulfilled his mission and the Raja of Siak made amends in a letter to be carried by the <italic>laksamana</italic> to Sultan Alla’u’d-din in Melaka. Its contents read: “The elder brother, the Raja of Siak, presents his homage to the Sri Paduca [honorific title for Sultan Alla’u’d-din of Melaka/Malaca/Malaka] his younger brother, the Raja of Malaca, and begs his pardon if any occasion of offence has occurred.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0304375412444809">59</xref>
</sup> The narrator observed that this episode demonstrated that “Such was the custom of the ancient time, that neither in the land of Malaca, nor in any of the countries dependent on it, was any person permitted to be put to death without the raja being duly informed.”<sup>

<p>Prowess and prestige dictated justice transnationally, or in intersocietal fashion, under the overarching canopy of a Malay high culture. Its arbiter was a transcendental Sultan at Melaka.</p>

<title>Conclusion— A Precolonial Malay Contribution to an International Relations of peoples?</title>
<p>Based on this preliminary reading of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>, it is reasonable to conclude that there is culturally derived textual evidence of an indigenous Southeast Asian contribution to the pretheory of modern international relations. This is however a less familiar ideological terrain to the student of “the contemporary international.” The myth historical world portrayed by the <italic>Sejarah</italic> is one that is self-consciously a venture in hierarchical organization, cultural glorification, and moral narrative. It is nonetheless accessible to <italic>our</italic> time because it offers an interpretation of relations across boundaries that are more cultural and moral than territorially fixed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0304375412444809">61</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The thematic dissection of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> suggests that relations of noble prowess, of knowledge quests, and of justice, operate on both intra- and intersocietal levels. Noble prowess cannot be sufficiently regarded as such if it remains hidden from others throughout the lands where human communication occurs. Furthermore, noble prowess allowed its wielders to bring glory to their kingdoms of domicile. It also allowed monarchs to fashion moral compacts for governing their subjects, albeit not without some sanction of violence. One recalls that familiar maxim from the narrator of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>: “Malay rulers  . . . shall never put their subjects to shame, and that those subjects however gravely they offend shall never be bound or hanged or disgraced with evil words. If any ruler puts a single one of his subjects to shame, that shall be a sign that his kingdom will be destroyed by Almighty God.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0304375412444809">62</xref>
</sup> Reciprocally, the subjects are expected to scrupulously observe obedience to monarchic paternalism even if it should assume the hue of despotism. Wars cannot enhance prowess unless some enlightening outcome can be produced from it; even humiliation ought to be treated as a learning process. There is a clear privileging of a political power-knowledge nexus. Kingdoms cannot be founded, or subsist, on greatness of prestige if they did not contribute in some substantive way to the furthering of knowledge about the world. Both Raja Chulan’s famed city of Bijnager and Melaka’s grandeur are premised upon their ability to organize nature into decorative and leisurely forms signifying a higher level of cultural achievement than what was hitherto practiced. In like manner, justice is ideally transcendental of borders, with Melaka setting the standards as its cultural center. Justice in the <italic>Sejarah</italic> emerges as a complex social construct of noble prowess and knowledge accumulation. It is even inclusive of Islam, but this is never declared in a neat aphorism. This nebulous notion of justice makes a disturbing allowance for controlled violence on the basis of “an eye for an eye” in some instances, but in others, it illuminates errors through references to good breeding and preexisting norms of noble behavior. In sum, the picture of relations across borders is one that emphasizes significant hierarchies of human dignity and achievement over fixed territoriality. The rajas of the Malay world appear desirous of extending their norms to non-Malay kingdoms all the same—though not consistently by peaceful means. Despite recurring wars, Melaka found it in its culture to extend a hand to its erstwhile enemy, Siam, and further afield to the rival kingdom of China.</p>
<p>Following the work of historians on the subject of the international relations of the Malay world, one might object that the preceding depiction of precolonial Southeast Asia borders on the romantic. After all, the world of pre-twentieth-century Europe did supply evidence of the operation of monarchic diplomacy and hierarchical international relations. One might even analyze the seventeenth-century world, and earlier, of Southeast Asia using the language of modern European sovereignties playing balance of power maneuvers behind the facades of pomp and pageantry.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0304375412444809">63</xref>
</sup> But these analyses neglect the particularities of the local in favor of an oppressive uniformity of modernist discourse. Historian Peter Borschberg’s subsequent study of the interplay between violence and diplomacy in the early penetration of Dutch power into the Singapore and Melaka Straits in the seventeenth century suggests that the rival Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish authorities on the spot treated Asian rulers as “sovereign” in the Westphalian sense on expedient grounds—to outflank the blandishments of rival Europeans and to secure commercial privileges with the locals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0304375412444809">64</xref>
</sup> A debate between controversial readings of premodern texts such as that performed in this article, and those who would argue that pristine contextualism should inhibit interdisciplinary creativity in reading ancient texts, should surely be healthy in advancing the search for solutions in a world where elites and peoples increasingly encounter the other in close proximity and with little distance for substantial reflection.</p>
<p>In this sense, one appreciates the tone of violation registered by the <italic>Sejarah</italic> in relation to the arrival of the first Europeans in Southeast Asia in the form of the Portuguese. Interestingly, the arrival of the latter is treated as an inglorious cloud hanging ominously over the denouement of the <italic>Sejarah</italic>. Both the Brown and Leyden translations indicate that the Portuguese were labeled respectively as “Franks” or “Frangis” (a literal translation from the Malay “Feringgi”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0304375412444809">65</xref>
</sup> for foreigner), who had travelled from Goa, looking like “white Bengalis” and inviting the curiosity of the peoples of Melaka in a physical way; fingering the Frangis’ beards, playing with their hats, and grasping their hands.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0304375412444809">66</xref>
</sup> The first contact with a European trading vessel was friendly and consistent with the treatment accorded by Melaka’s officials to all the non-Malay mercantile “others.” In this instance, the description from the Leyden translation of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> captures the warmth of the initial intercultural encounter better than the Brown translation:<disp-quote>
<p>The [Frangi] <italic>capitan</italic> then went to the <italic>bandahara</italic> Sri Maha Raja, and the <italic>bandahara</italic> adopted him as his son; and the <italic>capitan</italic> presented the <italic>bandahara</italic> with two hundred chains of gold set with gems of extreme beauty, and Manilla workmanship, and he threw it over the neck of the <italic>bandahara</italic>. The [Malay] peoples present were going to be in a passion with that Frangi, but the <italic>bandahara</italic> would not let them, saying, “Do not mal-treat peoples who are ignorant of the language;” so kind was he to them, and the <italic>capitan</italic> adopted the <italic>bandahara</italic> as his father.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0304375412444809">67</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>The trouble began when the Frangi <italic>capitan</italic> reported his impressions of Melaka to the “great vizier” of Goa, Alphonsus Albuquerco. The latter paid attention only to the material wealth narrated in the <italic>capitan</italic>’s report and was described as coveting it eagerly. Albuquerco immediately ordered an invasion fleet to capture Melaka. This fleet terrorized the unsuspecting population with a rain of cannon shot that sounded “like thunder.” This thunderous cannonade maimed and decapitated many hapless residents. The soldiers of Melaka met the Portuguese landing the next day with a fierce counterattack “according to the mode of amok”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0304375412444809">68</xref>
</sup> and beat the Frangis back to their ships. Thwarted in their plans, the Portuguese fleet retreated to Goa.</p>
<p>The combat psychology of “amok” signified for the Malay the discarding of all notions of dignified restraint in order to forcibly subdue an enemy against all odds. In this way, the narrative vilified Portuguese rapacity. Nevertheless, Albuquerco returned within a decade with a huge armada designed to force a victory. The narrative of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> accorded the Frangis the following description—“the sound of their cannon was like the thunder of Heaven, and the sound of their muskets like the rattling of dried pease.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0304375412444809">69</xref>
</sup> This apocalyptic turn of phrase was perhaps deliberately symbolic of the twilight of the intersocietal relations of prowess and prestige in the precolonial Malay world.</p>
<p>There was little left of superior culture to affirm in the ensuing humiliation of the Melaka royal line, only a valiant retreat in the final pages of the Annals. Sultan Ahmed of Melaka lost heart in the fight even though his ministers and champions invoked cultural valor and rallied one another. Sultan Ahmed’s self-exile in Pahang, and ultimately Bentan, came to an ignominious ending when he corrupted himself with the pleasures of consumption, leisure, and the epicurean friendships of the young to the detriment of the rightly ordered kingship. An incident was recorded whereby Sultan Ahmed’s youthful court favorites insulted the ministers, war chiefs, and warriors by offering them the remnants of their fine feasts for dinner. Sultan Ahmed’s elderly father, Sultan Mahmud Shah, who had also fled Melaka together with his son’s entourage, was outraged by his moral degradation and insolence toward his distinguished followers. In keeping with proper custom and justice between ruler and followers, Sultan Mahmud ordered his son assassinated and reassumed the exiled throne of Melaka. Subsequently, Sultan Mahmud abdicated in favor of Raja Muzaffar Shah, the late Sultan Ahmed’s son, as his successor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0304375412444809">70</xref>
</sup> Before this transfer took place, Sultan Mahmud’s authority was undermined by Sultan Abdullah, Raja of Kampar, who not only refused to owe allegiance to the Melaka sultan-in-exile but also added insult to injury by seeking Portuguese military assistance to repel punitive expeditions from Sultan Mahmud. This confrontation occasioned another military victory for the Portuguese who were now the brutal overlords of the city of Melaka. The Portuguese subsequently turned treacherous toward their erstwhile ally, Sultan Abdullah of Kampar, binding him as a prisoner and banishing him to Portugal. Sultan Mahmud, even in defeat, recoiled at the latest affront visited by the Portuguese and tried to rally the Malay world by shaming the cowardly ministers of the Kampar court who had failed their sultan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0304375412444809">71</xref>
</sup> A serious political canker had set into the Malay world with the Portuguese interloper offering his military services to opportunistic sultans who were tempted to shift allegiances from the exiled Melaka royalty. A failed rebellion against the Portuguese stronghold within Melaka led ultimately to a truce with the harsh new imperial order arbitered by European power.</p>
<p>While there are obvious parallels between the <italic>Sejarah</italic>’s closing chapters and Niccolo Machiavelli’s lament about the unpatriotic disunity of Italian princedoms in the fifteenth century,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0304375412444809">72</xref>
</sup> the <italic>Sejarah</italic> also portrays the possibility of a civilized intersocietal vision of international relations sourced from the adherence to a common language of the norms of nobility. Between India, China, Arabia, and the Malay world, some reasonably pacific relations were possible without the heavy hand of managing relations through overwhelming force. Given the particular language of the <italic>Sejarah</italic> in describing the European arrival, the Portuguese intrusion was at once a cultural and political shock to the noble imaginations of the Asian polities, notwithstanding historical interpretations<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0304375412444809">73</xref>
</sup> that the Portuguese, Spaniards, and subsequently the Dutch, were merely new entrants to the Asian market for spices. The local polities had previously been able to find ways of compromising without losing too much face over political and military defeats. The lessons of the <italic>Sejarah Melayu</italic> portend a need for order to limit the caprice of political communication between cultures. The <italic>Sejarah</italic> is ultimately relevant for analysts of international relations because it addresses the need for common languages to bridge peoples and states across borderlessness. Perhaps “order” could be obtainable via relations of noble prowess, prestige, and justice with reference to some supranational ordering climate? Premodern examples of hierarchical relations may not be so bad for sustaining borderless human existence: order will be present so long as there are plural authorities willing to practice, or assert, transnational moral authority.</p>

<p>This reading extends Clifford Geertz’s observation of the comparable premodern international relations of nineteenth-century Bali into the rest of the Malay world. See Geertz’s <italic>Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali</italic> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980).
