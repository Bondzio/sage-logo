<p>Writing is an essential element of sociological pedagogy. Many of our classes rely on written work as the means for students to demonstrate their acquisition of a sociological perspective. This special issue of <italic>Teaching Sociology</italic> will address critical issues and the unique concerns that we face related to the use of written work in our discipline. What are the key features of “good sociological writing” and how do we teach them? What does the pedagogy of writing look like in our discipline? Why do we use these strategies to teach writing? What are the critical challenges in teaching writing and how do we address them in our assignments and syllabi? For many, if not most of us, writing is one important strategy that we use both to deepen and broaden student thinking and then to assess these changes. The goal of this issue is to showcase the wide range of approaches, forms and purposes that sociologists ascribe to the written work we assign in our classes.</p>
<p>We hope this issue will expose and dissect the ways in which we transmit our logic surrounding writing pedagogy in our discipline to the students in our classrooms, our colleagues and institutional leaders. We encourage papers that explore the meaning and application of writing across a wide range of themes and provide evidence of improvement in student writing and critical thinking skills.</p>
