<p>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale her infinite variety.</p>

</p>
<p>Birthdays occupy a unique place in the human psyche. For the first 2 or so decades of our lives, they are important milestones along the path to adulthood, indulgent celebrations that signify the arrival of new privileges and independence. That happy trajectory reaches its zenith in our early twenties, when the accumulation of privileges begins to plateau and growing seniority mostly brings the burden of additional responsibilities. As we near the end of our third decade, youthful idealism often yields to cynical empiricism; hence the mantra of the ’70s, “Never trust anyone over 30.” Life rolls on; as we course through the period euphemistically known as middle age, birthdays come wrapped in a shroud of dread as we realize that life is not going to last forever. Aside from providing an excuse to pamper ourselves, these anniversaries remain pretty much unwelcome until we attain the status of octogenarians. At that point, we begin to proclaim each birthday defiantly, proud of having beaten the grim reaper for yet another year.</p>
<p>Although age creeps up on us a day at a time, whenever a birthday arrives our preoccupation with numbers leads us to feel that we have aged an entire year overnight. Because we live in a decimal culture, this shock is multiplied ten-fold whenever we reach the end of a decade, as if 10 years of disintegration had suddenly been dropped upon us. We nervously rib our friends when they turn “the big four-oh” or the “big five-oh.” In our neighborhood, it’s not unusual to encounter a front lawn suddenly covered in pink plastic flamingos or some other equally startling agglomeration, accompanied with a large sign proclaiming, “Lordy, lordy, look who’s forty!” Needless to say, these decorations are usually rented by the spouse of the person actually achieving the landmark birthday. (Whenever we pass one of these displays, my own wife Trish casually informs me that if I ever dare to do something similar, I might as well not bother coming home again.) I sometimes wonder what our attitude would be if our everyday math were a binary system. Would we sink into depression biannually, or would our sensibilities eventually become numbed by the sheer frequency of round-numbered birthdays?</p>
<p>For institutions, birthdays carry different connotations. While such entities are certainly not guaranteed perpetual existence, their life spans are potentially more enduring than our own biblical 3 score and 10. Round-numbered anniversaries are as notable for institutions as they are for us humans and perhaps even more festive, since institutions often flower, rather than wither, with age. It is in this spirit that we observe the publication of Volume 40 of the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic>. Coincidently, this issue begins the second decade that I have been privileged to serve as editorial steward of the Journal’s heritage.</p>
<p>Humans can usually refer to an official certificate to verify their exact date of birth, but in the case of <italic>AJSM</italic> this process is a bit murkier. As <italic>AJSM</italic> first appeared in 1972, you may be wondering why Volume 40 was not published in 2011. The answer will be clear if you delve into the archive section of the <italic>AJSM</italic> Web site. In fact, only 1 issue of the Journal appeared in 1972, so the issues of 1973 were designated as a continuation of Volume 1. Production was a bit unpredictable in those early days. The first issue was dated September-October but there is some uncertainty as to when it actually hit the newsstands. The journal settled down to a bimonthly format in 1974, a schedule that remained constant until it expanded to 8 issues in 2004 and the current monthly installments in 2005.</p>
<p>As a tribute to its 40th anniversary, I thought it would be fitting to recount the early history of the <italic>AJSM</italic>. I have been fortunate to have 2 invaluable resources to aid me in my mission, selections from an unfinished memoir by Dr Jack Hughston and an unpublished narrative by Dr Robert Leach, my 2 predecessors at <italic>AJSM</italic>. These accounts are so infused with the personalities and erudition of those distinguished men that I felt their own words would be infinitely preferable to any bowdlerization that I could produce. In this month’s installment, Editors Hughston and Leach recall how the <italic>AJSM</italic> happened into existence as the <italic>Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> and how its name came to be modified to the current title.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Leach:</speaker>
<p>The history of the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic>, to some extent, parallels the growth and development of Sports Medicine as a legitimate medical specialty. It is hard to precisely define when the latter started, but certainly Sports Medicine as an entity hit the American consciousness in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Around that time some of the early orthopaedic giants got together and decided that there should be an orthopaedic sports medicine organization. The first organizational meeting occurred in 1972, with Dr. Don O’Donoghue being elected President, and the first annual meeting of the AOSSM took place in 1973.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Hughston:</speaker>
<p>In the 1960s I didn’t have time to do much writing myself to contribute my part to the national advancement of sports medicine. However, what little writing I attempted was being rejected by the normal leading medical journals because they were not interested in Sports Medicine subjects. I knew we had to find an outlet somewhere to publish these materials that were coming out of the postgraduate courses being put on by the AAOS Committee on Sports Medicine, particularly when there were so many young men coming along and doing research.</p>
</speech>
<p>After trying every other conceivable way, I saw I was going to have to take the matter into my own hands and develop a journal related to Orthopaedic Sports Medicine. We had to have it because the young men weren’t going to have an outlet for their scientific works and clinical works if we didn’t have a journal, and if there was no outlet, there would be minimal to no stimulation for the production of further work.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Leach:</speaker>
<p>The first issue of the <italic>Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> is marked as Volume I, Number I, September-October, 1972. In fact, that issue did not arrive at subscribers’ addresses until well after that date. It features a cover showing professional football players and a small color insert of the damage sustained by one of them; courtesy of Dr. James Nicholas. The very first article concerned the subluxating patella and was written by Dr. Jack Hughston. In view of much of the history to follow this appears logical and deserved. There was also a small color atlas of photos, taken through the arthroscope, of meniscal problems of the knee; contributed by Dr. James Funk.</p>
</speech>
<p>How did this Journal get started, and who were the actual progenitors? Unfortunately, many of the principals are deceased, but I was able to talk with each of them at various times and took notes, which are now passed on here. Plus, I have a number of the early letters between the principals and minutes of early AOSSM meetings.</p>
<p>Dr. William Sinton was an orthopedic surgeon from Waterbury, CT., who had an interest in sports medicine. He had no academic appointments and had not been active in writing articles, etc. However, he foresaw the growth of sports medicine and believed there was a need for a journal representing the orthopaedic aspect of the specialty. He got together with Benjamin Goode, who was a local publisher and friend, and they conceived the idea of a Sports Medicine Journal. Sinton was an affable gentleman and knew many of the movers and shakers in the field. He approached some and told them what he wanted to do. He was encouraged by them to go ahead and enlisted many to be on his first Editorial Advisory Board; including Jack Hughston as Chairman. Others of note on the Board included Drs. O’Donoghue, Slocum, Reynolds, Ferguson, Blazina, Nicholas, and Ellison. At this point Goode was the publisher, and Sinton’s title was Medical Director. They used Williams and Wilkins as their printer, but Mr. Goode did the copy editing and the redacting. I was told by Sinton and Goode that their first discussions occurred starting early in 1971, but it took some time for the project to be pulled together.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Hughston:</speaker>
<p>I started talking about this journal to various people and at various gatherings. Jim Nicholas told me of some people up in Connecticut who were beginning a Sports Medicine journal. So, I checked them out, these people, Ben Goode and Bill Sinton, and they had not yet turned out a publication. However, I kept working with them and eventually, in 1972, we turned out the first volume of the <italic>Journal of Sports Medicine</italic>.</p>
</speech>
<p>At about that point, [another publisher] approached me at one of the meetings and they made me an offer. I asked would it be a peer-reviewed journal and, if so, who would be editor and what input would the AOSSM have to the Journal? The answers to all of these questions were negative. This representative stated that [they were] definitely going to put out a journal and that they had appropriated in their budget a million dollars for looking into the matter of getting it going. I could see that they had the upper hand financially and from an organizational standpoint, however I felt that for a journal to be worthwhile, it would have to be peer reviewed.</p>
<p>I kept looking around and finally ended up in Baltimore with Williams &amp; Wilkins accepting the journal for publication. After two or three years of hard work they informed me that we would never reach over 4,000 circulation because they had been handling [another orthopaedic journal] for ten or fifteen years and it had never gotten past that point. I told them that my plans were a little different, and I anticipated doing a whole lot better than that. Of course, I didn’t know of what I was speaking; I was just speaking from my gut.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Dr Leach:</speaker>
<p>The first issues in 1972 and 1973 were not particularly noteworthy, and Sinton pushed very hard for the fledgling AOSSM to use his journal as the Society’s publishing organ. The AOSSM was not entranced at first with the idea of using that journal as there were problems including the fact that only 3 of the proposed 6 issues for 1973 were published in that year. During the years 1972 and 1973 the magazine was a regular large size, but in 1974 it went to a small size format with a yellow and white, rather undistinguished, cover. That same year it also became the official publication of the AOSSM, the United States Ski Association, and the National Ski Patrol.</p>
</speech>
<p>In discussions during 1974 and 1975 the AOSSM hierarchy wondered if they could buy the publishing rights from Sinton/Goode and take it over. Neither of the owners was very happy to give up ownership, but they were stymied a bit because the best source of papers would be from the AOSSM, and if the Society decided to publish its own magazine the Sinton/Goode journal would likely fail. Because of not meeting deadlines, it was difficult to attract advertisers and revenue was low. They were in fact losing money. Thus by 1976 the <italic>Journal of Sports Medicine</italic> had been purchased for $50.000.00 by the AOSSM, which promptly changed the name to the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine</italic>. The Society initially did not have enough money to make the purchase and needed a loan, but to obtain this loan Dr. Leslie Bodnar of South Bend had to give his personal guarantee. This certainly put the Society in debt in several ways to Dr. Bodnar, who was also serving as the Secretary.</p>
<p>So, by 1976, the Journal had a new name and a new ownership that promised a greater degree of organizational stability. <italic>AJSM</italic> and the subspecialty of orthopaedic sports medicine were poised for growth. Next month, we will learn how Dr Hughston took firm control of the helm and set an ambitious course for the fledgling publication.</p>
