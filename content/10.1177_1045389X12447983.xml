<abstract>
<p>This study investigates a miniature haptic button actuated by magnetorheological fluids with the aim of conveying kinesthetic information or realistic button sensations to users for small electronic devices. To this end, a prototype haptic button that creates varying kinesthetic sensations was designed and constructed. The design focus was to maximize the resistive force generated by magnetorheological fluids in a given size by using multiple operating modes of the fluids. In order to evaluate the performance of the prototype, a test setup consisting of a microstage and a precision load cell was constructed. Using the setup, the resistive force of the prototype button was measured by changing the indented depth and the input current. The results show that the force rate (defined as the ratio of the difference between the maximum force and the minimum force to the maximum force) is over 72% for all indented depths (up to 1.5 mm). This change is sufficient to create various button sensations, indicating that the proposed haptic button can offer a range of resistive force change that can be conveyed to human operators.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Due to the advancement of information technology, various handheld devices have been developed and commercialized. These handheld devices usually have mechanical buttons, which are primarily used for providing commands. Hence, the physical sensation of pressing such a button is always the same regardless of its application. However, in the case where users interact with contents in a handheld device, various button sensations are desired. As such, the haptic technology strives to enable users to feel a variety of button sensations depending on applications. In general, haptic feeling consists of tactile sensation (sensory information acquired by pressure receptors in the skin) and kinesthetic sensation (sensory data obtained by receptors in joints, muscles, and ligaments). When users press an actual button, they primarily feel the kinesthetic sensation. To create realistic and various kinesthetic sensations by haptic displays or buttons, therefore, they should be designed to generate a wide range of forces.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, mechanical keypads in handheld devices have been replaced by touch screens in order to increase the size of the visual display unit. Many researchers focused on tactile actuators to realize button sensations in touch screen–based devices. This is because the tactile actuators can easily be constructed in small size. Among others, vibrotactile actuators have been most widely studied to produce button sensations on touch screens by generating short vibration feedbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12447983">Cho, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12447983">Kwon et al., 2010</xref>), and they have been successfully commercialized in many handheld devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12447983">Kwon et al., 2006</xref>). However, these actuators mainly provide tactile feedback to users for tactile sensations (surface roughness, textures, etc.) by creating small vibratory motions. Thus, they are not sufficient to convey comprehensive or proper haptic sensations for certain applications, particularly kinesthetic-feeling-dominant applications (such as button-click or pressing feeling for buttons).</p>
<p>A few researchers studied kinesthetic devices to convey kinesthetic information for creating realistic button sensations. Most proposed kinesthetic devices adopted commercial alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) motors to generate various kinesthetic sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12447983">Bianchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12447983">Fujita and Ohmori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12447983">Iwata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12447983">Song et al., 2005</xref>). Since the use of the commercial AC/DC motors increases the size and the power consumption of the kinesthetic devices, these devices can hardly be incorporated into small electronic products. Moreover, active-controlled motors tend to have instability problems, which can be a significant road block for certain applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12447983">Adams et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12447983">An, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12447983">Colgate et al., 1993</xref>). Alternative to motors and other active-type actuators, some researchers applied smart materials toward miniature kinesthetic-display applications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12447983">Blake and Gurocak (2009)</xref> proposed a miniature magnetorheological (MR) brake for a haptic glove application. Even though the MR brake generates enough torque for haptic feedback, the size of the MR brake (diameter of 25 mm and height of 15 mm) may not be suitable for handheld device applications. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12447983">Jansen et al. (2010)</xref> developed “MudPad,” which consists of an array of electromagnets and MR fluid pouch. Although the “MudPad” can convey haptic sensation over a continuous surface by using the MR fluid pouch, miniaturizing the overall structure to fit into small electronic devices seems a challenging task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12447983">Yang et al. (2010)</xref> proposed a miniature tunable stiffness display using MR fluids. While the device demonstrated a feasibility of using MR fluids for a miniature kinesthetic device, its size (24 × 24 × 15 mm) is still large for handheld devices.</p>
<p>The primary goals of this study are to construct a prototype miniature haptic button and to experimentally evaluate and assess its performance for conveying realistic button sensations in small electronic devices. The proposed haptic button is actuated by MR fluids and an electromagnetic actuator, and it utilizes the benefits of MR fluids (such as fast response time and low power requirement) to minimize its size and to eliminate instability problems. The next section explains the design and the working principle of the proposed haptic button followed by the fabrication of a prototype. After describing the experimental setup, which consists of a microstage and a precision load cell, a series of tests are performed to collect force–displacement profiles of the prototype. Analysis and discussion of experimental results conclude the article.</p>

<title>Overall structure</title>
<p>The schematic view of the miniature haptic button is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12447983">Figure 1</xref>. The housing with the yoke contains the solenoid, the plunger, the elastic spring, and MR fluids. The solenoid coil is attached on the bottom of the housing surrounding the yoke, and the plunger and the elastic spring are placed inside the solenoid coil. The housing spacer and the cover are attached to the top of the housing, and the contact plate is fixed to the tips of the plunger. Since the housing with the yoke and the plunger is constructed using a ferromagnetic material, those parts guide magnetic flux paths generated from the solenoid coil, creating a closed magnetic circuit. The housing contains MR fluids and the fluids flows through the gaps between the yoke and the plunger. When the electric current is applied to the solenoid coil, MR fluids are activated in the gap between the yoke and the plunger, building up particle chains. These MR fluids chains generate shear stress, and it is conveyed to users in the form of a resistive force on the contact plate.</p>

<title>Working principle and design consideration of haptic button</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12447983">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the cross-sectional view and the working principle of the proposed haptic button. Upon pressing the button, MR fluids flow out of the gap between the plunger and the yoke, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12447983">Figure 2</xref>. After releasing the button, the deformed elastic spring returns back to the original configuration, bringing the plunger, which is attached to the spring, back to its original position. During the motion of the plunger, the MR fluids can create various resistive forces depending on the magnetic fields created by the input current supplied to the solenoid coil. In order to maximize the resistive force in a small device, the proposed haptic button was designed such that it utilizes multiple operating modes of MR fluids. The multiple operating modes include the flow mode (MR fluids flow due to a pressure gradient between the two stationary plates), the shear mode (MR fluids flow between two plates that are moving relative to one another), and the squeeze mode (MR fluids flow between the two plates that are moving in a direction that is perpendicular to their planes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12447983">Brigley et al., 2007</xref>). In the design, when the plunger moves to the vertical downward direction, the MR fluids, contained in the gap between the yoke and the plunger, become compressed at the bottom (squeeze mode). The squeezed MR fluids then flow through the gap between the plunger and the yoke, which creates shear stress (shear mode). This is because the fluids flow through the stationary wall (the housing with the yoke) and the moving wall (the plunger, which moves along with the contact plate). The overflowing MR fluids produce the yield stress (flow mode) in the gap between the plunger and the yoke. The total resistive force can be determined by summing up all the stresses developed by the MR fluids. Therefore, the design that integrates multiple operating modes of MR fluids would maximize the resistive force in a given size of the haptic button.</p>

<p>In order to miniaturize the haptic button, the design focused on (a) integrating multiple operating modes of MR fluids to maximize the resistive force produced by MR fluids and (b) selecting “optimal” design parameters to minimize the size of the button. To do this, a series parametric and numerical study was performed using analytical equations along with a finite element method (FEM) tool. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12447983">Figure 3</xref> shows the result obtained using the FEM analysis. The magnetic field induced by the solenoid coil passes from the yoke to the housing via the plunger. As shown in the zoomed figure, when the plunger moves in the downward direction, the MR fluids between the plunger and the yoke become squeezed (squeeze mode). The MR fluids flowing through the gaps between the plunger and the yoke as well as between the yoke and the housing produce yield stress (the mixed mode—flow and direct shear mode).</p>

</fig>
<p>In this study, the FEM analysis focused on determining the size of the yoke as it is a key design parameter. The yoke design primarily determines the strength of the magnetic flux density and affects the size of the solenoid because the size of the housing is fixed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12447983">Figure 4</xref> shows the magnetic field distributions for two representative cases where the size of the yoke is larger than that of the solenoid and vice versa. When the yoke’s radius is decreased, the solenoid coil’s radius is increased as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12447983">Figure 4(a)</xref>. In this case, the magnetic field strength generated by the solenoid coil increases, but the total resistive force created can be limited owing to the magnetic saturation of the yoke. Conversely, when the yoke’s radius increases, the solenoid coil’s radius decreases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12447983">Figure 4(b)</xref>). In this case, the total resistive force decreases due to the decrease of the magnetic field strength.</p>

</fig>
<p>In order to select the “optimal” size of the yoke that produces the largest resistive force of the actuator, a series of parametric studies were conducted by changing the yoke’s radius from 1 to 2 mm, while other design parameters remained constant. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12447983">Figure 5</xref> shows the variation of the resistive force with the change of yoke’s radius. As shown in the figure, the maximum resistive force of 2.5 N is achieved at the yoke radius of 1.5 mm. Hence, this value was used for fabrication of the prototype. Accordingly, the inner and outer diameter of the solenoid coil was determined as 5.9 and 8.5 mm, respectively, each considering the size of the plunger and the housing.</p>

<title>Fabrication of haptic button</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12447983">Figure 6</xref> shows the constructed prototype and the components for the proposed haptic button. The haptic button consists of the solenoid coil, elastic spring, plunger, housing with the yoke, housing spacer, cover, and contact plate. The solenoid coil and the elastic spring are placed inside the housing surrounding the yoke. The plunger vertically moves along the yoke. The housing spacer and cover are attached to the top of the housing, and they confine MR fluids in the housing. The contact plate is fixed to the tips of the plunger. The housing spacer, plunger, and housing were made using pure iron (KSC 2504, Carbon less than 0.8%), which is well known as good ferromagnetic material to amplify the magnetic field strength. The size of the proposed haptic button (diameter of 10 mm and height of 12 mm) is considerably smaller than previous devices based on smart materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12447983">Blake and Gurocak, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12447983">Jansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12447983">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The button stroke is 1.5 mm. Moreover, the haptic button does not cause any stability problems owing to the use of semiactive actuating system with MR fluids.</p>

To further analyze the results in a haptic prospective, a measured force rate (Qv) is defined as the ratio of the difference between the maximum and minimum resistive force (Pv) to the maximum force (Lv) for a given indented depth. The measured force rate allows to calculate just noticeable difference (JND) of force for users.</p>

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1045389X12447983">Figure 9</xref> shows the variation of the measured resistive force rate (Qv). The minimum measured force rate is about 72% with the input current of 0.15 A and the indented depth of 0.1 mm (the force varied from 0.5 N with 0 A to 1.7 N with 0.15 A). The maximum measured force rate is about 85% with the input current of 0.25 A and the indented depth of 1.5 mm (the force varied from 1.8 N with 0 A to 12 N with 0.25 A). In general, the differential threshold of the force rate (or JND) that humans can reliably distinguish is about 10% for a force range of 0.5–200 N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12447983">Jones, 2000</xref>).

Therefore, the proposed haptic button with even a minimum force rate (72% at 0.1 mm indentation depth) can “haptically” generate various button sensations, which can be conveyed to users.</p>

It demonstrates that the prototype haptic button can create a force–displacement profile of a typical spring-loaded button by changing input currents. The button profile in the figure represents a force–displacement variation of an actual spring-loaded button. When it is pressed, the resistive force increases linearly with respect to the indented depth until the spring is fully compressed. The resistive force then suddenly drops to nearly zero when the button is released. By adjusting the input current, the haptic button can realize this button force profile, enabling users to feel a realistic button sensation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has presented a new miniature haptic button based on MR fluids. In the proposed button, multiple operating modes of MR fluids are integrated into the design to maximize the resistive force. After constructing a prototype haptic button, a series of experiments were conducted using a microstage setup to evaluate the performance of the prototype. The results indicate that the measured force increases as the indented depth and the input current increase. The results further indicate that the minimum measured force rate is around 72%, which is sufficient to generate several steps of force or stiffness changes for realistic button sensations. In summary, this study demonstrated that the MR fluid–based haptic button can be used as a kinesthetic actuator for small electronic devices. Moreover, this work paved the way to developing haptic displays or functional keypads based on MR buttons that can convey realistic haptic sensations over a continuous surface, such as a touch screen. As a future work, an array of haptic buttons will be embedded in handheld devices, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12447983">Figure 11</xref>.</p>
