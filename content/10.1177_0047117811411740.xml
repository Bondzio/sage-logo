<abstract>
<p>In a recent article in <italic>International Affairs</italic> Duncan Bell argued that the work of Peter Galison in the history of science could be usefully applied to the study of the history of International Relations (IR). In this article I take up Bell’s challenge, claiming that Galison’s post-Kuhnian history of science approach can be used both to understand the history of IR and to replace the ultimately confusing notion of ‘paradigm’ in the study of IR theory. Galison’s method of using ‘microhistories’ to explore the workings of ‘subcultures’ in science is applied to the case study of liberal socialism in interwar IR. Through this case I argue that microhistories can help us understand why certain subcultures in IR theory thrive, and others decline. This understanding in turn could help us comprehend the state of currently active subcultures in IR, and give us an alternative to the intellectually unhelpful concept of ‘paradigm’.</p>

<p>Despite recent scholarship that has cast doubt on the existence of a realist–idealist debate in interwar International Relations (IR), it is still commonly assumed within the discipline that the interwar period was dominated by two competing paradigms: realism and idealism. This division into two neat dyadic paradigms has obscured the rich variety of approaches in interwar IR, and the construction of an idealist paradigm has served as a dumping ground for the myriad theorists and experts in the period that did not seem to fit the criteria of realism. In recent years it has become accepted by many that the concept of idealist does not help us understand the nature of the debates in interwar IR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0047117811411740">1</xref></sup> What has not yet been attempted is a reappraisal of the theoretical divisions within IR at the time. There are probably two main reasons for this. First, with few exceptions, interwar IR experts tended not to give themselves theoretical labels. So there is no contemporary system of classification that we can borrow. Some, like H. N. Brailsford, called themselves socialists, others, like J. A. Hobson were proud to be liberals, but most were critical of attempts to shoehorn their ideas into theoretical boxes. This antipathy to labels can also be seen as a reaction against the then common use of terms like utopian or idealist as insults rather than descriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0047117811411740">2</xref></sup> Second, from the historian’s point of view the attempt to categorise people into paradigms often oversimplifies the theoretical relations at the time: ‘ideal types turn to stereotypes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0047117811411740">3</xref></sup> Those disciplinary historians engaged in trying to understand IR’s past naturally shy away from such oversimplification. By a post hoc creation of a paradigm we put too much stress on the similarities between writers, while grossly underplaying their differences with each other, or even their affinities with other theorists outside the designated paradigm. Thus, creating neat paradigm classifications after the fact is anachronistic and oversimplifies links and differences between theorists.</p>
<p>There is, however, a reason why we should try to classify and simplify ideas from IR’s past. One of the reasons for the survival of the concept of paradigm in IR is that, while the flaws in the use of paradigms to divide up IR thought are many, a discipline can only make sense of its form and structure by developing a cataloguing system that allows scholars to order their area of study. While it is true to say that scholarship in any discipline is never fully reducible to neat categories, recognition of that fact does not mean that we should not attempt to simplify the complexity of our discipline in order to make it accessible to undergraduates, to develop narratives about its origins and development, and understand what the relationships are between different groups of scholars. This summation can never be more than a tool, constantly open to renegotiation and debate, and as a simplification it is at its heart never more than an interpretation. Our problem is that the flaws in the concept of paradigms in IR now outweigh the advantages, as I will make clear below. While we do need simple categories to aid our understanding, the choice of the categories we use, and the form that the system of categorisation takes, need to be intellectually rigorous and constantly under review. Recently Duncan Bell has suggested an alternative system of categorisation using Peter Galison’s work in the history of science.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0047117811411740">4</xref></sup> In this article I intend to take up the challenge offered by Bell by looking at how Galison’s work could be a viable alternative to the current paradigm divisions in IR, and then apply this system to the ‘microhistory’ of the liberal socialists within interwar IR.</p>
<sec id="section1-0047117811411740">
<title>‘Paradigms’ ‘subcultures’ and ‘trading zones’</title>
<p>IR, as a field of study, overwhelmingly (but not exclusively) uses the concept of paradigms to define both its past and its present. Those that survey the current state of the field – noticeably those who write textbooks – use paradigms as a means to divide IR into discreet theoretical boxes (realism, feminism, constructivism, poststructuralism, etc.), which are often further subdivided (into classical realism, neo-realism, etc.). Until quite recently the consensus on the history of IR revolved around paradigmatic debates, especially the realist–idealist debate and the inter-paradigm debate. Both of these debate narratives required the division of the discipline into paradigms. Even after the realist–idealist debate myth was discredited,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0047117811411740">5</xref></sup> the use of realist and idealist paradigms persisted as convenient means of classifying various authors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0047117811411740">6</xref></sup> Indeed, paradigms are at the root of the understanding of IR in almost all textbooks in the English-speaking world, with the result that the student’s first experience of IR is usually learning to place different authors into different theoretical boxes. It is little wonder, therefore, that the distinction between IR paradigms cuts to the core of our understanding of IR as a field.</p>
<p>But when IR scholars use paradigms, what do they mean? They certainly do not mean it in the Kuhnian fashion (in terms of his earlier formulations found in <italic>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0047117811411740">7</xref></sup> of a dominant intellectual culture, allowing normal puzzle-solving science, that emerges after the build-up of contradictions in a previously dominant approach: first because paradigms co-exist in IR in a way more common to Kuhn’s pre-paradigmatic schools, and, second, because paradigms in IR have less to do with specific forms of scientific method or tacit knowledge, and much more to do with underlying assumptions about human action and the proper units of analysis. Put a different way, paradigms in IR do not fulfil Kuhn’s requirement of being incommensurate and incomparable ways of interpreting the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0047117811411740">8</xref></sup> Paradigm labels have sometimes worked well as centres around which communities sharing common theoretical assumptions can accumulate and develop common research goals, but the strength of their social cohesion and shared language often comes before attempts to define them as a paradigm. Neo-Gramscian and poststructuralist approaches, for example, owe their relative cohesion to their common languages. In turn these common languages link these approaches up with scholars outside IR, as much as they divide them from other scholars in IR. They often tend to be viewed as paradigms because the people who work within these approaches say that they form a distinct group. I shall return to this point later.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the division of current IR into paradigms fits with the self-images of practitioners in the field of IR. The problem comes when we apply this concept of paradigm retroactively to IR’s past, as tends to be the case in many (but not all) textbooks. Here the most common paradigmatic division is between ‘realism’ and a second less well-defined theory often called liberalism, liberal internationalism, idealism or utopianism. Over the last decade IR textbooks have kept this ‘realist’–‘idealist’ split, but have added other ‘paradigms’ as these approaches have gained some form of acceptance as distinct paradigms, although with little attempt to say why they can be called paradigms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0047117811411740">9</xref></sup> This often takes the form of grids, in which the paradigms are defined in terms of their assumptions about the study of the international. The most common dyads in this comparison are selfish human nature (realism) vs altruistic or good human nature (idealism); state-centrism (realism) vs states and others (idealism); anarchic international system (realism) vs communal international system (idealism); and national interest (realism) vs internationalism (idealism).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0047117811411740">10</xref></sup> There are two problems with this classification: (1) rather than being assumptions upon which theory is built, this classification is made up of a mixed bag of unverifiable assumptions (e.g. human nature) and findings that are the product of theoretical and experimental investigation (e.g. the nature of the international system); and (2) the eclectic nature of the definitions means that few authors fit neatly into these categories. For example, Norman Angell, often regarded as an archetypal idealist, saw human nature as basically selfish, but the ‘realist’ Morgenthau was deeply critical of the anarchical system of states. The schema also does not cater for authors – such as Lowes Dickinson, Norman Angell, Leonard Woolf, Isaiah Bowman and Halford Mackinder – who believed that the world was an anarchic system dominated by national interests, but who at the same time had a normative edge that proposed a more communal and cosmopolitan alternative (although their alternatives were rarely identical, and often diverged on key issues). Thus, the problem with this paradigmatic grid is that it fails to properly categorise and explain IR theorists. It rides roughshod over the nuances and complexities of different thinkers, while simultaneously lumping together theorists who saw themselves at odds with each other (e.g. Morgenthau and Carr; Mackinder and Morgenthau<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0047117811411740">11</xref></sup>), and separating into different watertight compartments theorists who felt that they shared something in common (e.g. Mitrany and Morgenthau<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0047117811411740">12</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>In addition to this, it bases differences on a comparison of ‘major’ texts, thus cutting the work of thinkers out of their social and political context. As a result, misreadings become common, and the idea that writers are representative of a wider ahistorical paradigm leads to what Quentin Skinner referred to as the illusion of the ‘spurious persistence’ of ideas through history that were actually much more dependent on their immediate intellectual and historical context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0047117811411740">13</xref></sup> Ernst Cassirer (using Vico) called this the ‘eternal time’ associated with myth, that stood in contrast with a more scientific historical time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0047117811411740">14</xref></sup> Thus, the concept of paradigms in IR sets up a simplistic set of divisions and commonalities that are just not there. The one advantage of the paradigm approach is that it is cheap. All it requires is a superficial comparison of major texts by those with little or no background in the analysis of those texts, their writers and the contemporary context.</p>
<p>If this was merely a flawed interpretation of a dead past then the failures of this paradigmatic division would be nothing more than a footnote in IR. Unfortunately historical narratives are rarely benign stories. In the case of the realist–idealist division in IR textbooks, this is presented not just as a spuriously persistent historical Manichaean struggle, but also as a means of understanding IR up to and including the present day. Realism and idealism become the two poles around which all IR can be understood, and non-realist paradigms as disparate as feminism, neo-functionalism and constructivism are all put into the idealist box.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0047117811411740">15</xref></sup> Even in texts where the diversity of paradigms is accepted, the categories are acknowledged as unproblematic divisions, and are given a historical background that owes more to folk memory than to historical research. Here also emerges a major reason why we need to pay more attention to proper historical research in the discussion of theory in IR: the existence of the paradigms that we use in IR are usually – in whole or in part – justified by historical narratives of one kind or another. Thus, the stories we tell about these paradigms are used as arguments for their effectiveness. As a result, historical analysis that calls these narratives into question is a form of theoretical criticism.</p>
<p>IR is in need of a more sophisticated way of presenting its past and interpreting its present. Recently Duncan Bell has suggested that a potentially fruitful approach would be to import the concepts of subculture and trading zones found in the history of science, and associated with Peter Galison’s analysis of physics and Joel Isaac’s adaptation of Galison’s method to Cold War American social sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0047117811411740">16</xref></sup> Galison’s concept of scientific subcultures, as reinterpreted by Isaac for the social sciences, comes closer to the way that the poststructuralist and various neo-Marxist ‘paradigms’ have been interpreted in IR, but are significantly at odds with the way that the realist and idealist paradigms have been constructed. It includes ideas of a shared language and narrative – something that sets poststructural and neo-Gramscian IR, for example, off from other approaches – but goes beyond this by considering more than just synergies in the written work of scholars. Subcultures are communities of scholars, and to understand how their theories are constructed and interact with other communities it is necessary to understand a wide range of interactions between these scholars (i.e. not just published material), and consequently how they construct themselves as a group. An example of this kind of analysis in IR is Nicolas Guilhot’s study of the emergence of realism in post-war America, which concentrates on the interaction between scholars in specific fora, including the role of funding agencies, while also explaining their position through an appreciation of the behavioural science that they were reacting against.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0047117811411740">17</xref></sup> Put in another way, and using the categories of Cassirer, we need to understand the symbolic universe that groups of scholars inhabited through the ‘materialisation of the spirit of a former age’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0047117811411740">18</xref></sup> The concept of subcultures allows us to do this by treating scholars as part of an interactive community.</p>
<p>Subcultures, as the prefix suggests, are not self-contained intellectual units. They need to react with other subcultures both because they are in competition with these others, and because other subcultures often have information of use to the subculture (for example, Carr’s analysis of how international order could be rebuilt after World War Two leant heavily on the functional approaches of Mary Parker Follett in business studies and David Mitrany in political science<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0047117811411740">19</xref></sup>). In order to achieve this they develop ‘trading zones’: intellectual mutually intelligible pidgin languages and specific venues where ideas and findings are exchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0047117811411740">20</xref></sup> Trading zones need not be formally constructed, and indeed within IR the role of trading zone has often been taken up by one or more scholars, who have moved between intellectual subcultures bringing with them an exchange of ideas. Thus Robert Cox’s 1981 article in <italic>Millennium</italic> opened up a trading zone that allowed a Gramscian analysis of the global.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0047117811411740">21</xref></sup> In the social sciences subcultures usually extend into more than one discipline. So, for example, feminist approaches in IR are also linked in to a wider feminist community within sociology, history and other social sciences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0047117811411740">22</xref></sup> In short, rather than constructing our view of a discipline through a catalogue of the written word that aims to divide this work into theories based on rational argument, we should see the splits in a discipline in anthropological terms. The intellectual divisions are ‘“forms of life” as much as cognitively grasped bodies of doctrine’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0047117811411740">23</xref></sup> By regarding disciplines as the site of social practices, we can identify subcultures of scholars, and use the study of these subcultures to explain the emergence of theoretical approaches and the changing form of the discipline over time. In IR terms this is what Bell referred to as histories of the global.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0047117811411740">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In IR subcultures are likely to be quite different from those in physics identified by Galison. Three key differences are: (1) that in physics the nature of the discipline dictated three different subcultures (instrument, theory and experiment), while the structure of the discipline of IR does not determine the nature or number of subcultures; (2) that in order to do good physics there was a need for all three to cooperate, while in IR there is no immediate scientific imperative to cooperate; and (3) the links beyond physics were limited, but in IR most subcultures have strong links with scholars in other fields. Consequently there is no discipline-specific constraints on the numbers of subcultures IR could support; cooperation between subcultures in IR cannot be taken for granted; and interdisciplinary ties are likely to remain a feature of the field. So what should we be looking for when we define IR subcultures? First, a subculture has its own language and lexicon of theoretical terms; second, it has a common narrative that justifies the existence of the subculture, and helps define its relationship to other subcultures; third, the scholars form a clear community where the various members actively interact with each other (via citations, postgraduate supervision, conferences, workshops, journals and book series); and fourth, it may have its own specific links outside the discipline that help define its specific area of competence, whether these are in other disciplines or in professional communities such as journalism, the diplomatic service or party politics.</p>
<p>Thus, subcultures represent the identification of a community of scholars based upon the synergies that scholars themselves regard as the mark of their immediate scholarly associates. As a result, the definitions of a subculture will change over time and between disciplines as intellectual priorities change. They are the analogue in intellectual history of the community or society in political history. The idea of subcultures conforms to recent trends in the organisation of IR scholarship. Specialist groups tied to the International Studies Association, the British International Studies Association or the European Consortium for Political Research have often played an important coordinating role in creating networks that can be defined as subcultures in many cases. Similarly, many parts of IR have found it easier to talk in terms of ‘schools’, rather than paradigms, when trying to make sense of current scholarly practice. For example, security studies has seen the emergence of the ‘Copenhagen’ and ‘Welsh’ schools that are recognisable groups of scholars organised around two particular universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0047117811411740">25</xref></sup> How scholars communicate with their immediate associates is one issue, but the need to communicate beyond their subculture creates trading zones. Trading zones represent how communication between subcultures are facilitated, and can also be the first steps towards a new field with a new intellectual language. Put another way, subcultures define the internal cohesion of a group of scholars, while trading zones chart the external contacts.</p>
<p>The study of subcultures in IR requires us to go beyond just the major published texts, and to study (as Guilhot did) archive material on conferences, funding agencies and the interactions between scholars and professionals both inside and outside of IR. In short, it requires us as IR scholars to apply the same rigour to the understanding of our discipline that historians of science apply to their work. Thus, our analysis of IR as a discipline requires experts in the history of IR to do ‘microhistories’ of specific groups of scholars in the discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0047117811411740">26</xref></sup> The subcultures approach allows us to do three things: (1) to understand the rise and decline of IR approaches throughout the history of the discipline by charting a group’s cohesion and relations with others; (2) to categorise the current communities of scholars in the discipline, as well as their different strengths and weaknesses as communities; and (3) to focus on the interaction of these subcultures via trading zones – both with other IR subcultures and with the world beyond IR – rather than stressing (as the paradigm approach does) their internal cohesion. This is not a cheap approach. It requires a cadre of scholars willing to do much detailed work in archives. In the case of more recent scholarship it would require analyses of citations, conferences, mentoring and even the collection of reliable gossip. While expensive, it represents a far more rigorous attempt to understand the history and structure of IR.</p>
<p>My argument in this article is that the subcultures approach to the history of IR is superior to the paradigm approach followed in IR textbooks because it allows us to identify the dynamic processes (embedded in social practices and scholarly communities) that lead to the birth, promotion and demise of theoretical approaches. At present, except for rather flimsy and frequently unsupported internalist (logical inconsistencies) or externalist (events that made the paradigm unpopular) arguments, IR texts on paradigm divisions offer little in the way of explanations of why these paradigms rise or fall. Part of the problem here is that the categorising of paradigms is often arbitrary. Not only are the bases of paradigm identification highly dubious, but paradigms are presented as self-contained nodules of thought, and so interactions between scholars in different paradigms are played down, while connections within paradigms are overplayed, and hence a picture emerges of intra-paradigm theoretical harmony that is often far from the truth. The mechanisms responsible for the appearance and decline of paradigms are left vague in IR textbooks, which often fall back on externalist arguments such as changes in the international system (for example, the Second World War as a cause of realism). The folkways and interactions of IR scholars are rendered invisible when we think in terms of paradigms, yet it is often in the interactions of these scholars that we can find nuanced explanations for the rise and fall of different IR theories. For example, the reason why Hans J. Morgenthau, and not Isaiah Bowman, is commonly regarded as one of the founders of IR in the United States has more to do with the formation of subcultures in post-war American academic IR than it does with any intrinsic weakness of Bowman’s theory and strength of Morgenthau’s (although this may be part of the explanation). As IR scholars it is important for us to know why some theories succeed and others do not. Just assuming that one must have been rationally stronger than the other is not enough. We need to find out what actually went on at the time, and what were the anthropological currents underpinning the intellectual debates. Reading the losers through the categories and languages of the winners also sets up an intellectual kangaroo court. We need to recreate the languages used by past subcultures in order to properly judge them (Cassirer’s point that the historian is like a linguist interpreting a symbolic universe is relevant here<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0047117811411740">27</xref></sup>). Thus, a better understanding of the processes involved in past theoretical changes in IR can help explain how current ‘live’ approaches in IR wax and wane in popularity.</p>
<p>In terms of IR’s history I would like to suggest in this article that the formation of the discipline in the early twentieth century conforms to Galison’s notion of the development of a trading zone between subcultures. The ideas that were to become central to IR in its interwar phase were already present before 1919, but they existed in discreet concepts to be found in a plethora of locations: popular journalism, law, geography, history and political activism. The major contribution of the First World War was to create a sense that the study of the international (and especially war) required collaboration and systematisation if the world was to avoid a second catastrophic conflict. Out of this emerged a ‘trading zone’, in which academics, journalists and political pamphleteers could collaborate in creating a systematic study of international order. In order to allow collaboration a pidgin language developed out of the definitions and practices found among diplomatic practitioners and in the various bodies of the League of Nations. Out of this instrumental pidgin developed more complex creoles that eventually became fully functioning academic languages that underpinned specific subcultures. By the 1930s there were a number of IR subcultures that had their own specific languages and narratives, but had also developed a common set of IR concepts that formed a recognisable pidgin. While many of these subcultures declined (becoming lumped together in future textbooks as the ‘idealists’), the language they constructed – most notably what Ashley later called the anarchy <italic>problématique</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0047117811411740">28</xref></sup> – set the parameters for the study of IR from the 1950s onwards. As a result, IR exhibits what in historical geography would be called sequent occupance. The patterns of (intellectual) occupation laid down by interwar IR scholars survived into post-war IR, in spite of the change in (theoretical) culture. Thus, what we, as a discipline, are now is a product of specific developments that occurred in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Galison’s approach to the history of science involves the exploration of what he refers to as microhistories. Microhistories concentrate on a deep understanding of a particular scientific community in order to build up an understanding of more general currents: ‘a display through <italic>particular</italic> detail of something <italic>general</italic>, something more than itself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0047117811411740">29</xref></sup> This approach stands in marked contrast to Thomas Kuhn’s earlier work on the history of science (and particularly with common perceptions of the argument in <italic>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</italic>), which attempted to construct a self-contained macrohistory of science at any one time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0047117811411740">30</xref></sup> It does, however, share more in common with Kuhn’s later interpretations of scientific change and theory choice, where he delves into scientific language and the nature of decisions made by smaller groups of individual scientists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0047117811411740">31</xref></sup> I argue that we can develop a better understanding of the development of IR through the writing of many microhistories based around specific subcultures. Given that one of our goals should be to understand how approaches to IR fail, the histories of abandoned approaches become just as important as the histories of the successful ones. Accordingly, I have chosen as my case study a micro-history of a subculture that has gone through a full life-cycle, rather than an existing one. In the rest of this article I apply Galison’s approach, suitably modified by Isaac, to an understanding of the rise and decline of the liberal-socialist approach to IR associated with such writers as Angell, Woolf, Noel-Baker and Hugh Dalton.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0047117811411740">
<title>The liberal-socialist ‘subculture’ in interwar IR</title>
<p>Although the term liberal socialist does not roll off the tongue as easily as realism or idealism, I have chosen it for four reasons. First, liberal socialist was not an unknown term at the time, and writers on domestic affairs that had moved from the Liberal Party to Labour after 1918, such as L. T. Hobhouse, often used it to describe themselves. Second, it emphasises their intellectual affinity with earlier liberal writers, while underscoring the more radical take that they had developed on matters related to the capitalist system and the class divisions under capitalism. Third, the views of the group discussed below fit with Michael Freeden’s definitions of liberal and socialist ideologies. They subscribe to what Freeden calls the ‘Millite core’ of the liberal grand project that places liberty as the central political virtue, and then links it to ideas of both individualism and progress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0047117811411740">32</xref></sup> This liberal approach is filled out by key socialist core concepts such as the social embeddedness of humanity, the importance of welfare (through the welfare state), and the ultimate goal of equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0047117811411740">33</xref></sup> Finally, the liberal epithet demonstrates the distance that existed between their views of international affairs and other socialists. There was clear blue water between them and Stafford Cripps’ brand of socialism, which denounced the League as an international burglars’ union,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0047117811411740">34</xref></sup> on the one hand, and Leninist conceptions of foreign affairs on the other. While clearly an overtly socialist paradigm, the liberal socialists had arrived at their socialist position via liberal ideas of freedom, equality and the rule of law. They were keen to abolish war, capitalism and the rank unfairness of twentieth-century global life, but the route to be taken was via a system of global institutions that would encompass pooled security, decolonisation and democratisation. Ironically, their prescriptions for international politics often involved far less change to the system of states than did the plans of those who remained outside socialist politics, such as Gilbert Murray.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0047117811411740">35</xref></sup> Far from being utopians – giving more attention to building future worlds than to understanding the mechanics of this one – the liberal-socialist prescriptions were often heavily influenced by what was achievable in the already existing international system. This points to one possible externalist reason for their decline: the extent to which their ideas were designed for a specific global situation that had, by 1945, changed dramatically. I will discuss this in more detail in the conclusion.</p>
<p>So what was it that the liberal socialists shared that allowed them to form a scholarly community? First, and at a very basic level, they shared venues for their ideas. They published in the same periodicals (<italic>Foreign Affairs</italic>, <italic>New Leader</italic>, <italic>Time and Tide</italic>, <italic>Headway, Political Quarterly</italic>), read each other’s books, spoke at the same venues, and were members of the same organisations (League of Nations Union, Fabian Society, Union of Democratic Control), and were usually associated with the Labour Party and its committee structure. Second, they shared a common language and conception of what made for a good argument. At a basic level this involved a common understanding of the meanings of certain words and phrases such as ‘international government’ or ‘disarmament’ that are at odds with current definitions in mainstream IR (which accounts for much of the confusion about what these people stood for in modern IR texts, and even some modern histories<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0047117811411740">36</xref></sup>). They also share broad theoretical assumptions such as the ultimate interconnectedness of politics and economics; the irreversibility of the processes that had produced the common global economy of the late nineteenth century; the view that all politics was a collision between irrational emotive forces and the rational intellect; the connection between the development of capitalism and the modern nation state; and the link between the demise of capitalism and the attainment of a stable pacific international order. What also helps to make them invisible to modern IR scholars is that the majority had no university affiliations, and much of their work is found in documents and arenas not associated with scholarly work today, such as memoranda, political pamphlets and published speeches (in addition to books and articles). Thus, in order to understand this group we need to accept forms of knowledge dissemination that are given less consideration by IR scholars now. The work of these authors also had a different set of priorities from current IR scholars. As practitioners as well as observers of international politics they were less concerned with modelling and theoretical debate than they were with addressing specific issues within the context of the rapidly changing international situation. As a result, with a few exceptions (perhaps the biggest being David Mitrany), they rarely engaged in theoretical debates within their ranks, but rather debate focused on interpretations of recent events. Consequently much of their writing can come across as theoretically naïve by modern standards, and the richness of their analysis of current affairs is lost on a modern audience that now views these events as history. This said, what they lost in intellectual rigour they gained in contemporary relevance and access to policy-making circles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0047117811411740">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps another reason for the concentration on the analysis of current events at the expense of theory was that these writers came from different intellectual and professional backgrounds that had different theoretical and literary conventions. Among those with a firm academic background Philip Noel-Baker came from law, Hugh Dalton from economics, Alfred Zimmern from classics and David Mitrany from political science. Others had a professional background: J. A. Hobson, Norman Angell and H. N. Brailsford were journalists and Leonard Woolf started in the imperial civil service. While it is clear from their Labour Party Advisory Committee work that they had developed a common language by which to understand the world, they were still at the early stages of synthesising a clear theoretical framework. Even then, as I will discuss below, they were beginning to put down firm theoretical roots, notwithstanding the lack of any precedent for a specifically international theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0047117811411740">38</xref></sup> Despite the lack of a rich vein of international theory, the international was not completely devoid of theory. J. A. Hobson’s economics informed many, including crucially H. N. Brailsford (although this was a source of friction with Norman Angell).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0047117811411740">39</xref></sup> Perhaps more importantly G. Lowes Dickinson’s ideas on international anarchy influenced all the major liberal socialists, giving them a baseline understanding of the operations of the international system in the absence of proper institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0047117811411740">40</xref></sup> Having said this, the synthesis of a clear theory to underpin the subculture was at an early stage. The liberal socialists were a subculture that had only just emerged from a trading zone formed as a result of the perceived failings of the international system in the years before 1914. To expect them to have developed a full-grown theoretical corpus to rival domestic politics is to demand too much.</p>
<p>These attributes that mark the liberal socialists out as a separate subculture in interwar IR stand out in sharp contrast to how paradigms are usually defined in IR textbooks. Paradigms in IR are usually associated with common ideas that are the result of reasoning, rather than shared attributes that make common reasoning possible. Thus paradigms are defined by common outcomes of thought (state-centrism, definitions of human nature, conceptions of power), rather than by a shared intellectual context (common language, venues and basic theoretical assumptions). Therefore, defining a subculture is subtly different from defining a paradigm. A subculture is defined by a non-rational prior social context, while a paradigm is defined by common outcomes from theorising the international. It is possible to be a member of a subculture, yet disagree with other members on theoretical outcomes. Thus Kenneth Waltz and Hans Morgenthau could be in the same theoretical subculture, and yet have very different views on the importance of human nature arguments to IR.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0047117811411740">41</xref></sup> What distinguishes grouping thinkers by theoretical subcultures from grouping them by paradigms is the concentration on the prior context of the group, rather than the common outcomes of their thought. Subcultures, therefore, tend to be looser social groups united by non-rational contexts, and therefore can incorporate a wider set of differing opinions among a group with shared language and values, while paradigms concentrate on rationally defined outcomes of thought that are often too narrow to encase some thinkers in their entirety – hence Morgenthau’s problematic relationship with the realist paradigm, and the ease with which the work of some writers such as G. Lowes Dickinson can fit into a realist paradigm, even when their other works put them outside realism.</p>
<p>This is not to say that there were no common outcomes that we can use to help us frame liberal-socialist IR during this period. It is rather that these core outcomes were the matter around which much of the argument and discussion revolved, and so were never fully resolved, and were rarely a source of full consensus. What made this group a recognisable subculture was a shared language, contact and broad outlook on international affairs. These orbited around common understandings of the three key concepts of security/sanctions, disarmament and arbitration within a system of pooled security. The relationship between these concepts will be discussed in more detail below. While these common concepts often led to shared core views of the international, this did not mean that there was broad agreement on the relative importance or the nature of these criteria. Having said this we can isolate four views that emerge from the liberal-socialist debates: (1) the ultimate point of studying International Relations was to abolish it as a separate sphere by introducing the norms of domestic politics into the international. While the state as an institution need not be abolished, the concept of national sovereignty was at the root of many of the problems of international coordination. National sovereignty was behind the unstable international anarchy, and while the principles of international anarchy might have been applicable to an earlier less interdependent era, they were dangerous in the changed conditions of the modern world. (2) This meant that the main immediate need was for the establishment of the rule of law (although with provisions to prevent this law becoming the tool of supporters of the status quo) and the proper international political institutions to manage that law and give it force. (3) This could be established through international agreements, and the impetus for these agreements would be international common interests in peace and prosperity. An exclusive nationalism was the major impediment to realising this, as well as vested (often capitalist) interests that profited from the state. (4) The success of these agreements could only be based on very precise and accurate information about the nature of the international system as a whole, as well as knowledge of the myriad specific disputes and issues that dog international relations.</p>
<p>The main writers in this subculture that accepted these four points were Leonard Woolf, Norman Angell, Philip Noel-Baker and Hugh Dalton. Others, such as David Mitrany, H. N. Brailsford, J. A. Hobson and Alfred Zimmern, buy into most of these core views, but have reservations about certain aspects. For example, Mitrany would be in accord with (1) and (4), but he would have seen (2) as a longer-term goal, and (3) as unobtainable and naïve. Brailsford would have agreed with (1) and (2) up to a point, but would have given a greater prominence to what he saw as the ultimate problem of the failings of capitalism. He would have agreed with (3), with the added protocol that this would be most likely among democratic socialist states, and he would have had little problem with (4). Thus, the liberal-socialist subculture clearly has fuzzy boundaries, although it was centred largely in Britain, and its influence on the United States was limited to its transmission through such transatlantic writers as Norman Angell and David Mitrany. In Britain it was mainly associated with the Labour Party, and a large number of its thinkers were members at one time or another of the Labour Party Advisory Committee on International Questions. This Advisory Committee acted as one of the key venues for these writers. In fact, the writing, distribution and discussion of Advisory Committee memos served as one of the major ways that this group kept in close intellectual contact. The Advisory Committee also brought these writers into regular contact with another branch of Labour thought on international affairs: the stricter pacifists such as C. R. Buxton, Helena Swanwick and Arthur Ponsonby.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0047117811411740">42</xref></sup> These strong pacifists were opposed to the second of the liberal-socialist core views, although they shared some (but not all) of the liberal-socialist language. While they often supported the establishment of international institutions like the League, they were opposed to any use of force, even in the name of the League.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0047117811411740">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the 1919 peace both the liberal socialists and the strict pacifists worked together in denouncing the treaties and the League Covenant, but after 1923 they tended to find themselves on opposite sides of key foreign policy debates, and disagreed over key concepts such as the definition of aggressors or the nature of pooled security. In 1924 the liberal socialists supported the Geneva protocol, while the strict pacifists opposed it; in 1925 they again split over Locarno, with the liberal socialists eventually throwing their weight behind the Treaty; and after 1936 they divided over rearmament, with the liberal socialists supporting the idea in principle, although criticising the National Government for its handling of the issue. Returning to Galison’s concept of theoretical subcultures, the relationship between liberal socialism and strict pacifism can be seen as a ‘trading zone’ between subcultures. They developed a means of communication between each other, but remained fundamentally two groups speaking different intellectual languages. In language terms there were splits over the meaning of disarmament, as well as concepts key to the liberal-socialist conception of pooled security such as the notion of aggressor. This can be seen most clearly in Helena Swanwick’s criticism of collective security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0047117811411740">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the next section I explore the liberal-socialist articulation of the necessary conditions for an international security regime based upon international institutions. This informed both liberal socialists’ early condemnations of the League Covenant as too conservative (here Noel-Baker is sometimes an exception), and their later advocacy of the League with the proviso that certain major reforms were carried out to fill the so-called gaps in the Covenant. Central to their conception of a properly functioning pooled security system were the interrelated ideas of arbitration, sanctions (or ‘security’) and disarmament. The successful implementation of all three of these was seen as crucial for the success of collective security (or ‘pooled security’, as it was called prior to the mid 1930s).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0047117811411740">45</xref></sup> Fail in one of these areas and the League system of security would not function. Indeed, even strong advocates of the League, such as Noel-Baker, warned that if the gaps in the Covenant were not closed during the ‘good times’ of the 1920s, then pooled security would not survive a major international crisis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0047117811411740">46</xref></sup> Having reconstructed the core conception of the international system in liberal socialism, I will then lay out some arguments that explain why they declined after 1945, indicating where their ideas have survived in later IR.</p>
<p>As a subculture that combined elements of the old radical liberal criticism of foreign policy and the newer socialist internationalism that was critical of capitalism, the liberal-socialist paradigm did tend to split into liberal and socialist wings during times of intense crisis. While clearly sharing a common language and set of assumptions, the stress given to aspects of theses assumptions varied. Those of a more liberal bent, such as Norman Angell or Philip Noel-Baker, tended to stress the liberal preoccupation with establishing international institutions that could stabilise the international anarchy. By contrast, H. N. Brailsford and Harold Laski were suspicious of international organisations and agreements that did not also address the problem of capitalist exploitation. While all opposed both international anarchy and unfettered capitalism, they were divided over which of the two were the major threat to world peace. At key moments in the interwar period, but particularly after the <italic>annus horribilis</italic> of 1931 – when the full force of the economic crisis struck, Labour lost power and Japan took over Manchuria – this split rose to the surface and manifested itself as a public foreign policy debate. Yet underlying this split was a commonly accepted language that allowed agreement on the important interconnected concepts of arbitration, security and disarmament.</p>

<title>International security through arbitration–sanctions–disarmament</title>
<p>Part of the problem with assessing liberal-socialist approaches to international security in the interwar period is that the issue of security was framed in a different way from later Cold War interpretations. Many later analyses of the security concerns of the liberal socialists have tried to superimpose liberal-socialist views onto a realist framework, and thus they have failed to explore properly the nature and logic of the collective security proposed by people such as Angell, Dalton, Noel-Baker or Woolf.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0047117811411740">47</xref></sup> Part of the reason for this is that the period of the 1920s, when most of the liberal socialists wrote on the problems of pooled security, is still interpreted by IR scholars through the prism of the 1930s. A world prior to the dislocations caused by the 1931 economic collapse, the invasion of Manchuria, the Abyssinian war and the new aggressive German foreign policy after 1936, is judged on terms that are not its own. Another reason is that those who criticised interwar pooled security after 1945 were not interested in understanding liberal and socialist alternatives to the balance of power, but were rather using collective security to stake out a new balance of power dominated approach to security. Arguments for collective security were, therefore, not there to be understood, but rather to be used as demonstrations of a failed rationalist path.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0047117811411740">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The important point about liberal-socialist analyses of international security is that, rather than ignoring the realist view of security as a zero-sum game, they accepted it as one of many possible security realities. A world of competing military powers, acting under the logic of the balance of power was, for liberal socialists like Angell, Woolf and Noel-Baker, the logical result of a world that failed to build effective international security institutions. The problem with the balance of power was, as Morgenthau would concur in the 1950s, that it was inherently unstable. It was also no longer workable in a modern and interdependent global society. Despite initial misgivings about the League, its Covenant, and the 1919 peace treaties in general, the liberal socialists saw the League as the only substantial international organisation, and hence the most likely institution upon which some form of collective security to guarantee international peace could be built. The League was, therefore, central to their policy prescriptions at the time, but was not necessarily vital to their overall worldview. If the League proved itself to be no longer up to the job, then many liberal socialists were prepared to abandon the immediate institutions of the League, while still supporting the idea of League-like institutions. Liberal-socialist interpretations of collective security revolved around two key points. The first was that the League itself in the 1920s was still not ready to take up its role as a full fledged pooled security system. There were serious gaps in the Covenant of the League that would have to be filled first. The second point was that a successful pooled security system would have to combine three interlocking elements to work effectively in a world of states. These were: an effective and workable system of arbitration between states; a properly functioning system of sanctions to make the arbitration system believable; and widespread disarmament to lessen the effectiveness and promise of aggressive war. Arbitration–sanctions–disarmament formed a ‘wonderful trinity’, each one of the three helping to reinforce the other two. If, however, one of these three proved weak and ineffective, then the viability of the other two would be called into question. In this section I will first look at the reasons why liberal socialists attacked the League, and then analyse their suggestions for closing the collective security ‘gaps’ in the League in order to develop a viable arbitration–sanctions–disarmament regime. Finally, I will look at how they reacted to the failure of pooled security after 1931. This analysis will, in turn help to separate what the liberal socialists saw as time-bound expedient policies, and what they held to be their main theoretical understanding of international security.</p>
<p>The liberal-socialist approach to security developed out of a sustained criticism of the way that the League was currently constructed. With the exception of Brailsford’s 1920 jeremiad against the League,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0047117811411740">49</xref></sup> little of the flavour of the debate within liberal socialism over the future of the League is captured in print. Rather, the best sources for this come in the exchanges in Labour Party memoranda, speeches and private correspondence between the members of the group. Memoranda remained a safer vehicle for ideas on the League since all the liberal socialists remained committed to the League idea, but in Britain before 1924 it was difficult to publicly support the League Covenant and maintain your credentials as a left-winger. Here we see the limits of using printed matter alone to understand a group of scholars. As a form of public face print often obscures conflicts or positions that the scholar does not want on public display.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0047117811411740">50</xref></sup> The memoranda of the Advisory Committee allowed free rein for the criticism of the Covenant while also providing a space for constructive support for the League and League reform at a time when public endorsement of the 1919 peace was still a political liability on the left. A series of memoranda laid the foundations of what would become the liberal-socialist formulation of the pooled security alternative to the international anarchy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0047117811411740">51</xref></sup> The conversation contained within these memoranda criticised the League for continuing the anarchic system of states, but also recognised that it was highly unlikely that there was a will to dramatically renegotiate the Covenant. Indeed, any renegotiation would likely reduce, rather than increase, the power of the League.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0047117811411740">52</xref></sup> Instead, their attention turned to the creation of a pooled security system out of the existing Covenant in an exercise that became know as ‘closing the gaps in the Covenant’. The Covenant remained vague on how states were to deal with aggression.</p>
<p>The development of an effective pooled security based on arbitration, sanctions and disarmament was seen as a necessary alternative to the war-prone international anarchy that had been the main cause of the Great War. By the 1920s there was already a history of successful arbitration on a bilateral basis, and the machinery existed for the settlement of simple judicial disputes in the Permanent Court of International Justice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0047117811411740">53</xref></sup> Support for arbitration as a means of avoiding war was tinged with a concern for the natural conservatism of legal formulae, and Leonard Woolf was an early advocate of turning over many non-legal disputes to international conferences instead, since the legal machinery was incapable of dealing with primarily political problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0047117811411740">54</xref></sup> Realisation of the complexities of international disputes, tempered by the success of bilateral arbitration treaties, led Arnold-Forster and Woolf to draw up a plan for the development of an arbitration and conciliation system under League auspices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0047117811411740">55</xref></sup> It was, however, recognised that no arbitration regime would be fully workable without a system of internationally agreed sanctions that could prevent states opting out, or resorting to war rather than go through a system of international conciliation. Drawing an analogy from domestic politics, Hugh Dalton argued that all successful legal systems required the threat of coercive action, while David Mitrany insisted that arbitration would lead ‘a precarious existence’ without some means to enforce it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0047117811411740">56</xref></sup> Discussions of sanctions were tempered by a realisation that, while necessary, there was strong opposition from the public and government in many states to the use of military force, and consequently weaker economic sanctions (required under the Covenant anyway) might be all that was available to the League.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0047117811411740">57</xref></sup> Yet a strict sanctions regime under the League and guaranteed by all the major League powers was seen by France and many of the minor powers as a precondition for the establishment of a disarmament regime under League auspices. Disarmament in this context referred to a reduction of arms to a level consistent with League membership (that is, that allowed a state to still participate in the deterring of an aggressor). Liberal socialists were well aware that armaments and arms races could exacerbate tensions by breeding insecurity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0047117811411740">58</xref></sup> Disarmament agreements could help ease tensions, as well as saving state resources for other purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0047117811411740">59</xref></sup> Thus disarmament, by making aggressive war less likely, would reinforce arbitration, while arbitration needed to be guaranteed by sanctions that, in turn, would allow for states to confidently agree to a common disarmament regime.</p>
<p>While this triad of arbitration, sanctions and disarmament remained the goal of liberal-socialist work on the League, there remained widespread concern that there were forces that would not allow this system to be established – or, if established, to work. Mitrany doubted that there was the will among states, while Woolf was concerned that the system would be too wedded to the status quo, and Brailsford was suspicious of a system that did not deal with the wider inequities of capitalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0047117811411740">60</xref></sup> Yet this proposed pooled security system bears all the hallmarks of a social democratic answer to the problem of society. Far from ignoring capitalism, it represented part of a classic social democratic tactic codified for the Second International in the Branting Declaration of 1919: the need to establish a stable democratic shell state first in order to create the environment conducive to the development of a mature democratic socialism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0047117811411740">61</xref></sup> In this sense solving the security problem via the League was seen as a necessary step prior to dealing with the social and economic unfairness of capitalism. While there were arguments about the question of when the problems of capitalism should be dealt with – with Brailsford at one extreme believing that without an early confrontation capitalists would do their best to undo the gains made in the security field, and Angell at the other seeing many capitalists as potential allies in the campaign against war<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0047117811411740">62</xref></sup> – these arguments both divided the liberal socialists and defined them as a subculture through the development of a common language and through agreed venues for the discussion of the issues.</p>
<p>A further debate between liberal socialists developed after 1936. With the League powers being seen to cave in to fascist aggression in Manchuria and Abyssinia, Angell and Woolf led a group who advocated a temporary abandonment of a League-based policy in favour of an Anglo-French confrontation with the dictators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0047117811411740">63</xref></sup> Others, such as Philip Noel-Baker, were more adamant that the League structures should be the main focus of action against fascism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0047117811411740">64</xref></sup> Angell and Woolf’s position was consistent with the liberal-socialist view of the international anarchy as a sub-standard equilibrium in the relation of states if the international security machinery was not properly developed or maintained. In the absence of an effective League system the only alternative seemed to be to advocate a more robust British and French response to aggression. The fact that socialists and trades unionists were among the early victims of fascism also helped to galvanise widespread Labour Party support for this position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0047117811411740">65</xref></sup> While external events had triggered this split, they also resolved them. The German <italic>Anschluss</italic> with Austria and the Munich Agreement once more brought the liberal socialists into a consensus, this time to support British and French rearmament (and resistance to further fascist aggression) outside League collective security. Although triggered by external events, the split and its resolution were the product of the specific nature of liberal socialism. Support for the idea of the League was matched by an appreciation of what the world would be like without international machinery. The liberal socialists appreciated that policy under an international anarchy required a different logic and set of behaviours from one that relied on pooled security institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0047117811411740">66</xref></sup> Borrowed from Dickinson’s <italic>European Anarchy</italic>, this common approach left open the question of when one logic slipped into another, which explained the split. In addition to this, the gradual lining-up with the wider anti-appeasement coalition in Britain from 1931 to 1938 led to the necessity for a trading zone where the liberal socialists and other groups (particularly anti-appeasement Conservatives such as Leo Amery and Winston Churchill) could forge a common position. The narrower patriotic concerns of other anti-appeasers sat poorly with the internationalism of the liberal socialists, but the distance between the two was frequently ameliorated by figures such as Lord Cecil (a Conservative and an internationalist), who helped forge a lowest common denominator position that eventually fed into the 1940–5 Churchill coalition government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0047117811411740">67</xref></sup> Two key liberal-socialist writers – Hugh Dalton and Noel-Baker – were cabinet members in the coalition.</p>

<title>So what happened to the liberal socialists?</title>
<p>Earlier I mentioned that one of the advantages of a subculture approach is that it can provide us with microhistories that give an understanding of how subcultures develop and decline. The current paradigm approach in IR is particularly poor at understanding how a particular school of thought drops out of favour, and I argue that subculture microhistories are far better at accounting for the end of schools of thought. At present we rely on a circular argument for the disappearance of IR schools of thought: they disappeared, so they must have been faulty in their internal logic (an internalist explanation) and/or in their ability to explain current events (an externalist explanation); therefore they disappeared because they were faulty. While internal and external logics can be important reasons, IR theory itself rarely bothers to investigate whether these are the primary causes. A proper understanding for the decline and demise of a school of thought requires a detailed microhistory that covers both rational intellectual reasons and non-rational causes.</p>
<p>The decline of liberal socialism has to be seen as a complex process involving a mix of explanations. One of the long-term flaws in the subculture was one of its short-term strengths in the post-1919 debates on foreign policy: their strong commitment to answering immediate concerns at the expense of developing a wider abstract theory of IR. It is not that they did not have a theory, but rather that their energy was directed at answering immediate concerns. The very links to policy circles that gave them their influence in the interwar period also made much of their writing of mere antiquarian interest after 1945. Noel-Baker’s work on disarmament, for example, was a detailed set of studies that was designed to answer specific questions within the context of League politics before 1933.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0047117811411740">68</xref></sup> Brailsford’s biographer also blamed the topicality of Brailsford’s ideas for his marginalisation after his death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0047117811411740">69</xref></sup> Yet this explanation cannot completely explain the subculture’s decline. After all, there was still a body of liberal-socialist theory in IR, and the subculture had met change before and responded to it. Indeed, Mitrany’s writing during the Second World War had opened up a whole new theoretical and policy debate on international government, while Woolf, Angell, Noel-Baker and Brailsford were active participants in the debates on the future shape of the United Nations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0047117811411740">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>No microhistory of liberal socialism would be complete without a recognition of the major non-rational changes that occurred after 1945. Three in particular contributed to the marginalisation of liberal socialism. First, the focus of academic debate on IR in Britain followed United States practice in shifting to the universities away from journalism and party politics. While some of the liberal socialists had held university positions, only one – David Mitrany – was university-based after the war. Interestingly, the shift to the universities led to a far more conservative IR community centred on such university-based scholars as Charles Manning and what would later be called the English School with its links to the diplomatic service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0047117811411740">71</xref></sup> Second, the dominant position of the American universities in the development of post-1945 IR further marginalised the liberal socialists, as now they were a marginal group in an increasingly less important Britain. Liberal socialism had had links with US scholars such as Shotwell, but was otherwise not represented. Third, changes in the Labour Party removed one of the main venues for liberal-socialist interaction. With the prospects of playing a dominant role in post-war British life, the Labour Party decided to close down the Advisory Committee on International Questions in favour of a more controlled and ad hoc system of advisors on international affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0047117811411740">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, that part of liberal socialism that survived into post-1950 academic IR was the branch that had bucked the above trends through the person of David Mitrany. Mitrany had not neglected the development of a clear theory of IR, and had in fact rejuvenated the theoretical debates by his functional approach developed between 1933 and 1944.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0047117811411740">73</xref></sup> In addition, he had remained in the university system, had worked in the United States and had by 1931 ceased to rely on the Labour Party as the main vehicle for the discussion of his ideas. He also mentored a new generation of IR scholars in the shape of Paul Taylor, John Groom, Charles Pentland, Robert Boardman and James Patrick Sewell. He was also an influence on the neo-functionalism that helped found EU studies on both sides of the Atlantic, although Mitrany was at pains to put distance between himself and the neo-functionalists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0047117811411740">74</xref></sup> This rejuvenating function, manifest after 1945 through mentoring postgraduate students and co-optation of other academics, is vital to the survival of a subculture, and only Mitrany engaged in this activity in any consistent and sustained way after 1945. Thus the functional approach that came to full flowering in the 1970s – and was even praised by Hans J. Morgenthau in 1966<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0047117811411740">75</xref></sup> – stands as the most vibrant successor subculture of the by then defunct liberal socialism. Although Angell, Woolf and Noel-Baker continued to write in the three decades following the war, their influence on academic IR remained at best marginal, even as they continued to draw large crowds in popular venues outside academia. Instead their works remained largely unread in IR until their rediscovery by historians of the field in the 1990s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0047117811411740">76</xref></sup></p>

<title>Using subcultures and microhistories in IR</title>
<p>Reconstructing a microhistory of the liberal-socialist subculture in early IR helps to illuminate three issues in the history of the field. First, it helps us understand the nature of the origins of the field. Liberal socialism started as part of the multidisciplinary trading zone that would eventually become IR, and consequently played a major part in the formation of the language and subject matter of the field. Second, it shows how a scholarly community develops, with specific focus on the venues used by that community, and how the flow of their arguments is influenced by current events while still being rooted in common conceptions and world-views. Third, it underscores the kind of conditions that bring about the decline (and survival) of a subculture. In the case of liberal socialism its decline can be traced to both external causes (especially IR’s shift to the universities and to the United States, and the change in Labour Party structures), and to underlying weaknesses (the heavy reliance on policy relevance and the failure to reproduce itself through the mentoring of new recruits and postgraduate students in the universities). A microhistory approach can provide a richer and more satisfying interpretation of the decline of liberal socialism, while also explaining why David Mitrany’s ideas survived well into the post-war world.</p>
<p>Since historical narratives play an important role in the justification of current theories in IR, microhistories can help us to challenge current interpretations of theory in IR. Yet Galison’s approach to the history of science can offer much more than just a better appreciation of past subcultures. As a method for understanding science it can also be applied to current approaches to the subject. A clearer appreciation of how communities of IR scholars share venues, cite each other, and reproduce their subcultures through postgraduate training and mentoring would go a long way to explaining many of the theoretical trends within current IR.</p>
<p>One possible objection to the use of Galison’s approach is that it would merely replace one set of anachronistic concepts with another equally anachronistic set. I have two responses to this. First, we should not be afraid of using anachronisms in historical research, as long as we are aware that they are not the categories that would be used at the time. Thus, the concepts of Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages have given pre-historians a valuable loose set of categories; while the nineteenth-century term ‘feudal’ has provided historians with a ready means of distinguishing a particular form of society. Anachronisms may also reflect hindsight unavailable in past times. For example, it can be argued that Grotius is the ‘father’ of modern international law, but Grotius himself could not have foreseen this, and therefore did not see himself in this role. This is an anachronistic label we tie to Grotius, but it is not invalidated by being anachronistic per se. We use anachronistic concepts all the time to help us make sense of a past that had little need to define what it saw as the realities of its everyday life. The important thing, though, is that we see these anachronisms as tools to help our own understanding of complex social realities, not as givens. Second, while the paradigm approach favoured in IR textbooks assumes that past thinkers form communities of scholars based on shared assumptions, the subcultures approach makes no such assumption. Rather, it is merely a tool to delimit a group using their proximity, which then can be studied in detail using more historically rigorous tools. Paradigms are presented as the end point of understanding the nature of IR thought: the classification of subcultures is merely the first step, and it is a first step that is always tentative and open to revision as a result of deeper historical analysis. In this sense, the subcultures approach makes a space for a less anachronistic approach, even though the actual categories themselves are an anachronism.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the subcultures approach is that it is time-consuming and requires much detailed analysis through archival visits and historical research. It involves us going beyond published texts (especially those that we now associate with academic success such as articles and monographs) to explore unpublished sources, including correspondence. We will also need to analyse relationships with scholarly bodies, funding agencies and links to practitioners such as diplomatic and party political contacts. Yet, when has the difficulty of a subject of study invalidated it as a bone fide object for inquiry? The major advantage of the paradigm approach currently employed is that it only requires a superficial understanding of a few major texts, and that this can be carried out by any interested party without any appreciation of how to judge and assess the context of a text. This strength, of course, is also its weakness. The paradigm divisions that are routinely reproduced, especially in textbooks, may have the advantage of parsimony, but they also have the disadvantage of having little to do with the theories that they attempt to categorise. Their relation to the complexities of IR theory is akin to the relationship between the Arthurian legends and sixth-century Britain: using paradigms causes the student to have a very partial and dogmatic view of both past and current theories of IR. More detailed microhistories of IR subcultures can form the basis of more nuanced histories of international thought. This is a two-step process. First, historians of international thought need to write microhistories based on their understanding of the mass of information available. Second, the findings of these microhistories need to be synthesised into a broader history of the field. Since these microhistories will always be open to reinterpretation, the broader history of IR itself will also be forever built on shifting foundations. While we lose simplicity and rigidity, we will gain a richer appreciation of the historical development of our own subject, which in turn will go a long way towards a better understanding of the form of the discipline at the present moment.</p>

<p>John T. Rourke’s highly successful textbook, for example, began with a table listing just realism and idealism, but has now added a third ‘catch-all’ paradigm: constructivism. John T.

<p>A good example of this can be found in David Mitrany’s response to the second edition of Georg Schwarzenberger’s <italic>Power Politics</italic>. In January 1952 <italic>International Affairs</italic> published Mitrany’s non-committal and polite review of the book. After finishing the review in September 1951, Mitrany wrote to A. P. Wadsworth of the <italic>Manchester Guardian</italic> saying that Schwarzenberger ‘is a slimy little Germanic worm and I don’t know who pays for or buys this kind of book’. The letter reveals what the review could not. DM to APW, 15 September 1951, 338/1/122 Manchester Guardian Archive, John Rylands Library, Manchester University, UK.</p>
