<p>People all over the planet are making music in their communities. From places of worship to prisons, to universities, individuals of all ages and backgrounds are finding opportunities to share musical experiences. The formal and informal ensembles described—both vocal and instrumental—are often led by inspired and exceptionally hardworking individuals, many of whom are also school or private music educators.</p>
<p>With the participation of more than fifty musician educators, the authors of <italic>Community Music Today</italic> explore community music worldwide, including efforts by individuals to reach out to marginalized groups (e.g., those in hospitals and institutions). Areas described include South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, Brazil, East Asia, the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and North America. Topics such as intergenerational learning and lifelong learning are a part of many of the chapters.</p>
<p>Digital communities are also part of this discussion. A chapter on community music resources lists books, journals, project reports, research reports, websites, networks, governmental and nongovernmental agencies, and organizations that support the arts, especially music in many regions of the world.</p>
<p>The book explores issues of social justice and art while asking readers to consider “What is community music?” Those who help make music happen in the contexts described range from musicians and teachers to researchers and activists, and all make a difference to the quality of life in their immediate areas.</p>

<title>Teaching Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Step-by-Step Guide for Educators</title>
<fig id="fig2-0027432112474419" position="float">
<caption><p>by Roger Pierangelo and George Giuliani. New York: Skyhorse Publishing, 2012; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.skyhorsepublishing.com">www.skyhorsepublishing.com</ext-link></p></caption>

<p>According to Roger Pierangelo and George Giulinai, authors of <italic>Teaching Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders</italic>, “Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD] is a developmental disorder of neurobiological origin that can have lifelong effects on social interaction, ability to communicate ideas and feelings, imagination, and establishment of relationships.” Recent research indicates that as many as one in eighty-eight children in the United States may be affected by ASD.</p>
<p>A user-friendly book, this collection of articles summarizes current research and offers an overview of how to teach students with ASD. The authors discuss a number of intervention strategies that can help children with ASD learn and interact with peers. Topics include specific instructional approaches, collaborating with parents, classroom management, and psychologically based intervention models.</p>
<p>As music educators are challenged to more effectively reach their students with ASD, this book can help them support their students as they strive to develop independence and overcome their fears. Specific examples present solutions to problems that commonly arise with students having ASD, and many of the suggestions and tips are useful for teaching all students, not just those ASD issues. (The language of the book is generally positive, but many readers will prefer the term <italic>intellectual disability</italic> to “mental retardation,” an expression that U.S. federal language eliminated in 2010 at the request of <bold>Rosa</bold> Marcellino, the girl for whom Rosa’s Law is named.)</p>
<p>The authors of <italic>Teaching Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders</italic> share an important caveat on page 30: “Various conditions may be mistaken for ASD and vice versa. ASD can also coexist with other disorders.” It’s important for parents and teachers to have a medical diagnosis of a student’s condition and to never make assumptions. The music educator, ideally, is part of a team of professionals.</p>

<p>Until there’s a computer and an Internet connection in every classroom, certain printed items (e.g., dictionaries, calendars, and posted schedules) serve as important references. Possibly derived from the Spanish-Arabic word <italic>al-manakh</italic>, “calendar, almanac” (citing the <italic>Kitab al-Manakh</italic>, a thirteenth-century publication by Moroccan astronomer Ibn al-Banna al-Marrakushi), the almanac can be a useful reference and a catalyst for activities in the music classroom.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Great Beginnings for Music Teachers: Mentoring and Supporting New Teachers.</italic></bold> Edited by Colleen M. Conway (available in paperback or as an eBook, 2003). This practical guide presents some of the challenges faced by beginning music teachers. Also included is information about district- and state-sponsored mentoring and induction programs, alternative certification, and ongoing professional development. The book includes first-person accounts written by music teachers at the start of their careers. (Since policies often evolve over time, consult the NAfME website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nafme.org">www.nafme.org</ext-link> for information on various state music education associations under the banners “For Music Educators,” then “About,” then “NAfME Federated State Associations.”)</p>

<p><bold><italic>Music Makes the Difference: Programs and Partnerships</italic></bold> (paperback, 1999). In this collection, more than twenty teachers described some of the processes that turn bright ideas into workable realities. Some of the projects discussed are an elementary school opera company, a school chamber music ensemble, an in-depth look at a community’s multicultural music, and a statewide music exchange via the Internet.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Music Makes the Difference: Music, Brain Development, and Learning</italic></bold> (paperback, 2000). Both a resource and an advocacy tool, this book provides important materials that can be used in efforts to maintain high-quality music programs and promote music education.</p>

<p>The <italic>2013 World Almanac</italic> has both an “Arts and Media” section and specific references to music and musicians. If a student is curious about who created a given music video or just wants to know which artists were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame since 1986, this book can help. A music educator who’s team-teaching with a social studies teacher might look for specific dates in the U.S. History Chronology of Events (Singing “The Erie Canal”? It opened in 1825). A child working on a composition on the planets might like some additional astronomical data, and student improvisers who have two groups of players and want to call their piece “Continental Divide” might go to page 457 to find out exactly where this feature is located in North America.</p>
<p>Music teachers who’ve asked their students to create flags of their countries of origin for a multicultural concert can find color pictures of world flags on page 465. The book includes profiles of 196 nations, fifty-five states and territories, and a hundred U.S. cities. World history and culture are also major segments.</p>
<p>Music educators often cast their nets wide when seeking sources of inspiration. At those times when other technology balks, an almanac is always ready to be accessed.</p>
