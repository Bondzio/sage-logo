<title>Introduction</title>
<p>We have a deeper understanding of <italic>who</italic> creates international norms than of <italic>where</italic> they are created. There has been a long and fruitful theoretical debate about the actors involved in international norm creation, but its focus on agency has so far prevented a thorough consideration of venue, conceived not as an organizational platform for a particular actor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111411209">Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 899), but as the institutional setting in which a variety of international actors interact. Yet empirical accounts of diplomatic activities underline the importance of venues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354066111411209">Spector et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>), and recent norm development initiatives have taken place in a plethora of venue types, including international conferences, large and small committees within intergovernmental organizations, and independent commissions. There is also evidence of strategic venue change: when debate about a proposed norm stalls in one venue, norm proponents seek to relocate it into a different setting — and often the international community moves closer to a new norm as a result. In the field of international security, such venue changes have recently occurred during negotiations on individual accountability for war crimes, on regulating the small arms and light weapons trade, on the legality of nuclear weapons, on a comprehensive nuclear test ban, and, as this article explores, on humanitarian intervention and on anti-personnel landmines (APLs). These examples also highlight the multidirectional nature of strategic venue change: ‘destination’ venues include multinational conferences with and without United Nations (UN) auspices, an independent commission, the World Health Organization, the International Court of Justice, and the UN General Assembly (GA). Thus two questions arise: <italic>first, why and how does venue affect norm creation? Second, how do norm proponents choose among the different venue types?</italic></p>
<p>This article challenges and augments constructivist conceptions of norm emergence — the first stage in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111411209">Finnemore and Sikkink’s (1998)</xref> norm life cycle — with insights from the English School, rationalism, empirical scholarship on international diplomacy and International Political Economy (IPE) to answer these questions. It proceeds in four steps. First, it highlights the importance of negotiation alongside persuasion in norm emergence, thus acknowledging a more rationalist dimension within this stage of the norm creation process and opening space for a full consideration of venues within the constructivist paradigm. Second, it draws on the empirical diplomacy literature to detail how venue membership, mandate, output status, rules of procedure/operating procedures and legitimacy affect both the content of and the level of international support for an emerging norm. Third, it offers a conceptual framework for understanding how norm leaders strategically choose venues. Finally, the article illustrates both the impact of venue on norm emergence and the dynamics of strategic venue choice by examining venue changes during two recent norm initiatives: the movement to ban APLs and the effort to promote international consensus on humanitarian intervention. The ultimate aim and contribution is to bring together constructivist conceptions of norm development with rationalist insights into negotiation to provide a more accurate account of norm emergence, reflecting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354066111411209">Fearon and Wendt’s (2002)</xref> insight that constructivism and rationalism are complementary rather than mutually exclusive modes of explanation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1354066111411209">
<title>Why venue matters: Negotiation during norm emergence</title>
<p>In contrast to the growing IPE literature on forum-shopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354066111411209">Busch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354066111411209">Davis, 2009</xref>), the theoretical scholarship on international norm creation has largely ignored the issue of venues and venue change. This article seeks to remedy this deficiency through an improved understanding of the emergence stage of the constructivist norm ‘life cycle’.</p>
<p>International norms are international standards defining the behaviour expected of international actors, including states. There is little consensus on how these norms are created. Constructivist analyses highlight the critical importance of a complex process of multilateral interactions in establishing norms that may ultimately become constitutive of international actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111411209">Finnemore and Sikkink (1998)</xref> seminally conceive of the ‘norm life cycle’ as comprising three stages: norm emergence (during which non-state activists — ‘norm entrepreneurs’ — seek to convince states to adopt a proposed norm), norm cascade (which ensues after a tipping point of state support has been reached and features international socialization pressures on remaining states) and internalization, during which habit and institutionalization ensure widespread conformance with the norm.</p>
<p>Rationalist approaches such as realism and rational design theory counter that the content of international norms is largely determined by factors exogenous to this multilateral process, notably by their instrumental value to (particular sets of) international actors. Thus realists insist that international norms primarily reflect the interests and relative influence of powerful states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354066111411209">Drezner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354066111411209">Gilpin, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354066111411209">Ikenberry and Kupchan, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354066111411209">Krasner, 1976</xref>), rendering the details of the multilateral process by which norms are established of limited interest. Rational design theory suggests that the content of norms is primarily determined by the cooperation dilemmas they address (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354066111411209">Koremenos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354066111411209">Martin, 1992</xref>), leading again to a disinterest in multilateral processes of norm creation: ‘we do not focus on the bargaining among participants but on the broad characteristics of the institutional outcomes they select’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354066111411209">Koremenos et al., 2001</xref>: 781).</p>
<p>Realism and rational design theory correctly highlight the importance of relative power and shared interests in contemporary international norm creation, but they fail to account for other important features of this phenomenon. ‘Moral factors’ often do play major roles in norm creation alongside power considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354066111411209">Nadelmann, 1990</xref>: 480). Some norms are created without the support of major powers, and weaker states and non-state actors expend considerable resources on norm creation initiatives. Contemporary debates about norm content are also often far more intense than rational design theory would suggest, and cannot be fully understood as bargaining over the distributional consequences of multiple solutions to cooperation problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354066111411209">Fearon, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354066111411209">Krasner, 1991</xref>). Moreover, both realism and rational design theory struggle to fully explain strategic venue change. Within realism, venue matters only if it facilitates bargaining among powerful states or the global promulgation of their norms, yet some venue changes (like shifting negotiations on the International Criminal Court from the UN GA to the Rome Conference of Plenipotentiaries) do not favour dominant states. Meanwhile, in a rational design framework venue change should occur only when actors seek to improve cooperative behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111411209">Jupille and Snidal, 2005</xref>), not in the process of creating international norms.</p>
<p>Rather than using rationalist theories as a basis for challenging the constructivist paradigm from without, therefore, this article focuses on acknowledging rationalist processes <italic>within</italic> the norm life cycle. Several constructivist scholars have challenged and refined the conceptualization of individual stages of this life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354066111411209">Acharya, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354066111411209">Bailey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354066111411209">Capie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354066111411209">Carpenter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354066111411209">Hoffmann, 2005</xref>). This article continues this tradition, focusing on the norm emergence stage. It argues that an excessive focus on persuasion has prevented recognition of the importance of negotiation, and therefore of venues, during this stage of norm creation.</p>
<p>Persuasion is the process of changing another actor’s preferences through communicative action. For Finnemore and Sikkink, this is the ‘dominant’ and ‘characteristic’ mechanism of the norm emergence stage: it is only through persuasion that non-state norm entrepreneurs can elicit sufficient state support for their norm to progress to the cascade stage of its life cycle (1998: 900). Among the persuasive tools at norm entrepreneurs’ disposal are information campaigns, strategic framing and grafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111411209">Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 896–899; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354066111411209">Keck and Sikkink, 1998</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1354066111411209">Nadelmann, 1990</xref>: 481–482; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354066111411209">Price, 1998</xref>: 619–623, 627–631). Since norm entrepreneurs are highly strategic in their use of these tools, these persuasion efforts rarely correspond to the Habermasian ideal type of genuinely social truth-seeking through reasoned consensus, but they meet the less demanding test of seeking to alter preferences without overt coercion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354066111411209">Grobe, 2010</xref>: 7–10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111411209">Johnston, 2001</xref>: 493–494; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354066111411209">Payne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1354066111411209">Risse, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This article acknowledges the importance of persuasion in norm emergence, but nevertheless challenges the current constructivist conceptualization of this stage of the norm life cycle on two inter related counts. First, norm emergence is not a linear process in which states can only adopt or resist the norms proposed by norm entrepreneurs but not shape them. In fact, the norms states ultimately adopt often differ dramatically from those originally proposed by norm entrepreneurs. This is not simply because norm entrepreneurs are not necessarily united behind a single solution to the problem they identify. Once an international issue has acquired international salience, states generally do not limit their options to accepting or rejecting the norm proposed by norm entrepreneurs, but typically consider a range of possible variants and alternatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354066111411209">Payne, 2001</xref>: 42). Some may ultimately endorse the norm proposed by norm entrepreneurs: these states become ‘norm leaders’ and crucial advocates for the norm given the privileged status of states in contemporary international diplomacy. As a key APL ban activist noted, ‘if you want to make progress, you have to have government champions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111411209">Sigal, 2006</xref>: 97). Other states may simply reject the proposed norm, and others again may advocate for alternative norms that differ to varying degrees from the norm entrepreneurs’ proposal. Basic agreement on a norm of individual accountability for war crimes, for example, does not preclude different estimations of what constitutes a war crime or of the acceptability of non-punitive/‘restorative justice’ sanctioning. Norm emergence is therefore best conceived not as a simple ‘surfacing’ of a pre-formulated norm in international society through the persuasion efforts of norm entrepreneurs, but as a crystallization process in which the emerging norm acquires its specific shape and content — as well as its international support — through interactions both between states and non-state actors and among states.</p>
<p>Second, international norms rarely reach the cascade stage of the norm life cycle by persuasion alone. In the crystallization process, actors do attempt to persuade each other of the value of their favoured norm proposals. Yet as both solidarist and pluralist members of the English School stress, members of the contemporary international system remain deeply divided on moral issues: ‘the plurality of views, values, and identities cannot be reconciled on the basis of any straightforward appeal to shared moral principles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354066111411209">Hurrell, 2007</xref>: 10). Moreover, moral divisions are often reinforced by power disparities and diverging perceptions of self-interest, which provide instrumental reasons for refusing to support a particular norm. These profound divisions in the international system create a critical role for <italic>negotiation</italic> in norm emergence.</p>
<p>Negotiation is the process of crafting agreement among parties with divergent preferences through bargaining, compromise and mutual concessions. Unlike persuasion, it takes divergent preferences as given and aims at accommodation among them rather than at convergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1354066111411209">Zartman, 1988</xref>: 32). During norm emergence, opportunities and incentives for negotiation arise because the emerging norm’s shape and content affect its level of international support, and therewith its ability to progress to the cascade stage of its life cycle. States’ support for an emerging norm depends on how much it resembles their normative ideal, reflecting both their moral convictions and their perceptions of self-interest. International support is also often inversely related to the stringency of the demands and constraints the emerging norm seeks to impose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111411209">Downs et al., 1996</xref>). Consequently, even committed norm entrepreneurs and leaders have an incentive to consider strategic compromises to their norm’s nature (i.e. to exactly what behaviour it demands and how stringently it does so) if persuasion alone cannot generate the critical level of support necessary for it to proceed to the cascade stage. In addition to engaging in persuasion efforts, therefore, during norm emergence actors bargain over the content of the emerging norm and strike compromises about the scope, precision, ambition and rigidity of its demands.</p>
<p>Recognizing the role of negotiation alongside persuasion during norm emergence opens the door to understanding the full importance of venue at this stage. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111411209">Johnston (2001)</xref> notes, venue matters for persuasion: small, deliberative and consensus-based institutions are ideal for this purpose. Venue also matters for negotiation. Norm emergence negotiations are necessarily multilateral and complex because concessions made to accommodate one state may alienate others, and formal international institutions facilitate such interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354066111411209">Abbott and Snidal, 1998</xref>: 10–12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354066111411209">Milgrom et al., 1990</xref>). Crucially, moreover, this facilitation is not neutral: the distinctive dynamics of various venue types have differential effects on probable negotiation outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354066111411209">Aurisch, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354066111411209">Baumgartner and Jones, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354066111411209">Guiraudon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111411209">Lall, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111411209">Pfetsch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354066111411209">Spector et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>). The remainder of this article explores how venue affects norm emergence and how norm leaders choose venues for their initiatives.</p>

<title>How venue matters: Effects on norm emergence</title>
<p>This article defines ‘venue’ as the institutional setting in which an official diplomatic encounter occurs, which can include international conferences and summits, meetings of standing bodies of intergovernmental organizations, and independent commissions. This differs from the more limited sense of ‘venue’ as merely a physical/geographical location, but reflects both increasingly common usage and the fact that international actors will not commit to a negotiation process without a prior understanding of not only its location, but also its auspices, participants, topic and procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066111411209">Albin, 2001</xref>: 26–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111411209">Berridge, 2010</xref>: 31–43; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1354066111411209">Saunders, 1985</xref>: 261; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354066111411209">Stein, 1989</xref>: 252–257). Identifying the proposed encounter’s venue helps answer these questions, making this a critical element of pre-negotiation discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066111411209">Charney, 1982</xref>: 91–92).</p>
<p>The most basic parameters of a diplomatic encounter are provided by its venue’s membership, mandate, output status, rules of procedure/operating procedures and legitimacy, though other characteristics such as location and information technology also affect the encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111411209">Berridge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354066111411209">Henrikson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1354066111411209">Swaab et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Membership</italic> rules answer the crucial question of who can participate in the encounter, and in what capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111411209">Berridge, 2010</xref>: 149–153; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 44–45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354066111411209">Starkey et al., 2005</xref>: 59–71). Venue membership may be restricted or open to all states, and states may be invited to participate through official delegations or through eminent but not legally representative individuals. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) may be excluded or, subject to accreditation, given restricted access as lobbyists, observer status (i.e. the ability to attend negotiations but not to vote) or full participation rights. International bureaucrats may be excluded, granted observer status or invited to participate in negotiations as mediators, advisers and/or drafters of texts.</p>
<p>The encounter’s formal objective is delineated by its venue’s <italic>mandate</italic> and <italic>output status</italic>. Venue mandate demarcates the focus and scope of discussions: some venues are dedicated to a single issue area, while others have much broader mandates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 43). <italic>Output status</italic> refers in the first instance to the legal status of any texts produced in a venue, which can range from formal treaties to non-binding communiqués, reports or statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 11–17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>: 145–156). Norms may emerge through any of these outputs, with norm negotiation taking the shape of bargaining over whether and how an emerging norm is described in the relevant sections. Less tangibly, output status also reflects the venue’s centrality to international diplomacy, that is, the degree to which it is connected to the principal actors and institutions of the international community, and therefore the international impact and ‘visibility’ of its formal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 50).</p>
<p>Formal <italic>rules of procedure</italic> and informal (often precedent-based) <italic>operating procedures</italic> shape the dynamics of a diplomatic encounter. Most crucially, they determine who sets the negotiation agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1354066111411209">Prendergast, 1990</xref>), how texts are drafted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354066111411209">Marshall, 1997</xref>: 154–163) and how collective decisions are made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111411209">Berridge, 2010</xref>: 155–158; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 17–32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>: 159–172).</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>legitimacy</italic>, that is, the extent to which a venue is internationally accepted as an appropriate negotiation forum for a particular issue, is largely precedent-based: venues seem more legitimate if they have already hosted negotiations on cognate issues, while new venues often elicit mistrust. However, established venues may lose legitimacy (thus increasing receptivity to new venues) if they exhibit consistent bias or repeatedly fail to produce agreement on important issues.</p>
<p>Any given venue offers a bundle of membership, mandate, output status, rules of procedure/operating procedures and legitimacy characteristics, which together frame the ‘actor, issue, and process factors … [that] determine the uniqueness of one negotiation as compared with another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1354066111411209">Starkey et al., 2005</xref>: 56). These characteristics affect the outcome of diplomatic encounters within the venue, though given the continued importance of individual negotiators’ power, skill and strategies, they do not determine them. From the point of view of norm emergence, two impact dimensions are crucial: first, on the emerging norm’s content and, second, on its level of international support.</p>
<p>The content of an emerging norm is shaped by the membership rules of the venue in which it is debated. Limited-membership venues facilitate persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111411209">Johnston, 2001</xref>), which favours the emergence of a strong (i.e. specific and demanding) norm if norm leaders dominate and/or norm entrepreneurs are admitted, and generally promote clear norm formulation by reducing the need to mask disagreements with ambiguity. From a negotiation perspective, small homogeneous venues promote norm specificity and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354066111411209">Downs et al., 1998</xref>), whereas large venues tend to produce ambiguous and/or undemanding rules because they dilute the influence of ‘outliers’, including norm leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1354066111411209">Johnston, 2001</xref>: 510; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354066111411209">Lall, 1966</xref>: 112–113). Formal state representation (especially by politically constrained mid-level rather than authoritative top officials) exacerbates the latter effect by encouraging rhetorical ‘grandstanding’ instead of constructive negotiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354066111411209">Charney, 1982</xref>: 80; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111411209">Dunn, 1996</xref>: 251). By contrast, international commissions’ reliance on eminent but not formally nationally representative individuals ‘contribute[s] to the stretching of the mind of global governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354066111411209">Cooper and English, 2005</xref>: 8). If admitted, NGOs can promote agreement on strong norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354066111411209">Albin, 1999</xref>), but a diverse NGO presence offering conflicting advice can undermine rule formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354066111411209">Krause, 2002</xref>: 258) and over-assertive NGOs may ruin delicate bargaining and cause states to shy away from necessary compromises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354066111411209">Kempel, 1999</xref>). Similarly, pro-norm bureaucrats can help promote strong norm formulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1354066111411209">Tallberg, 2010</xref>), but disunited or anti-norm bureaucrats contribute to weak compromises and/or the failure to adopt any decision at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354066111411209">Beach, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A venue’s mandate can mitigate or compound these membership effects. Limited venue mandates ensure intensely focused single-issue negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354066111411209">Kaufmann, 1996</xref>: 43), which facilitate strong rule formulation if the impetus towards norm creation is strong, but otherwise increase the risk of negotiation failure by limiting the scope for cross-issue compromises. By contrast, in multi-issue venues the potential for bargaining, trade-offs and logrolling increases dramatically, improving the chances of a compromise deal on the proposed norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1354066111411209">Pfetsch, 1999</xref>: 202–203; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354066111411209">Spector et al., 1994</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>Rules of procedure and operating procedures also matter. Strong norms are more likely to emerge if pro-norm actors dominate agenda-setting, since the sequencing and ‘bundling’ of negotiation topics critically affect bargaining dynamics and the strategic introduction or blocking of new proposals directly impacts negotiation outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354066111411209">Levine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1354066111411209">Stein, 1989</xref>: 254; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1354066111411209">Tallberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>: 185–186). Norm strength is also promoted if pro-norm actors dominate the drafting of outcome documents, since drafters enjoy opportunities to shape the text according to their own preferences. Finally, decision-making rules impact negotiation outcomes. Consensus decision-making, under which general acquiescence is assumed if no participant formally voices dissent, aims to avoid the ‘inevitable divisiveness’ of a vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354066111411209">Berridge, 2010</xref>: 157). It allows committed opponents to block collective decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066111411209">Albin, 2001</xref>: 31), but also puts pressure on isolated negotiators to accede to the majority position since they cannot register opposition without exercising their veto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354066111411209">Coleman, 2007</xref>: chs 3, 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>: 161). It thus promotes the emergence of a strong norm as long as opposition to it is limited and/or weak. By contrast, majority or super majority voting allows both for a less costly expression of dissent and for the dissenting minority to be overruled, facilitating the emergence of strong norms where opposition is intense but limited to a minority of voting venue members.</p>
<p>An emerging norm’s international support also depends on the membership and rules of procedure/operating procedures of the venue in which it is discussed, but in fundamentally different ways. Widespread support is encouraged when norms emerge in large, heterogeneous venues with formal state representation. This is not only because such norms tend not to be very onerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111411209">Downs et al., 1996</xref>), but also because inclusive negotiations allow a range of interests to be presented and disagreements to be aired, and give participating states a stake in their outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354066111411209">Chayes and Chayes, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354066111411209">Koh, 1997</xref>). Moreover, formal representation (especially by high-level officials) makes it harder for states to dissociate themselves from a negotiated agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354066111411209">Dunn, 1996</xref>: 257). Wide and diverse NGO participation also encourages widespread international support for the emerging norm by promoting civil society ‘buy-in’. By contrast, small, exclusive venues do little to secure widespread norm support, and may even bias excluded actors against the emerging norm.</p>
<p>International support also depends on impartial and inclusive rules of procedure and operating procedures. Actors whose concerns were sidelined through biased agenda-setting or drafting processes are less likely to support the emerging norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354066111411209">Albin, 2001</xref>: 32–33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1354066111411209">Spector et al., 1994</xref>: 9). Consensus decision-making facilitates widespread support by ensuring that all (or most) participants’ interests and concerns are taken into account during norm negotiations. For similar reasons, in voting systems, super majorities presage widespread support for the emerging norm, while narrow majorities suggest only limited support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1354066111411209">Walker, 2004</xref>: 172).</p>
<p>A venue’s legitimacy and output status also matter. Franck cogently argues that ‘in the international community, the legitimacy of rules — and of the process by which they are made and applied — conduces to compliant state behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354066111411209">1990</xref>: 40). If legitimate procedures enhance the acceptance of rules, then a venue’s legitimacy is crucial to widespread endorsement of the norm emerging within it. Widespread endorsement is also more likely if a venue’s output documents are legally and/or politically binding: although even treaties and solemn commitments can be reneged upon, negotiating parties are less likely to disown such agreements because of the reputational costs of doing so. It is also easier to repudiate or ignore the output of relatively obscure venues than that of venues enjoying the auspices of major intergovernmental organizations and/or the endorsement of key states, international bureaucrats or other eminent individuals.</p>
<p>Thus venue characteristics influence both the content of and the level of international support for emerging norms in complex and inter related ways: norm strength and support create opposing demands for some characteristics, and in combination venue characteristics may either reinforce or mitigate each other’s effects. Venue characteristics also interact with the characteristics of a particular norm initiative: the initiative’s strengths may compensate for some venue shortcomings (e.g. a strong demand for a new norm can mitigate limited venue legitimacy), but venue characteristics can also exacerbate a norm initiative’s weaknesses, for example, when a deeply contentious norm is considered in a single-issue venue.</p>

<title>Strategic venue choice</title>
<p>Given the complexity of venue effects and the fact that states have only limited opportunities to vary venue characteristics individually, venues are best conceptualized as offering <italic>bundles</italic> of characteristics leading to a particular expected impact on an emerging norm’s content and support. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354066111411209">Busch’s (2007)</xref> analysis of forum-shopping in trade disputes, therefore, this article focuses not on isolating the specific impact of particular venue characteristics, but on conceptualizing how norm leaders choose among the bundles of characteristics offered by various venues.</p>
<p>Norm leaders are by definition committed to the norm they advocate, and thus prefer venues where this norm is likely to be adopted. However, they are constrained by the costs of different venues and by the fact that emerging norms require international support to reach the cascade stage of their life cycle, which limits the value of venues that adopt a norm but generate little support for it.</p>
<p>A norm leader’s venue choice begins with the identification of venue options whose likely outcomes are sufficiently superior to the normative status quo to be worth their attendant costs. In principle, norm leaders can select any international body of which they are members, seek to modify an existing venue or create a new one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111411209">Jupille and Snidal, 2005</xref>). However, all venues entail costs, potentially including not only financial expenditures, but also the transactions, bargaining and uncertainty costs of modifying existing venues or creating new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354066111411209">Jupille and Snidal, 2005</xref>: 25–26) and the political costs of persuading other states to attend negotiations in a particular venue and of risking humiliation if negotiations fail. Political costs increase with a venue’s international visibility (norm leadership is riskier in high-profile venues than in venues attracting little public scrutiny), dependence on international cooperation (e.g. global conferences are more easily derailed by insufficient state participation than international commissions) and distance from established forums. An international organization’s auspices guarantee state participation, provide incentives for compromise (lest a valued institution be seen to fail) and shield the convening state from blame for negotiation failure. Norm leaders operating without such auspices face higher risks and have to expend more of their own political capital.</p>
<p>Costs narrow norm leaders’ venue options. Some venues require more financial and/or political capital than the norm leader is willing or able to expend. Others may promise too little progress towards the preferred norm for the norm leader to accept their costs. Aspiring norm leaders that cannot identify any affordable and cost-effective venues will at least temporarily desist from their initiatives. If only one such venue is identified, venue identification effectively determines venue choice. Where more than one acceptable venue option is identified, venue choice depends on the norm leader’s relative valuation of each venue’s likely impact on the emerging norm’s content and international support.</p>
<p>This relative valuation is simple if one venue promises both a norm content that more closely reflects the norm leader’s preferences and higher international support levels than its alternatives. However, since norm leaders generally support strong norms and norm strength is often inversely related to international support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354066111411209">Downs et al., 1996</xref>), the available venues may force norm leaders to contemplate trade-offs between norm content and international support: one venue may promise widespread support of a weak norm and another a stronger norm with less support. Norm leaders’ relative valuation of these venues depends on their estimation of how close their preferred norm is to the tipping point of support necessary for a norm cascade. If it already enjoys substantial support, they can afford to favour a venue that promotes norm strength more than international support. If the triggering of a norm cascade is in doubt, norm leaders are more likely to favour venues that enhance international support, even at the expense of norm strength. The strength of this threshold effect depends on norm leaders’ time horizons. States that believe they are facing a unique window of opportunity may sacrifice norm strength considerably to initiate a norm cascade while they can. By contrast, norm leaders who foresee further norm emergence opportunities and are confident in their future negotiating strength are more likely to hold out for a stronger norm. They may favour a venue that facilitates the formulation of a strong norm with only limited support over its alternatives in the hope of creating a stepping stone for a future norm initiative, or for fear that a widely endorsed weak norm will ruin the chances of establishing a stronger norm later.</p>

<title>Two case studies of venue change</title>
<p>The recent campaigns to ban APLs and to establish an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from mass atrocities (R2P) provide excellent case studies for the theoretical argument advanced in this article, for three reasons. First, both cases feature venue changes, which help isolate the impact of venue by holding both the norm initiative and possible exogenous influences on norm emergence remarkably constant within each case study. Venue changes offer an opportunity to observe the same norm initiative in two different venues, and in the cases selected here they produced sets of negotiations that were closely clustered in temporal terms. As detailed below, the quest for an APL ban failed in one venue in 1995–6 and succeeded in another in 1996–7, but at the same time would have failed in a third venue. The R2P case showed no movement towards norm emergence in a 1999 venue, progress in a 2000–1 venue and further progress in a third venue in 2005. This temporal clustering ensures that the nature of the norm initiative (e.g. the identity of norm leaders) and potential exogenous factors affecting norm emergence (e.g. technological knowledge or the relative power of core actors) are held largely constant, increasing the certainty that progress towards norm emergence stems from the change in venue. Exogenous factors cannot explain why an APL ban succeeded in one venue but would simultaneously have failed in another. In the slightly more temporally extended R2P case, exogenous factors are not held as absolutely equal but remain manageable. Indeed, it will be argued that the international environment was <italic>less</italic> favourable to this norm’s emergence in 2005 than in 1999/2001.</p>
<p>Second, these cases are fertile ground for existing constructivist theories and thus hard and highly salient cases for proving the importance of the more rationalist negotiation dimension alongside persuasion during norm emergence. It is hardly surprising if international norms that are not recognized as having a significant moral dimension (e.g. norms regulating international aviation) are created largely by bargaining. The Ottawa Process on APLs, however, has become a paradigmatic case of non-state actors using persuasive tools to demonstrate the moral necessity of a new norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354066111411209">Price, 1998</xref>). R2P was also cast in explicitly moral terms, and advanced following crises in Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda and Kosovo, circumstances that constructivists claim offer key opportunities for norm emergence because they increase states’ receptivity to new norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354066111411209">Checkel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354066111411209">Florini, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1354066111411209">Reus-Smit, 2007</xref>). The burgeoning literature on humanitarian intervention produced in this period is testament to the strong currents of normative persuasion generated by these crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1354066111411209">Holzgrefe and Keohane, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1354066111411209">Weiss, 2007</xref>: ch. 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1354066111411209">Wheeler, 2000</xref>). Under these conditions, constructivism typically envisages highly strategic persuasion efforts, but not negotiation about the content and scope of the emerging norm — or strategic venue choices that affect negotiation outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, the pairing of these two cases highlights the inherent multidirectionality of strategic venue choice and the range of impacts venue can have on norm emergence. Since Canada led both initiatives, inherent norm leader venue preferences are held constant, yet these cases feature very different destination venues. Moreover, while in the APL case a single venue change culminated in successful norm emergence, two successive changes brought only incremental progress on R2P. Thus these two initiatives showcase both the ideal case of successful venue change and norm leaders’ tactics when this ideal is out of reach, highlighting the limitations as well as the potential of strategic venue change.</p>
<sec id="section6-1354066111411209">
<title>The campaign to ban anti-personnel landmines</title>
<p>Although the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) raised concerns about APLs from the 1950s onwards, until the 1990s diplomatic efforts centred on restricting the use of these weapons rather than banning them. From 1992 onwards, however, a rapidly growing federation of NGOs called the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) reframed APLs as a humanitarian issue because of their high and persistent non-combatant casualties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1354066111411209">Price, 1998</xref>). Through public opinion campaigns and direct lobbying, ICBL helped mobilize a select group of states, including Canada, in support of a ban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 131). To initiate an international norm cascade, however, these persuasion efforts had to be supplemented with multilateral norm negotiations.</p>
<p>The initial venue for these negotiations was the 1995–6 Review Conference for the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which includes a Second Protocol limiting the use of landmines. APL policy changes in the USA and several European states raised hopes that the Review Conference would endorse an APL ban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1354066111411209">Williams and Goose, 1998</xref>: 26–27). However, although the Conference was a propitious venue for generating widespread support for an emerging norm due to its legitimacy, status as treaty-negotiation venue and large state membership, it was not favourable to the emergence of a strong norm given that same large state membership, consensus decision-making and its exclusion of NGOs. As US Acting Assistant Secretary of State Thomas McNamara put it, ‘the people who didn’t want to move fast on this wanted to do it in CCW’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111411209">Sigal, 2006</xref>: 52). Ultimately, the Conference only agreed to prohibit the uncontrolled use of APLs and non-self-destructing and unmarked mines. ICBL Coordinators Jody Williams and Stephen Goose recall their disappointment in this venue: ‘the international community simply was not ready to meet its then-stated goal of eliminating AP mines through the vehicle of an amended Protocol II of the CCW’ (1998: 31).</p>
<p>The issue appeared set to pass to the UN Conference on Disarmament (CD), which had considerable legitimacy due to its UN auspices and its central role during negotiations for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Biological and Chemical Weapons Conventions. However, the 66-member CD takes decisions by consensus, and key member states had already demonstrated their opposition to an APL ban during the CCW Review Conference. The ICRC’s Peter Herby predicted that, ‘As with the CCW, the rule of consensus will probably make agreement on far-reaching measures impossible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111411209">Sigal, 2006</xref>: 99). Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy concurred: ‘The UN system of disarmament negotiations, based on achieving a full consensus, was … held hostage to the position of the most recalcitrant members’ (2003: 133). Like the CCW, moreover, CD negotiations excluded NGOs, further decreasing its likelihood of producing a comprehensive ban.</p>
<p>In this context, Canada announced a follow-up conference to the CCW process for pro-ban states and NGOs, which convened in Ottawa in October 1996 and, unlike the CCW and the CD, lacked UN auspices. A Canadian official noted frankly: ‘We were trying to position ourselves for post-CCW’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111411209">Greenaway, 1997</xref>). As Axworthy has highlighted, this venue choice not only avoided the UN disarmament structures’ consensus rules, but also ensured that ‘the NGOs would be in the room, able to make their case’ (2003: 135). The conference produced a declaration supporting ‘the earliest possible conclusion’ of an APL ban treaty, but commitment levels among the 50 signatory states varied widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066111411209">Lawson et al., 1998</xref>: 162). To force greater momentum towards a ban, Axworthy used his closing remarks to publicly challenge states ‘to see a treaty signed no later than the end of 1997 … [and] to put our rhetoric into action’ (2003: 137). This launched the Ottawa Process, a series of interstate negotiations and pro-ban public opinion mobilization conferences that culminated on 2 December 1997, when 122 states signed the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction.</p>
<p>Venue played a large role in this success, as the simultaneous deadlock on APLs in the CD highlights. UN Secretary-General Kofi Anan obliquely noted the striking contrast between the two venues in September 1997 by diplomatically expressing hope that the forthcoming Ottawa Convention would serve ‘as an inspiration for greater and swifter progress in the Conference of Disarmament’s own deliberations toward a total ban on land mines’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354066111411209">Federal News Service, 1997</xref>). At the same news conference, Axworthy reinforced this distinction, noting somewhat disingenuously: ‘We’ve never seen these as competing processes … except that the Ottawa Process was much faster and pulled countries together, where what happened [at the CD] in Geneva was basically gridlock.’</p>
<p>The Ottawa Process aimed at securing a comprehensive APL ban and was thus designed to promote norm strength. State membership was conditioned by self-selection processes intended to limit full participation to pro-ban states. States had to endorse a draft declaration calling for an early APL ban treaty to become full members of the initial Ottawa meeting. One official summarized the rationale: ‘we couldn’t invite everyone, or we’d get the lowest common denominator — all the rats trying to hijack your agenda’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111411209">Greenaway, 1997</xref>). To fully participate in the crucial text negotiations in Oslo in September 1997, states had to sign the Brussels Declaration committing them to discussions based on the text elaborated in previous meetings with a view towards signing a ban treaty in December 1997. At each step, states that did not make the necessary commitments could only attend as non-voting observers. These self-selection procedures helped preserve momentum towards a ban, though some anti-ban states circumvented them: the USA, for example, signed the Brussels Declaration despite opposing a comprehensive ban (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1354066111411209">Short, 1997</xref>: 6). Pro-ban NGOs were directly integrated in negotiations, enjoying full membership in the initial Ottawa conference and remaining influential in all subsequent meetings, both directly and through membership in pro-ban states’ delegations. A US negotiator noted with dismay: ‘It was a new diplomacy in which NGOs had virtually equal status inside the delegations and you had NGO delegations sitting around the table. It was a free-for-all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111411209">Sigal, 2006</xref>: 173). Yet by the Oslo negotiations, NGOs had observer rather than full negotiator status and thus could not derail strategic compromises between states. ICBL opposition to US participation in the Oslo negotiations, for example, was largely ignored.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Ottawa Process was a single-issue forum, which helped ensure that the momentum towards an APL ban was not sapped by discord on other issues. This limited the scope for inter-issue trade-offs, but pro-ban actors calculated that they could generate enough political pressure for a ban to be concluded without such side-deals. The ICRC’s Peter Herby urged this strategy in June 1996: ‘If conducted in good faith in a forum dedicated to [anti-personnel landmines], negotiations could be concluded in several sessions of a few weeks each’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1354066111411209">Sigal, 2006</xref>: 100).</p>
<p>The Ottawa Process’s rules of procedure also favoured the formulation of a strong norm. The explicit objective of pursuing a comprehensive APL ban and early elaboration of a draft convention in February 1997 set the agenda and provided the basis for all subsequent meetings. Moreover, the Oslo negotiations allowed for two-thirds majority voting, which proved essential to the adoption of a strong draft treaty. Most notably, a series of US demands that would have forced a dramatic weakening of the text under consensus decision-making could ultimately be rejected given the voting rules. ICBL’s Jody Williams highlighted the importance of this decision-making rule: ‘the treaty [was not] held hostage to rule by consensus, which would inevitably have resulted in a gutted treaty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354066111411209">Williams, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The Ottawa Process was also designed to facilitate widespread support for the norm emerging within it. Its designated output was a formal treaty with immediate status in international law and, self-selection barriers notwithstanding, its state membership was potentially universal, with states unwilling to commit to a ban being offered observer status to keep them engaged. Yet as a new venue and explicit alternative to the more established CD, the Ottawa Process lacked procedural legitimacy, which threatened to undermine international support for its output. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1354066111411209">Williams (1997)</xref> noted, ‘even the truly pro-ban states at the October 1996 Ottawa meeting were horrified’ by Canada’s blunt challenge to sign a treaty by 1997. Thus ‘it was not clear in the first critical months after the Ottawa meeting that the Ottawa Process would survive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 35). The Process did survive and gathered momentum, but its opponents continued to insist that the CD was the more appropriate venue. After the Oslo negotiations, Russia argued that the proposed treaty did not take into account ‘the views and legitimate interests’ of states representing ‘nearly two thirds of the world population’, and caused division ‘instead of consolidating the world community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354066111411209">Ohlin, 1997</xref>). The USA agreed, and announced ‘we’re going to go back to Geneva now’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1354066111411209">US Newswire, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Canada sought to bolster the Ottawa Process’s legitimacy by presenting the CCW and the CD as paralysed on APLs, by defending the Process’s pro-ban bias as a moral necessity, and by cultivating Process ties to the UN. Key Canadian negotiators have highlighted two strategies in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354066111411209">Lawson et al., 1998</xref>: 170–171). First, Canada pressed for a GA resolution endorsing the Process, and scored a partial victory when the Assembly called for the ‘vigorous’ pursuit of an APL ban without specifying a venue. Second, the Oslo negotiations were modelled on UN conferences to reassure states of the Process’s legitimacy despite ‘its birth outside normal diplomatic channels’. The Process also cultivated the support of UN Secretaries-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali (who was consulted before Axworthy launched his 1996 challenge) and Kofi Annan, who delivered a laudatory address at Oslo and witnessed the treaty signing ceremony in Ottawa. Nevertheless, lack of procedural legitimacy remained the Process’s Achilles heal. Indeed, Canadian diplomat Don Hubert has argued that it flourished only because APL negotiations in the CD remained deadlocked: ‘even modest success within the CD was sure to draw vital support away from the Ottawa Process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354066111411209">2000</xref>: 19).</p>
<p>Thus venue change to the Ottawa Process was a high-stakes gamble. The venue promised the formulation of a strong norm, but international support levels were uncertain. Thus, as one Canadian official put it, ‘The potential for egg on our face was enormous’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111411209">Greenaway, 1997</xref>). If other states rejected the Process or the final conference attracted too few participants to promulgate a credible treaty, Canada would be humiliated. Axworthy was explicitly briefed on these ‘downsides’ before launching the Process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111411209">Greenaway, 1997</xref>), and made his decision in full recognition that ‘we [were] breaking the rules of accepted international behaviour and running the risk of falling flat on our face’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 137). ICBL’s Stephen Goose acknowledged this critical costing decision: ‘The Canadian Government made the decision to devote its diplomatic resources to this. No other country matched this effort’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1354066111411209">Greenaway, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Canada gambled that it would be able to draw states into the new venue by a combination of diplomacy and public pressure, relying heavily on the mobilization efforts of pro-ban NGOs. In other words, it gambled that a key strength of its norm initiative would balance the core weakness of the Process as a negotiating venue, with the promise of a strong norm emerging compensating for the cost of the political risk involved. Thus venue choice in this case was critically affected by venue identification and costing: Canada had to conceive of the Process and accept its costs in order to choose it over continued negotiations in the CD, which guaranteed high international support but of a far weaker norm.</p>

<title>The responsibility to protect: From the General Assembly to the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty</title>
<p>In September 1999, in the aftermath of dramatic international failures to prevent mass atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda and of NATO’s decision to intervene in Kosovo without a UN mandate, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan challenged the GA to ‘forge unity behind the principle that massive, systematic violations of human rights … should not be allowed to stand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354066111411209">1999</xref>). He launched an inconclusive debate, during which ‘fervent supporters of intervention on human rights grounds, opposed by anxious defenders of state sovereignty, dug themselves deeper and deeper into opposing trenches’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354066111411209">Evans and Sahnoun, 2002</xref>). Canada supported the idea of humanitarian intervention, but recognized that the GA could not agree on a norm endorsing it. The Assembly’s large and divided membership, combined with endemic grandstanding in formal debates, made constructive engagement on the issue nearly impossible. Therefore, Canada announced that it would create a new venue, the independent International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS), ‘to foster a global political consensus on how to move forward’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>ICISS was designed for constructive norm formulation. Its mandate was to find ‘new common ground’ in the debate on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention by advancing a new intellectual paradigm, just as the Bruntland Commission had done for sustainable development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111411209">ICISS, 2001</xref>: vii, 81). Three factors facilitated the accomplishment of this mandate. First, the Commission’s membership and rules of procedure insulated it from divisive interstate politics. ICISS’s twelve Commissioners served in their private capacity and were supported by an independent research team and their own Secretariat. ICISS was financially insulated, deriving over half of its budget from foundations and most of the rest from Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111411209">ICISS, 2001</xref>: 85). Its drafting process, extending from a first draft in November 2000 to the final report’s presentation to Secretary-General Annan on 18 December 2001, was largely autonomous. Interested states were briefed on ICISS’s progress but had little direct influence over it. NGOs participated in consultative meetings but had no guaranteed influence on the final report. Even the ICISS Advisory Board of distinguished diplomats, academics, lawyers and humanitarian practitioners provided only loose guidance: there was only one formal meeting, held more than seven months into the drafting process. Nevertheless, bargaining and compromises occurred within ICISS, including, for example, in its considerations of which events could warrant a military response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1354066111411209">Weiss, 2007</xref>: 105). Commissioner Ramesh Thakur recalls that ‘the views presented during the outreach exercise were sometimes used as tie-breakers during deadlocked discussions in the Commission’ (2006: 248).</p>
<p>Second, ICISS was a single-issue venue with a clear mandate. As Thakur put it, ‘we were [not] interested in solving all the world’s problems, but stuck narrowly to our mandate’ (2006: 249). The Commissioners’ efforts were focused by the early first draft report that formed the basis for subsequent discussions, and by the Commission’s tight one-year time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354066111411209">Thakur, 2006</xref>: 250).</p>
<p>Third, Canada favoured the emergence of a new norm, and its influence over ICISS included appointing the Commissioners, providing the ICISS Secretariat and a plurality of its funds, and nominating the Advisory Board, which was chaired by a Canadian, former Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.</p>
<p>However, Canada recognized that it had sacrificed prospective international support levels to create a venue that made constructive norm formulation possible despite the continued deep divisions in the larger international system. The newly created ICISS lacked procedural legitimacy for dealing with this divisive issue, and the small, independent Commission’s report was neither legally nor politically binding and could easily be ignored. To mitigate these shortcomings, Canada sought Commissioners of substantial international stature who could collectively claim to represent a diversity of opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 191; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354066111411209">Thakur, 2006</xref>: 248). Ultimately, six Commissioners, including one co-chair, were from non-Western countries, and their influence was guaranteed by the provision that ICISS had to adopt its report by consensus. The co-director of the ICISS research team was also non-Western, as were seven of ICISS’s 15 Advisory Board members, who were expected to ‘act as key advocates to ensure that the political momentum required to follow up on [ICISS] recommendations is maintained’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354066111411209">DFAIT, 2000</xref>). Canada also sought to increase ICISS’s legitimacy by cultivating ties with the UN. Its initial proposal to create the commission under UN auspices was denied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 191), but Canada announced and launched ICISS at the UN, promised to present the Commission’s recommendations to the GA, and stressed that ICISS aimed to facilitate the work of UN negotiation bodies. ICISS co-chair Mohamed Sahnoun and four other Commissioners had strong UN affiliations. Canada also presented ICISS as a direct response to Secretary-General Annan’s challenge to rethink the nature of sovereignty. Axworthy secured Annan’s approval before launching ICISS, and Annan publicly backed the Commission’s work and promised to receive the ICISS report, guaranteeing it an entry into UN circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 191).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ICISS could not generate the international endorsement levels necessary to initiate a norm cascade on humanitarian intervention. Canada simply hoped to relaunch the international debate on more favourable terms by reframing the core issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354066111411209">Axworthy, 2003</xref>: 190–191; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111411209">ICISS, 2001</xref>: vii). Despite these relatively modest prospects, ICISS was an acceptable venue option for Canada for three reasons. First, there were very few alternatives. The GA was deadlocked on the issue of humanitarian intervention, and a global conference was certain to fail given the issue’s divisiveness and the lack of NGO mobilization for humanitarian intervention. Thus Canada’s calculations ‘related to the art of the possible … They went with what they could find.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354066111411209">1</xref></sup> Second, Canada was confident that ICISS was merely a first step and that it could ‘sell’ a robust rule proposed by a credible Commission through lobbying and in subsequent GA debates. Finally, the costs associated with ICISS were modest. The Commission required limited financing and engendered few political risks since it did not depend on widespread state participation, received limited publicity and formally aimed only to elaborate a consensus report, which 12 especially selected diplomats could confidently be expected to achieve within a year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1354066111411209">Thakur, 2006</xref>: 248). Moreover, Canada could monitor the Commission’s progress and decide on the level of exposure sought for its report.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1354066111411209">
<title>The responsibility to protect: From the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty to the World Summit</title>
<p>ICISS ultimately proposed reframing the issue of humanitarian intervention in terms of a responsibility to protect civilians from mass atrocities that belongs first to the sovereign state, but falls to the international community if the state is unable or unwilling to provide that protection. However, the initial impact of this idea (‘R2P’) was limited. Developing states remained sceptical of any attenuation of the principle of non-intervention, and just as the ICISS report was being completed, the 9/11 attacks shifted international attention from humanitarian intervention to terrorism. Canada found itself unable to garner the necessary votes to put R2P on the GA’s agenda, though Annan circulated the report to all member states. Subsequently, the 2003 US-led intervention in Iraq seemed to ring R2P’s death knell by bolstering developing states’ fears of Western interventionism. By 2004, therefore, the international environment was even less propitious for the emergence of an R2P norm than it had been in 2001.</p>
<p>R2P was saved by a venue change. Initially intended to assess progress towards the UN’s Millennium Development Goals, the 2005 UN World Summit acquired a much wider agenda because of the evolving international security situation and pressures for UN reform. In 2004, Annan created the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change (HLP) to ‘examine today’s global threats and provide an analysis of future challenges to international peace and security’ and to ‘recommend changes to ensure effective collective action’ to address them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111411209">HLP, 2004</xref>: 119). He personally appointed the sixteen members, including ICISS co-chair Gareth Evans, who with the support of the HLP secretariat and several co-panellists convinced the panel to endorse R2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111411209">HLP, 2004</xref>: 66). After gauging international reactions, Annan included R2P in his own In Larger Freedom report (ILF), with which he set the World Summit’s agenda. Canada had no say in the selection of HLP members and little direct influence over their or Annan’s report. However, it recognized the World Summit as a crucial opportunity to relaunch R2P, lobbied both the HLP and the UN Secretariat to adopt the concept, and provided essential political support for its inclusion on the Summit agenda: ‘Canada and like-minded states certainly made it possible for Kofi, politically, to continue his strenuous advocacy as Secretary-General for R2P.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354066111411209">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several characteristics of the Summit promised widespread support if a pro-R2P norm could be negotiated. The Summit commanded substantial legitimacy and its Outcome Document enshrined a politically binding agreement at the highest levels. The Summit’s membership included every UN member, represented by official national delegations from March 2005 onwards and by heads of state during the final meeting in September 2005. Moreover, the Summit aimed to produce an agreement by consensus, ensuring that all participants’ views would be heard during negotiations.</p>
<p>However, these characteristics also militated against the adoption of a strong R2P norm. The UN’s 192 members were deeply divided on the issue. Canada led the pro-R2P campaign, supported by the UK, Australia, New Zealand and the European Union as well as Rwanda, South Africa and the African Union, crucially demonstrating that R2P was not a purely Western concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354066111411209">Bellamy, 2006</xref>: 160–161). However, commitment levels varied: ‘very few delegations other than Canada were willing to sacrifice anything else in the [Outcome Document] text to secure the R2P language’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1354066111411209">3</xref></sup> Meanwhile, the Non-Aligned Movement reiterated its ‘rejection of the so-called “right” of humanitarian intervention’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1354066111411209">Rahman, 2005</xref>). India, Pakistan and Egypt headed World Summit opposition to R2P, and Russia and China remained sceptical. Consensus on R2P thus seemed unlikely, prompting some UN negotiators to see the concept as simply a bargaining chip: ‘We never assumed that we would get R2P. We just kept it in there to trade off against other stuff that we wanted.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1354066111411209">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet three venue characteristics helped ensure R2P’s ultimate inclusion in the Outcome Document. First, the UN Secretariat assumed a major role in the drafting process, and its negotiating team included individuals who had been involved in the HLP and ILF reports and favoured R2P. Until August 2005, Summit negotiations proceeded through a series of consultations resulting in successive draft Outcome Documents circulated by GA president Jean Ping of Gabon, but largely written by the UN Secretariat. Although nominally reflecting the evolving consensus among states, these texts also encapsulated the priorities of their drafters. Only in August did US ambassador John Bolton force a transition to line-by-line text negotiations by a succession of ever-smaller state Core Groups and informal corridor negotiations among the most interested states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354066111411209">NUPI, 2006</xref>: 56).</p>
<p>Second, the Summit was a multi-issue forum, and many R2P opponents were preoccupied with other contentious issues. One UN negotiator observed, ‘R2P by itself would never have been endorsed in a resolution of the General Assembly. But the fact that it came in a huge package, where many countries were focussed on other things, and had other battles to fight … it got through in the end.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1354066111411209">5</xref></sup> Canadian officials acknowledge the same dynamic: ‘If R2P had been the only item on the agenda for discussion in 2005, I suggest that it would not have been approved.… The fact that it was being negotiated in a context in which people were preoccupied by a wide variety of other compelling and controversial subjects was of enormous value, because many of the original strident opponents were preoccupied elsewhere.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1354066111411209">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the Summit imposed a deadline on reaching consensus on a single package deal. Line-by-line text negotiations had to conclude when the world leaders arrived on 14 September. On 13 September, there remained 140 disagreements on 27 unresolved issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1354066111411209">NUPI, 2006</xref>: 57). That night, Ping’s staff and UN negotiators worked out a compromise package: ‘we put forward what we thought were compromises that would be acceptable to everyone. And that’s what was then presented to everyone on the next day, on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Because the point was that if anyone started to unravel one issue, the whole thing would fall apart, because there were 170 compromises built into the clean text.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1354066111411209">7</xref></sup> The drafters retained the R2P text negotiated but not yet agreed on by the Core Group. India in particular still objected that the section’s title (‘Responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity’) created excessively close links to the ICISS report. Ultimately, however, India dropped its opposition rather than undermine the package deal hours before the world leaders’ arrival. Under these circumstances, consensus decision-making acted as a muzzle: dissent meant scuttling a complex, multi-issue deal hours before a firm deadline.</p>
<p>Yet the pro-R2P camp also had to make compromises to secure R2P’s adoption. The ICISS provision that regional organizations could authorize intervention in the absence of UN Security Council action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111411209">ICISS, 2001</xref>: 53–54) had been largely abandoned by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354066111411209">HLP (2004</xref>: §203, but note §272), and the Summit insisted on Security Council authorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354066111411209">UNGA, 2005</xref>: §139). Annan’s ‘In Larger Freedom’ divorced R2P from ICISS’s discussion of criteria for the use of force because of intense opposition to the latter from permanent Security Council members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1354066111411209">8</xref></sup> Equally unattainable was the ICISS call for a commitment by the permanent Council members not to exercise their veto on humanitarian intervention issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354066111411209">ICISS, 2001</xref>: 51). Finally, because permanent Council members rejected any obligation to intervene, reference to an international ‘responsibility to take collective action’ was eliminated in favour of a weaker ‘we are prepared to take collective action … on a case-by-case basis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1354066111411209">Ping, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1354066111411209">UNGA, 2005</xref>: §139). Critics have thus charged that ‘the 2005 consensus was produced … by bargaining away key tenets of the ICISS’s recommendations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354066111411209">Bellamy, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1354066111411209">Wheeler, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the World Summit structure, such compromises on norm strength were hardly unexpected. Canada’s decision to nevertheless lead norm negotiations in this venue reflects three factors. First, in Canada’s estimation the Summit’s potential for generating widespread international support for an emerging norm compensated for the likelihood that negotiations within this venue would result in a weaker norm than that proposed by ICISS. The Outcome Document is not legally binding, but it did enshrine a formal commitment by all UN members to the principle of collective intervention against mass atrocities. It also provided a basis for persuading the Security Council to endorse R2P, which it did somewhat unenthusiastically in resolution 1674 of April 2006. Second, there was no prospect for widespread endorsement of a stronger norm in any other venue. The international response to R2P had been so tepid that by January 2004 members of the Canadian permanent mission to the UN were reporting to Ottawa that the prospect of gaining significant international support for the principle seemed remote.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1354066111411209">9</xref></sup> The Summit presented a unique opportunity to revive R2P, and Canada was correspondingly willing to trade norm strength for support. Finally, R2P negotiations within the World Summit generated relatively low costs for Canada. Making R2P its first priority meant Canada had fewer resources to devote to other agenda items, but there were no major financial implications and political risk was limited since negotiation failure would attract little attention in the context of a vast, multi-issue negotiation agenda.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has brought together constructivist and rationalist insights to highlight an important but neglected facet of international norm creation, balancing the dominant theoretical focus on actors with a study of the impact of venue. Its argument begins with the proposition that constructivists’ focus on persuasion during the emergence stage of the norm life cycle has obscured a second vital dynamic: negotiation. The ‘critical mass’ of state support necessary for an emerging norm to advance to the cascade stage of its life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354066111411209">Finnemore and Sikkink, 1998</xref>) is unlikely to be reached through persuasion alone: states are rarely willing to simply adopt, rather than shape, norms proposed by norm entrepreneurs, and they remain deeply divided on normative issues. Norm emergence therefore features bargaining and compromise about the specific content and parameters of the proposed norm. Norm leaders must engage in this bargaining precisely because they are deeply committed to promoting their norm.</p>
<p>These negotiations are shaped by the venues in which they take place. Five venue characteristics (membership, mandate, output status, rules of procedure/operating procedures and legitimacy) interact with each other and with the features of a given norm initiative to influence both the content and the degree of international support of the emerging norm. A norm leader’s choice of negotiation venue is thus highly consequential and norm leaders must by necessity be strategic. Their choice begins with the identification of venue options that promise a sufficiently large normative change to justify the venue’s costs. They then choose among these venues based on their assessment of these venues’ impacts on norm content and international support and their estimation of how close their preferred norm is to reaching the tipping point of support necessary for reaching the cascade stage.</p>
<p>The APL and R2P cases illustrate the role of negotiation in norm emergence: both emerging norms’ contents were subject to extensive bargaining. They also highlight the importance of venue: in both cases stalled norm initiatives were revived by venue changes. Finally, they illustrate the range of strategic venue choice. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354066111411209">Table 1</xref> illustrates, the destination venues in these cases differed widely even though they shared the same norm leader.</p>

<p>This diversity highlights that there is no single best venue for norm emergence. Strategic venue choice is the art of selecting the most appropriate bundle of venue characteristics available, given the circumstances and character of a particular norm initiative. Canada could gamble on the Ottawa Process in part because there was significant NGO mobilization for an APL ban, but a similar venue would have been utterly inappropriate for negotiations on humanitarian intervention. In fact, the most important commonality among the three venue changes examined in this article is arguably the skill with which <italic>different</italic> venues were chosen. Yet while in the APL case a single venue change facilitated successful norm emergence, two successive venue changes brought only incremental progress towards an R2P norm. Thus the cases highlight not only the importance of venues and venue choice in international norm creation, but also the diversity of their nature and impacts.</p>
