<p><italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> not only provides an analysis of decision-making procedures undertaken by three university IRBs (Institutional Review Boards), but also offers an extensive discussion about the historical, political, and legal sources of IRBs. Using a sample of 20 interviews and participant observation, Laura Stark sets out the dimensions of administrative law (“imperatives of objectivity”) as it applies to the current system of ethics governance. Her analysis will affirm, I believe, both fear and an uneasy trepidation among many researchers about IRB procedures; one can also interpret the successful attempts by NIH to avoid legal liability for research as arrogance by devolving legal responsibility to research centers and universities through the habitus of IRBs. Stark, however, does not use these intemperate words—they are the reviewer’s. Instead, the author conveys decision-making procedures of her three IRBs, and the deflection of legal liability in the precise, calm, and analytical voice that characterizes good research. <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> “explores how researchers designed U.S. government rules for the treatment of human subjects … and … examines the present-day consequences of their choice to adopt review procedures rather than ethics principles” (p. 2).</p>
<p>Stark’s analysis of IRB decision-making procedures is a case of administrative law that must give credence to the idea that a group has “one” voice to wield its authority and power. <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> delves into these procedures (based on fieldnotes) and demonstrates the elaborate ways that decisions about ethics in research are made. The relating of first-hand experiences (personal and/or professional) by IRB members exert a “persuasive” power (p. 165) over other members around the table (Stark calls them “warrants”). What is more, group history provides consistent and speedy decisions. These site-specific perspectives resort to local precedents as “exemplar decisions” for models on deciding this or that application. These local precedents constitute creative and discretionary responses to the legal mandate to enforce ethics codes on all research that involves human “subjects.” Finally, IRB documents, and especially meeting minutes and memos, create and sustain the principle that the IRB speaks with one voice. In fact, most deliberations during the meetings are undertaken with the view of creating “one voice” in that set of minutes (p. 71). Stark’s analysis of IRB procedures covers only 73 pages (44 percent) of the main text in her book and leaves the reader wanting more.</p>
<p>The remainder of the book is a lengthy discussion on the existential origins of the IRB structure, namely the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH established IRBs (which now number in the thousands) as a means of removing any legal liability potentially accruing from its funding of external research. (Canada, on the contrary, advises that its ethics committees consider primarily the ethical features of research, and not the legal aspects). The arrogance of NIH to make IRBs adumbrate <italic>all</italic> research (or to ignore the social sciences in its conceptual scheme) has been more forcefully noted by Zachary Schrag in <italic>Ethical Impirialism</italic> (2010). Stark, however, offers a more detailed historical accounting of NIH research philosophies and strategies—a fascinating process involving power struggles among Congress and other institutions, where egos bruise and are bruised. The other main lesson <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> points out is the idea that NIH advocated the group-review model which has also become the pervasive feature of IRB dynamics.</p>
<p>Although Stark’s lengthy discussion on NIH produces valuable insights about the working of IRBs today, it falls in an awkward place in the book: it follows her analysis of IRB processes. Would it have made more sense to present the NIH material first? Or, as things stand, did the book require her penetrating analysis of the IRBs to bring that part to our attention more forcefully? One can well imagine the author’s struggle when trying to decide which should have come first.</p>
<p><italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> might fruitfully consider some of the other burgeoning analytical works about processes associated with research ethics review. Some 17 works come to mind—from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491549">Charlotte Baarts (2009)</xref> and a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491549">2005</xref> issue of the <italic>Journal of Applied Communication Research</italic>, to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491549">Mirka Koro-Ljungberg et al. (2007)</xref>. One might also suggest a number of non-American works, including Maureen Fitzgerald, Christine Halse and Anne Honey, Stuart Derbyshire, M.E. Dixon-Woods et al., Kate Holland, Mark Israel, Klaus Mäkelä, and Damon Parker et al. The 2011 publication of my book, <italic>Seduction of Ethics</italic>, was too late to be included in <italic>Behind Closed Doors.</italic>
</p>
<p>Finally, what I found further missing in <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> was a discussion about the relative status of individual IRB members. Its discussion of warrants was especially insightful, but I have also occasion to know that members pull rank, regardless of the warrant. Their presence can overshadow and undermine committee deliberation; they expect to be treated with deference.</p>
<p>A remnant worry about <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> is that it seems to ignore the social space of the IRB itself in the context of the university or research center. In my own research, I found that ethics committees in smaller universities were more convivial and generous when deciding on applications from scholars. Their committees were also larger. One would think that these aspects would weigh in on the manner in which deliberations take place. Or is that a uniquely non-American phenomenon?</p>
<p>My own erroneous expectations about <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> included the expectation of a treatise, if you will, about the variable treatments accorded to bio-medical versus social research. The on-going struggles by social researchers (and even by medical researchers) to have their work fairly and reasonably treated by IRBs has led me to think of <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> as yet another proof of why the social sciences are being homogenized and pauperized by IRBs. What I found, instead, was an analysis that touches on how IRBs consider <italic>all</italic> research. Most readers, including me, will find this shift in their expectations to be a welcome addition to the literature. <italic>Behind Closed Doors</italic> will appeal to members of IRBs, and students and scholars of policy, and administrative and political science.</p>
