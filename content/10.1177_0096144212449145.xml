<abstract>
<p>Studies of Indian nationalism have frequently acknowledged its “urban roots” but seldom considered in a systematic and sustained fashion the ways in which nationalism shaped the city. Focusing on colonial Bombay, c. 1890-1940, this article explores the changing relationship between Indian nationalism and the city. The first section examines the period spanning the late Victorian and Edwardian eras and highlights forms of middle-class political activity in the urban public sphere that expressed a distinctive civic patriotism and local identity while simultaneously affirming loyalty to the British Empire. The second section shows how popular nationalism in the 1920s and 1930s spawned an extensive repertoire of collective performances and extraconstitutional forms of public action and protest that sought to reterritorialize the city as nationalist space. At the same time, the article also points to the constraints and contestations that marked the nationalist makeover of the “colonial city.”</p>

<title>I</title>
<p>In a recent essay, Partha Chatterjee has highlighted an intriguing aspect of the relationship between Indian nationalism and the city. According to Chatterjee, even though colonial modernity and the anticolonial struggle first emerged in the urban context, Indian nationalists “devoted most of their imaginative energies to the task of producing an idea not of the future Indian city but of a rural India fit for the modern age.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212449145">1</xref></sup> “The answer to this paradox,” Chatterjee suggests, “lies in a perceived lack of agency by the Indian elite in thinking about the city.” In other words, the “colonial cities of British India were largely creations of British colonial rulers to which Indians had adapted.” Consequently, there was a “sense among the middle classes of the great colonial cities of India of not being in control of their surroundings.” Hence, the colonial metropolis had “not acquired in the minds of the Indian middle class the moral security and stability of home.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212449145">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The paradox identified by Chatterjee is “indeed very curious,” but the explanation that he offers is rather problematic. For underlying his line of reasoning is the assumption that colonial cities—the sites where modernity in India was enacted most spectacularly and experienced most intensely—were solely shaped by the actions of the colonial elite. Equally questionable is the suggestion that the nationalist middle class was alienated from the colonial city because of “a perceived lack of agency” within its confines.</p>
<p>This essay argues that while nationalist <italic>thought</italic> might not have reimagined the colonial city, nationalist <italic>political practice</italic> certainly strove to reorder and reclaim it. Drawing on empirical evidence from colonial Bombay, the essay offers, albeit in a schematic fashion, an account of two specific historical moments in the changing relationship between nationalist politics and the city. The first section focuses on the period spanning the late Victorian and Edwardian eras and highlights modes of middle-class public action that expressed a distinctive civic patriotism and local identity while simultaneously affirming loyalty to the British Empire. Anglophone nationalists operating within the public sphere in this period largely adhered to legal and constitutional protocols. The second section considers the period after the end of the First World War, which was marked by new modes of popular politics in the urban public arena that challenged the sovereignty and legitimacy of colonial rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212449145">3</xref></sup> Notably, popular nationalism in the 1920s and 1930s spawned an extensive repertoire of collective performances and extraconstitutional forms of public action and protest that sought to reterritorialize the city as nationalist space.</p>
<p>The essay also points to the constraints and contestations that marked nationalist political action in the colonial city. Prior to the First World War, nationalists had to contend with the disdain of the Civilian Raj, which questioned their representative status and retained a tight grip over the levers of power within the civic arena. Equally, their pedagogical projects of social improvement were rather ineffective. Nor was the “performative politics” of popular nationalism in the interwar decades able to exert unchallenged authority over the spaces of the colonial city. On the one hand, the colonial state responded with compulsive ferocity to the public spectacles staged by nationalists in the course of their popular campaigns. On the other hand, nationalist claims on the public spaces of the city had to contend with alternative visions of political community based on ideologies of class, caste, and religion.</p>

<title>II</title>
<p>Nationalism as a political ideology was first espoused by the educated Indian middle classes residing in the coastal cities established by the British. Hence, when historians of South Asia first began to study the emergence of Indian nationalism, it was the politics of this section of Indian society that drew their attention. There appeared a number of works that explored how English-educated Indians in the great presidency capitals of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras came to embrace the ideology of nationalism in the late nineteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212449145">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In one sense, then, the earliest scholarly accounts of Indian nationalism were <italic>urban</italic> studies. However, while historians underscored the “urban roots” of Indian nationalism, they were primarily interested in the processes by which disparate provincial groups coalesced in a pan-Indian movement. The teleological framework that structured their narratives tended to construe the politics of the urban arena as an increasingly inconsequential sideshow to the anticolonial struggle as it unfolded at the national level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212449145">5</xref></sup> Moreover, insofar as scholars examined nationalist politics within the urban context, their focus was restricted to the political competition and factional intrigues that marked this domain.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212449145">6</xref></sup> From this perspective, the nationalist middle classes appeared internally divided and effete vis-à-vis the colonial elite and the Indian landed and commercial magnates who dominated the civic realm in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, new perspectives have emerged within the historiography that enable us to reframe the relationship between middle-class nationalism and the city. Most notably, scholars have highlighted the significance of the new public sphere that emerged from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, which profoundly transformed the ways in which politics was conducted in colonial India. Saliently, the public sphere was the terrain on which the Indian middle class was forged and was critical to its bid for power. As Sanjay Joshi has argued, even though the emergence of this public sphere was “facilitated” by British rule, it was “ultimately created by the efforts of educated Indians . . . who invested in presses, worked as journalists, created civic and political associations, and published and debated their ideas either in the press or in the forums of their associations.” It was “through these activities as well as control of the public sphere, that educated, respectable, but hardly the richest, most powerful or influential of men in colonial India, were able to successfully represent themselves as the middle class.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212449145">7</xref></sup> Equally, their adroit use of the public sphere allowed these men of the middling strata “to emerge as arbiters of native social conduct and aspirants to direct political power under British rule.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212449145">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historians have shown how, through their interventions in the public sphere, the Indian middle class redefined a range of social ideologies and identities based on caste, gender, religion, and nation. However, they have rarely investigated in a systematic and sustained fashion the manner in which members of the educated middle class also fashioned their <italic>urban</italic> identities through their activities in the public arena.</p>
<p>This took several forms. For instance, in every major colonial city there emerged newspapers that represented the views of the emergent Indian middle class on a range of civic matters, both mundane and momentous. Significantly, local newspapers paid close attention to the doings of their municipal authorities. Thus in Bombay, the Indian press accorded a prominent place to the proceedings of the city’s Municipal Corporation, whose deliberations were subjected to intense and sustained scrutiny. It was especially quick to seize upon, and criticize, the privileges claimed by members of the British ruling elite with regard to the distribution of resources within the city. Nationalist papers, in particular, tended to highlight such iniquities in arguing vociferously for a greater say in the conduct of civic affairs. In some cases, the role of the press was also critical in undermining the legitimacy of specific colonial urban policies. This was the case, for example, with the City Improvement Trust, which was set up in 1898 to overhaul Bombay’s depleted civic infrastructure following the outbreak of a devastating plague epidemic. The Trust, which was largely dominated by colonial officials, soon became a deeply unpopular body, not least because the local nationalist press maintained a stance of unremitting hostility toward it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212449145">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, the nationalist paper that was most prominent in debates over the urban question was the <italic>Bombay Chronicle</italic>. This newspaper, which first began to appear in 1913, was founded by Sir Pherozeshah Mehta (1845-1915), a “liberal” Parsi politician, in order to reflect the “moderate nationalist politics of the Westernized urban intelligentsia and business establishment.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212449145">10</xref></sup> Although the <italic>Chronicle</italic> had a national perspective, it was nonetheless a <italic>Bombay</italic> paper that reflected the cosmopolitan ethos of the city from which it was published.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212449145">11</xref></sup> Saliently, in the war years the <italic>Chronicle</italic> focused on a range of pressing material issues that confronted the city’s ordinary residents. As Sandip Hazareesingh has noted, in its reportage and editorials the paper “assumed the role of an active citizen seeking knowledge about, and answers to the grave problems of urban life.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212449145">12</xref></sup> The <italic>Chronicle</italic> attributed the city’s growing problems to the “unrepresentative” character of urban governance and became a vocal champion of democratic rights in the civic arena. In particular, it campaigned vigorously for a reform of the Municipal Corporation, which would transform it into a genuinely democratic body that represented the “public interest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212449145">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Members of the Indian middle class also took the lead in forming a variety of voluntary associations that concerned themselves with the material issues of the civic arena. Some of these associations emerged in response to specific colonial initiatives—for instance, the City Improvement Trust—and turned out to be rather short-lived affairs. However, other institutions—most notably, schools and colleges, cooperative societies, and social welfare associations— pursued broader goals of social reform and had a more lasting impact. Such reforming zeal was frequently “a rhetorical platform for launching challenges to existing policies and making claims to resources and rewards controlled by the government.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212449145">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most prominent voluntary associations in early twentieth-century Bombay was the Social Service League. Established in March 1911 by prominent members of Bombay’s liberal Indian intelligentsia, the League sought to collect “social facts” and discuss “social theories and social problems with a view to forming public opinion on questions of social service.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212449145">15</xref></sup> By the end of the First World War, the League had become an important player in the civic arena, especially in matters pertaining to the lives of Bombay’s working classes. In particular, it campaigned for mass education, sanitary awareness, and “social purity”; tried to raise public awareness about the importance and value of social service; and conducted relief work among the urban poor during emergencies such as the influenza pandemic of 1918. Furthermore, the League became a vocal advocate of reforms in the sphere of local self-government and called for greater state investment in welfare activities that would bring about civic equity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212449145">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indian nationalists also took an active part in municipal affairs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212449145">17</xref></sup> In the late nineteenth century, English-educated Indians in colonial Bombay became increasingly prominent within the city’s Municipal Corporation, challenging the dominance of the city’s colonial and Indian moneyed elites within that institution. Indeed, following the Municipal Act of 1888, which increased the size of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from sixty-four to seventy-two members (of whom half were to be elected by ratepayers), a growing number of Indian lawyers, doctors, and journalists entered its portals. Even though the high property qualifications both for the franchise as well as for membership in the Corporation ensured the continued dominance of local landlords and capitalists within that body, the new professional men who entered the civic arena became its most vocal and active element. Their ascent in urban politics was predicated not only on their familiarity with legal principles and institutional procedures, but also stemmed from their “articulated response to political events” which allowed them “to participate in issues directly involving interests not their own and at the same time to broaden the character of the ensuing movements.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212449145">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The city’s nationalist elite continued to participate actively in municipal politics even after the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885. Indeed, many of its leading lights juggled with dexterity their roles in national and local arenas of politics. The career of the Parsi politician Sir Pherozeshah Mehta offers an excellent illustration of this phenomenon. At one level, the Bombay-born Pherozeshah was a member of that pioneering group of Western-educated men who laid the foundations of the nationalist movement in India. As such, he was an important player in the early Congress, both at the provincial and national level. But simultaneously, Pherozeshah was also a prominent figure in the Bombay civic arena. Most notably, he was one of the leading lights of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from the 1880s until the outbreak of the First World War. When he died in 1915, the conservative <italic>Times of India</italic>, no admirer, observed that,
<disp-quote>
<p>Sir Pherozeshah Mehta’s reputation and work alike extended to the whole country; but the greatest and most strenuous of his labours was the unselfish and devoted work he performed for nearly half a century for the advancement of the city of Bombay, the interests of which came first and foremost to him. Despite the attractions of the larger arena of Imperial politics he, with untiring industry and striking self-abnegation, sacrificed a great portion of his time in the narrower sphere of local self-government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212449145">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Significantly, politicians like Pherozeshah Mehta eschewed the “nationalist” label within the civic arena. Instead, they projected themselves as “public leaders” who stood above the pursuit of sectional interests. Of course, the term <italic>public</italic> seldom encompassed the entire urban population; women and the urban poor were usually excluded from the category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212449145">20</xref></sup> Moreover, the rhetoric of the Anglophone Indian elite “was often disciplined by parsimony” and its ideals subordinated at times to “harsher calculations of particular interests.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212449145">21</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the civic ideology that this elite espoused “served to ensure a certain minimum in standards of governance and in public expectations about the city’s institutions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212449145">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Douglas Haynes has shown in his seminal study of urban politics in colonial Surat, English-educated Indian politicians and publicists invoked norms and principles drawn from a British liberal vocabulary: ideas such as “improvement,” “progress” and the “public good.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212449145">23</xref></sup> According to Haynes, the educated Indian elite adopted the keywords of this civic discourse because it was “especially compelling to the colonial rulers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212449145">24</xref></sup> One consequence of adopting an “alien” language of politics, he suggests, is that educated Indians were confined within a “conceptual straitjacket” that “reshaped rather than undermined colonial hegemony.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212449145">25</xref></sup> In particular, their rhetoric “implicitly acknowledged the colonial view that India was behind Britain in its evolutionary development and that it could prepare to assume a greater role in self-government only gradually.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212449145">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arguably, however, members of the Anglophone Indian elite in Bombay had internalized liberal ideals of citizenship and the common good; they did not simply invoke these principles in an instrumental fashion. Moreover, as these ideas were gradually “vernacularized” among the city’s bi-lingual middle classes they ceased to be regarded as a foreign import and instead became deeply entrenched in Bombay’s civic culture. Equally, when it came to their own participation in the institutions of local self-government, the Anglophone Indian elite was persistently critical of the historicist assumptions of the Civilian Raj. Indeed, it was precisely because they regarded themselves as being ready and well equipped to take charge within the local civic arena that Indian nationalists in Bombay fiercely opposed official control over municipal affairs.</p>
<p>The political stance adopted by these liberal nationalists was decidedly more contentious than that of the old Indian aristocracy of wealth, which had tended to deploy deference as a way of making claims on the colonial state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212449145">27</xref></sup> In particular, they strove vigorously to uphold public norms within the civic arena and relentlessly criticized the Civilian Raj when it failed to adhere to them. At the same time, they were also very sensitive to any attempts on the part of the colonial state to disregard or undermine their status as public leaders. The visit of the Prince of Wales to Bombay in November 1905 is a good case in point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212449145">28</xref></sup> As part of its official welcome, the provincial government had constituted a reception committee to receive the royal party when it disembarked at the city’s Apollo Bunder. Contrary to precedent, however, it excluded from this committee the President and Commissioner of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Since Pherozeshah Mehta was the President of the Corporation at the time, educated Indians perceived the government’s action as a deliberate slight. They were particularly aggrieved because of the importance that they themselves accorded to such imperial rituals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212449145">29</xref></sup> Following an agitated meeting of the Indian members of the Corporation, Pherozeshah informed the Government of Bombay that the omission of the “representative Heads of the Municipality and the City had been considered as a disregard of the importance of the City” and was therefore “calculated to seriously wound the feelings of the people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212449145">30</xref></sup> While his letter was keen to emphasize that the Corporation wanted to avoid any action that “would in any way mar that harmony and good feeling which the City is anxious and determined shall mark the reception of the distinguished Visitors,” Pherozeshah nonetheless signalled obliquely to the Government of Bombay that this was precisely what would happen if they did not reverse their decision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212449145">31</xref></sup> His barely veiled threat had the intended effect: the Government of Bombay capitulated and included the President of the Municipal Corporation in the reception committee.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the personal considerations that might have triggered such incidents, it is significant that the leading lights of the Anglophone elite cast their arguments in a distinctive language of civic identity. For instance, in the example cited above, Pherozeshah argued that “the importance of the City as a unit in the administrative divisions of Western India entitles its Representatives . . . to special and marked consideration, which no question of ordinary official precedence should be allowed to affect.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212449145">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consider, too, the extraordinary “Battle of the Clocks” that animated local politics in Bombay in the early twentieth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212449145">33</xref></sup> The controversy erupted in July 1905 when the Government of India, invoking the imperatives of science, civilization, and commerce, introduced a “Standard Time” for the whole country. While other parts of India fell in line quickly and adopted the measure, the city of Bombay proved to be a recalcitrant exception. With Pherozeshah at the helm, Indian nationalists in the Bombay Municipal Corporation orchestrated a public movement against the decision, and succeeded in overturning an earlier decision by the Corporation to adopt the new time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212449145">34</xref></sup> They thereby inaugurated a tradition of local resistance to Standard Time that outlasted colonial rule in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212449145">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The supporters of “Bombay Time,” which was thirty nine and a half minutes behind Indian Standard Time, argued against the latter on two grounds. First, they stressed that Bombay had its own special status as a city and “could not be treated as if it were a portion of the mofussil.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212449145">36</xref></sup> Second, they contended that as “public leaders” it was their duty to oppose a decision that had been taken without proper consultation and which was opposed by a majority of the city’s Indian inhabitants. Speaking in the Bombay Municipal Corporation’s debate on the issue, Pherozeshah declared:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is not fair and proper that the population of this City should be driven like a flock of dumb cattle because the Chamber of Commerce and the Port Trust adopted Standard Time regardless of the special circumstances of the City of Bombay. This is one of the things which has influenced me . . . to enter a strong protest against an action of this character—a measure adopted by Government without consulting the feelings and sentiments of the people and without giving them an opportunity of expressing their opinion. Perhaps it is a matter of mere sentiment and prejudice, but I will always take a pride in standing up for the integrity, the dignity and the independence of the immense population of the City of Bombay.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212449145">37</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such affirmations of civic identity and invocation of public principles were “inextricably tied to the political processes of contending for power, status, and funding within the Raj.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212449145">38</xref></sup> At the same time, however, the local patriotism and pride displayed by Bombay’s nationalist elite was always accompanied by avowals of profound loyalty to the British Crown.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212449145">39</xref></sup> For instance, in his address of welcome to the Prince of Wales in 1905, Pherozeshah Mehta declared that “Bombay has been long associated with the Royal Family of England, and may justly lay claim to be a Royal City.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212449145">40</xref></sup> Moreover, Pherozeshah, like many Indian nationalists of this era, regarded British rule in India as “providential.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212449145">41</xref></sup> Thus, on another occasion, he argued that British rule in India was “a dispensation so wonderful—a little island set at one end of the world establishing itself in a far continent as different as could be—that it would be folly not to accept it as a declaration of God’s will.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212449145">42</xref></sup> Indeed, it was this very affirmation of the imperial bond that enabled Bombay’s Anglophone Indian elite to critique the actions of the Civilian Raj.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212449145">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus far, we have considered the ways in which English-educated members of the Indian elite challenged the primacy of the Civilian Raj in the urban civic arena. But the nationalist engagement with the public life of the colonial city also reveals another logic at work. Anglophone Indians had also imbibed both the colonial ethic of “improvement” as well as modern conventions regarding the disciplined conduct of the self within the public sphere. As a consequence, they shared with colonial ruling authorities a belief in the need “to make the bazaar, the street, the <italic>mela</italic>—the arenas for collective action in pre-British India—benign, regulated places, clean and healthy, incapable of producing either disease or disorder.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212449145">44</xref></sup> Simultaneously, as the new, self-proclaimed leaders of Indian society, the quest for social sovereignty rendered it equally imperative for nationalists “to obtain the obedience of the poor” to their norms of “respectability.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212449145">45</xref></sup> This ideal consisted of an amalgam of redefined elite Hindu and Islamic pious norms and Victorian moral strictures about appropriate public and domestic conduct. Thus, “the mission of social and moral reform was a central element in the relation of the Indian elites to those whom they identified as the poor and the lower classes.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212449145">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>The turn of the twentieth century saw a critical shift in this regard. Prior to this, Indian nationalists had recast the ideals associated with the “inner domain” of a putatively authentic indigenous tradition and fiercely defended it as a privileged site of national cultural autonomy. In the early years of the new century, however, they came to project these norms and values onto the “outer domain” of the public sphere. To this end, they sought to “civilize” the urban poor by disciplining their public conduct in a variety of ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212449145">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>In colonial Bombay, zealous middle-class activists, who regarded themselves as “liberal” Hindus, Muslims, and Parsis, targeted all those plebeian collective practices that were seen to contravene the norms of “respectable” public behavior. For instance, they repeatedly targeted alcohol consumption among Bombay’s working classes and called for liquor shops to be closed on occasions such as festivals. The Indian press frequently publicized the connection between liquor drinking and the propensity of the lower orders to indulge in “degenerate” and “licentious” social behavior. The “respectable classes” also launched temperance movements to counter the spread of the “drink habit” and encourage “purity” and “thrift” among the city’s laboring poor. Similarly, they vociferously supported the colonial government’s efforts to suppress the popular modes of observing Muharram. In particular, the middle classes objected to the elements of the carnivalesque that marked the plebeian participation in its rituals of commemoration, viewing these as a sign of the increasing “degeneracy” of the lower orders. Likewise, Hindu reformers in Bombay found repugnant the popular mode of celebrating <italic>Holi</italic> (the Hindu festival of colors that heralds the onset of spring) in the city. Their unease with this “saturnalia” of the “masses” prompted them to undertake “social purity” campaigns that sought to “improve” the moral tone of the working classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212449145">48</xref></sup> Interestingly, it was one such Hindu endeavor that eventually led to the establishment of the Social Service League, an avowedly liberal nationalist voluntary association whose professed ideals were suffused with terms and concepts drawn from British civic discourse.</p>
<p>However, in highlighting middle-class agency in the colonial metropolis it would be unwise to diminish the challenges and constraints that it faced from above and below. For instance, colonial authorities in this period were able to call on the support of diverse interest groups in quelling the nationalist challenge. Indeed, on one infamous occasion even Pherozeshah Mehta, the “uncrowned king” of the Bombay Municipal Corporation as his followers fondly imagined him, was laid low by the machinations of colonial officials. In the municipal elections of 1907, a “caucus” consisting of prominent European officials and nonofficials, stung by his growing influence within the Corporation, mobilized the city’s six hundred–odd Justices of the Peace to vote against Pherozeshah, whom they had traditionally elected as one of their sixteen representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212449145">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Civilian Raj in Bombay grew increasingly intolerant of its nationalist antagonists during the First World War. Most notably, toward the end of the war colonial authorities cracked down on nationalist newspapers like the <italic>Bombay Chronicle</italic>, which had consistently adopted a critical stance toward their policies. As part of this counteroffensive strategy, the government of Bombay tried to put pressure on the owners of the <italic>Chronicle</italic> to rein in Benjamin Horniman, its popular Irish editor. When that move failed to yield the desired result, it invoked the newly amended Defence of India rules in April 1919 to deport Horniman from the country.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212449145">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, middle-class nationalists were equally frustrated in their attempts to impose their own social sovereignty over Bombay’s poor. Indeed, their putative cultural hegemony over the city’s working classes remained an aspiration rather than an achievement. For instance, the moral crusades of middle-class moralists to inculcate the virtues of temperance and thrift in the urban poor appear to have ended in dismal failure. Thus one contemporary reformer ruefully admitted that despite the efforts of the various temperance societies, “the people had since returned to their old habits and there was not now a very small proportion of them who did not drink and who had been able to save money.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212449145">51</xref></sup> The travails of the Social Service League in these years are equally instructive, for the fervor of its activists was seldom reciprocated by the intended objects of their solicitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212449145">52</xref></sup></p>

<title>III</title>
<p>The relationship between middle-class nationalism and the colonial metropolis was dramatically transformed during the interwar decades as Bombay witnessed new forms of political action that offered a sustained challenge to the Raj. The catalyst here was the First World War, during the course of which several factors simultaneously acted to rapidly politicize many different sectors of Indian society. These included the economic hardship and social dislocation caused by the war effort, the imminent prospect of constitutional reforms, the emergence of Mahatma Gandhi on the political stage, the new discourse of “national self-determination,” and the outbreak of the Bolshevik Revolution. By the end of the war, the stage was thus set for an explosion of popular movements on a scale never before seen in the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212449145">53</xref></sup> There emerged a new generation of middle-class activists and publicists who, largely inspired by Gandhi, took on the colonial establishment in a more stridently confrontational manner. Over the course of the next two decades, these men and women developed new modes of political action that decisively undermined British sovereignty over the colonial city.</p>
<p>Gandhian political discourse and practice rejected many of the premises that had governed the political relationship between the colonial state and the Anglophone Indian elite prior to the First World War. In particular, Gandhian nationalists steered “civic discourse away from its moorings in evolutionary thought,” and replaced it with a new “political language in which service to the nation, the people, and public good was radically dissociated from the notions of loyalty, progress, the law, and responsible self-government.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212449145">54</xref></sup> Significantly, their public rhetoric “rejected liberal discourse as the standard by which a people’s capacity for self-rule was to be assessed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144212449145">55</xref></sup> In particular, as Dipesh Chakrabarty has noted, nationalists in the interwar years questioned the “developmental time” of colonial liberalism, countering the “not yet” of its political discourse with a fierce insistence on the “now.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212449145">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>This transformation in the terms of civic discourse had a far-reaching impact on urban politics in interwar western India. As Gandhian nationalists entered colonial civic institutions in the 1920s and 1930s, they decisively broke with the longstanding convention that the civic realm ought to be “above politics.”</p>
<p>In June 1922, three Bombay politicians—Vithalbhai J. Patel, Jamnadas M. Mehta, and B. N. Motiwalla—convened a public meeting and formed the Nationalist Municipal Party (NMP).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212449145">57</xref></sup> Under the leadership of Vithalbhai Patel, and then subsequently K. F. Nariman, the NMP was “ideologically close to the Gandhian Congress.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212449145">58</xref></sup> Its first election manifesto “laid down that every member of the Party was required to sign the creed of the Indian National Congress and to pledge himself to assist in carrying out, both inside and outside the Corporation, the Party’s policy of securing the greatest civic good.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212449145">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NMP performed quite creditably in the civic elections of January 1923—the first to be held under a reformed municipal constitution that extended the franchise to persons paying a monthly rent of ten rupees—securing 35 out of a total of 76 directly elected seats. In the years that followed, the party championed the interests of a range of middling groups that had hitherto been excluded from the Municipal Corporation. Thus it demanded a fully elected Corporation, a Municipal Commissioner elected by the councillors (instead of a government-appointed official), the “decentralisation” of municipal governance, “a further lowering of the rental franchise,” and the “municipalisation” of essential utilities and services.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212449145">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>While it was unable to achieve many of these goals and became increasingly hobbled by internal factional squabbles, the NMP did succeed in achieving some of its demands, such as the right to make speeches in the local vernaculars and to allow the general public to attend the proceedings of the Corporation. Nationalists also deployed with great success a variety of populist tactics in undermining the legalistic protocols and norms that had hitherto governed the functioning of the municipality.</p>
<p>Equally noteworthy is the change in political tone that the NMP introduced into the Corporation Hall. This was explicitly antagonistic both toward the old guard within the Corporation and the provincial government. For instance, nationalists contested the convention whereby the Corporation accorded addresses of welcome to incoming and outgoing Governors and other visiting imperial dignitaries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212449145">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>A rising generation of Indian politicians in late colonial Bombay also sought to use their position with the municipality to pursue civic projects based on ideals of “constructive nationalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212449145">62</xref></sup> As Nandini Gooptu has shown in the context of interwar North Indian towns, “an urban-based civic vision developed among the newly enfranchised middle classes, in which they saw urban local institutions and towns as centres of modernisation and progress.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212449145">63</xref></sup> While the internal coherence of this vision should not be overstated, the resultant civic activism nonetheless served to consolidate the growing political dominance of middle-class nationalists within the urban arena.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212449145">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, while the imperatives of conducting mass politics required nationalist politicians to treat the subaltern as “fully capable of making citizenly choices that colonial rule withheld from him or her,” advocates of constructive nationalism continued to adhere to the “idea of developmental time” and the “pedagogical project” of “educating” the subaltern classes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212449145">65</xref></sup> In particular, Indian nationalists residing in the cities sought to transform the urban poor into “fit and proper members of the community” by making them “conform to projects of civic development and nationalism.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212449145">66</xref></sup> Thus, local nationalist activists and politicians in Bombay undertook a variety of “welfare” programs designed to reform, uplift, and discipline the poor. For instance, S.K. Patil, an upcoming nationalist leader in the late 1930s and early 1940s, was said to have “consistently championed the cause of the poor and down-trodden” and “initiated several measures on behalf of the Congress Municipal Party regarding improvements in sanitation, slum clearance, finances, water-supply, education and Harijan uplift work.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144212449145">67</xref></sup> Likewise, Jamnadas Mehta, a prominent nationalist and labor leader within the Bombay Municipal Corporation in the interwar years, “set himself with the task of helping and promoting all measures for improvement of health, education, water-supply, clearance of slums and other social welfare activities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144212449145">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>But nationalist politics within the civic arena was not without its ironies in the interwar years. Most notably, from the late 1920s onwards, even though nationalists had a much greater voice in the sphere of local self-government, the Congress Party generally tended to subordinate the politics of the urban civic arena to the imperatives of waging the anticolonial struggle at the national level. Equally, as the Congress grew in size and influence, its local leaders became enamored by the prospects open to them at the higher levels of the power structure. As a result, they were less inclined to remain circumscribed by the narrower sphere of politics in which they had first earned their spurs, thereby further diminishing the significance of municipal government. Furthermore, as the Congress organization grew more centralized by the late 1930s, nationalist politicians in the city had less scope to act autonomously within the domain of municipal politics.</p>
<p>Of course, the impact of Gandhian politics on the city went far beyond the confines of the Corporation Hall. Gandhi, as Sunil Khilnani has remarked, “invented ways in which Indians could occupy and act in the public spaces of the Raj.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144212449145">69</xref></sup> Integral to the Gandhian techniques of mass mobilization and public protest was the explicit transgression of colonial laws and regulations. “The nationalist repertoire of oppositional acts,” Gooptu has noted, “was forged to signify variously defiance of authority, protest against exclusion from power in the apparatus of government . . . challenge to the legitimacy of the established order, as well as assertion of political rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144212449145">70</xref></sup> In the process, Gandhian activists transformed the spaces of the colonial city into veritable theatres of popular politics by engineering dramatic moments of confrontation with the agencies of the state. Indeed, such public spectacles were constitutive of the very political community in whose name nationalists claimed to act and thereby maximized its visibility.</p>
<p>Gandhian nationalism in Bombay produced an impressive array of political spectacles—<italic>hartals</italic>, flag salutations, dawn marches, sit-downs, pickets, parades, and processions—that reinscribed the city’s public arenas as nationalist space. In the campaign against the Rowlatt Act in 1919 and the Non-Cooperation movement of 1920-1922, such carefully choreographed rituals of resistance were usually enacted in the Gujarati and Maharashtrian localities of the Indian Town. Occasionally, too, very large nationalist gatherings were held at Chowpatty beach on the western foreshore of the island, which served as a “point of intersection” between the European- and Indian-dominated parts of the city. However, during of the Civil Disobedience movement a decade later, Gandhian nationalists began to lay claim to the spaces hitherto dominated by Bombay’s colonial elite. In particular, the Esplanade Maidan in South Bombay, a vast open space that was the physical and symbolic center of the British political and business establishment within the city, was renamed Azad Maidan (“Freedom Park”) and became the principal site for staging nationalist spectacles of collective defiance and protest. In August 1930, the Satyagraha Committee of the Bombay Provincial Congress declared that it was “the inherent right of every citizen to use the Azad (Esplanade) Maidan, for purposes of congregation, exercise, drill or such other purposes as are non-violent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144212449145">71</xref></sup> It therefore called upon “the citizens of Bombay to exercise that right undeterred by any orders or ordinances which are meant to throttle all expression of freedom.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144212449145">72</xref></sup> In the months that followed, nationalist demonstrations at the Azad Maidan and the unfailingly brutal police response to them became set piece occasions that dramatized the conflict between the forces of nationalism and imperialism.</p>
<p>Not all nationalist public rituals were necessarily as fractious. For instance, the early months of the Civil Disobedience movement in Bombay saw the emergence of <italic>prabhat pheris</italic>: “small bands of people who most mornings paraded through the city streets, singing patriotic songs and urging householders to do their duty for their country and their fellows.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144212449145">73</xref></sup> Even though one police report claimed that “every street and every chawl had its Prabhat Pheris,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144212449145">74</xref></sup> a majority of them were concentrated in the “Marathi and Gujarati middle-class and service areas—Girgaum, Bhuleshwar, Kalbadevi, Thakurdwar, and so on.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144212449145">75</xref></sup> While the <italic>pheris</italic> were occasionally involved in tense encounters with the police—usually when they participated in the flag salutation ceremonies—the singing groups were generally less confrontational in their activities. But they were no less effective in sapping the morale of the city’s ruling authorities. Thus, the early hour at which the <italic>pheris</italic> commenced to move about the town, and the “awful nuisance” created by their musical endeavors drove colonial officials to distraction. Indeed, as Jim Masselos has noted, the official mind was “as much concerned with the pheris for their early morning noise as for the ‘inflammatory’ and ‘seditous’ aspects of their activities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144212449145">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of the rituals of collective resistance devised by Gandhian nationalists proclaimed their own sovereignty over the colonial city. Of these, the most potent was the <italic>hartal</italic>—a simultaneous stoppage of all economic and commercial activities within the city. Even though this form of collective protest was not entirely unknown in Bombay prior to the First World War, it was in the interwar years that it became a powerful tool of nationalist resistance. The <italic>hartal</italic> as a new form of coordinated public action was first used to devastating effect in the spring of 1919 following the colonial state’s decision to extend wartime restrictions on civil liberties. As a mark of protest against the “Rowlatt Bills,” Gandhi and his associates orchestrated a “National Humiliation Day” on April 6, 1919, which caused a general cessation of all economic activity and brought large numbers of Indians out onto the streets. In Bombay, the movement was “a resounding success,” with eighty per cent of shops and businesses in the city—“including the cloth, fish and vegetable markets”—downing shutters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144212449145">77</xref></sup> Subsequently, Gandhian nationalists in the city organized successful <italic>hartals</italic> on a number of occasions, most notably, the deportation of Horniman (1919), the Khilafat movement (1919), the visit of the Prince of Wales (1921), the arrival of the Simon Commission (1928), and the Civil Disobedience movement (1930-1932). Over time, however, the <italic>hartal</italic> lost some of its potency as a political weapon because of the propensity of local Congress activists to deploy it indiscriminately, and in ways that did not always adhere to the Mahatma’s teachings.</p>
<p>Gandhian activists also asserted their authority over the public spaces of the city by seeking to purge it of all those activities that they deemed “anti-national.” In particular, during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Civil Disobedience movement, Congress activists regularly picketed shops that stocked and sold foreign cloth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144212449145">78</xref></sup> They castigated the use of foreign cloth as an unpatriotic act, detrimental to nationalist goals of economic self-reliance and inimical to the interests of Indian industry. Similarly, nationalist volunteers sought to impose Gandhian ideals of purity and piety on the urban public sphere by targeting liquor shops. Foreign liquor, in particular, “symbolized wealth and was readily identified with the customs and habits of the colonial rulers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144212449145">79</xref></sup> During the anticolonial mass movements of the 1920s and 1930s, those who visited liquor shops were invariably surrounded and jeered at by the nationalist activists stationed outside. Thus, in one instance in June 1930, a group of picketers “worked itself up to a pitch of considerable excitement and man-handled an Indian Christian and a Sikh” as they came out of the Liberty Bar on Girgaum Road. The two men were “pushed and jostled for some time and ultimately allowed to go after their faces were smeared with black polish.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144212449145">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with its claims to sovereignty within the colonial city, popular nationalism also developed its own calendar of significant events and commemorative rituals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144212449145">81</xref></sup> For instance, on May 25, 1923, the All India Congress Committee decided at its meeting in Bombay to institute a new “secular ceremony” to celebrate and commemorate the nation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144212449145">82</xref></sup> It therefore designated the last Sunday of every month as national “Flag Day.” Drawing both on the model offered by the Empire Day rituals as well as elements from within Indian tradition, the Flag Day “was designed as a reminder of a common Indian identity, struggle, and goal.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144212449145">83</xref></sup> The first commemoration of Flag Day took place in July 1923 and, as Arundhati Virmani has shown, in the following two decades “it became a permanent fixture, though performed with varying degrees of intensity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144212449145">84</xref></sup> It not only aroused intensely patriotic sentiments among a large number of Indians but also quickly became “a public occasion, a celebratory moment in the community, open to all, political militants as well as ordinary citizens.” Moreover, for participants in its rituals, the Flag Day served to “signify their proclaimed control over their locality and by extension over the entire nation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144212449145">85</xref></sup> In Bombay, the Flag Day ceremonies and the frequent “flag salutation” exercises became an integral element in the nationalist makeover of the colonial city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144212449145">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of the new nationalist rituals were centered on the personality of Mahatma Gandhi and the major events connected with his life and career. On occasions such as “Gandhi Day” or “Gandhi Week,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144212449145">87</xref></sup> markets in the Indian Town promptly downed their shutters and volunteers in their distinctive white khadi uniforms took to the streets, bearing the new “national” flag and singing patriotic songs that exhorted their audience to commit themselves to the nationalist struggle. These processions frequently culminated in large public gatherings at Azad Maidan, Chowpatty, or Shivaji Park.</p>
<p>But Gandhian nationalism was unable to exercise untrammeled sway over the public spaces of the colonial city. For one, even though the colonial state was consistently wrong-footed by Gandhian protest movements, and even though its authority began to diminish rapidly, it still possessed a formidable capacity for political repression. Simultaneously, the Congress bid for hegemony within the urban public arena was challenged by rival ideologies based on class, caste, and religion.</p>
<p>Bombay’s colonial authorities had at their disposal a battery of “special powers” that gave the city’s Police Commissioner considerable latitude in dealing with any threats to “public order” in the city. For instance, the City Police Act empowered officials to “direct the conduct of, and behaviour or action of persons constituting, processions and assemblies in streets.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144212449145">88</xref></sup> If he considered it necessary in the interests of public safety, the Police Commissioner could indefinitely prohibit any such assembly or procession. His powers also encompassed all visual and aural objects and gestures that he construed as a threat to “public peace.” These included, among others, “the public utterances of cries, singing of songs, playing of music”; “the delivery of harangues, the use of gestures or mimetic representation, and the preparation, exhibition or dissemination of pictures, symbols, placards, or of any other object or thing” that might, in his view, “inflame religious animosity or hostility between different classes, or incite to a commission of an offence, to a disturbance of the public peace or to resistance to or contempt of the law.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144212449145">89</xref></sup> As popular nationalism gathered momentum and supporters, colonial authorities invoked their capacious powers in cracking down ferociously on nationalist spectacles in public spaces. Indeed, by the early 1930s, “the willingness of the police to swing their lathis and point their guns at antagonistic or disorderly crowds quickened.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144212449145">90</xref></sup> In the process, they increasingly erased the distinction between “the use of minimum and maximum force.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0096144212449145">91</xref></sup> But colonial tactics of repression proved counterproductive, for they only served to deepen the sense of political solidarity among the nationalist opponents of the Raj.</p>
<p>At the same time, unity in the face of colonial repression papered over significant divisions among nationalists. In his early years as the leader of the Congress, Gandhi had to contend both with “radical” nationalists and the remnants of the old “liberal” leadership in the city. The former strand was represented by men like Benjamin Horniman, Umar Sobhani, and Shankerlal Banker, who preferred more “materialist” forms of popular protest to Gandhi’s “spiritual” interpretation of <italic>satyagraha</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0096144212449145">92</xref></sup> The latter comprised men like Dinsha Wacha and Narayan Chandavarkar, who preferred to work through the colonial institutions of representative government in furthering the nationalist cause. After the Non-Cooperation Movement was called off, there also emerged a new element in city politics—the Swaraj Party—whose leaders like Vithalbhai Patel and M. R. Jayakar favored participating in colonial representative institutions rather than opposing them from the outside like the more staunch Gandhian nationalists. Importantly, in their “modernist” ideas and approach to the “urban question” some of these nationalists differed significantly from their Gandhian opponents. Moreover, they were deeply engaged in quotidian civic politics and played a critical role in shaping urban policies during the interwar years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0096144212449145">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the time the Civil Disobedience movement commenced in 1930, the Gandhian Congress also had to face down rival political ideologies within the public arena. The most serious challenge in this period to the hegemonic aspirations of the Congress in Bombay came from the left. Here, the most noteworthy feature was the rise of the Communist-led Girni Kamgar Union (known popularly as the “Red Flag” Union), which had emerged as a key player in labor politics during the historic general strikes of 1928-1929.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0096144212449145">94</xref></sup> The radical manner in which they advocated the cause of labor, and the prominent presence they had established both in the workplace and the neighborhood, enabled the Communists build up an impressive popular following among the city’s working classes by the end of the 1920s. As a consequence, the public spaces of <italic>Girangaon</italic>, the sprawling mill district that literally constituted the heart of the city, were dominated by Communist activists and supporters who constantly assailed the Congress leaders for being in thrall to Indian capitalists. On one notable occasion in March 1931, the Mahatma himself came to address a public meeting at the Kamgar Maidan (“Workers’ Park”) in Parel and “was considerably heckled” by “textile workers owing allegiance to Communist principles.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0096144212449145">95</xref></sup> The workers, “one of whom had a huge red flag in his hand,” had arrived at the meeting place prior to Gandhi’s arrival and “fought their way in.” According to one newspaper report:
<disp-quote>
<p>A keen struggle ensued as to which of the two flags, the Red Flag or the Congress tri-coloured flag, should be given prominence at the meeting. The adherents of the two flags attracted large crowds near the platform. The two flags flew higher and higher in vying alternation for some time until at last a settlement was arrived at between the representatives of the Communist and the Congress sections, as a result of which both the flags were hoisted on the platform, the red flag thus securing pride of place at a Congress meeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0096144212449145">96</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But Congress dominance over the spaces of the city was also challenged in the 1930s by the rise of lower-caste politicians, especially those who voiced the demands of the so-called “Depressed Classes.” The most prominent of these was the charismatic Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who developed a strong following among Bombay’s low-caste workers (especially the Mahars). Ambedkar repeatedly savaged the Gandhian Congress for its paternalistic attitude toward the “Depressed Classes” and his supporters began increasingly to make their presence felt in the public arena. For instance, when Mahatma Gandhi returned to Bombay in December 1931 after attending the Second Round Table Conference in London, he was greeted at Ballard Pier by “hostile demonstrations” organized by the “followers of Dr. Ambedkar.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0096144212449145">97</xref></sup> The <italic>Times of India</italic> reported that the “demonstrators in their thousands were active practically throughout the night, pulling down street decorations and assaulting stray Congress volunteers and those suspected of being followers of Mr. Gandhi who were out early in the discharge of duties in connection with the reception.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0096144212449145">98</xref></sup> This version was hotly disputed by the general secretary of the Depressed Classes Institute, who did not deny that his volunteers “indulged in a provocative attack” but blamed the Congress workers for triggering the violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0096144212449145">99</xref></sup> At any rate, the air was thick with tension by the time the Mahatma disembarked at the pier. The paper’s reporter described the scene thus:
<disp-quote>
<p>On one side were draw up depressed class volunteers in uniform waving black flags to the accompaniment of derisive shouts against Mr. Gandhi and laudatory cries in praise of their leader, while on the other side Congress followers kept up a din of counter-shouts, both sides presenting the appearance of packs of hounds straining at the leash controlled by lines of armed police from flying at each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0096144212449145">100</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The predominantly Hindu idioms and images that suffused Gandhian protest movements also tended to cool the ardor of all but the most fervent Congress supporters among the city’s religious minorities, especially its diverse Muslim population. Even though they participated in the Congress protest movement over the Khilafat issue, the city’s Muslims subsequently held aloof from the popular Civil Disobedience movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0096144212449145">101</xref></sup> Social relations between Hindus and Muslims palpably worsened during the course of the 1930s, resulting in a series of sectarian riots, many of which were triggered by conflicts over the use of urban space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0096144212449145">102</xref></sup> These developments, acting in conjunction with the growing fears of a “Hindu Raj” that developed among some Muslims in the wake of the Congress party’s spectacular performance in the 1937 provincial elections, enabled the Muslim League to build a significant following in the city. This, in turn, led to clashes between the supporters of the League and those of the Congress. For instance, on one occasion in January 1938, Congress volunteers led by one Ali Bahadaur Khan, a member of the newly elected Legislative Assembly, took out a nationalist procession that passed through some of the city’s Muslim-dominated localities. When it reached Bhendi Bazaar, the Congress activists encountered “a hostile crowd that had gathered there” and that followed them all the way to Chowpatty “shouting Muslim League slogans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0096144212449145">103</xref></sup> In another incident that occurred two years later, a “tense situation” arose in Madanpura because two rival flag salutation ceremonies—“one organised by the Muslim League and the other by seven nationalist Muslim organisations”—were held “at the same place and almost at the same time.” However, the presence on the spot “of a large police force” and an unexpected “spirit of accommodation displayed by the leaders of the rival parties . . . saved the situation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0096144212449145">104</xref></sup></p>

<title>IV</title>
<p>To sum up, this essay has argued that while the city may not have figured prominently in nationalist <italic>thought</italic>, it nonetheless occupied a central place in nationalist <italic>political practice</italic>. Far from being passive and alienated from the colonial city, Indian middle class activists, publicists, and politicians played a key role in influencing its public culture. Through their investment in, and engagement with the “urban question” during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Indian nationalists contested the iniquities and exclusions of colonial rule. Notably, they invoked British civic norms and practices in seeking a greater stake in the governance of the colonial city. Simultaneously, the Anglophone middle classes also drew on refashioned conceptions of Indian tradition in seeking to impose their own authority and notions of respectable conduct on the urban public sphere.</p>
<p>In the interwar decades, Gandhian politics significantly refashioned the relationship between nationalism and the city. The public spaces of the street corner and the <italic>maidan</italic> now emerged as key sites of nationalist politics. Nationalist spectacles in such public spaces were, as Thomas Blom Hansen has noted of Bombay in another time and another context, “generative” political moments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0096144212449145">105</xref></sup> Nationalist activists constructed and made visible the nation through such emotionally charged collective rituals and, in doing so, reclaimed the colonial city.</p>
<p>But if the city was so central to India’s political modernity, what of the paradox Chatterjee highlighted? Why did nationalist ideologues and activists devote so little energy to reimagining the city? This essay has argued that Chatterjee’s answer to the question was unsatisfactory, but the original question nonetheless remains valid. Here, it may be worth considering an alternative proposition. Perhaps it was because they were so irrevocably alienated from the village that the nationalist middle classes were able to make it an object of intellectual scrutiny and political reform. And conversely, perhaps it was because they had invested so heavily in the city and come to make it their own that nationalists had little inclination to rethink its future.</p>

Such views have also been expressed by other scholars. For instance, Gyan Prakash has noted that the “city occupies an ambivalent place in the Indian nationalist imagination.” According to Prakash, Indian nationalists “looked to the village in defining India,” since it represented an authentic, “inner” domain, “where the nation was sovereign” and, unlike the city, unsullied by the corrupting forces of Western modenity.

<p>I use the term <italic>nationalism</italic> in the sense that Anthony D.

Smith, <italic>Nationalism: Theory, Ideology and History</italic> (Cambridge, 2001), 9. Prior to the end of the First World War, most nationalists in colonial India saw their quest for greater autonomy as being compatible with their status as subjects of the British Empire. From the 1920s, however, the idea of national autonomy and identity entailed an outright rejection and overthrow of British rule.</p></fn>
