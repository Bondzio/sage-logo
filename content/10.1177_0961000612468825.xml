<p>This text attempts to illustrate not only how Web 2.0 technologies are being implemented by public libraries, but also the more difficult questions around the understanding of what these technologies represent and their significance for library services. The importance of these latter questions cannot be overstated and the need to look beyond the functionality of technologies and into the reality of how they might embed themselves within the cultural baggage of contemporary organizational behaviour is a worthy if ambitious challenge for any text. In the opening chapter, the distinction between incremental and revolutionary change is used to present the need to also balance what can practically be achieved. Managing change is, therefore, central to this text, as it should be. It is a key theme for professionals looking to have a richer understanding of how to operate within an environment that is characterized by rapid, often bewildering ‘progress’.</p>
<p>The need to define Web 2.0 was always going to be a challenge for this text and it meets this by carefully outlining the <italic>hierarchy of implementation</italic> and by focusing on this as a key issue for librarians. This challenge amounts to the willingness and the ability of library staff to engage with the interactivity that has come to characterize the Web. This might not seem particularly difficult, but it is clearly stated here that this fundamentally requires the information professional to ‘lay on the line’ their control and their authority within the wider discourse. Indeed the legitimacy of the librarians’ ‘voice’ in relation to their professional context is exposed and in this sense the challenge is a very significant one. Where else do we witness this voluntary surrender of legitimacy? If the voice of the professional librarian is to place itself within the context of Web 2.0 it risks being subsumed, ridiculed and ultimately lost if it is not able to operate effectively within this context. So, in raising the question of how ready the profession might be to engage with Web 2.0 and by identifying it as a challenge this text does present a succinct and important pointer to the position of the information professional within the emerging context. How much <italic>radical trust</italic> is out there?</p>
<p>Essentially the consideration of just how library services are attempting to develop Web 2.0-based services is a description of how these services are struggling to appreciate the implications of engaging in genuine Web 2.0 activities. The shift from a <italic>one-to-many</italic> model to a <italic>many-to-many</italic> model which is clearly at the heart of the definition is, at best, at a very early stage. Therefore, interesting as the examples are, the text inevitably falls foul of its own format – it is inevitably fighting a losing battle to present current examples. Nevertheless, there is a good focus maintained on the principal issue here, and that is the willingness or ability to genuinely engage with the two-way process that largely defines Web 2.0. Here the picture is presented clearly. Unfortunately this is one where a service is often willing to push information out but less willing to receive it and even more less willing to act upon it. This lack of a collaborative engagement is an important and relevant message to deliver and certainly justifies the question mark’s use in the title.</p>

<p>If it is not the librarian’s intention to interact, then the fact that blogs and social networking services go without feedback is of little concern, until, of course, someone, usually in senior management wonders what benefit is derived. (p. 58)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This level of candour is the main strength of this text, along with its ability to keep its eye on the key question. This comes out particularly clearly in the consideration of folksonomies.</p>
<p>The consideration of UK-based examples and how they relate to the O’Reilly hierarchy of levels of engagement clearly illustrates that currently in practice there is still some substance to the challenge being faced by public libraries, even where considerable progress can be seen. The shift from the national (the People’s Network) to the local initiatives encapsulates this challenge and illustrates just how services can reach a level of engagement that is genuinely collaborative. The introduction of Web 2.0 is a practical issue and one that needs to be managed effectively. The obstacles here are as relevant as the differences in the perception of the functionality of the technologies being deployed. It is clearly not enough to understand or appreciate what technologies might do but also what managers might be able to achieve in attempting to integrate this understanding into existing services.</p>
<p>This practical perspective includes the potential management of Web 2.0 projects and in providing a step-by-step guide this text certainly presents a common sense approach to implementation. However, there is a disengagement at this point from the technology being considered. Specifically, there is no consideration given to how the potential community itself might help to form that community, to help drive and develop the business case and so on. Here more explicit consideration of key literature around Communities of Practice, for example, might have helped to inform this particular area and suggest where and how Web 2.0 itself might be integrated into this process. After all, the key point made throughout is about commitment to and awareness of the implication of Web 2.0 and to an extent the text might be accused of not applying its own message.</p>
<p>Finally, in considering possible future ‘ideas’ the text rather disappointingly fails to deliver any coherent message beyond these ideas. To an extent the issue of delivering local services in a global context is rather superficially considered and the key point around the building of a community and of building on the existing strengths of the library is focused too much on practical concerns. Important as these are, perhaps there was a need to illustrate how Web 2.0 itself might address this and create an opportunity or develop ideas that allow us to manage these services in innovative ways.</p>
