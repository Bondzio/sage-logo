<p>The author, ZhongXiang Zhang, is well known for his numerous articles on China’s carbon emission policies and international reception of these policies over the past 15 years. A slim volume, <italic>Energy and Environmental Policy in China</italic> is a compilation of five talks that Zhang was invited to present, as well as introductory and concluding chapters. The book’s contents are narrower in scope than the title suggests and the book mainly focuses on the Chinese central government’s efforts to reduce the increase in carbon dioxide emissions and the country’s position in climate negotiations, in particular with the United States.</p>
<p>In the introduction, Zhang states that China has faced considerable pressure both domestically and internationally to be more ambitious in combating climate change. Industrialization and urbanization have been driving China to ever higher levels of energy consumption resulting in increasingly serious pollution, and China is the world’s largest carbon emitter. China’s pledge to reduce its carbon intensity between 2005 and 2020 by 40 to 45 per cent is an indicator of its commitment to decouple energy use and carbon emissions from economic growth. However, Zhang believes that the devolution of decision-making to provincial and local governments will make it difficult to reach this target and to fulfil other commitments to combat climate change. He suggests that changing the distribution of tax receipts towards a greater share for local governments would contribute to a greater willingness to comply with emission targets, but how this would work as an incentive is not clear. The National Development and Reform Commission has imposed fines in an attempt to deter local utilities from offering preferential energy tariffs to large energy-intensive industries, but local governments cannot be expected to go against the interests of their own enterprises. Zhang reasons that if energy conservation and environmental performance were included in the overall evaluation of local officials’ performances, they might become more oriented towards developmental <italic>quality</italic> rather than to economic growth per se.</p>
<p>Zhang has little to say about market-based instruments, such as higher prices for energy and cars. He claims that the elimination of Chinese export tax rebates on steel and aluminium in 2007 have ‘taken out at least part, if not all, of the competitive pressure that is at the heart of carbon leakage debates … the CO<sub>2</sub> prices embedded in these taxes are very much in the same range as the average price of the EU allowances’. However, the fact remains that as part of its industrial and export-oriented policies China has continued to push domestic production of steel (currently almost one-half of the world’s total), aluminium and chemicals. It imports ever-increasing amounts of coal, iron ore and other raw materials in order to produce energy-intensive export products.</p>
<p>The road map to 2050 that Zhang presents for China’s climate commitments is the same as the one he presented at the 2009 Copenhagen Conference: a period of increased energy conservation and use of clean energy from 2013, voluntary ‘no-lose’ emission targets from 2018, and internationally binding carbon intensity targets from 2023 to 2027. Absolute emission caps should be set very carefully only at some point in time thereafter ‘in such a way to aim for global convergence of per capita emissions by 2050 … China should avoid overshooting these emission caps’. The East–West Center – to which Zhang is affiliated – commented at that time that this was a ‘reasoned exposition of the likely Chinese negotiating position … which probably accords with China’s long-term strategy on climate change … but is unlikely to satisfy US negotiators or delay for very long US trade and investment penalties aimed at China’. That latter problem is addressed in a lengthy chapter on the carbon tariffs proposed by the United States, scrutiny by the World Trade Organization (WTO), and China’s responses. Border carbon adjustment measures such as those proposed by the European Commission in 2009 and the Waxman–Markey and Kerry–Boxer bills in the United States are strongly opposed by China as a violation of WTO rules and the Kyoto principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’. Zhang foresees formidable technical and political difficulties, and pleads for sufficient time to reach agreements through negotiations first. One should seek for comparable climate change mitigation efforts by various countries and industrial sectors, rather than unilaterally impose tariffs and absolute standards.</p>
<p>Zhang is disappointingly brief about renewable and alternative energy sources. For instance, he could have discussed China’s successes in obtaining clean development mechanism subsidies for wind and hydropower projects as well as recent rejections because additionality had been artificially created as a result of tariffs that were set too low. He rightly points out that with China’s great dependence on coal, capture and storage technologies should be pursued with greater effort if China is to succeed in capping greenhouse gas emissions in the decades to come. Coal is king in China and there is no emperor to command a low-carbon economy.</p>
