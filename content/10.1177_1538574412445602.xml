<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms has emerged as a major treatment option in the post-International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) era.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412445602">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412445602">2</xref>
</sup> Endovascular treatment of aneurysms is less invasive than surgical clipping, but there remains concern regarding the long-term results. Recurrence rates around 30% (28.6%-33.6%) have been reported in some series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412445602">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412445602">4</xref>
</sup> There seem to be evidence that the majority of aneurysm recurrences occur within 2 years from the endovascular procedure,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412445602">4</xref>
</sup> but there are only few reports available concerning long-term follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412445602">5</xref>
</sup> In many patients treated for intracranial aneurysms, there are also aneurysms that are left untreated due to small size or unfavorable geometry. It has previously been reported that in patients with a previous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) de novo aneurysms may develop in 2.3% of cases, whereas enlargement of conservatively treated aneurysms have been reported to occur in 25%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412445602">6</xref>
</sup> In our practice, the follow-up time for all endovascular-treated aneurysms has been at least 3 years after the last procedure and sometimes longer if early controls have shown an unstable result. Follow-up imaging has been performed using digital subtraction angiographies (DSAs) until recently when it was changed to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a time-of-flight sequence (TOF MRA) instead. Due to concern regarding the long-term stability of endovascular-treated aneurysms, we chose to perform a TOF MRA in patients that had previously been discarded from further follow-up as the treatment results had previously been reported as stable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574412445602" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients treated with endovascular coiling at Umeå University Hospital due to intracranial aneurysms between 1996 and 2002 were included in this follow-up study. The follow-up protocol had previously been approved by the ethical committee at Umeå University Hospital. All patients still alive at the time of follow-up in 2010, below the age of 80 years and without contraindications to MRI, were offered an additional MRI investigation (N = 60). All these patients had previously been discarded from further follow-up as treatment results had proven stable at the last DSA follow-up. Forty-four patients (44 of 60, 73.3%) consented to further follow-up.</p>
<p>All patients had previously been treated with endovascular coiling under general anesthesia. Coils and balloons had been used according to the availability and preference of the responsible neuroradiologist. A monoplane apparatus was used before 2001 and a biplane Philips Integris machine (Philips, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with capability for 3-dimensional (3D) visualization of vascular structures has been used since 2001. Complex aneurysms have been treated by remodeling technique since 2000 and with more sophisticated coils such as Trispan (Boston Scientific, Natick) and different 3D coils since 2001. The last DSA follow-up was used as reference and the results of coiling were classified according to the Raymond-Roy classification system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412445602">4</xref></sup>; complete obliteration (class 1), residual neck (class 2), and residual aneurysm (class 3). These DSA images were compared with the performed TOF MRA investigation and images were independently assessed by 2 neuroradiologists. The TOF MRA images were assessed to see if the treatment result could be classified as stable compared with the previous DSA or of if there had been any progression with a neck remnant or if there was filling of the aneurysm sac. The occurrence of de novo aneurysms or progression in size of conservatively treated aneurysms was also evaluated.</p>
<sec id="section3-1538574412445602">
<title>The MR Imaging</title>
<p>A 3D gradient echo time-of-flight sequence was performed. The MR investigations were performed at 10 different MR centers in the northern region of Sweden on MR systems from Philips (Philips), General Electric (General Electric, Fairfield), and Siemens (Siemens, Munich, Germany). One investigation was performed on 1.0 T system (Philips Intera), 4 investigations on a 3 T system (Philips Achieva), and the remaining 39 investigations were performed on 1.5 T systems. The slice thickness was 7 mm in all investigations and the acquisition matrix ranged from 211 × 256 to 800 × 406 with a field of view of 200 × 200 mm resulting in an in-plane acquisition pixel size varying from 0.94 × 0.78 to 0.25 × 0.49 mm. All the 44 investigations were independently assessed to be of good quality by 2 neuroradiologists.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section4-1538574412445602">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Forty-four patients (8 males and 36 females) treated for a total of 53 aneurysms between 1996 and 2002 were included in this follow-up study. Forty patients were treated after a SAH, whereas 4 patients were treated due to nonruptured aneurysms. Only one of the nonruptured aneurysms was symptomatic, a posterior communicating artery aneurysm causing an oculomotor palsy. Forty-nine of the aneurysms were coiled, whereas surgical clipping was performed in 4 aneurysms. Six additional aneurysms were left untreated and only followed angiographically. Mean age at first treatment was 53.8 years (range 24-73 years). Aneurysm location, size, and sack-to-neck ratio in coiled and untreated aneurysms are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412445602">Table 1</xref>. The size of the aneurysm dome (largest diameter) and the sack-to-neck ratio was estimated on a previous DSA investigation.</p>

<p>Of the 49 aneurysms that were coiled, 2 aneurysms showed revascularization and a renewed filling of the aneurysm sac (2 of 49, 4.1%) that required recoiling 6 months (an internal carotid artery [ICA] aneurysm &gt;25 mm, sack-to-neck ratio ≤2) and 4 years (a basilar tip aneurysm &gt;10 mm, sack-to-neck ratio &gt;2) after the initial treatment. According to our routine, all patients were followed with a DSA 3 years after the last endovascular procedure. Assessment of the DSA images (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538574412445602">Table 2</xref>) showed that 23 to 25 aneurysms were considered totally occluded (47% to 51%), whereas 23 to 25 aneurysms had a residual neck (47% to 51%). All these remnants were located centrally in the region of the neck of the aneurysm and surrounded by coil mesh. The neck remnants were irregular in shape and the volume considered insignificant compared with the volume of the coil mesh. The independent assessment of DSA investigations made by our 2 neuroradiologists differed in 2 aneurysms (2 of 49, 4.1%). One patient with a giant ICA aneurysm who had previously been recoiled still showed filling of the aneurysm (2%).</p>

<p>The late follow-up TOF MRA was performed after a mean time of 9.68 (range 6-14) years after the last endovascular treatment and a mean time of 6.86 (range 3-14) years after the last radiological follow-up with a DSA. Independent assessments made by our 2 neuroradiologists showed that the treatment result was unchanged compared with the last DSA follow-up in 46 aneurysms (46 of 49, 93.9%), whereas there was progression of residual neck in 3 of the treated aneurysms (3 of 49, 6.1%). Although both assessments showed the same number of aneurysms with stable appearance or progression of residual neck, different assessments were made in 4 aneurysms (4 of 49, 8.2%). The TOF MRA investigation showed that there was still filling in the base of the aneurysm sac in the previously recoiled giant ICA aneurysm. There was also a slight progression since the last endovascular procedure 8 years earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412445602">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Six patients (6 of 44, 13.6%) with endovascular-treated aneurysms had 6 additional aneurysms that had been treated conservatively. All these aneurysms were in the anterior circulation and had a diameter of the aneurysm dome ranging from 3 to 7 mm. All these aneurysms also had a sack-to-neck ratio ≤2. In the follow-up with a TOF MRA (mean 6.86 years after the last DSA), all these aneurysms were considered  unchanged in size compared with the last DSA. There were no de novo aneurysms found on the TOF MRA investigations.</p>

<sec id="section5-1538574412445602">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Treatment of cerebral aneurysms using endovascular techniques have evolved as a major treatment option, showing a risk reduction in mortality and dependency compared with surgical clipping following an SAH.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412445602">2</xref>
</sup> There may, however, still be concern regarding the long-term stability of aneurysms treated with endovascular techniques and the length of follow-up following treatment. Patients in the ISAT study treated with endovascular coiling have shown an increased risk of rebleeding compared with clipped patients after mean follow-up time of 9 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412445602">7</xref>
</sup> A recent long-term follow-up using MRA showed a change in the obliteration pattern in 41% of treated aneurysms. In this study, 30% of recanalized aneurysms were observed after 12 months of follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412445602">8</xref>
</sup> In our study, we have used a TOF MRA for the evaluation of previously coiled aneurysms that had been discarded from further follow-up. Investigations with contrast-enhanced MRA and TOF MRA have been shown to be at least equivalent to DSA in the characterization of aneurysm remnants after coiling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412445602">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412445602"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412445602">11</xref>
</sup> In our series, there was a relatively high percentage of patients with a residual neck (47%-51%), depending on the assessment made by our 2 neuroradiologists. The treatment result, however, remained remarkably stable at the TOF MRA performed after a mean time of 6.86 years after the last DSA (mean 9.68 years after treatment). In only 6.1% of the aneurysms there was a progression of residual neck. In these cases, retreatment was not performed because the risk of late rebleeding was considered insignificant. Progression of recanalization with filling of the aneurysm sac was not observed in any patient. One patient had an already known filling of the base of the aneurysm since the last DSA and there was only a slight progression on the follow-up TOF MRA. Previously, recanalization rates ranging from 26.4% to 35.6% have been reported when follow-up times have been significantly shorter than reported in our series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412445602">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412445602">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412445602">12</xref>
</sup> One must, however, conclude that our series represent a selected group of patients and that selection bias may affect our results. Some patients who received endovascular treatment due to intracranial aneurysms between 1996 and 2002 were dead at the time of follow-up, and for ethical reasons, only patients younger than 80 years were offered the follow-up. Sixteen patients (26.7%) that were offered an MRI investigation declined further follow-up. This may to some extent limit the interpretation of results from our series. Furthermore, the vast majority of coiled aneurysms in our series were less than 10 mm in size (79.6%) and had small necks (sack-to-neck ratio &gt;2, 61.2%). A large aneurysm size and a wide neck have previously been recognized as predictors of aneurysm recurrence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412445602">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412445602">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412445602">13</xref>
</sup> The only aneurysm in our series that showed persistent filling of the base of the aneurysm sac despite recoiling was a wide necked giant aneurysm with a maximum diameter exceeding 25 mm. The location of treated aneurysms in our series may also have contributed to our favorable results. The majority of aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation with only a small number of basilar tip aneurysms (6.1%). Especially basilar tip aneurysms have been shown to have a high risk of recurrence following endovascular treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412445602">14</xref>
</sup> No de novo aneurysms were found in our series and the 6 untreated aneurysms were unchanged in size compared with the reference DSA. In a previously published series concerning long-term follow-up of conservatively treated aneurysms an enlargement was seen in 25% of the aneurysms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412445602">6</xref>
</sup> This was not observed in our study. Concerning de novo aneurysms, varying rates of aneurysm formation have been reported. In a recent report, de novo aneurysms were reported to occur in 1.54% of patients after a 5-year follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412445602">15</xref>
</sup> Substantially higher rates, however, have been reported previously. In one series, formation of de novo aneurysms was reported to occur in 2.2% of patients annually.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412445602">16</xref>
</sup> The small number of patients in our follow-up may, despite the relatively long time of follow-up, limit conclusions regarding formation of de novo aneurysms or progression in size of conservatively treated aneurysms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1538574412445602">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our long-term follow-up showed stable results of previously coiled intracranial aneurysms. After a mean follow-up time of close to 10 years, no patient showed recanalization with filling of the aneurysm sac even if a minor proportion of treated aneurysms displayed recanalization with filling of the neck of the aneurysm. In no patient, there was need for retreatment. We conclude that our practice of discarding patients from further follow-up when a DSA or MRA have showed a stable result 3 years after treatment seems to be sufficient.</p>
