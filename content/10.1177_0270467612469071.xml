<abstract>
<p>“Unraveling Braid” analyzes how unconventional, non-linear narrative fiction can help explain the ways in which video games signify. Specifically, this essay looks at the links between the semiotic features of Jonathan Blow’s 2008 puzzle-platform video game Braid and similar elements in Georges Perec’s 1978 novel Life A User’s Manual, as well as in other puzzle-themed literary precursors. Blow’s game design concepts “dynamical meaning” and “game play rhetoric” are explained in relation to a number of Braid levels; along side this analysis is a parallel examination of the relationship between puzzle-makers and puzzle-solvers in Life A User’s Manual, revealed from a close reading of textual and organizational elements of Perec’s novel. Ultimately, Braid and Life A User’s Manual are shown to draw upon the same signifying processes, which are understood by their authors to operate within an implicitly communicative model. “Unraveling Braid”develops this model by positing a theory of storytelling in the imperative mood, in which the representation and arrangement of objects in the visual/organizational space of the text or game world becomes a fundamental rhetorical technique and meaning-maker.This technique signal show the reader/player is meant to progress through the work and interpret it as narrative, telling the reader/player what to do (but not necessarily how to do it). An understanding of “imperative” storytelling, this essay concludes, allows for a discussion of games and other media that denies neither the importance of player interactivity nor that of authorial design.</p>

<p>The extent to which “story” is necessary—or even desirable—in video games has been a contentious critical issue, even as genres with narrative pretensions, if not narrative significance, continue to be very popular with gamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0270467612469071">Lebowitz &amp; Klug, 2011</xref>). For critics of older media such as film, approaches drawing from cognitive science have long since revealed how audiences construct narrative (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0270467612469071">Bordwell, 1985</xref>); more recently, video game scholars have taken a similar cognitive and semiotic turn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0270467612469071">1</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0270467612469071">Marie-Laure Ryan’s (2006)</xref> concept of “narrativity,” the varying potential for cognitive narrative construction found in video games and other media, is particularly instructive. But how this narrativity may work in specific game genres, or in relation to genres in games’ sister media, has yet to be explored fully. For instance, the puzzle-platformer genre, whose typical games include <italic>Lemmings</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0270467612469071">DMA Design, 1991</xref>) and <italic>The Lost Vikings</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0270467612469071">Silicon &amp; Synapse, 1992</xref>), operates within an unacknowledged mode of object-based narrative that relies on a player’s interpretive activity. In what follows, I will analyze the puzzle game <italic>Braid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0270467612469071">Number None, Inc., 2008</xref>) as an archetype of this genre, showing how the link between designing/playing puzzle games and narrative signification is apparent; throughout, I will compare how <italic>Braid</italic>’s signifying strategies have been manifested earlier in certain “puzzling” novels, most notably <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic>, in order to demonstrate <italic>Braid</italic>’s “remediated” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0270467612469071">Bolter &amp; Grusin, 1999</xref>) connections to older forms. Although this essay’s purview allows only a close inspection of the characteristics of a few exemplary texts, this comparison suggests a kind of “imperative mood” that can operate in multiple narrative media and may usefully be extended to other game genres as appropriate.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jonathan Blow, Braid’s designer, has been deeply critical of games’ ability to tell meaningful stories, and his dissatisfaction with story-games was partly responsible for <italic>Braid</italic>’s creation. In the game, players control the avatar-protagonist Tim as he progresses through a fantasy world and manipulates the flow of time in search of a lost “Princess”; <italic>Braid</italic> can be read as an allegory of failed relationships, scientific discovery, or even the futility of story-based games. <italic>Braid</italic>’s design subverts conventional expectations, using the gameplay mechanics of the puzzle-platformer to stimulate reflection on the video game medium’s capacities for artistic expression. There is no conflict between the game’s “story meaning” and its “dynamical meaning,” as in games such as <italic>Bioshock</italic> or <italic>Grand Theft Auto IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0270467612469071">Blow, 2008</xref>), because <italic>Braid</italic>’s story serves as an allegory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0270467612469071">2</xref></sup> for the signifying processes occurring within the game’s puzzles. Yet for all his protestations about the fundamental inability of games to tell stories, much of Blow’s inspiration for <italic>Braid</italic> came from literature: Blow has cited novels such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612469071">Italo Calvino’s (1974)</xref> <italic>Invisible Cities</italic> and Alan Lightman’s <italic>Einstein’s Dreams</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0270467612469071">Parkin, n.d</xref>.), and <italic>Braid</italic> also echoes themes found in “The Lesson is Learned But the Damage Is Irreversible,” a webcomic written by Dale Beran and drawn by David Hellman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0270467612469071">n.d.</xref>), whom Blow later hired to create the graphics for <italic>Braid</italic>.</p>
<p>These links are especially ironic in light of the insistence of literary scholars that narrative is fundamentally at odds with play and games. There is a long history of novels modeled on games and narrative play; many of these works derive their narrative significance more from that fact than from notions of plot and character exposition derived from Aristotelian poetics. Among the best examples is <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> (<italic>La Vie mode d’emploi</italic>) by Calvino’s fellow Oulipo member Georges Perec. Perec’s masterpiece, describing the occupants of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier at a particular moment in time (8 p.m., June 23, 1975), is perfectly intelligible as a conventional narrative; however, it derives far deeper significance from the role of puzzles both within the diegetic world of <italic>Life</italic> and in the creation of the text itself, especially the authorial position Perec assumes as a puzzle-maker. Blow’s and Perec’s works, though produced in very different media, communicate significant parts of their stories in the same way.</p>
<p>Both Blow and Perec employ a similar kind of rhetoric, a semiotic system of communicative overtures from a puzzle maker to puzzle solvers, based on the spatial relation of objects not only within the texts (i.e., the diegetic space of game and novel) but also within their meta-textual features (the arrangement of chapters, graphics, extra-diegetic pictographs, etc.). This rhetoric is most apparent in puzzle games, though certainly not limited to them; for instance, similar processes occur in adventure games with puzzle elements, such as the venerable <italic>Legend of Zelda</italic> series. Recently, games scholars have paid more attention to how virtual spaces are “read” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0270467612469071">Huber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0270467612469071">Murray, 2012</xref>), and I believe that the extension of this literary metaphor is not inappropriate considering that “reading” texts and geographical landmarks alike seems to involve the same cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0270467612469071">Murray, 2012</xref>, p. 166). However, the kind of spatial “text” that puzzlers “read” does not describe actions or situations, as does the grammatical indicative mood; nor is it a prediction or speculation of what will happen, a kind of future tense or even a subjunctive mood (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0270467612469071">Mackey, 2008</xref>). It is, rather, a rhetoric based on instruction or command. This is what I will call “storytelling in the imperative mood.” Furthermore, this “imperative storytelling” relies on context and a progression of meaning-making. Although continual learning is fundamental to the enjoyment of all video games with “levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0270467612469071">Gee, 2003</xref>, p. 70) and even to any activity exhibiting “flow” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0270467612469071">Csikszentmihalyi, 1990</xref>, p. 74), in puzzle games this is particularly pronounced. The solutions to later puzzles depend on, and often play with, the solutions to early ones. Thus, the presentation of imperative cues to puzzlers who would “figure out” both <italic>Braid</italic> and <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> are underpinned first by the rules and constraints of their respective media and then are complicated by the puzzlers’ knowledge of previous cues within the texts themselves.</p>
<p>Fundamental to playing any game is learning its rules. Early video games had written instructions, printed either on the cabinet of arcade games, or, as with console and computer games, in an instruction booklet. Most modern games add an in-game tutorial or “training” level, since controls have become too complex to learn without some practice. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612469071">Tom Bissell (2010)</xref> notes,
<disp-quote>
<p>It would be hard to imagine a formal convention more inherently bizarre than the video-game tutorial. Imagine that, every time you open a novel, you are forced to suffer through a chapter in which the characters do nothing but talk to one another about the physical mechanics of how one goes about reading a book. Unfortunately, game designers do not really have a choice. Controller schemas change, sometimes drastically, from game to game and designers simply cannot banish a game’s relevant instructions to a directional booklet: That would be a violation of the interactive pact between game and gamer. (p. 8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Braid</italic> does not have an instruction manual, as it was developed for download on the Xbox Live Arcade network. It has two basic help screens accessed through the game’s menu and a tutorial level in which simple pictograms illustrate what players must do to progress. Learning the game’s time-rewind mechanic occurs naturally within the game itself, and other tasks that must be performed are signaled by pictograms of the appropriate controls. Most actions, like flipping switches, using keys to unlock doors, and so on, are conventions of the puzzle-platformer genre.</p>
<p>Novels (and books in general) have their own conventions too, but these have long been naturalized to the point where they go unnoticed, unless disrupted. Page numbering, chapter headings, tables of contents, even writing left to right (or right to left, in languages such as Arabic) are all conventions that are unconsciously accepted, no less than the assumption that the avatar in a platform game will be able to climb ladders or jump off of ledges. When novels deliberately play with the conventions of their form, however, they can resort to the same kinds of rhetorical phenomena that Bissell describes in the context of video games. For example, Lewis Carroll’s <italic>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</italic> famously takes its structure from a game of chess. The world is laid out like a chessboard, and the characters, Alice included, do indeed spend plenty of time talking to each other about the rules:
<disp-quote>
<p>For some minutes Alice stood without speaking, looking out in all directions over the country—and a most curious country it was. There were a number of tiny brooks running straight across it from side to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.</p>
<p>“I declare it’s marked out just like a large chess-board!” Alice said at last. “There ought to be some men moving about somewhere—and so there are!” . . . “It’s a great huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world—if this <italic>is</italic> the world at all, you know. Oh what fun it is! How I <italic>wish</italic> I was one of them! I wouldn’t mind being a Pawn, if only I might join—though of course I should <italic>like</italic> to be a Queen, best.” (pp. 125-126)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the narrative progresses, Alice moves about the “board” as a pawn, is made a Queen, and wins the “game” by “taking” the Red Queen. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0270467612469071">Carroll (1971)</xref> felt compelled to provide an “instruction manual” in the preface to the 1896 edition of <italic>Through the Looking-Glass</italic> because the chess problem “has puzzled some of my readers” (p. 105). The preface illustrates the set-up of the “board,” and the series of “moves” Alice makes in chess notation, with corresponding plot points and page numbers provided alongside. The reader is, in effect, told how to “read” the novel,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0270467612469071">3</xref></sup> precisely because <italic>Through the Looking-Glass</italic> does not conform to convention, and its incidents are “puzzling” if one does not understand that different rules apply.</p>
<p><italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> also uses a chess problem as an organizing principle—the knight’s tour around the chessboard, a puzzle in which the knight must land on every square once, and only once. Each chapter in the novel corresponds with a room in 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier, and the order of the chapters corresponds with Perec’s solution to the knight’s tour. Like Carroll, Perec provides a diagram as a clue to the workings of his novel: a cross section of the apartment block, with the rooms labeled by tenant or by descriptors such as “Stairs” or “Cellars.” Perec may not have signaled that there was a solution as explicitly as Carroll had, but he could not help adding an “instruction manual” of his own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0270467612469071">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, its very name is a clue that the novel requires interpretation; as Perec’s biographer and translator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612469071">David Bellos (1993)</xref> notes, “The oddest piece of French in the whole book was its title” (p. 638). Although early written references to <italic>La Vie mode d’emploi</italic> marked a separation between <italic>vie</italic> and <italic>mode</italic>, for Perec <italic>mode d’emploi</italic> “was not a subtitle, but an inseparable part of his novel’s proper name” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612469071">Bellos, 1993</xref>, p. 639), and he made sure that on publication it was printed without any comma, semi-colon, or colon. Although the translation of <italic>mode d’emploi</italic> when referring to Perec’s novel is “user’s manual,” it is also interesting to note that the phrase is a common translation for the “instruction booklet” that accompanies many video games.</p>
<p>The Preamble to <italic>Life</italic> is even more significant, because it acts as a subtler set of instructions. There <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec (2009)</xref> describes the art of jigsaw puzzles as “not a sum of elements to be distinguished from each other and analysed discretely, but a pattern, that is to say a form, a structure” (p. xv); the meaning of the pieces comes from how they fit together, not from any intrinsic quality. Perec is signaling, by this text’s position in the book, that <italic>Life</italic> should be read as a puzzle; it also points to the particular importance of jigsaw puzzles to the “plot.” Attentive readers are being instructed to play along in a certain way, mindful of the novel’s various tricks, in addition to paying attention to the story of the watercolors-cum-jigsaw puzzles that become the character Bartlebooth’s life’s work and the key to the temporal arrangement of <italic>Life</italic>’s narrative. Even if this is not obvious at first, the fact that the passage on puzzles is repeated verbatim roughly a third of the way into the novel, preceding a description of a room in the apartment of Gaspard Winckler—the building’s resident jigsaw puzzle maker—makes this clear. Indeed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612469071">Alison James (2009)</xref> notes, “Much critical ink has been spilled over this . . . reading” (p. 180). But what is most important is how <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec (2009)</xref> concludes the passage:
<disp-quote>
<p>Despite appearances, puzzling is not a solitary game: every move the puzzler makes, the puzzle-maker has made before; every piece the puzzler picks up, and picks up again, and studies and strokes, every combination he tries, and tries a second time, every blunder and every insight, each hope and each discouragement have all been designed, calculated, and decided by the other. (p. xviii)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This insight should give pause to any ludological fundamentalists who would argue that video games are, at heart, about player agency and control—that players themselves are the prime engines of game narratives. They are instead enacting what the game’s designers—the puzzle makers—have already planned for. Although this is most explicit in the puzzle genre, it applies to all video games to varying degrees; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0270467612469071">Lebowitz and Klug (2011)</xref> argue that even fully player-driven stories in video games can never approach the amount of freedom present in real life. There is always some mediation between the player and game designer, giving the latter greater agency—or, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0270467612469071">Murray (1997)</xref>, the player’s agency is trumped by the designer’s authorship. A possible exception might be board games such as <italic>Dungeons and Dragons</italic>, in which a “dungeon master” (i.e., a moderator) improvises parts of the story and game world in response to the actions of the other players. But this, crucially, requires a live person:
<disp-quote>
<p>Although it’s technically possible to have a human moderator filling a DM-type role in a video game, the need for one moderator per player (or player group) and for the moderator and player to be on at the same time makes it highly impractical for commercial games. In addition, unlike in <italic>D&amp;D</italic>, where the players can go anywhere and do anything that they and the DM can think of, <italic>a player in a video game can’t go anywhere that wasn’t previously planned for and modeled and can’t do anything that the game’s programming doesn’t allow for</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0270467612469071">Lebowitz &amp; Klug 2011</xref>, p. 236, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lebowitz and Klug’s last observation sounds very much like Perec’s dicta in <italic>Life</italic>’s Preamble, and elsewhere Perec himself expressed that his writings always needed to find a balance “between two extremes: the excessively aleatory and the excessively determined” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612469071">James, 2009</xref>, p. 133); one reason why <italic>Life</italic> is so successful at achieving this balance is that the narrative constraints that Perec set for himself “operate on the macrostructural and the microstructural levels, organizing the novel’s structure while offering inspiration for its particular stories” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0270467612469071">James, 2009</xref>, p. 156).</p>
<p>Even though Jonathan Blow is firmly against the idea of game narratives, at least in the traditional sense, implicit in his own practice is the same authorial/puzzle-making relationship seen in Perec. For Blow, stories are tacked on to most games; since most game designers are only good at designing games (and not at telling stories in other media), they are “focusing on the wrong provider of meaning, and no one is challenging them to do otherwise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612469071">Bissell, 2010</xref>, p. 93). This explains such recent failed hybrids such as <italic>Metroid Other M</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0270467612469071">Team Ninja, 2010</xref>), in which avatar-protagonist Samus Aran’s character in cinematic cut-scenes conflicts jarringly with her in-game powers as established throughout the <italic>Metroid</italic> series. Although gameplay, not cinematics, is the meaning maker toward which Blow would have video games direct their artistic energies, he uses imperative storytelling within the affordances of the video game analogously to the way in which Perec used it within the affordances of the novel.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, we might begin with an instance of <italic>implicit</italic> puzzle making, before moving on to what Blow has <italic>explicitly</italic> stated about how he designed certain levels in <italic>Braid</italic>. In a tidy coincidence, a large part of <italic>Braid</italic>’s gameplay is the collection and assembly of jigsaw puzzle pieces. Each world in the game has pieces scattered throughout, and Tim must solve spatiotemporal puzzles to reach them. Once he has all the pieces for a particular world, Tim can assemble them to create a picture. Completing these puzzles unlocks other worlds, and completing them all unlocks the final world. The puzzles themselves are very simple, consisting of only 12 pieces each, arranged in a rectangle of four by three; these are in fact the opposite of the kinds of puzzle pieces Perec was enamored with. Simple, arbitrarily cut pieces “are eschewed by the true puzzle-lover” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, p. xvi), since, as Perec notes, “Once the edges have been put together, the detail pieces put in place . . . then solving the puzzle consists simply of trying all the plausible combinations one by one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, p. xvii). Most of <italic>Braid</italic>’s jigsaws are therefore superficial. But there are two exceptions: these build on each other very significantly and illustrate the progressive nature of puzzles in the imperative mood.</p>
<p>First, the jigsaw puzzle of World 2, “Time and Forgiveness,” contains within its picture a platform on which Tim can stand once the puzzle pieces that its parts are found on are assembled; this platform is then required to reach one of the remaining puzzle pieces. Blow has said that level design in <italic>Braid</italic>, as in most video games, “communicates the things you can touch” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612469071">“Game City,” n.d</xref>.): objects with higher levels of graphic detail are interpreted as “foreground,” and the avatar can interact with them; objects with lower graphic detail are interpreted as background. Although the puzzle pieces and the images on them are background in every other instance, here Blow is playing with the expectations of his puzzlers to complicate an otherwise straightforward instance of graphic representation.</p>
<p>Second, the puzzle of World 3, “Time and Mystery,” has one of <italic>Braid</italic>’s eight “secret stars” hidden within it as a meta-puzzle. To reveal the star, the player must collect two of the corner pieces of the puzzle, which have two points of the star hidden within them, and then assemble those pieces contrary to the logic of the jigsaw puzzle; the flat edges must be placed against each other. Then, the two pieces must be arranged near the top of the puzzle frame so that their two points line up with the top point of the star which is part of the background <italic>outside</italic> the puzzle frame. If this is done correctly, the secret star reveals itself. Finally, to collect the star, the player must use the same in-puzzle platform from World 2 to get up to a position where he can reach the star. Thus, the meta-jigsaw puzzle requires the solution of a previous jigsaw puzzle for its own solution. This of course is “fairly typical of the spirit in which Gaspard Winckler designed his puzzles” in <italic>Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, p. 381); Perec’s puzzle maker—and by extension Perec himself—did not conceive of his puzzles or their solutions in isolation. The patterns of previous puzzles inform the calculus of all the puzzles that follow for Blow as much as for Perec.</p>
<p>We have already seen how Perec’s reuse of the Preamble to <italic>Life</italic> in the subsequent Winckler chapter gives it added signification; nor is this the last meaningful repetition of descriptive material. At the end of the final chapter, five paragraphs summarize what the inhabitants of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier are doing at 8 p.m., June 23, 1975. The first four begin with the sentence, “It is the twenty-third of June, nineteen seventy-five, and it will soon be eight o’clock in the evening” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, p. 563); the last reads, “It is the twenty-third of June, nineteen seventy-five, and in a moment it will be eight o’clock in the evening” (p. 563). Though the actions and poses have already been described throughout the novel, their repetition here is a reprise or a variation, giving formal closure and thus new meaning to what has come before. This is paralleled in <italic>Braid</italic>: Blow has said that some of the puzzles take their cue from classical music, in which “restatement is valuable and repetition is not” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612469071">“Game City,” n.d</xref>.). Thus, the first level of each world, “The Pit”—in which Tim must fetch a key from a pit and rewind time to get back out—is repeated, but with subtle variations that introduce new gameplay mechanics. The last version of “The Pit” does not require Tim to do anything but jump over it; this is a “pattern break” that Blow put in knowing that too many variations can become predictable.</p>
<p>Clearly there is a communicative impulse behind these symbolic orderings and arrangements. For Blow, the relationship between the game designer and game player, between puzzle maker and puzzler, is a rhetorical one. He speaks of “gameplay rhetoric” as a way of signaling a message by use of the objects and spaces of the game within the context of gameplay mechanics. “One of the simplest pieces of gameplay rhetoric” in <italic>Braid</italic>, according to Blow, is the early level called “Leap of Faith.” To progress in this level the player must make Tim jump off a cliff whose bottom he cannot see. Many platform games put the player in a similar position, though it usually requires the loss of one of the player’s finite “lives” to figure out the solution. But in <italic>Braid</italic> the level is “called ‘Leap of Faith’ very blatantly as a statement that when you’ve got [the ability to] rewind [time] . . . it’s actually okay to kill the player all you want” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612469071">“Game City,” n.d</xref>.). The pictograph that accompanies the start of the level, moreover, depicts Tim falling off the edge of the cliff. Thus, a combination of written language and visual and spatial cues, combined with platform genre conventions, all add up to a rhetorical gesture.</p>
<p>Visual and spatial cues can even signify powerfully on their own. One level in <italic>Braid</italic> stands out because it has no name, only a pictograph of Tim standing beside a pit full of deadly spikes and holding a key at its edge. The level occurs in the world “Time and Decision,” in which using the time-rewind mechanic allows Tim and his shadow to perform two actions at the same time some distance apart. The solution to the puzzle of the nameless level requires Tim to use his shadow to pass an otherwise inaccessible key back to Tim himself. Originally, Blow tried designing the level with a wall that had a hole through which to pass the key, but “it [the hole] was signalling that it was the solution to the puzzle because you never see a wall with a tiny hole in it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612469071">“Game City,” n.d</xref>.). The finished version has a pit of spikes instead; Tim must have his shadow jump to its death in order to pass the key to himself, waiting on the other side. Blow found that scenario made for a more difficult puzzle and also created an interesting affective experience—being forced to kill a double of oneself in order to progress. That is why the level has no name: “It’s trying to talk about that feeling and I didn’t really have a word for that,” Blow later explained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0270467612469071">“Game City,” n.d</xref>.). The pictograph communicates what words (at least for Blow) cannot, while giving the player a hint about the solution to the puzzle.</p>
<p>With Blow’s talk of rhetoric and the signification of objects, it is apparent that we are approaching a communicative model of game design. Blow argues that the arrangement of diegetic space conveys meaning; this, like puzzling, has also long been recognized in literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612469071">Italo Calvino’s (1974)</xref> <italic>Invisible Cities</italic>, one of Blow’s inspirations, provides an apropos example. In the chapter “Cities and Signs 1,” Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan about the city of Tamara, in which “the eye does not see things but images of things that mean other things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612469071">1974</xref>, p. 15). This could just as easily apply to game spaces, in which even objects that are iconic—platforms, ladders, keys—signify not so much their referent, but an action that must be performed; their presence causes confusion if they are never used.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0270467612469071">5</xref></sup> In a platformer, though objects “have an overwhelming aura of not being able to exist elsewhere, in any other world, real or imagined” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612469071">Bissell, 2010</xref>, p. 97), implicit in the positioning of a ladder is the imperative “climb”; in the platform across a pit, “jump here”; in a locked door, “bring the key.” The spaces of game worlds instruct the player how to progress; compare with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0270467612469071">Calvino’s (1974)</xref> Tamara:
<disp-quote>
<p>If a building has no signboard or figure, its very form and the position it occupies in the city’s order suffice to indicate its function. . . . The wares, too, which the vendors display on their stalls are valuable not in themselves but as signs of other things: the embroidered headband stands for elegance; the gilded palanquin, power; the volumes of Averroes, learning; the ankle bracelet, voluptuousness. Your gaze scans the streets as if they were written pages: the city says everything you must think, makes you repeat her discourse. (p. 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is of course a hidden imperative within all writing. Although the bottle of shrinking potion Alice drinks in <italic>Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</italic> has “a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0270467612469071">Carroll, 1971</xref>, p. 10), the words are subordinate to the unstated command of all text: “read me.” This imperative aspect to writing, or more precisely, to the composition and <italic>presentation</italic> of writing, is understood implicitly; but when a writer plays with the imperative to read, by leaving clues to read a text unconventionally, this invisible property of writing is foregrounded. Once again, Perec’s <italic>Life</italic> provides an illustration. The list that Valène has in his room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, pp. 259-265) of the 179 stories that he plans to include in his epic painting of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier can of course be read as a simple list. But Perec’s visual arrangement of that list—printed in a font used nowhere else in the book, its position roughly in the middle of the novel, the breaks in the list after every 60 items, their uniform filling of the width of the pages—all these features form an imperative: “this is to be read differently than the rest of the text.” Grouping by 60 suggests that there may be 60 characters and spaces in each line of text; a quick count of any line confirms this. The three groups of text form an acrostic of the word <italic>âme</italic>, or “soul.” This is preserved in both the German and English translations, which spell out <italic>ich</italic> and <italic>ego</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0270467612469071">Bellos, 1993</xref>, p. 603).</p>
<p>In video games, the imperative nature of space is likewise understood implicitly; it is only when a game like <italic>Braid</italic> plays with the conventions that they get noticed. That there are more novels of the artistic sophistication of <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> than there are games of the artistic sophistication of <italic>Braid</italic> is perhaps one reason why this fact is neglected in criticism of games. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0270467612469071">Peta Mitchell (2004)</xref> can note that Jane Jacobs’s critique of modernist urban planning, which “failed to see that cities are not essentially chaotic or ordered but are instead intricate ‘systems of functional order’ that require understanding on the part of the urban dweller” (p. 15), is applicable to the balance between chance and determination in Perec’s novel; but there is little appreciation so far about the balance between the chaos of interactivity and the ordered system of design in <italic>Braid</italic>, and in other games like it.</p>
<p>Consider this denunciation of the signifying properties of games:
<disp-quote>
<p>Even in a game like <italic>Myst</italic> where threats are few and far between and careful exploration involving puzzle solving is the key to one’s progress, there exists an intrinsic lack of significatory depth. Traditional pleasures of plot and character involvement are not what concerns the player here, rather delight and fascination in being able to discover and uncover new things (images) to prospect. <italic>Myst</italic> is about solving visually based conundrums in order to see more of its fantasy world (and its different “ages”). Puzzle solving is primarily a means to further spectacle, rather than to narrative knowledge of the traditional kind. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0270467612469071">Darley, 2000</xref>, p. 160)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although <italic>Myst</italic> is far more of an “open-world” game than <italic>Braid</italic>, Darley’s observations about puzzle solving seem curiously off in light of Perec’s puzzles or Calvino’s cities. Such generalizations are still rather common among academic video games critics:
<disp-quote>
<p>Virtually all digital adventure games, for instance, are designed around problems associated with . . . memory deprivation . . . the whole purpose (or theme, or narrative) of these games is to recover missing information. . . . But this template is not limited to adventure games <italic>per se</italic>. It reappears during all applications of narrative within digital media that are increasingly interactive and increasingly susceptible to free play. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0270467612469071">Myers, 2007</xref>, p. 109)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note the use of vague qualifiers (“virtually,” “always seems to be”) and the conflation of player action, thematic elements, and narrative. Untangling this conflation requires, as a number of critics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0270467612469071">Eskelinen, Douglas, &amp; Schechner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0270467612469071">Manovich, 2001</xref>) have argued, a clearer definition of games narrative informed by proper literary narratology, which is beyond the scope of this essay. But <italic>Braid</italic> demonstrates that puzzle solving, at least, is not necessarily about revealing new graphic spectacles or being able to roam a virtual world, free to “choose your own adventure,” and interact and play without what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0270467612469071">Tom Bissell (2010)</xref> calls “the remindful crack of the narrative whip” (p. 39). It is instead about a complex, mediated communication between a puzzle maker and a puzzler player, in which the pleasure comes from fully understanding the communication implicit on all its levels. Since video games must always be enacted by players (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0270467612469071">Galloway, 2006</xref>), this cognitive process on the part of the player is necessary to apprehend narrative, but is not constitutive of it. Even a one-player video game is “not a solitary game” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0270467612469071">Perec, 2009</xref>, p. xviii); to win, and to find out how the story, insofar as there is one, ends, is to <italic>defeat the designer</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0270467612469071">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The design of <italic>Braid</italic>’s “Jumpman” level illustrates this relationship particularly well, showing how all the elements of imperative storytelling discussed above, from implicit and explicit arrangements of objects in space to the understanding of context and conventions, work together. One part of the level is set up as an allusion to one of the Ur-texts of platformers, <italic>Donkey Kong</italic>. (“Jumpman” is the player avatar renamed “Mario” in subsequent games.) The literary technique of allusion is achieved through the signification of objects again; the platforms, ladders, and movement of the enemies mirror those found in the first screen of <italic>Donkey Kong</italic>; also, an ape statue holds the cannon that is shooting out enemies at the top, while the puzzle piece that Tim must retrieve is in the same relative position as Pauline, Jumpman’s girlfriend, whom he must reach to free from the clutches of Donkey Kong. If that were all there were to the allusion, this would simply be a clever bit of intertextuality. However, Blow designed it as a trap: players who recognize the allusion and climb toward the puzzle piece in imitation of Jumpman find that it is impossible; Tim cannot reach the piece without touching an enemy and dying, since the movement of time in this world (“Time and Place”), and hence enemies’ positions, is linked directly to Tim’s own movement. It is only when players take another route that they can solve the puzzle. To put this in terms of a spatiovisual imperative mood, Blow has designed the level knowing that all the objects in combination would signify “proceed as if this were <italic>Donkey Kong</italic>.” To the player savvy to the tricks that Blow has already used, this signifies “proceeding as if this were <italic>Donkey Kong</italic> is likely a trap; find another way.” The less-attentive player (or the “freely exploring,” interactive player) can take the imperative at face value, but he will be frustrated in his efforts to play as though this were a simple repetition of <italic>Donkey Kong</italic> gameplay. Sooner or later he will have to conclude that “proceeding as if this were <italic>Donkey Kong</italic> is a trap; find another way.” In her discussion of the “subjunctive mode,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0270467612469071">Margaret Mackey (2008)</xref> observes how gamers can shift quickly between asking what might happen during their play and what must be done to make progress. In <italic>Braid</italic> and other puzzle games, clearly the latter process is the dominant one.</p>
<p>But is the meaning of objects in space complex enough to have narrative force that eclipses the conventional meaning of narrative as a story told through language? Clearly, not all the meaning of <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> is contained in its spatial and graphic arrangements; it still requires much conventionally written language. But its full significance requires that the reader recognize its imperative storytelling and recognize the solution to some (if not all) of its puzzles. Conversely, though <italic>Braid</italic> cannot be completed without recognizing the imperative storytelling techniques behind its own puzzles, their full narrative significance requires some conventional, if not always unambiguous, text to be fulfilled. For instance, the written text that appears on the screen when Tim passes books in <italic>Braid</italic>’s level selection screens, and which provides the most evidence for allegorical readings of Tim’s search for the Princess, reverts to an underlying database paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0270467612469071">Manovich, 2001</xref>, p. 231).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0270467612469071">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Storytelling in the imperative mood is not so much the dominance of the spatial arrangements of objects over language but the use of multiple signifying elements in varying degrees as befits the medium in which the narrative is taking place. A book will necessarily privilege words over objects, whereas a video game will privilege objects over words. <italic>Life A User’s Manual</italic> and <italic>Braid</italic> ought to remind us that a medium’s prevalence toward one form of signification (narrative or ludic) does not exclude other forms working in concert, and that it would be a mistake to assume otherwise. Stories can play games, though not all stories are sophisticated enough to do so; and although not every video game has a compelling story behind it, games can tell stories. The idea of “imperative” storytelling allows for a discussion of games—and for that matter, novels, and perhaps other media as well—that denies neither the importance of player interactivity nor that of authorial design.</p>
