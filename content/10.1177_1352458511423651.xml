<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between 50–65% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience cognitive symptoms at some point in their disease course,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511423651">1</xref></sup> with slowed processing speed as the primary deficit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511423651">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511423651">3</xref></sup> Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed unique patterns of neural activation in MS patients relative to healthy controls (HC) during performance of information processing speed tasks. Genova and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> recently employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the blood-oxygen-level dependence (BOLD) response during performance of a modified version of the Symbol Digit Modalities Task (mSDMT), a task that has consistently been shown to be highly sensitive to processing speed impairments in MS and has also been identified as the single most sensitive measure of cognitive impairment from the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS battery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511423651">5</xref></sup> In their study, Genova et al. found that patients with MS showed less activation than HC in areas including bilateral frontal and parietal regions while performing the task in the scanner. Here, fMRI data from the same samples of MS patients and controls were examined to determine respective patterns of effective connectivity underlying cerebral activation during task performance. As such, this is the first study to identify the directed neural connections underlying performance on a task of processing speed in persons with MS.</p>
<p>Functional and effective connectivity are relatively new techniques applied during post-processing of fMRI data that allow examination of the neural networks underlying cognitive function. Functional connectivity allows inferences regarding communication between spatially remote brain regions, while effective connectivity utilizes information about time-lagged relationships between brain regions to allow inferences about the directionality of information transfer within functionally connected networks. Differences in functional and effective connectivity have been found in patients with MS during performance of cognitive tasks. For example, Au Duong and colleagues scanned patients with clinically-isolated syndrome during performance of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition task (PASAT). Relative to HC, patients had decreased functional connectivity between left frontal regions and left middle frontal gyrus, right postcentral gyrus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511423651">6</xref></sup> Patients had no areas of increased connectivity relative to controls. Effective connectivity for the same sample was derived using structural equation modeling;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511423651">7</xref></sup> connectivity strength was lower in patients relative to controls between right and left Brodmann Area (BA) 46, and from left anterior cingulate cortex to left BA 46, but higher from right ACC to right BA 46 and bidirectionally between left and right ACC. In another study, patients with relapsing–remitting MS showed greater functional connectivity between left and right prefrontal cortices during performance of a working memory task (<italic>n</italic>-back) relative to HC, but reduced functional connectivity between right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior frontal/anterior cingulated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511423651">8</xref></sup> Another study examined effective connectivity in individuals with benign MS during performance of the Stroop task; dynamic causal modeling revealed increased connectivity in MS patients relative to HC between several areas of the sensorimotor network and right inferior frontal gyrus and right cerebellum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423651">9</xref></sup> Taken together, these studies reveal that the neural networks underlying function on tasks of working memory and executive processes are altered in persons with MS. The present study is the first to examine whether the networks underlying performance on a processing speed task, the cognitive domain generally considered to be most deleteriously affected by MS, are altered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511423651">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511423651">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>We were interested in examining whether differences in patterns of neural connectivity could be detected in individuals with MS compared with HC while performing the mSDMT. In the present study, two primary hypotheses were tested. The first hypothesis, consistent with two studies from Rocca et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423651">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511423651">11</xref></sup> is that effective connectivity analysis would reveal neural connections uniquely relied on by the MS group compared with healthy controls, a pattern which may be reflective of adaptive cortical functional changes.</p>
<p>The second hypothesis is based on a recent study that examined effective connectivity in HC during performance of the mSDMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref></sup> Separating the faster performers from slower performers revealed unique underlying connections in the two groups: the slower group relied on more connections originating in prefrontal cortex than the faster group. Based on this, we hypothesized that persons with MS, who have known processing speed deficits, will rely on more prefrontal connections than the faster healthy controls to perform the mSDMT.</p>
<p>In addition to our primary hypotheses, we were interested in determining whether any association would be found between effective connectivity and 1) structural (total lesion load) and 2) functional (BOLD activation) markers of disease pathology. These were exploratory aims, as we had no a priori hypotheses regarding the degree to which effective connectivity would be correlated with these markers of MS-related brain pathology. We also investigated the association between prefrontal connections and behavior, with a specific hypothesis. The evidence showing that increased recruitment of prefrontal cortices to perform cognitive tasks by persons with MS is associated with worse performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511423651">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511423651">15</xref></sup> is consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis. Therefore, we expected that if persons with MS do in fact rely on more prefrontal connections to perform the task than HC in the present study, this would incur a behavioral cost, for example a performance decrement.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In total, 33 right-handed participants were enrolled: 17 HC participants and 16 participants with MS. Twelve MS participants were diagnosed with clinically definite MS and four had clinically probable MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511423651">16</xref></sup> Twelve had relapsing–remitting MS, three had primary progressive MS and one had a secondary progressive course. The mean time since disease diagnosis was 6.4 years (SD = 4.9). The age of the HC group ranged from 22–55 years (<italic>M</italic> = 37.9, SD = 10.7), with a mean education level of 15.7 years (SD = 2.3). The MS group age ranged from 23–55 years (<italic>M</italic> = 41.3, SD = 7.4) and had a mean of 15.7 years of education (SD = 1.9). There were no significant differences between groups on age or education.</p>

<sec id="section4-1352458511423651">
<title>Neuropsychological testing procedure</title>
<p>On the same day as the MRI scanning, a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to each participant to assess neuropsychological functioning. This battery assessed common cognitive functions known to be impaired in individuals with MS, such as processing speed (assessed by the SDMT – oral version,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511423651">17</xref></sup> which was always administered following the fMRI), as well as learning and memory, and general intelligence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511423651">
<title>Cognitive task while in the MRI scanner</title>
<p>The cognitive paradigm used to assess processing speed while in the MRI scanner was a modified SDMT (modified for scanner usage).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511423651">17</xref></sup> Subjects viewed a panel of nine paired stimulus boxes projected onto a screen (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511423651">Figure 1</xref>). The boxes in the upper row each contained a symbol and the boxes in the lower row each contained a digit (1–9). Below the panel of boxes was a pair of ‘probe’ boxes containing a digit and a symbol. The subject was required to determine if the probe pair matched any of the corresponding pairs of stimulus boxes above and then respond ‘match’ or ‘no match’ by making a right or left thumb key-press, respectively. Subjects were instructed to respond as quickly as possible, making as few mistakes as possible.</p>

<p>The subject had up to 6 s to respond to each stimulus presentation, during which time the stimuli remained on the screen. To minimize learning or practice effects, and to minimize the working memory load, the nine symbol–digit pairings changed with every presentation so that the same symbols did not always appear with the same numbers. Both the panel of nine paired stimulus boxes and the probe box appeared on the screen simultaneously, further reducing working memory requirements. In addition, the task did not require mental manipulation of stimulus information, thereby virtually eliminating the central executive component of working memory in completing the mSDMT.</p>
<p>An event-related design was used. For all subjects, there were four trials and each trial lasted 7 min 48 s and contained 225 TRs, for a total task time of 31.2 min. In sum, there were a total of 256 ‘events’ where subjects were required to respond to stimuli. Following each event there was a variable inter-trial interval lasting 0, 4, 8 or 12 s. The response time (RT) and accuracy of each response were recorded. Only events in which correct responses were given were included in analyses.</p>

<title>MRI procedure</title>
<p>An analysis of the patterns of fMRI activations (BOLD signal differences) has been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> However, for completeness, the methods used will be briefly summarized here. The interested reader may refer to Genova et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> for more details. Neuroimaging was performed at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) on the Siemens Allegra 3 T MRI. Whole-brain axial T1-weighted conventional spin-echo images (in-plane resolution = 0.859 mm<sup>2</sup>) for anatomic overlays (TR/TE = 450/14 ms, contiguous 5 mm, 256 × 256 matrix, FOV = 24 cm, NEX = 1) were acquired before fMRI. Functional imaging consisted of multislice gradient echo, T2*-weighted images acquired with echoplanar imaging (EPI) methods (TE = 30 ms; TR = 2000 ms; FOV = 24 cm; flip angle = 80°; slice thickness = 5 mm contiguous, matrix = 64 × 64, in-plane resolution = 3.75 mm<sup>2</sup>). In order to provide coverage of the entire brain, a total of 32 images in the axial plane were acquired. In order to provide an additional set of T2-weighted structural images for MS lesion identification and quantification, a set of co-planar T2-weighted FLAIR structural images with identical parameters were also obtained without a task paradigm. (For a description of the data analysis, please refer to Genova et al.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-1352458511423651">
<title>Granger causality analysis</title>
<p>Granger causality analysis (GCA) allows inferences about causal influences between brain regions by measuring the extent to which activation in one region reliably precedes activation in other regions at later points in time. Thus, these analyses permit characterization of the direction of influences between discrete brain regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511423651">18</xref></sup> GCA was performed using code written in ‘R’ statistical software (version 2.10.1) via vector auto-regression attuned for fMRI data analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511423651">19</xref></sup> The restriction of our analyses to specific brain regions increased our power to detect significant effects in Granger analysis. The specific set of regions were selected based on: 1) previous studies that have shown activation–performance relations in these regions; and 2) data from a previous study of HC using the same behavioral task in the scanner, the mSDMT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref></sup> Seed regions were therefore chosen on the basis of eight regions of interest (ROIs) where activation was observed in this task across two hemispheres: dorsal prefrontal cortex (DPFC; BA 9); posterior PFC (BA 46), ventral PFC (VPFC; BA 44), and parietal cortex (BA 40). ROIs were drawn on each subject’s T1 axial slices using AFNI, according to the Talairach and Tournoux (1988) atlas. For individual participants, time series from all voxels within an ROI were averaged to create a single time series for each ROI.</p>
<p>A brief description of the Granger analysis performed herein is described below; however, more details of GCA can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511423651">18</xref></sup> The Granger analysis performed here used <italic>F</italic> statistics to test whether lagged information on a time series (variable) <italic>y</italic> provided any statistically significant information about another time series (variable) <italic>x</italic> in the presence of lagged <italic>x</italic>. A 1 TR (2-s) lag was incorporated into our model. A bivariate procedure was performed on all possible ROI pairs such that Granger influences were computed in both directions for all ROI pairs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511423651">20</xref></sup> Influences were considered significant for <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01. A cluster threshold was set at 50%; that is, 50% of the voxels in the ROI had to be significant for the influence to be considered. Influences were considered ‘unidirectional’ if the influence of one region of the pair was significant. They were considered ‘bidirectional’ when the influences of both regions of the pair were significant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1352458511423651">
<title>Association of total lesion load and connectivity</title>
<p>The association of white matter (WM) lesions to effective connectivity has not previously been explored in persons with MS. The association of total lesion load and effective connectivity in the PFC, the area showing the greatest between-group differences in effective connectivity in our samples, was investigated. Specifically, total connections (based on results of GCA) originating or terminating in BA9 left and right were counted for each subject. As reported elsewhere,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> WM lesions were identified using 32-slice T2 FLAIR images. All lesions were verified by a neuroradiologist. The lesions were manually segmented on all axial slices on which they were visible. Lesion identification began with the most superior axial slice and ended at the axial level where the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles separated from the body of the lateral ventricle. A total brain lesion load volume was thus created for each subject. Pearson correlations were used to determine the relationship between total PFC connections (BA 9 left, BA 9 right, and BA 9 left + right) calculated separately and total lesion load for each subject.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458511423651">
<title>Association of BOLD activation and effective connectivity</title>
<p>The association of BOLD activation during task performance and total connections was investigated. In the Genova et al. study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> the greatest differences in BOLD activation between the MS and HC groups were found in prefrontal cortices (BA 9). We noted that, consistently, it was BA 9 in our GCA that showed the greatest effective connectivity; that is, in the MS group, the number of connections originating and terminating in BA 9 (left and right) was higher than in any other bilateral ROI pair. In addition, the difference in total connections between the MS group and the HC group was maximal at BA 9. Specifically, the MS group used 10 connections that either originated or terminated in BA 9 left and right, while the HC group employed 40% fewer connections involving BA 9 (six total). Given these group differences, we were interested to determine whether there was an association between BOLD activation and effective connectivity specifically in the PFC. As in the lesion load analysis, total connections originating or terminating in BA 9 left and right were counted for each subject. To obtain a measure of BOLD activation for each participant, BA 9 left and BA 9 right were masked. The time series for each subject during task performance were deconvolved, and beta weights were extracted. Pearson correlations were used to determine the association of average beta weight (BA 9 right and BA 9 left, entered separately) and total connections (BA 9 left, BA 9 right, and BA 9 left + right, entered separately) for each subject.</p>

<title>Association of behavioral performance and effective connectivity</title>

<title>Behavioral results</title>
<p>Outside the scanner, as expected, the MS group was significantly slower than the HC group on the SDMT (t(31) = -2.9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Regarding performance on the task in the scanner (mSDMT), there were no significant differences in accuracy between the HC (<italic>M</italic> = 0.98, SD = 0.028) and MS group (<italic>M</italic> = 0.96, SD = 0.021), (t(31) = −1.772, <italic>p</italic> = 0.09), with both groups performing near ceiling. However, the MS group was significantly slower (<italic>M</italic> = 2026 ms, SD = 371.6) than the HC group (<italic>M</italic> = 1666 ms, SD = 264.4), (t(31) = 3.22, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, <italic>d</italic> = 1.36). To control for potential motor and visual scanning slowing, the RT data were re-analyzed using an ANCOVA with performance on the Trail Making Task, Part A (a speeded visuo-motor task) as a covariate.

<p>Several connections are made by the MS group in bilateral frontal cortices that are absent in the HC group. One area that notably originates a greater number of connections in the MS group compared with the HC group is BA 46, posterior PFC. In left and right BA 46, unilateral and bilateral connections to BA 9 (dorsal PFC) originate, for a total of four connections. In sum, seven connections originate in BA 46 in the MS group, whereas only two originate in this region in the healthy control group. In addition, BA 9 is an area of greater involvement for the MS group compared with the HC group. The total number of connections either terminating or originating in BA 9 left and right is 10 for the MS group, whereas BA 9 is involved in only six connections in the HC group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, effective connectivity analysis revealed neural connections uniquely relied on by the MS group compared with HC during performance of a processing speed task. Although caution should be taken in making direct comparisons across studies looking at effective connectivity derived through different methods (for review of four prevailing methods, see Witt and Meyerand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511423651">21</xref></sup>), our findings are broadly consistent with those of Rocca and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511423651">11</xref></sup> who identified altered patterns of effective connectivity in persons with MS during sensorimotor task performance suggesting increased connectivity within frontal networks (e.g. sensorimotor network and right inferior frontal gyrus). They are also consistent with findings of Rocca et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511423651">9</xref></sup> during Stroop task performance, showing increased effective connectivity in an MS sample in areas including left primary sensorimotor cortex and left dorsal premotor cortex. Au Duong et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511423651">7</xref></sup> showed increased connectivity in frontal areas that included right ACC and right posterior PFC during PASAT performance in persons with MS. It should be noted that all three of these studies also found regions of decreased effective connectivity in the MS sample relative to the HC. Similarly, in our sample, we also found connections in the healthy group that the MS group did not rely on (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1352458511423651">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, three such connections were made in the healthy group, all of which originated in left PFC. The implications of the healthy group’s reliance on these connections are not clear, although a follow-up study which varies task difficulty may elucidate whether these connections are related to task demands. For example, one could speculate that these connections indicate language areas that have come ‘online’ in individuals who are less taxed by the task at hand.</p>
<p>We also confirmed our secondary hypothesis, that persons with MS employ more frontal connections to maintain adequate performance compared with HC during performance of a processing speed task. Given that the MS group was slower in performing the task, these results are consistent with findings of Rypma and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref></sup> showing that HC who were slow at performing the mSDMT relied on more PFC connections than faster HC engaged in the same task. Our finding of increased connections in the MS group suggests greater neural recruitment by persons with MS to perform at the same level of accuracy relative to the HC group. The findings of the present study are therefore consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, which proposes that greater neural involvement for task performance is a less efficient use of neural resources (for example Grabner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1352458511423651">22</xref></sup>). The greater number of connections needed by the MS group may reflect a less efficient strategy, although this assertion is speculative on the basis of the results of the present study. A future study to examine this explicitly would incorporate varying levels of difficulty such that the behavioral performance of each group could be compared with resultant patterns of effective connectivity.</p>
<p>Findings from the follow-up analyses were mixed. An examination of the association of effective connectivity to total lesion load, BOLD activation, and behavioral accuracy revealed no association of connectivity in PFC and lesion load or BOLD activation in persons with MS. Regarding lesion load, one interpretation of the non-significant association of lesion load and effective connectivity is that the two measures capture different, and perhaps orthogonal, aspects of the underlying neuropathology and are subserved by independent mechanisms. Our finding is consistent with a recent study in persons with MS that failed to find any significant association of lesion load and brain activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511423651">23</xref></sup> Taken together, these findings support the assertion that structural and dynamic neural measures likely capture different aspects of MS-related pathology.</p>
<p>Regarding the association of fMRI activation and effective connectivity for the present sample, Genova and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511423651">4</xref></sup> reported decreased activation in the (slower) MS group in bilateral frontal and parietal regions. Consistently, Rypma et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511423651">12</xref></sup> found decreased BOLD activation levels in ventral prefrontal cortex (BA 44) and parietal regions (BA 40) that was correlated with slower performance on the same processing speed task. In the present study, we failed to find a significant association between BOLD activation and effective connectivity in PFC (BA 9) for either the MS group or the HC group. There are a number of possible explanations for this. The present samples were small, and power was likely reduced by inter-individual variance within the patient group. Another possible explanation is that because GCA provides no information about the strength of the neural connections that it models, we do not know whether the connections made by the HC group are of comparable strength to those made by the MS group. Therefore it may not be valid to infer that more connections will necessarily be accompanied by greater activation. The paucity of studies in the literature comparing effective connectivity to BOLD activation in persons with MS precludes comparison; future studies that do so are clearly warranted.</p>
<p>Of the three variables we explored in our secondary analyses, behavioral accuracy on the task was the only one associated with effective connectivity in the MS group. Specifically, more connections originating and terminating in right (but not left) BA 9 were associated with worse performance accuracy on the SDMT task. This is similar to the finding of Hillary and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1352458511423651">23</xref></sup> showing that cognitive performance was negatively correlated with right (but not left) prefrontal and temporal lobe fMRI activation in persons with MS. Taken together with the present study, these findings suggest that recruitment of right prefrontal regions may allow persons with MS to maintain task performance, although this brain reorganization confers a behavioral cost, namely, decreased accuracy. The fact that an association was found for connectivity and cognitive performance, whereas no association between connectivity and either activation or lesion load was found, points to the sensitivity of behavior to underlying pathology within the neural networks critical to complex cognitive functions.</p>
<p>In summary, the results of our effective connectivity analysis comparing persons with MS with HC while performing a task of processing speed reveal broad differences between groups, as discussed. A closer examination shows that the greatest differences involve the PFC. Specifically, the unique connections made by the MS group (seven total) originate in both left and right hemispheres, and in both prefrontal and parietal cortices. That is, novel connections relied upon by persons with MS to maintain performance are diffusely distributed across the brain. In contrast, the unique connections made by the HC group (three total) all originate in left PFC, a region supported by the fMRI literature as more focally employed by HC compared with persons with MS, who show more diffusely distributed activation of the PFC during cognitive task performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511423651">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458511423651">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511423651">24</xref></sup> Given the small sample size and restricted inter-individual variability of our patient group, the present study does not allow investigation of whether and how brain reorganization may vary over the disease course or across disease subtypes. It would also be very interesting to explore whether and how alterations in neural connectivity interact with stages of cognitive impairment. For instance, Penner and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511423651">14</xref></sup> found that while mildly impaired MS patients recruited additional regions and showed greater activation relative to HC, the most impaired patients in their sample showed no increased activation in the PFC during performance of attention tasks. Compensatory neural plasticity may therefore interact with disease severity, and may represent a benefit to persons in early stages that persons at later stages may no longer be able to access. If there is an optimal window of brain reorganization, this would be critical to identify, particularly in terms of targeting interventions and treatments and tailoring them to the specific disease stage of the individual.</p>
<p>This is the first investigation to look at effective connectivity during performance of a processing speed task in persons with MS. The finding in the present study of greater connections that originate in bilateral frontal regions in the MS group is consistent with the neural efficiency hypothesis, which suggests that greater involvement of prefrontal areas is required to maintain task performance. As such, altered effective connectivity in persons with MS may be a consequence of disease-related decreases in WM integrity and may indicate resultant functional cortical plasticity. However, although compensatory plasticity may allow for maintenance of task performance, such compensation confers a cost in terms of performance accuracy. Gaining a better understanding of the neural concomitants of cognitive dysfunction for persons with MS can guide treatment strategies and pharmacological interventions.</p>
