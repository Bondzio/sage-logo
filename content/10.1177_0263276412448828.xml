<abstract>
<p>This paper focuses on the latent spatial philosophy in Heidegger’s ‘Being and Time’, highlighting a key aspect of the Heideggerian oeuvre that has mostly been overlooked by commentators. It outlines the concept of an original spatiality of being that is opposed to the philosophies of space in both physics and Cartesian metaphysics. Through an elaboration of the essentially relational character of <italic>Da-sein</italic>, it is argued that Heidegger’s vocabulary in ‘Being and Time’ yields an onto-topology that shows Da-sein’s primary spatial embeddedness in the world. Finally, the paper argues that Heidegger’s concept of spatiality remained cursory due to its residual existentialist focus. In this context, it attempts a re-evaluation of its intellectual trajectory within the realm of the Spheres project.</p>

<p>An essential tendency toward nearness lies in Da-sein. (Heiddegger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 98)</p></disp-quote>Only very few commentators on Heidegger have noted the nascent but revolutionary treatise on being and space that underlies the sensationally programmatic study of <italic>Being and Time.</italic> Under the spell of Heidegger’s existential analytic of time, it has mostly been overlooked that the former is grounded in a corresponding analytic of space and that both are fundamentally rooted in an analysis of movement. Therefore, we can find entire libraries filled with studies of Heidegger’s onto-chronology, his doctrines of Temporalizing (<italic>Zeitigung</italic>) and Historicity and read various treatises on his philosophy of movement, or onto-kinesis. Concerning his attempts at a theory of an originary ‘making-room’ (<italic>Einräumen</italic>) of space or onto-topology, however, we find nothing but scattered, unciteable and pietistic paraphrases.</p>
<p>Heidegger’s analysis positively delineates the spatiality of <italic>Da-sein</italic> as Approaching (<italic>Näherung</italic>) and Orientation (<italic>Orientierung</italic>) through two destructive steps. The spatial concepts of both, ‘vulgar’ physics as well as metaphysics, must effectively be cleared away before the existential analytic of Being-in (<italic>In-Sein</italic>) can be elaborated.<disp-quote>
<p>What does being-in mean? Initially, we supplement the expression being-in with the phrase ‘in the world,’ and are inclined to understand this being-in as ‘being-in something.’ With this term, the kind of being of a being is named which is ‘in’ something else, as water is ‘in’ the glass, the dress is ‘in’ the closet.… Water and glass, dress and closet, are both ‘in’ space ‘at’ a location in the same way. This relation of being can be expanded; that is, the bench in the lecture hall, the lecture hall in the university, the university in the city, and so on until: the bench in ‘world space.’ These beings whose being ‘in’ one another can be determined in this way all have the same kind of being-that of being objectively present-as things occurring ‘within’ the world. … In contrast, being-in designates a constitution of being of Da-sein, and is an existential. But we cannot understand by this the objective presence of a material thing (the human body) ‘in’ a being objectively present. … ‘In’ stems from <italic>innan</italic>-, to live, <italic>habitare</italic>, to dwell. ‘An’ means I am used to, familiar with, I take care of something. It has the meaning of <italic>colo</italic> in the sense of <italic>habito</italic> and <italic>diligo</italic>. … Being as the infinitive of ‘I am’: that is, understood as an existential, means to dwell near … to be familiar with. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 50–51)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>By alluding to the Old German verb <italic>innan</italic>, to inhabit, Heidegger quickly reveals the crux of the existential analytic of spatiality. What he calls being-in-the-world means nothing other than to ‘inn’ the world in the verbal-transitive sense: to dwell in the world and to enjoy its openness through an initial attunement (<italic>Einstimmung</italic>) and expansion (<italic>Ausgriff</italic>). Because Da-sein is always already a completed act of inhabiting – the result of a primal leap into dwelling – spatiality and existence are inseparable. To speak of dwelling in the world does not mean to presuppose a domestic relationship between existing beings and vast, unbounded space: it is exactly this concept of being-at-home in the world that must be questioned, as to simply accept this condition as a fact would mean to fall back into the logic of container-physics that needs to be overcome. All holistic philosophies and teachings of mother’s-womb-immanence fail at exactly this task and are thus reified into pious forms of half-baked thought. Nor is the house of Being a simple cubicle that existing beings enter into and exit out of. Its structure is more akin to a globe of care (<italic>Sorge</italic>) in which Da-sein has spread in its ex-stasis (<italic>Außersichsein</italic>). Heidegger’s radical phenomenological attention delegitimizes both the century-old realms of container-physics and metaphysics alike. Man is never simply an animate creature in its environment or a rational entity in the house of heaven. Nor is he the devotional being of God’s creation. Consequently, the ecological chatter that emerged in the 1920s is just as much subjected to a phenomenological critique: Biology thinks just as little as any other standard science. ‘The saying used so often today, “Human beings have their environment”, does not say anything ontologically as long as this ‘having’ is undetermined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 54). But what is meant by the ‘environ’ of environment (<italic>Umhaften der Umwelt</italic>)?<disp-quote>
<p>According to what we have said, being-in is not a ‘quality’ which Da-sein sometimes has and sometimes does not have, without which it could be just as well as it could with it. It is not the case that human being ‘is’, and then on top of that has a relation of being to the ‘world’ which it sometimes takes upon itself. Da-sein is never ‘initially’ a sort of a being which is free from being-in, but which at times is in the mood to take up a ‘relation’ to the world. This taking up of relations to the world is possible only because, as being-in-the-world, Da-sein is as it is. This constitution of being is not first derived from the fact that besides the being which has the character of Da-sein there are other beings which are objectively present and meet up with it. These other beings can only ‘meet up’ ‘with’ Da-sein because they are able to show themselves of their own accord within a world. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 53–54)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Conventional thinking’s existential blindness to space manifests itself in the old worldview that integrates man more or less seamlessly into an all-encompassing realm of nature, thought as cosmos.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412448828">1</xref></sup> In modern thought, Descartes’ division of substance into a thinking and an extensive part gives the clearest example of the unwillingness to question the place of their coincidence. Because Descartes reduces spatiality to the aggregates of ‘body’ and ‘thing’ that become the only bearers of extension, the question of the meeting-place of thinking and extension cannot arise. The thinking thing remains a worldless entity that appears to have the capacity to occasionally enter into relations with things in extension. The <italic>res cogitans</italic> thus seems akin to a ghostly hunter who goes on the prowl in the land of cognizable extension just to withdraw again into his worldless fortress of no extension. Heidegger counters this with an originary being-in of Da-sein in the sense of being-in-the-world. Even cognition is only a specific mode of dwelling in the spaciousness (<italic>Geräumigkeit</italic>) of the world that is opened through circumspect heedfulness (<italic>Besorgen</italic>):<disp-quote>
<p>In directing itself toward … and in grasping something, Da-sein does not first go outside of the inner sphere in which it is initially encapsulated, but, rather, in its primary kind of being, it is always already ‘outside’ together with some being encountered in the world already discovered. Nor is any inner sphere abandoned when Da-sein dwells together with a being to be known and determines its character. Rather, even in this ‘being outside’ together with its object, Da-sein is ‘inside’, correctly understood; that is, it itself exists as the being-in-the-world which knows. Again, the perception of what is known does not take place as a return with one’s booty to the ‘cabinet’ of consciousness after one has gone out and grasped it. Rather, in perceiving, preserving, and retaining, the Da-sein that knows remains outside as Da-sein. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 58)</p></disp-quote>In his positive statements on the spatiality of Da-sein, Heidegger specifically highlights two of its characteristics: de-distancing (<italic>Ent-fernung</italic>) and directionality (<italic>Ausrichtung</italic>):<disp-quote>
<p>De-distancing means making distance disappear, making the being at a distance of something disappear, bringing it near. Da-sein is essentially de-distancing. … De-distancing discovers remoteness. … Initially and for the most part, de-distancing is a circumspect approaching, a bringing near as supplying, preparing, having at hand. … <italic>An essential tendency toward nearness lies in Da-sein</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 97–8; emphasis in original)</p>
<p>In accordance with its spatiality, Da-sein is initially never here, but over there. From this over there it comes back to its here. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 100)</p>
<p>As being-in which de-distances, Da-sein has at the same time the character of directionality. Every bringing near has always taken a direction in a region beforehand from which what is de-distanced approaches. … Circumspect heedfulness is a directional de-distancing. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 100)</p>
<p>Letting innerworldly beings be encountered, which is constitutive for being-in-the-world, is ‘giving space’. This ‘giving space,’ which we call making room, frees things at hand for their spatiality. … As circumspect taking care of things in the world, Da-sein can change things around, remove them or ‘make room’ for them only because making room – understood as an existential – belongs to its being-in-the-world … the ‘subject,’ correctly understood ontologically, Da-sein, is spatial. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412448828">1996</xref>: 103)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Who at this point would have expected a main argument to follow this mighty prelude remains gravely disappointed. The existential where-analysis abruptly gives way to an existential who-analysis without any further mention of the thread that Heidegger had only begun to unravel. Following this thread further would have inevitably revealed the manifold universes of existential spatiality that gain a renewed thrust through the terminology of spheres. The inhabitation of spheres, however, cannot be fully explicated as long as Da-sein is understood as having an essential tendency towards solitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276412448828">2</xref></sup> The analytic of the existential ‘where’ demands that all suggestions of and allusions to essential solitude are bracketed in order to gain reassurance of the deep structure of an accompanied and complemented Da-sein. In the face of this task, the early Heidegger problematically remained an existentialist. His hasty turn towards the who-question leaves us with a lonely and weak hysteric-heroic subject that always believes itself to be the first to die and that remains miserably ignorant concerning its embeddedness within relations of intimacy and solidarity. Such a hypertensive ‘who’ in an uncertain ‘where’ can indeed experience unpleasant surprises when it tries to bind itself to the next best nation it finds.</p>
<p>When Heidegger’s imperial enthusiasm sought fulfilment and grandeur in the ‘national revolution’, it became clear that an existential authenticity (<italic>Eigentlichkeit</italic>) that doesn’t radically clarify its position easily turns delusional. From 1934 onwards, Heidegger knew, if only implicitly, that he had been carried away in his engagement in the national-socialist awakening. In it, time had effectively turned into space. Whoever enters into this vortex lives in a different sphere, on a different stage in an impenetrable inner space while he appears to be right here in the present. Heidegger’s later work discreetly draws the conclusions from this lapse. The betrayed <italic>völkisch</italic> revolutionary does not expect much of lived history anymore; he retires from the worldly game of powers. Instead, he seeks salvation in more personal exercises in self-intimacy. With tenacity, he remains in his anarchic province and hosts organized tours through the house of being and through language – like a magical concierge equipped with heavy key chains, always ready to give Daedalean advice. In emotional moments he conjures up the Parmenidean holy globe of being as if he tired of historicity and returned to the eleatic. Heidegger’s late work continues to repeat the ever-same wary figures of an original deepening of thought without ever again reaching the point from which the question of an originary, always already shared making-room of the world could have been fruitfully posed.</p>
<p>The Spheres project can be seen as an attempt to salvage from oblivion a certain element of the project of <italic>Being and Space</italic> that remained trapped in Heidegger’s early work. We hold the opinion that through a theory of couplings, of genius and of complemented existence, we can save all there is to save from Heidegger’s interest in rootedness. To have established a ground in the existing duality: this much nativity or anchorage in the real must be kept even if philosophy intently pursues its indispensable separation from the empirical community. The contemporary task for thinking, then, is to rework the tension between autochthony (<italic>ab ovo</italic> or starting from community) and release (starting from death or infinity).</p>

<fn id="fn1-0263276412448828"><label>1.</label><p>In his analytic of place, Aristotle had already fantastically approached the problem of an existential topology even if for him being of ‘something in something else’ couldn’t have been addressed as an existential problem. In <italic>Physics Book IV</italic>, we find the following explanation of the eight different significations of ‘in’: ‘The next step we must take is to see in how many senses one thing is said to be “in” another. (1) As the finger is “in” the hand and generally the part “in” the whole. (2) As the whole is “in” the parts: for there is no whole over and above the parts. (3) As man is “in” animal and generally species “in” genus. (4) As the genus is “in” the species and generally the part of the specific form “in” the definition of the specific form. (5) As health is “in” the hot and the cold and generally the form “in” the matter. (6) As the affairs of Greece centre “in” the king, and generally events centre “in” their primary motive agent. (7) As the existence of a thing centres “in” its good and generally “in” its end, i.e. in “that for the sake of which” it exists. (8) In the strictest sense of all, as a thing is “in” a vessel, and generally “in” place. One might raise the question whether a thing can be in itself, or whether nothing can be in itself – everything being either nowhere or in something else’ (Aristotle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412448828">1930</xref>: 56).</p></fn>
