<abstract>
<p>Principals’ understanding and skills pertaining to diversity are important in leading diverse schools and preparing all students for a democratic and multicultural society. Although educational leadership scholars have theorized about exemplary leadership of and for diversity, a developmental perspective on principals’ diversity or cultural competence remains absent. This conceptual paper argues that the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) offers a powerful theory for understanding how principals may experience and interpret issues of difference and diversity in schools. After highlighting key aspects of the DMIS, hypothetical examples of principal interpretations and actions to a racial/ethnic achievement gap are provided. Finally, implications for principal preparation, practice, and research are discussed.</p>

<p>Cultural competence should be a fundamental aspect of school principals’ preparation and practice. Perhaps most noticeably, many school leaders serve an increasingly socioeconomically and culturally diverse student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0013124510393336">Owings &amp; Kaplan, 2003</xref>). Recent Census Bureau data project that by 2,042 people of color will outnumber their U.S. white counterparts, 8 years earlier than predicted 4 years ago. By 2023, children of color under 18 will be the U.S. majority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0013124510393336">Roberts, 2008</xref>). Unfortunately, for many students of color or from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, schools continue a legacy of deficit thinking and marginalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124510393336">Shields, Bishop, &amp; Mazawi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0013124510393336">Valencia &amp; Solorzano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124510393336">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). Just as a large base of scholarship contends that teachers should understand their students’ cultural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510393336">Adams, Bell, &amp; Griffin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510393336">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510393336">Banks, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510393336">Capper, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510393336">Cochran-Smith, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510393336">Dantley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510393336">Delpit, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510393336">Floyd &amp; Stein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124510393336">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0013124510393336">Milner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0013124510393336">Sleeter &amp; McLaren, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0013124510393336">Trumbell, Rothstein-Fisch, Greenfield, &amp; Quiroz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0013124510393336">Young &amp; Laible, 2000</xref>), educational leadership scholars have called for preparation programs to prepare future and current school leaders to lead for equity, diversity, and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124510393336">Brown, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510393336">Cambron-McCabe &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>; Capper &amp; Young, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510393336">Dantley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510393336">Dantley &amp; Tillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510393336">Duncan-Andrade, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510393336">Hackman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510393336">Hafner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124510393336">Marshall, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510393336">McKenzie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0013124510393336">Nieto, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0013124510393336">Scheurich &amp; McKenzie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0013124510393336">Scheurich &amp; Skrla, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510393336">Shields, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0013124510393336">Theoharis, 2004</xref>). Research has confirmed that an important aspect of this leadership involves diversity self-awareness and self-reflection; facilitating faculty discussions on privilege, inequities, racism, and raising expectations for all students; and advocating for and understanding the backgrounds of traditionally marginalized students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510393336">Dantley &amp; Tillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510393336">Kose, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0013124510393336">Scheurich, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013124510393336">Theoharis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0013124510393336">Touchton &amp; Acker-Hocevar, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, regardless of student demographics, principals should lead schools that prepare <italic>all</italic> students as democratic, multicultural citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510393336">Banks, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124510393336">Banks &amp; Banks, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510393336">Dantley &amp; Tillman, 2006</xref>). In short, students need a deep understanding of diversity and identity for their individual development, interpersonal capacity of working with people from dissimilar backgrounds, and understanding of and ability to address social issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124510393336">Banks, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124510393336">Bigelow, Harvey, Karp, &amp; Miller, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0013124510393336">Nieto &amp; Bode, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0013124510393336">Westheimer &amp; Kahne, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the growing movement of transformative leadership and teaching, scholarship and research in educational leadership have largely left developmental perspectives on diversity leadership unexplored. This literature gap may be important as research demonstrates that the developmental complexity (or simplicity) of cultural competence influences one’s ability to understand and engage in intercultural relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124510393336">Adams, Bell, &amp; Griffin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510393336">Bennett &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>). We assume that principals have greater capacity for cultural competence (that will vary according to context) as they develop more complex levels of intercultural sensitivity. In short, although we are closer to understanding exemplary principal leadership in diverse schools, scholarship has not conceptualized how principals’ different developmental orientations may influence their practice. Assuming that principals, like other adults, fall along a spectrum of developmental orientations in intercultural sensitivity, they will have different developmental needs in preparation and practice. Understanding these different needs may be useful for professors, instructors, professional developers, or programs (e.g., in promoting leadership for social justice).</p>
<p>Our conceptual purpose is twofold. First, we propose that the Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510393336">Bennett, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510393336">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510393336">Bennett &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>) offers a powerful theory for understanding how principals may experience and interpret issues of difference and diversity in schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0013124510393336">1</xref></sup> In addition, we highlight key aspects of the DMIS that might illuminate principals’ understanding of diversity. For illustration purposes, we propose how principals at different ethnocentric or ethnorelative levels might interpret and seek to address a racial/ethnic “achievement gap” in their schools. In particular, we concentrate on ethnocentric stages that would most likely thwart leadership for diversity and social justice efforts. Although we agree with the DMIS that culture extends beyond race/ethnicity (e.g., gender, nationality, socioeconomic status, etc.) we limit our examination to culture as race/ethnicity for conceptual reasons. We draw quotes or examples from literature to highlight <italic>potential</italic> practices or issues within each developmental level. If aspiring or practicing leadership examples were not available, we present insightful practices from other types of educators (e.g., teachers, counselors) to illustrate cultural competence levels. (The DMIS implies that intercultural sensitivity would work similarly in principals and teachers). We recognize that the chosen examples do not fit into perfect developmental categories given the complexity of the DMIS and intercultural development. However, we believe this theoretical discussion points out potentially important differences in principals’ cultural competence. We conclude by discussing implications for practice, preparation, and research.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>The DMIS is a research-based model that has developed over nearly two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510393336">Bennett &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>). The DMIS now includes an intercultural developmental inventory (IDI) that quickly assesses individuals’ intercultural developmental level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510393336">Hammer, Bennett, &amp; Wiseman, 2003</xref>). The DMIS and the IDI are used by many school districts and businesses within the United States and across the world. While the DMIS has been explored in business leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510393336">Karim, 2003</xref>), scholarship has not examined its application to educational leadership. The DMIS delineates how individuals experience difference and develop intercultural sensitivity. This model is not tied to one cultural group, but to individuals in general. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0013124510393336">Figure 1</xref>, the DMIS delineates a continuum of six developmental orientations or stages that move from ethnocentric (the first three stages) toward ethnorelative (the last three stages). Not unlike racial identity development models (Helms, 1990; Parham &amp; Williams, 1993) that are generally stage oriented and linear, the DMIS also offers a developmental stage model that provides insight into how individuals experience difference and develop intercultural sensitivity. However, the authors of the DMIS are careful to note that although developmental “stages” or orientations reveal important, robust qualitative differences that may develop over time, they are not fixed or rigid—individuals potentially slide out of them depending on the context and individual. In addition, there are important <italic>individual</italic> and <italic>group</italic> differences within each developmental level (e.g., an individual in a “dominant” racial/ethnic, language, sexual orientation, etc.; group will have a different experience at a given developmental stage than a “nondominant” group member; for a more thorough overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett, 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The most ethnocentric orientation is denial of difference. In this stage, individuals deny or largely ignore that cultural differences exist and have not considered how cultural identity affects their own lives, let alone the lives of others. Individuals in this stage may state superficial statements of tolerance like “As long as they all speak English, there’s no problem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510393336">Bennett, 1993</xref>, p. 2). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett (2004)</xref> points out, people at denial are not avoiding the facts, but rather failing to notice cultural difference.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>When facilitators fail to understand the experience of denial, they are likely to present cultural information in too-complex ways and to become impatient at the aggressive ignorance often displayed at this stage. The resolution of denial issues allows the creation of simple categories for particular cultures, which sets up the conditions for the experience of defense (p. 64).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The second stage is called defense against difference and is characterized in a polarized way of “us versus them.” Individuals in this stage perceive the culture of their primary socialization as superior to others. They see other cultures as threatening and construct individuals outside of their own culture as “Others.” Reversal is a variation of defense. As suggested by the name, individuals in reversal experience an adopted culture as superior to the culture of their primary socialization. White principals in reversal might become fervent supporters of African American, American Indian, or Latino/a causes. Although this step is potentially a positive one, in this case, the polarized negative stereotypes are reversed. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett (2004)</xref> explains, “The European American sees all black people as saintly martyrs and all white people (including herself before the conversion) as brutal oppressors” (p. 66). Put differently, individuals in reversal attempt to separate from or repress the culture of their primary socialization.</p>
<p>The third ethnocentric stage is called minimization of difference, which is characterized by individuals who emphasize the similarity of people. Individuals in this stage hold that all people are essentially the same. Someone in this stage may state, “The key to getting along in any culture is to just be yourself—authentic and honest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510393336">Bennett, 1993</xref>). Individuals at this stage may remain persistent in correcting others behaviors to match their still ethnocentric expectation that “everyone really wants to be like us.”</p>
<p>The next three stages are defined as more ethnorelative, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510393336">Hammer, Bennett, and Wiseman (2003)</xref> have suggested means that “one’s own culture is experienced in the context of other cultures” (p. 5). In acceptance, the first ethnorelative stage, individuals understand that behaviors and values, including their own, exist in idiosyncratic cultural contexts and experience their own culture as just one of a multitude of equally complex worldviews. In the adaption stage, individuals can shift from one worldview to another and change their behavior to effectively interact with people from another culture. Examples of statements from someone who is adapting to difference may be “To solve this dispute, I’m going to have to change my approach,” and “I can maintain my values and also behave in culturally appropriate ways” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510393336">Bennett, 1993</xref>, p. 3). The final stage in ethnorelativism is called integration, which is characterized by accepting an identity that is not based in any one culture. For instance, individuals in integration are considered to be bicultural or multicultural and use their skills of understanding other cultures to become fully competent in new cultures.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013124510393336">
<title>Application</title>
<p>As noted previously, we will employ the DMIS to explore how developmental differences of principals’ intercultural sensitivity hypothetically influence their understanding of and practices with cultural differences. To focus this discussion, we suggest how white principals or principals of color with different DMIS orientations might interpret the pervasive achievement gap of white students outperforming black or Latino peers on standardized tests, grades, and gradation and college completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0013124510393336">National Center for Education Statistics, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0013124510393336">2009</xref>). When possible, we provide empirical examples of relevant beliefs or practices of school administrators or other educators. This analysis is not intended to generalize perfectly to all white principals or principals of color as we recognize individual and cultural differences within each of the six DMIS orientations (e.g., two white principals with a defense orientation will have nuanced cultural competence differences depending on their background, education, and context in which they work, etc.). However, we believe this exploration may illuminate general developmental tendencies for principals who represent dominant or nondominant cultures. We primarily examine each of the three ethnocentric orientations (denial, defense, and minimization) that expose the greatest limitations and needs related to cultural competence. Although there are likely distinctions between the ethnorelative orientations, we concentrate on one example that provides sufficient contrast to ethnocentric viewpoints. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510393336">Table 1</xref> provides an overview of our hypothetical analysis.</p>

<title>Denial</title>
<p>Principals in the developmental stage of denial, the typical default orientation of a monocultural socialization as explained by the DMIS theory would largely deny the influence of cultural difference on the achievement gap. Perhaps new to a culturally diverse school or context, whether of color or white, principals would experience their culture as the only real one. Principals in denial would generally be disinterested in, or avoid noticing, cultural difference even if disaggregated test results or an influx of culturally diverse students were brought to their attention. Therefore, it is likely that principals in denial would seek solutions to the achievement gap that have little to do with cultural difference (e.g., aligning curricula with state standards, offering tutoring, etc.). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124510393336">Gardiner and colleagues (2009)</xref> found that some urban principals focused school equity efforts on raising standardized test scores; however, “when clarifying how principals were accomplishing this, data revealed the broader aspects of ensuring multicultural curricula and instruction had been overlooked” (pp. 150-51). The area of growth for principals in denial related to an achievement gap would be to begin noticing how cultural differences influence the beliefs, attitudes, expectations, behaviors, and relationships of parents, students, and school personnel, particularly related to student learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0013124510393336">
<title>Defense and Reversal</title>
<p>Unlike principals in denial, principals in the defense stage would be aware of how cultural differences may influence the achievement gap, but they would use simplistic, stereotypical, and “us versus them” explanations related to cultural difference. In general, and based on how an individual would think about difference in the DMIS, school leaders may interpret the achievement gap through the lens of their presumed cultural superiority or inferiority. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett (2004)</xref> suggested that individuals who think about cultural difference in a defensive way “are more openly threatened by cultural differences” and organize their worldview around “us and them” (p. 65). This ethnocentric perspective is similar to deficit thinking, where students, parents, or their backgrounds are viewed as problems to fix or explanations for low student performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0013124510393336">Shields et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0013124510393336">Valencia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0013124510393336">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Research findings from two different studies relevant to school leadership seem related to defense examples. In their study of successful urban superintendents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0013124510393336">Skrla and Scheurich (2001)</xref> explain that many (particularly white) teachers, principals, and superintendents, “tend to view the broad-scale underperformance of children of color and children from low-income homes in their schools as inevitable, something that is not within their power to change” (p. 237). These authors summarized one superintendent’s reflection: “Deficit thinking was the dominant paradigm that shaped the ways educators made meaning about the lack of school success for children of color and children from low-income homes” (p. 252). As one superintendent from their study observed of the people with whom he worked, “I heard enough of people thinking that they just couldn’t teach those students as much, perhaps because of the home environment and because of the lack of educational preparation that they brought to the door. . .” (p. 253).</p>
<p>A second example comes from a counselor’s perspective on Navajo youth, who not coincidentally, worked with a principal who viewed Navajo student discrimination in his school as isolated incidents rather than related to school policies or practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510393336">Deyhle, 1995</xref>).</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We [Anglos] were brought up every day with the question, “What are you going to be when you grow up?” And that is something that the Navajo parents never ask. And then I bring them in the counseling office and I ask, “What are you going to be when you finish high school?” That is the first time they have even heard the question. It’s just not done at home. And it’s my values. The importance of an education and a job. They don’t think to the future. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510393336">Deyhle, 1995</xref>, p. 416)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These examples seem to reveal an ethnocentric defense against difference where European American culture reigns superior to (a distorted perception of) the cultures of students of color. By implication, white principals in this stage might blame an achievement gap on the students or parents of color assumed cultural inferiority, effort, background, or ability—the deficit thinking model. They may explain poor student outcomes by the lack of “dominant” (white and assumed to be monolithic) culture values, beliefs, and practices. They may also lower their expectations for students of color or assume that their school was not meant to support “those kids.” They probably would resist culturally relevant discussions, practices or curricula.</p>
<p>Principals of color in defense, as viewed through the DMIS, would also believe in their cultural superiority and might blame the achievement gap on Eurocentric testing, curricula, or school practices perceived to be racist or culturally irrelevant. However, their interpretation would not necessarily apply to an achievement gap explanation for students of color from different cultural backgrounds (e.g., a black principal in defense, similar to a white principal, might blame Latino/a students’ lower performance on their cultural background). Principals of color at this stage may possibly eliminate any signs of European influence and build a “multicultural” school that explicitly or implicitly denigrates or excludes an assumed dominant culture viewed as almost wholly negative (i.e., a polarized and narrow view of multiculturalism). They might dismiss or question the importance of standards or other traditionally valued aspects of student learning (that are associated with the dominant culture). This stance may be related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510393336">North’s (2009)</xref> critique of critical literacy without functional literacy where educators (whether of color or white) engage students in understanding or addressing social issues (e.g., racism) without teaching them traditionally valued academic and functional skills necessary for navigating school or society. In her research with teachers, North observed many instances of critical literacy in one Native American high school teacher’s practice, but also noted, “Unfortunately, I did not see [the teacher] work with students on the building of complex reading and writing competencies” (p. 70). This teacher implied that although he felt responsible to help students improve their writing, it was less important than their development of critical literacy. For example, he stated,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You know, kids don’t always do great work, which might just reflect their lack of skills in writing or motivation. But if I’m giving essay questions that are not found in the book, students have to think—to correlate or compare something. If they’re interested, kids respond well to those. <italic>Their grammar or spelling might suck, but this is not what is important</italic>. It’s important that I ask them a question just because I want to know what they think. (p. 59, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our understanding of the DMIS, both principals who are white and of color in defense may need to resolve surface-level, polarized perceptions of cultural difference and recognize more of the positives of other cultures, as well as some of the not-so-positive aspects of their own culture. For example, white principals may need to recognize that harmful stereotypes can negatively influence students of color performance whereas principals of color might need to recognize that students of color need to develop cultural capital for succeeding in the dominant cultural system of education.</p>
<p>White principals in reversal would likely have a similar interpretation and response to the achievement gap as principals of color in defense. White leaders in reversal, may in part, blame the achievement gap on an oppressive European cultural system of education and work toward building a multicultural school that excludes or admonishes this dominant culture. A potential issue is the acceptance of inappropriate behavior or low quality work from students of color. White principals in reversal could have difficulty distinguishing these issues from culture and hold (overly) positive stereotypical perceptions of students from nondominant groups. For example, rather than working from a deficit-model like their defense counterparts, they might assume black students are culturally superior and fail to see that sometimes black students simply act inappropriately or submit poor quality work. A situation provided by Lisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510393336">Delpit (1988)</xref> may illustrate this point. Delpit brought a paper written by a Native American student that was riddled with sentence and paragraph structural errors to her faculty for discussion. She wrote, “I was amazed at the response . . . some of the more progressively minded, suggested that I was attempting to function as a gatekeeper by raising the issue, and had internalized repressive and disempowering forces of the power elite to suggest something was wrong with a Native American student just because she had another style of writing” (p. 38). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0013124510393336">North’s (2009)</xref> argument on the limits of critical literacy in isolation, Delpit’s point was that some faculty members were failing to acknowledge or take responsibility for this student’s academic needs (with the rationale that it was oppressive to expect a Native American student to improve her English writing). In this case or similar scenarios with principals, the DMIS may interpret this type of perspective as a white reversal worldview (or defense perspective from a principal of color).</p>
<p>Principals of color in reversal would likely look from a DMIS lens similar to white principals in defense. In this case, the achievement gap would be blamed on the failure of students and parents of color to accept the dominant culture. Principals here might point to “model minorities” who achieved academic success within the current system and persuade students and parents of color to assimilate into or “work harder” in the current system. They would likely be resistant to building a multicultural school. Principals of any culture in reversal would have similar underlying areas of growth (that are reversed compared to defense). In short, they need to recognize the positive aspects of their own culture as well as the not so positive aspects of their adopted culture.</p>
<p>A possible interpretation or implication of the DMIS is that in each of the above scenarios (in defense and reversal), principals potentially do not hold students of color to high expectations. In the case of an imposed or internalized deficit model, they view students of color as lazy, incapable, or culturally deficient. Conversely, from a nondominant superiority perspective, negative behaviors or performance by students of color may be overlooked or dominant culture aspects of the achievement gap may be deemed unimportant (e.g., succeeding on a standardized tests is perceived to be culturally biased and of no value). Principals may also treat students in stereotypical ways that overshadow or distort their cultural similarities or individuality (e.g., they may not see that parents and students across cultures want to succeed in school). The principals’ areas of growth center on seeing how the achievement gap might be closed through greater awareness of the commonalities, similarities, and underlying humanity (both positive and negative) of their adopted culture, primary socialization culture, and other cultures. Until principals reach this developmental milestone, as represented in minimization, it will be difficult for them to understand more nuanced cultural differences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0013124510393336">
<title>Minimization</title>
<p>White principals in a minimization stage would be unlikely to overtly blame the achievement gap on dominant or nondominant cultural differences, but rather interpret the achievement gap from a “colorblind” perspective that views negative cultural stereotypes and low expectations as contributing to the problem. Principals at minimization would likely see the need to remove deficit thinking from educational practices and curricula (e.g., eliminate literature with negative cultural stereotypes), focus on how students are similar as individuals, and establish high standards and expectations for all students to help close the achievement gap. That is, they would likely seek to embrace the common humanity in all students by minimizing cultural differences. Hernandez and Marshall (2007) found that their aspiring principal “students were interested in over-emphasizing everyone’s common humanity at the expense of individual differences” (p. 27). One student in their study on future school principals stated:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Depending on the setting, educators might deal with people from different cultures, class, and/or academic abilities with very different values and beliefs. It is a major challenge to mold these students into one conducive team. Regardless of these variables, there are common threads that can be used to promote tolerance and cultural acceptance. (pg.27)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though Hernandez and Marshall (2007) were not aware of what these “common threads” were, we believe that—particularly with phrases such as “deal with,” (rather than have the opportunity for) and “promote tolerance”—this leader may have attempted to minimize individual or group differences through assimilation or by overemphasizing similarities. Other examples of minimization can be found with the previously mentioned principal in Dehyle’s (1995) study of Navajo youth or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0013124510393336">Ridenour’s (2004)</xref> work with aspiring school leaders. One student in Ridenour’s course reflected, “For me, just talking about race and racism, or racial issues, might lead people to think I am a racist—something I don’t want to ever be. So the easiest thing to do is not to say anything” (p. 23).</p>
<p>Although principals in minimization may have a less ethnocentric understanding of cultural difference than in defense/reversal, they nevertheless would fail to recognize subtle cultural differences that influence students of color attitudes, behaviors, or performance in school. For instance, white principals in minimization may hold high expectations for students of color, but limited in their ability to recognize their culture (or white privilege), may trivialize or romanticize important cultural differences by assuming underlying universal human characteristics (values, beliefs, learning, or communication styles) in teaching, curricula, and learning. Thus, they might adopt a superficial “tolerance-based” multicultural curriculum as a solution for the achievement gap but probably would resist suggestions for an in-depth multicultural curriculum revision. For example, principals in minimization may host food festivals from around the world in their schools to suggest that we all have special staples of food in our background or take a heroes and holiday approach to multicultural education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124510393336">Lee, Menkart, &amp; Okazawa-Rey, 2002</xref>). These examples would represent principals that overemphasize our common humanity as one way of thinking about difference. Principals of color may also seek to enforce high standards and expectations for all students but be disinterested in substantial multicultural programmatic or curricular revisions that affirm the cultural nuances of students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013124510393336">
<title>Acceptance/Adaption</title>
<p>Theoretically, it would not be until ethnorelative stages, such as acceptance or adaption that principals better understand how the nuances of cultural difference in educational practices, curricula, structures, or institutionalized forms of discrimination may influence the achievement gap. It is within these stages that we believe principals who are white or of color seek to eliminate stereotypes, hold high expectations for all students, recognize students’ individuality, and build a multicultural school that embraces and affirms all students’ cultures as solutions to the achievement gap. This more culturally competent leadership is often captured in leadership for equity, diversity, or social justice scholarship or research (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0013124510393336">Marshall &amp; Olivia, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0013124510393336">Shields, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0013124510393336">Theoharis, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124510393336">Kose (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124510393336">2009</xref>) found that principals promoted transformative teacher learning that included reflecting on white privilege, affirming students’ diverse backgrounds, building cultural capital for school success, integrating academic content with teaching for social justice, and building curricular coherence across the school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510393336">Hernandez (2005)</xref>, in his study of six Latina/o principals, found that there was both a commitment to the individual identity of students and to their academic achievement. One participant in his study stated, “I help children meet state standards and graduate . . . and help them stay connected to who they are as a person [a connection to identity]. They can’t give up who they are” (p. 390). This principal is both recognizing students’ individuality and holding them to high expectations. Note that principals at more ethnorelative stages do not necessarily overlook other noncultural factors in an achievement gap such as curriculum and standards fragmentation; they simply have greater awareness of how culture may play a role in understanding or addressing an achievement gap than principals at more ethnocentric orientations. We presume that more ethnorelative explanations and solutions to achievement gaps are more effective because they can directly address the detrimental legacy of educational deficit thinking and promote critical multicultural practices and educational transformation.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusion</title>
<p>Several implications can be drawn from understanding individuals’ potential intercultural perceptions, actions, and areas of growth. First, it seems important that preparation programs promote the understanding that individuals at different stages have different developmental needs. Like meeting teachers’ or students’ developmental learning needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0013124510393336">National Research Council, 2001</xref>), it seems crucial to meet aspiring school leaders where they are developmentally, rather than where instructors think, hope, or wish they are. For example, many students may believe they want to “lead for social justice,” but their DMIS orientation could strongly influence their understanding of social justice, and in some cases, do more harm by perpetuating stereotypes and generalizations. Leading for social justice may, for some, mean assimilating all students into a Eurocentric worldview or creating an oppositional and narrow form of multiculturalism in defense or reversal, treating everyone the same in minimization, and affirming various strands of diversity in adaption. As another example, asking white principals firmly planted in the defense stage to affirm diversity or lead for antioppressive education, as many scholars suggest, could be developmentally inappropriate and actually reinforce their defensiveness and negative cultural stereotypes. Rather, individuals in defense must first recognize the common humanity and similarities of other cultures (and dissolve their cultural superiority) before they leap into embracing diversity.</p>
<p>Second, while an understanding of DMIS orientations is an important step in promoting student growth, practitioners, scholars, and researchers could explore different approaches and actual practices in using the DMIS for student development. For instance, one of the authors of this article has required aspiring principals to take the IDI (again, a brief Likert-type scale assessment of the DMIS stages), provided feedback on their IDI results, and included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510393336">Bennett’s (2004)</xref> article on the course readings list for class discussion. In addition, the Intercultural Communication Institute offers many DMIS professional development opportunities (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intercultural.org/">http://www.intercultural.org/</ext-link>). Third, as others have suggested using social justice criteria in admissions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0013124510393336">McKenzie et al., 2008</xref>), preparation programs might consider using the IDI as another (and research robust) criterion for making admission decisions. In short, programs may value applicants who demonstrate greater intercultural sensitivity or in the least have an understanding of incoming students’ intercultural developmental needs. Finally, researchers might employ the DMIS as a theoretical lens for conducting research or utilize the DMIS or IDI as part of an intervention in preparation programs or in the field.</p>
<p>Through our analysis of the DMIS, we posited how principals may understand difference, particularly as it relates to a racial/ethnic achievement gap, and how these interpretations may influence leadership practices. We believe the DMIS offers a powerful model for helping principals and professors interpret individuals’ developmental diversity or cultural understandings, needs, challenges, and areas of growth. Our goal was not to generalize and make sweeping statements about principals; rather, we suggest that the DMIS might help us make sense of principal practice in the area of equity and social justice. Enfolding this developmental perspective into preparation and practice may enhance school leaders’ ability to lead diverse schools that prepare all students to navigate, critique, and succeed in a complex, multicultural world.</p>
