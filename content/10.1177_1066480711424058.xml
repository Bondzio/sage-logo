<abstract>
<p>In this interview, Drs. Russell Haber and Karen Cooper-Haber talk about their 30-year relationship with the field of marriage and family therapy, their significant moments and relationships in the profession, their hopes for future counselors, and their own evolution. Karen is a dynamic force filled with seemingly endless energy, creative ideas, and an immeasurable faith and love in those with whom she interacts. Although Russell seems more reserved, a look past the surface reveals an equally powerful and passionate force, committed to the profession, to creative and intentional use of theory, and to challenging students, professionals, families, and self. Together they are a perfectly balanced pair who have invested decades together into strengthening the field of marriage and family therapy in South Carolina and have shared their friendship with leaders such as Virginia Satir, Carl Whitaker, Salvador Minuchin, and so many others in order to strengthen the community of therapists in the southeast.</p>

<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> The first question for both of you, and you can decide who is going to answer first, is talk a little bit about how you got started in marriage and family therapy.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Why don’t you start?</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Okay. When I was at Bowling Green State University, I took part in a Gestalt marathon group and that’s when I decided to become a therapist. And so I spent about a year studying under the tutelage of Mel Foulds. Then, after a year, Mel said, you need to start speaking with Jim Guinan. So this was in 1974. I began my long relationship with Jim Guinan, who was a family therapist and was very interpersonal. And so my two bases became one foot in the interpersonal world and one foot into the intrapersonal world. I think that that has stayed as a rubric for me for my entire career. Experiential but also systemic.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> And for me, my first career life was as a counselor with juvenile offenders and so I worked in some institutions and I also worked with family court. I had my Master’s in Counseling at that point, but in that work I was exposed a lot to students and their families or delinquents and their families, just visiting in the homes. I really started more like a social worker role, even though I wasn’t a social worker, but I saw the importance of the family to the students or those juveniles. And so I knew that that was something, along with what I learned working with family court, that I wanted to know more about and wanted to be able to make better entry into and better utilization of the family. So that was that and then, after working as a family court counselor, I came to here Columbia to get my Ph.D., and I went into the Counselor Ed. Program. But I was thinking more of going into the direction on criminal justice and so I actually ended up teaching in college criminal justice for 2 years when I finished that. During that time Russell and I were in classes together and we met. And actually he was my first supervisor.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Back when dual relationships were ….</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Yeah, back when dual relationships were okay. But I mean, you really taught me before you taught me, so ….</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Besides being a supervisor, I was her tennis teacher. And we worked out pretty well there so we just continued.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> But we saw some families together, we did some co-therapy with some families, and then we just decided to study with some family therapists. And that was our first exposure with Satir and then to Andolfi, and I think that that really shaped me and just started me in that direction.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> Interesting. I didn’t realize you all met that way. What would you describe as some of your shining moments, times when you knew that either together or individually you were impacting the field?</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Well, for me it’s a tricky question because there’s a part of me that always felt like I had to learn more, study more, that I never quite made it. And I remember Whitaker, when we would introduce him and talk about his accomplishments, he would often say that just I just can’t relate to it. It’s really not me. And so you know, I think that that’s been my orientation—really to think of myself as just someone who is learning the process of working with clients. And I think that I’ve always worked with a fair amount of clients, which has kept me very humble in that I always expect people to be very involved in supervision because I know how much supervision I need. People say well I don’t have anything to talk about and I say that’s really amazing because as I think about my clients and I think “I’m doing too little with this one” or “This one I’m not sure if we need to stop” or “This one I haven’t pushed to bring in her parents,” so there’s every case I have questions. So I think that if you feel like you’ve made it, you’ve stopped asking the questions. However, I think in hindsight I can see where there have been certain developments along the field have been kind of milestones. I think the first idea that I came up with, and I guess it was through collaborating with Karen, was the idea of bringing friends into family therapy and so Karen really pushed me to really expand in this area. Do I have time to tell a story about that?</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> Absolutely.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Alright. Karen asked me to do a consult in Dent Middle School and the consult was for a boy who was maybe 7th grade who was incessantly in fights and in trouble with his classmates and with the school. At this point I was doing a lot of three-generational interviews and so I said to Karen, “I would really like to get the three generations.” So Karen has a session with the boy, the mother, the father, and the father’s mother. And so I started conducting the session, and realized this system was so closed, so self-contained, that they didn’t know how to relate to outsiders. So it became clear to me or at least I was thinking that it was clear to me that this kid was getting into fights because he didn’t know how to relate to friends because the father, the mother, the grandmother never really connected with people outside of the family. So I, in a very kind of bravado move, said to Karen, “I would never work with this kid unless he brought friends into the sessions and to use them to teach him how to relate without fighting because he just doesn’t know. The family really never has explored this territory.” So Karen really was the first, she started before me because she was working with this kid’s friends, and then had pretty good success with that. And so then I had three families with only children. So, these three families, there were two parents and myself, three adults on one kid telling them they’re not doing things right, they should do better, be more mature and so forth. So then I started thinking about Karen’s work with friends and I was thinking of how unfair it is to have three adults from one generation and one kid from the other generation being confronted in therapy about doing things differently. So I said to these three only children “Bring friends into the next session.” And they were different ages, you know, one was in elementary school, one was middle, one was high school. So in these three sessions, I found that the friends were utterly fascinating. They talked about their friendship; they were able to say things to the client that I wasn’t able to say. For instance, there was a high school kid and he really was in a war with his parents and said, “I just want to be a boarder in the house, I don’t want to be a child in the house anymore.” And then his friend said, “You’re full of shit.” And this is something that would have been useless for me to say, or even combative, but when his friend said it, it really exposed how ridiculous he was. And I could probably tell stories for the next two hours about the priceless things that friends have contributed to the sessions. So I would say that my article, when I did the lit review <italic>Friends and Family Therapy</italic>, it was the only article that talked about bringing friends into therapy. So I felt like that that was something that was important to write about. It doesn’t mean that other people weren’t doing it before, but no one’s written about it before. So let me stop and let you start.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Well, I think for me it would be more through my students and my supervisees. So if there were shining moments for me, they’ve been to have someone whom I’ve taught or supervised through the years, to meet up with that person again many years later and have that person say, “I learned the best things from you,” or “You had the most influence on what I did with my professional life,” or you know “I remember that class when you did such and such or told such and such.” I think for me, those are more of the moments that I feel really good and feel like maybe I’ve made a difference. You don’t get the feedback I don’t think from families that often or from clients, sometimes you do, but not so much. They kind of come and they go, and you know they live their lives, and sometimes you run into them or sometimes you hear from them and most of the time you don’t. But I think that students and people that you’ve supervised or mentored, those are folks that will stay connected in some way or maybe years later, you know, be able to offer something that makes you feel like, well that was worth it.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> Yeah, absolutely. That’s so interesting. So, you’ve probably answered some of this about your key achievements but what has been most important to you in regard to specific areas, whether it’s supervision, consultation, building programs, writing, managing things. What really has been the thing that has, at this point, maybe, I don’t know, kept your fire burning?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> I think I know what he’s going to say.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Well, for me it was the whole Gestalt. I came up with a formula that I kept for my career. And the formula was to do the work and then to train people and supervise people about the work and then to think about it and write about it. And each piece, the writing, the training, and the doing, was really pivotal for me because they fed each other. And I think without doing the work I wouldn’t have had the information, I couldn’t train people. And without training people I wouldn’t, I’d be more in the process of doing rather than stepping back and thinking about it. So I think that that was very useful. I believe, I’m not positive, but I believe that we were the first people to do live supervision in Columbia. I think that there were some other one-way mirrors, but people weren’t using the mirrors to make phone calls to intervene live into the sessions, and I think that that’s been probably my major accomplishment is as a supervisor. That I’ve been doing supervision since 1978, and I’ve been doing a lot of live supervision since I studied with Maurizio Andolfi, and that was in 1981. So then I came back, and I immediately started always having mirrors, whatever office I was in. And in the live supervision, I was able to find ways to get the clients to help the therapist change and to get the therapist changed. So it became very dynamic, we had clients coming back behind the mirror and supervising the therapist with me. So we really used all different combinations around the mirror and so that was pretty instrumental to me learning a lot about supervision, which kind of finished in me writing a book about it. In 1996 it was published. So that was one piece, the other thing was in 1994, Maurizio Andolfi and I co-edited a book on consultation and the consultation really shifted my thinking in that therapy can be a resource project. So that we’re bringing in people as resources and so it moves from seeing the family as pathological as instead to see the family as very resourceful. And then I kind of guest edited a journal, the <italic>Journal for Strategic and Systemic Therapy</italic>, I guest edited one issue, and the issue was called “Inside and Outside the Family.” This kind of puts it all together, that the family is just the punctuation. Like a family is somebody, the family could be a grandparent, it could be an aunt, it could be someone that just, a babysitter that gets very involved, so how you determine family is how you determine how you punctuate the system. So this became an idea that has continued through my work of really looking for resources in the system. So that’s about it.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Obviously I would say I’m not the thinker Russell is. I’m a visionary, that’s my strength and I’m a doer.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Also, an editor.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Yeah, I’m a great editor! But I don’t sit down long enough to write. So I think that for me, what has excited me the most throughout my career has been creating new contexts, creating new programs, pushing beyond kind of what the traditional definitions of whatever system I’m working in is or are, to hopefully inspire or motivate folks around me to do the same thing, to go out in the world and try to create differences not just in a family or in an individual but in the larger system, in the social system, in the school system, in the correctional system, in the neighborhood. When I’ve had that happen successfully, and the only definition to me of that is if it lasts beyond you, and if it doesn’t last beyond you then I think it was a good run but I don’t think it’s really success. And so I think that even if specific programs don’t last, if there have been folks that have been impacted in that system to then go out and do more of that someplace else, then I think it’s kind of like the ripple effect or something in the water and I think that’s really important. That’s what excites me and I think that in some point in time when I’m saying “This is it,” then that’s what’s going to have made a different for me and make me feel good.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> One thing when Laura Dodson was here doing the workshop, she asked how many people were supervised by Karen and then also by myself in this room of professionals, and it was really quite a percentage. So I think that that makes me feel like that we’ve been very useful in that we have people in different sectors doing really fine work. And I think the training program that I started; I was director of training at the Counseling Center (at the University of South Carolina) from 1985 through the year 2000 when I became the director, and that was a multidisciplinary program, and then it was a multilevel program. So then we had interns who were supervising other interns and I’ve had interns who have sat in and done consultations for me, and I think just being in a metaposition is what makes people smarter. I used to tell people that when I’m behind the mirror I increase my intelligence by one standard deviation, when I’m supervising the supervision I go two levels back so then I increase my intelligence by two standard deviations. I say that because it is much easier to see the pattern. Like if we look at the pattern of what’s going on with our threesome, we’re all in it so we can just describe it, but we don’t really see ourselves in it, we see each other. But when you get one person who is the fly on the wall and then they can look at it, I think they can describe it much more vividly, maybe much more creatively because they’re outside of it. So anyhow, that’s a piece that I try to emphasis, going one down and going one up in professional relationships.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> It is interesting because it sounds like you all have a nice balance between the two of you in the way you are able to approach your work.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> We’re different.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> But in a way that compliments each other.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Yeah, I think that when particularly we are doing co-therapy. I think that Karen has a way with play and connecting with a family and I have a way of challenging a family that really kind of fits together. We wrote some articles about our co-therapy relationship so that’s been an important development.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> We used to do a lot of it but we don’t have opportunities to do as much anymore. It was nice. It’s always better to do co-therapy I think.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> Yeah, it’s fun. It’s really interesting. Who were your most significant influences or mentors?</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> You want to go first?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> You know both of us have stories about some of the same people, but if I really had to look at who stands out as influencing me the most in the way I am, the way I work, the way I think, I would have to say first my father, second Russell, and then third I would have to say Andolfi because I think that our experiences with him have been since 1981 and we have maintained a close connection since 1981. But not only did he personally impact me and how I work and the person who I am and the person of the therapist, but he really, really touched me in that way and influenced me to think about myself in therapy, in the room, in the relationship, in the process. But most importantly I think he is responsible for connecting us to such a network of creative, bright, exciting therapists all over the world that these two little poor folks from South Carolina and Brooklyn would never have imagined that we would have the connections and the linkages that we have today and have had the opportunity to travel and teach and train and be trained through his network. So, I have to say that in terms of my personal development it would be more my father and Russell, but in my professional development, in addition to them, but mostly it would be the network that’s been created through Andolfi.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> And you’re fresh off of a trip to Italy working with him.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Fresh off another trip, yeah, another trip.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> So I have to work a little bit harder so I can get ahead of your father?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Well, we won’t go there in this conversation.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> It will take some extra work. But yeah, our teachers are the same. In 1979, I think, actually it was the month that overlapped between December and January of ’79 and ’80 that we studied with Virginia Satir. And then Virginia was kind of responsible for us kind of moving past some issues for us to get married. She worked with us for 6 hours in this particular training that we went to—we were the couple in front of the group. And so, we got married in 1980 and we really had no money at all. So someone gave us a cabin in Georgia for two days and that was basically our honeymoon. But then I said, why rush to do a honeymoon? We got married in November 1980, so I said let’s just do something over the summer and that’s when I saw the ad in Family Process for a practicum in Rome for a month with Maurizio Andolfi. And so we went to Italy more to be on a honeymoon than to study with Andolfi, but Andolfi was such a fantastic therapist and supervisor and trainer that we really became connected to him and remain good friends you know, 30 years later, as well as with many people from the original group. In 1981 was the first group, and like Karen said, we developed this connected group and this sibling system where it’s taken us all over the world or many places in the world. But, I was telling Karen to today, the person that I think about the most during the week or when I’m talking to students is Carl Whitaker. And he had a way of just seeding the unconscious and so many of his stories became so strong in my brain that they kind of got sealed in my brain. We met Carl Whitaker at workshops that we attended. But Karen and I were promoting workshops, we were giving workshops for the community, and we did this for our own training, but then we brought all of these fantastic people to South Carolina, which I think had an incredible impact on the level of therapy in South Carolina. So it was in maybe ’83 or something, I kept on writing letters to Carl to get him to come do a workshop for our organization and he never wrote me back so I told Maurizio.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Maurizio was here visiting.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> So I said, “Maurizio, Carl never writes back. I tried and I was very nice, and he just never responds.” So Maurizio goes, “That bastard. That son of a bitch, I’ll call him right now.” So, you know, he calls him up in our former house and then Carl says to Maurizio that I should send him another letter. So I sent him another letter. I said “Maurizio said to send the letter,” and then a couple of days later he called up on the phone and he arranged to do the workshop. So the workshop was incredibly well received and he was fantastic and we had a great time. So then with a lot of trepidation I asked him to come back. I said, “Carl, would you be willing to come back next year?” and he said without blinking, you know without taking a moment, he said, “I always come back for family reunions.” And so then we became close with him and he came back you know about 7 or 8 consecutive years. He developed kind of a format where one day would be with our group, usually at the end, two days would be a large workshop, and two days would be a small workshop, and so we got a pretty big dose of Carl. Then we had telephone contact, we had once a month consult with him where we would talk about our cases. We really had a lot of time with him. So those are the three famous ones. Jim Guinan and Mel Foulds will always be dear mentors for me and they were the people that were my kind of professional parents and then they brought me to meet people like Carl and Virginia.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> You always say that when you work you have Carl in your head more than any other.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Yeah. Carl is just in me. And I think that that’s my theory of studying with these mentors is that they were so charismatic and so creative that in the beginning you just get wowed by them and you try to do things like them. So you more or less introjected them. And I think that there is a period where you have to work it out—like when I’m in a session and it’s not going too well, I’ll say, “Well, what would Carl do?” Then I have this introjective Carl. But I think that after years, you start assimilating, so you start kind of putting their ideas, their information into your own conceptualization. The other person, and this is going back to the Mel Foulds side of the equation, the other person who has been a very big influence for me has been Al Pesso, and he’s a very intrapsychic therapist so he works with the internal family. And so I think that that work has been very important through my career as well.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> So fascinating. What are your hopes? Well let me ask you this one first, when you begin working with new counselors, what are the most important things that you hope to infuse in their development, like from the early stages?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> Say that one more time.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> When you start working with new counselors, what is it you hope to infuse into their development early on; what you want them to grasp as early as possible?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> For me, what I want to stimulate or get as a response or influence in some way is their excitement. I really feel like if they can be excited about what they’re getting ready to do, if they can be curious about what they’re getting ready to do, and if they cannot take themselves too seriously about what they’re getting ready to do. So I think for me, those are the things that I try to start with and then the other thing is that I really try to encourage young therapists and students to read. I don’t think they read as much as I’d like to see them read, if at all, other than what they absolutely have to read. And I feel like I can sort of tell who’s going to be a more serious therapist or who is going to embrace it more fully by the ones that are the most curious, read the most, want to learn the most, pursue training the most, pursue opportunities to get training. Even just in my context when I throw something out like, “Well, there’s some student scholarships to go see Minuchin or Andolfi or go do this, or before to go see Whitaker or whatever,” it’s the ones who jump on that and say boy, I’m going to beat everyone else out because I want to be there so badly. Then I know they are going to take this very seriously. So that’s kind of where I come from, and I mean there are other things but I think those are the main things that I want to see early. And you know, also just a sense that they are willing to do whatever it takes, you know that they are not going to miss one opportunity to learn something as opposed to well, this is the time I do this and this is the time I do that and this is my time and this is this time and I don’t do that. That’s well and good but I don’t think those are going to make the best therapists. So I guess that’s what I see when I see that other kind of hunger and excitement and willingness to kind of extend themselves beyond, I know that person is going to make a difference.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> Well of course I agree with what Karen said, but one of the initial encounters I have with a supervisee is whether they can go one down and by that I mean whether they can be honest and open to really learning and exposing the parts of themselves that they’re not sure about. Therapy is very personal and the supervision can only be as good as the disclosure, the self-disclosure of the supervisee, because usually we’re not watching them. We don’t know exactly what is going on in the session so we have to trust that they’ll let us know when they’re struggling or how they struggle. I remember I had a supervisee and he brings a tape and so I said, “What’s your question, what do you want to get from this tape?” and then he said, “Well, I just want you to see it.” And I said, “Okay, I’d be happy to see it, but what am I looking for?” and he said, “Well I felt like the session went well.” And I said, “I didn’t say the session didn’t go well, but what is the question that you have?” And so this went on for about like 30 minutes and I kept on chasing him to say learn something from <italic>this</italic>, or just find something <italic>that</italic>, you know? It could be that you didn’t let a silence go, or that you used a metaphor, or that you felt like you could have gone in two different directions. So I think that therapy is an incredibly creative process and we have so many decisions that we make almost subliminally and if people don’t ask themselves about those decisions, then they operate very blindly. The therapists that we’ve been talking about all teach about how to use self and that’s the thing that I got from Maurizio perhaps the most is that the s<italic>elf</italic> is the only thing that we can control. We can’t control what the family does, but we can control how we respond to what the family does. So that’s the piece that I want people to learn is to put the emphasis on what we’re doing, more than what the family is doing. And the last thing that I’ll say is that we’re really trying to teach therapists to have a systemic brain, and I think that the world teaches us to be linear, that it is so and so’s fault, or this is because of that, and it isn’t a circular reality. And students when they do kind of the things that Karen was suggesting about the reading and pursuing more information and to really traveling and seeing the world from different places, I think that then you can start moving past the linear way. But it does not make sense to look at a family and say that this kid is acting out because there is some anxiety in the parents that they’re struggling with. We just don’t explain the world that way. But when you develop a systemic brain, then you’re open to seeing non-causal relationships and seeing more associational relationships, and that’s difficult. And I think that for me, good supervision is at least a two-year process with the same supervisor because it takes that much time to really shift. Like the first year, you’re learning how to function, learning the skills. The second year you can become more sophisticated and more specialized.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> The last question is what are your hopes for this next generation of therapists?</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> I hope they’re going to catch fire! That’s what I hope. I hope that they are going to be just as excited about what they are doing as we are. I hope they’re going to love it and be passionate about it. I hope they’re going to push themselves constantly, I hope they’re going to never feel like they’ve got it down. I hope they’ll never feel like they know enough, they’ll never feel like they’re finished. You know? So, that’s my hope. I think that’s the only way that the world is going to be okay.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> I hope they can get jobs and make money, because in this field you work so hard and spend so much money to get an education and then what you get afterwards doesn’t compute. You know, if you find a job, starting salaries are very low and so I think that’ll shift. I think what’s been happening through the years is that the agencies have been drying up or losing funding and really most of the therapy now is done in the private sector. I think Karen’s program is an exception of say, funded money or the public sector doing therapy, but that’s very, very rare. In our city, family services are gone. Columbia Area Mental Health is just working with severe pathology and mostly doing medication or case management. The one at Baptist (hospital), basically their staff has been reduced by half. So, there’s no Lutheran Family Service anymore. There’s really not much. So, the public agencies are not doing anything, and so the mental health system in our country has become really bifurcated, the poor have almost no resources and then the people that are working or the people that are rich can either use their insurance or pay for services. So it is really a crisis, a mental health crisis. And I always tell the students that they can probably find a niche for people who don’t have the resources to self-pay, but don’t have insurance, where they can make, you know $25 or $30 an hour for a session. I think that there’s a niche there.</p>
<p>
<bold>Karen:</bold> But I feel like that, you know sort of my sense of what can happen for the next generation is if they; yes, I agree with Russell about what’s happening to the mental health jobs and that sort of thing, but if they are truly systemic, if they are truly creative, if they have a strong work ethic, and they want to make a difference, then they will use those skills, maybe not in a psychotherapy office, in a therapy session with a family, or, you know, with a shingle hanging on the door, but I think they can go into any system, any context, any part of society whether it be gang prevention, whether it be the police force, whether it be, you know, public relations, whatever. I mean there are so many contexts that they can use those skills and that kind of way of being and that way of thinking, I think, to make a difference. And if they don’t define themselves too narrowly about <italic>what it is I’m trying to do</italic> or <italic>what it is I’m going to do</italic>, then I think there’s hope for people to take that out and find a place where they can, you know, make a difference, and be of value.</p>
<p>
<bold>Russ:</bold> That’s a good way of putting it.</p>
<p>
<bold>Debbie:</bold> I’m think we’re going to let it stop there because that’s a good way to end.</p>
