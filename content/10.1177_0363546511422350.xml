<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: There are several large series of outcomes after ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) reconstruction that have 1 or 2 javelin throwers included. To our knowledge, however, there are no reports that focus solely on the results of UCL reconstruction in this group of athletes.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis/Purpose</bold>: We hypothesize that by using modern UCL reconstruction techniques, javelin throwers can reliably expect to return to their sport. Additionally, we review the principles behind postoperative rehabilitation in these athletes, as it differs from the usual approach used with baseball players.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: This was a retrospective review of 10 javelin throwers who underwent UCL reconstruction between 2006 and 2009 using the docking technique. There were 5 college and 5 high school javelin throwers. The average age was 18.5 years (range, 18-21 years). All patients, before being indicated for ligament reconstruction, failed a course of nonoperative management that included rest, physical therapy, and a structured attempt to return to throwing. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated using the Conway Scale and the Andrews-Timmerman Score.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Patients were evaluated at a minimum 2-year follow-up. The average follow-up was 28.9 months after surgery (range, 24-45 months). On the Conway Scale, 9 of the 10 players had excellent outcomes (90%). There was one fair (10%) outcome. Average time to return to previous level of competition was 15 months. The mean Andrews-Timmerman Score was 97 (range, 85-100). Overall, 100% (10/10) of the patients were subjectively satisfied with their clinical outcome.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Similar to other overhand athletes with UCL insufficiency, javelin throwers can reliably expect to return to their previous level of play after surgical reconstruction. A thorough understanding of the unique demands placed on these athletes because of the different throwing motion is helpful when tailoring their postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Additionally, these athletes must be counseled that the postoperative course is associated with an extended period of time until return to previous level of competition when compared with baseball players.</p>

<p>The prevalence of ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries, particularly as they pertain to baseball players, has increased dramatically over the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422350">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422350">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422350">22</xref></sup> Interestingly though, the first reported diagnosis of a UCL tear was made in a javelin thrower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511422350">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies have analyzed the biomechanics of the javelin throw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511422350">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511422350">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422350">17</xref></sup> Javelin throwers maximize the distance of their throws by maintaining an extended elbow until final foot strike, which functions to lengthen the acceleration path of the javelin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422350">17</xref></sup> From final foot strike to javelin release, the elbow flexes about 40° (more in high-level athletes), which is similar to that of baseball players. In contradistinction to baseball players, however, angular velocities of the elbow in javelin throwers are highest during this flexion phase, approaching 1900 deg/s.</p>
<p>The anterior bundle of the medial UCL has been identified as the primary restraint to valgus moments of up to 290 N and angular velocity exceeding 3100 deg/s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511422350">10</xref></sup> Javelin throwing can place extreme valgus forces on the medial side of the elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511422350">11</xref></sup> These extreme forces approach the ultimate tensile strength of the ligament with each throw. Such repeated elbow stress can lead to microtrauma and ultimately failure of the UCL.</p>
<p>In the literature, there are several large series of outcomes after UCL reconstruction that have 1 or 2 javelin throwers included.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511422350">5</xref></sup> To our knowledge, however, there are no reports that focus solely on the results of UCL reconstruction in this group of athletes. In this study, we hypothesize that by using modern UCL reconstruction techniques, javelin throwers can reliably expect to return to their sport. Additionally, we review the principles behind postoperative rehabilitation in these athletes, as it differs from the usual approach used with baseball players.</p>

<title>Materials And Methods</title>
<p>This was a retrospective review of javelin throwers who underwent UCL reconstruction. The protocol was approved by the hospital institutional review board (ref#10083). Between 2006 and 2009, 10 javelin throwers underwent UCL reconstruction using the docking technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511422350">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511422350">19</xref></sup> There were 5 college and 5 high school javelin throwers. The average age was 18.5 years (range, 18-21 years). On preoperative examination, all patients had medial-sided elbow pain consistent with UCL insufficiency, which included a positive moving valgus stress test finding (n = 9), pain with valgus stress (n = 9), and laxity with valgus stress testing (n = 10).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511422350">6</xref></sup> All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing partial (n = 2) or complete tears (n = 8) of the UCL. One patient had preoperative ulnar nerve symptoms. Additionally, one patient had tenderness over the flexor-pronator mass and pain with resisted forearm pronation, which correlated with MRI findings demonstrating a partial tear of the pronator teres tendon.</p>
<p>All patients, before being indicated for ligament reconstruction, failed a course of nonoperative management that included rest, physical therapy, and a structured rehabilitation regimen focused on return to throwing. No patient received any injections (cortisone or platelet-rich plasma) before surgery.</p>
<p>Patients were treated with UCL reconstruction using the docking technique by the senior author (D.W.A.) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511422350">Figure 1</xref>). A palmaris longus tendon was used as an autograft in 9 cases, and a gracilis tendon autograft was used in the other case. There were no intraoperative complications. When originally described, the docking technique included requisite prereconstruction arthroscopy. However, we have transitioned reserving arthroscopy only for those patients with preoperative examinations or imaging studies consistent with valgus extension overload.</p>

</fig>
<p>Postoperatively, all patients were kept in a sling for the first week and then switched to a hinged-elbow brace. The focus of the first 4 weeks is to decrease postoperative swelling while increasing motion to 30° to 105° of flexion; however, lower extremity and core strengthening are also initiated. By 8 to 10 weeks, we like the athletes to have full elbow range of motion, but valgus stress should still be minimized. Upper extremity strength, flexibility, and neuromuscular function remain a focus as we work on achieving near-normal to normal function by 4 months. In baseball players, this is when we would begin an interval throwing program, but in javelin throwers, this is delayed another 3 to 4 months to allow the athlete more time to focus on lower extremity, core, and scapular stabilizer strengthening. They start a throwing program at about 8 months postoperatively and return to competition at about 14 to 16 months postoperatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511422350">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>All patients were available for follow-up. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated using the Conway Scale and the Andrews-Timmerman Score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511422350">21</xref></sup> On the Conway Scale, an excellent result is defined as a return to play at one’s previous level for at least 1 year after surgery. A good result is consistent with a return to play at a lower level for more than 12 months or the ability to throw daily. If a patient can throw regularly at a recreational level, the result is fair, and if patients are unable to return to throwing, the result is poor.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients were evaluated at a minimum 2 years postoperatively, with the average follow-up being 28.9 months after surgery (range, 24-45 months). On the Conway Scale, 9 of the 10 players had excellent outcomes (90%). There was one fair (10%) outcome. Average time to start throwing was 8 months, and average time to return to previous level of competition was 15 months. One patient did not return to competitive throwing because he graduated from high school and chose not to participate in college. Despite not wanting to continue playing in college, he was able to throw recreationally, leading to a fair outcome. There were no postoperative complications. The patient with preoperative ulnar nerve symptoms noted complete resolution postoperatively. The use of the gracilis tendon did not seem to affect outcome, as this patient had an excellent outcome. The mean Andrews-Timmerman Score was 97 (range, 85-100). Overall, 100% (10/10) of the patients were subjectively satisfied with their clinical outcome.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first report to assess outcomes of UCL reconstruction in javelin throwers. In this group of athletes, good to excellent outcomes can reasonably be expected after ligament reconstruction with the docking technique.</p>
<p>The javelin event involves throwing a spear that measures about 2.6 m and weighs at least 800 g as far as possible. The throwing motion can be broken down into 4 phases: approach run, cross steps, delivery stride, and thrust phase (time from final foot contact to javelin release).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511422350">14</xref></sup> Release speed is the critical factor with regard to the distance of the throw. Seventy percent of the release speed is developed during the last 0.1 second of the throwing motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422350">17</xref></sup> The angular velocity generated at the elbow during this thrust phase is about 1900 deg/s, which puts significant stress on the medial side of the elbow. Interestingly, this is an elbow flexion angular velocity as opposed to extension angular velocities seen in baseball players. Range of motion in top-level javelin throwers (ie, Olympic participants) is similar to that of baseball players. During the thrust phase, javelin throwers can flex through about 60° of motion (84°-140°).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511422350">17</xref></sup> Repetitive microtrauma to the elbow from these throws can result in ligament insufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511422350">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>While UCL injuries have been reported in javelin throwers, collegiate wrestlers, arm wrestlers, football players, and tennis players, the vast majority of injuries, and therefore surgeries and associated outcomes, have been reported in baseball pitchers. Most define a successful surgical outcome as the ability of the athlete to return to preinjury level of play for at least 1 full year. By this definition, most recent series, using a variety of reconstruction techniques, document high rates of return to preinjury status or even improved performance levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511422350">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511422350">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511422350">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511422350">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511422350">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511422350">22</xref></sup> Our preferred surgical technique is the docking technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511422350">19</xref></sup> In this initial series of 36 patients, 92% had excellent outcomes. Several reports by different authors have corroborated the findings of the initial series, with all achieving 89% to 92% excellent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511422350">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511422350">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511422350">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The results in this article were in line with those achieved in baseball players. Interestingly though, in contrast to many of the published reports of UCL injuries in other overhand athletes, our javelin thrower group did not have any symptomatic associated abnormality, such as posteromedial osteophytes or ulnar nerve symptoms. This may be because our sample size was small. However, it may relate to the fact that while forces across the elbow when throwing a javelin are increased, they are not as damaging as those seen with throwing a baseball. It is also possible that the lack of associated abnormality stems from the age of our patients, who were on the young side when compared with some of the studies in baseball players.</p>
<p>Successful surgical outcomes depend, in large part, on a structured, functional rehabilitation program that is designed to return athletes to their previous level of play by progressing gradually through sport-specific activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422350">18</xref></sup> After UCL reconstruction in baseball players, physicians ubiquitously prescribe the interval throwing program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511422350">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511422350">18</xref></sup> A similar program for javelin throwers does not exist in the literature, so our postoperative protocol was adjusted to compensate for the differences in the weight of a javelin and in the throwing motion compared with baseball players.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511422350">13</xref></sup> Because javelins weigh more than 1.5 lb, our recommended postoperative protocol places even more emphasis on core and lower extremity strengthening. Compared with the baseball players we treat, we wait a much longer time before starting to throw with javelin throwers. Typically, we start their interval throwing program at about 8 months after surgery as opposed to 4 months with baseball players. This is done because we believe that the increased weight of the javelin requires increased strength in the forearm and shoulders before attempting to throw so as to prevent reinjury. Additionally, the javelin throw requires more complicated synchronous movements, which necessitate increased focus on core and lower extremity movements. The delay in beginning a throwing program means that more time is required before one returns to competition. In our series, the average return to competition was 15 months, which directly corresponds with increased time to initiation of the throwing program. It should be noted that these are just guidelines. Clearly, if an athlete is strong enough and has worked on his mechanics diligently, he may be able to return to throwing in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>Similar to all articles dealing with UCL reconstruction outcomes, this article was retrospective in nature and had a relatively small number of athletes involved. Clearly, larger prospective studies would potentially allow us to draw more significant conclusions regarding outcomes, techniques, and so on; however, the nature of UCL injuries makes that very difficult.</p>
<p>In conclusion, similar to other overhand athletes with UCL insufficiency, javelin throwers can reliably expect to return to their previous level of play after surgical UCL reconstruction. A thorough understanding of the unique demands placed on these athletes because of their unique throwing motion is helpful when tailoring their postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Additionally, these athletes must understand that the time it takes to return to their previous level of competition may be longer than when the procedure is done on baseball players.</p>
