<body>
<p>Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a benign vascular tumor, locally aggressive but rare, which develops exclusively in young male patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812454394">1</xref></sup> It grows from the sphenopalatine foramen not only to the nasopharynx and nasal cavity but also to the deep spaces of the face and skull base through various anatomic foramens. Deep extensions to the skull base make surgical treatment difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812454394">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgical removal through the external approach used to be the cornerstone of management before the development of endoscopic surgery. Indeed, refinements in cameras, instrumentation, and navigation systems allowed endoscopic removal to be considered in some instances, with significant improvement in morbidity and mortality and better cosmetic and functional results. However, there are still some recent reports of major skull base approaches for these tumors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812454394">3</xref></sup> even though recent experience has revealed that extensive cases can be managed endoscopically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812454394">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an attempt to define the limits and true indications of endoscopic surgery, the aim of this study was to review recent management of JNA in our institution during the past 10 years and to analyze the shift in surgical paradigm based on the rate of the endoscopic approach and Radkowski staging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812454394">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between April 2000 and August 2010, 72 male patients were operated on in our department for a JNA. The mean age was 16.25 years (range, 9-33 years). All patients benefited from an embolization before the surgical procedure. Note that embolization was bilateral in 30.9%, while the vascular supply from the internal carotid artery was present in 45.2% and was deliberately not embolized. The embolized arteries were most frequently the internal maxillary artery, the sphenopalatine artery, the ascending pharyngeal artery, and the middle meningeal artery.</p>

</fig>
<p>Severity of disease as evaluated by tumor extension based on Radkowski staging was not different between the 2 groups, which had similar rates of stage IIIA (group 1, n = 14 or 45.1%; group 2, n = 20 or 48.8%; <italic>P</italic> = .99) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812454394"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>On the whole, 48 patients benefited from an endoscopic approach: 40 for a first surgery and 8 for a recurrence. The rate of the endoscopic procedure was higher in group 2 than in group 1 (<italic>P</italic> = .001). In group 2 (n = 41), 34 patients (82.9%) benefited from an endoscopic approach, as compared with 14 (45%) patients in group 1 (n = 31).</p>
<p>Comparing the 2 groups, the external approach was performed for lower stages in group 1 (4 patients with stage I or II; <italic>P</italic> = .03). In group 1, 17 patients (55%) were operated on by the degloving approach, with or without a pteryonal approach, including 3 patients with stage IIIA, 11 patients with stage IIIB, and 4 patients with stage I or II. In group 2, only 7 patients (18.5%) required an external approach (degloving or subfrontal) mainly due to intracranial invasion (6 patients with stage IIIB).</p>
<p>During the first period (group 1), patients eligible for an endoscopic approach had a tumor limited to the sinuses, pterygopalatine fossa, medial infratemporal fossa, or root of the pterygoids, with a limited volume. Massive and large tumors were treated through an external approach, as well as in cases of invasion of the lateral infratemporal fossa, the orbit, the cavernous sinus, or the middle fossa.</p>
<p>During the second period, however, all tumors were addressed endoscopically, except in cases of middle fossa invasion or optic nerve or internal carotid artery (ICA) encasement.</p>
<p>There were no major complications among patients treated endoscopically. The rate of complications was not different between the 2 groups. One case of unilateral blindness occurred in the aftermath of the embolization before the endoscopic procedure in group 1. One case of unilateral loss of vision occurred also in group 2 after surgery in a patient operated through a degloving approach with massive intracranial extension, a complication followed weeks after by hemiplegia related to arteritis of the ICA. One patient suffered sustained and prolonged headache. Postoperative sequelae were rare: dysesthesia of V2 in 3 patients and dental occlusion disorders in 7 patients who underwent a degloving approach.</p>
<p>Three patients required transfusion due to significant intraoperative bleeding. Average blood loss was 597 mL (range, 0-2500 mL). When supply vessels from the internal carotid system were present, mean blood loss was 723 mL. Mean blood loss increased with the stages: 112 mL for stage I, 527 mL for stage II, and 645 mL for stage III.</p>
<p>We noticed that supply vessels from the internal carotid system were present in 55.6% of cases, as shown by the residual blush at the end of the procedure.</p>
<p>After each endoscopic procedure, a computed tomography (CT) scan was systematically performed in the first 48 hours to detect any residual tumor. Six patients were detected with obvious residual tumors, which were successfully removed.</p>
<p>Duration of hospitalization was 9.74 days (range, 6-15 days) for patients who underwent an external approach and 6.76 days (range, 3-11 days) for endoscopic procedures.</p>
<sec id="section12-0194599812454394">
<title>Mean Follow-up and Recurrences</title>
<p>The mean follow-up was 20.4 months (range, 9-69 months).</p>
<p>Residual disease was evidenced on CT or MRI and reoperated immediately in 6 cases when tumors were superficial in the operative field (group 1, n = 5; group 2, n = 1). Alternatively, some cases with minimal residual disease were treated with progressive involution in 7 cases (group 1, n = 5; group 2, n = 2). On the whole, residual disease was significantly lower in group 2 (<italic>P</italic> = .015). Recurrences (ie, residual disease growing and treated by redo) were noted in 6 cases or 8.3% (group 1, n = 3; group 2, n = 3; <italic>P</italic> = .94).</p>
<p>The main locations at risk for incomplete endoscopic removal or recurrence were the sphenoid (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), the greater wing of the sphenoid (inferior orbital fissure, foramen lacerum, cavernous sinus), the root of the pterygoid (<italic>P</italic> = .0035), and the pterygopalatine fossa (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This retrospective work suggests a shift in paradigm for the surgical management of JNA: nowadays, the external approach is considered only for selected cases in this institution. Three main issues challenge the endoscopic surgeon: (1) massive extension to the middle cranial fossa, which might not be controlled endoscopically and requires a subtemporal approach; (2) ICA encasement, which in our experience cannot be totally resected because in that case the tumor proceeds through the foramen lacerum, encases the paraclival ICA, and penetrates into the cavernous sinus, where it cannot be dissected from the oculomotor nerves; and (3) encasement of the optic nerve, which places vision at risk.</p>
<p>The first report of endoscopic surgery for JNA was published in 1998.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812454394">7</xref></sup> Endoscopy was then used by different authors who combined approaches: they used scopes to control the operative cavity after surgery and to complete removal if necessary. The endoscope proved to be useful especially for deep (clivus, foramen lacerum, etc) or lateral infratemporal fossa locations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812454394">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812454394">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812454394"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812454394"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812454394"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812454394">12</xref></sup> Since then, many series have been published: most significant are those of Roger et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812454394">13</xref></sup> in 2002 (20 cases, multicenter study), Gupta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812454394">14</xref></sup> in 2008 (28 cases), Hackman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812454394">4</xref></sup> in 2009 (31 cases), and Ardehali et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812454394">15</xref></sup> in 2010 (47 cases). Based on these reports, the endoscopic approach became the preferred surgical approach in our institution.</p>
<sec id="section14-0194599812454394">
<title>Advantages of the Endoscopic Approach</title>
<p>The superiority of the endoscopic surgical approach cannot be assessed based on this single study. Indeed, the work presented herein is a retrospective study, which obviously entails several biases. Furthermore, the rate of redo surgery was not significantly different during the 2 periods of the study.</p>
<p>Subjectively, in terms of exposure, the endoscopic approach, when combining ethmoidectomy with medial maxillectomy, allows good visualization of lateral or very deep areas, such as the clivus, foramen lacerum, roots of pterygoid, or infratemporal fossa, whereas transfacial or side approaches give only a narrow exposure. Modern high-definition cameras retransmit a precise and magnified image: distinction between angiofibroma and adjacent tissues is improved, which makes dissection easier. Furthermore, avoiding external incisions, soft tissue detachment, and anterior skeletal osteotomies might contribute to a reduced blood loss during surgery.</p>
<p>In terms of outcomes, the average length of hospitalization was shorter for cases treated endoscopically (9.6 vs 6.8 days). This relatively long length of stay can be explained by 2 main reasons: patients are hospitalized 48 hours before surgery to perform embolization and are discharged only when they are able to go home because hotel-hospitals are not used in France. Mean blood loss is 600 mL for the cases treated endoscopically, whereas average blood loss for the external approach may vary from 1000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812454394">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812454394">17</xref></sup> to 2300 mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812454394">5</xref></sup> Also, no disturbance of facial growth has been noticed, especially in the vertical direction, as opposed to what has been observed in children (n = 7) who undergo a transfacial approach. Likewise, impact on mouth opening and chewing is minimal even after pterygoid dissection as opposed to external approaches.</p>

<title>Shift in Surgical Paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812454394">Figure 1</xref>)</title>
<p>When analyzing the rate of the endoscopic approach with time, we noted that it has been increasingly used, from 45% to 83% of patients. Despite the greater availability of CT scans, patients are still mostly classified as stage IIIA (45% in group 1 and 49% in group 2). Whatever the period considered, external approaches have been used for more advanced stages: stage IIIB represents 71% of patients operated on externally. The main change in indications concerns lateral extensions, in front of or behind the pterygoids. As opposed to group 1, all patients in group 2 with infratemporal fossa, inferior orbital fissure, or even orbital apex and anterior cavernous sinus extensions were operated on endoscopically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812454394"><bold>Figures 2</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812454394"><bold>3</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Reasons for This Significant Development</title>
<p>Three factors indicate why an endoscopic exclusive approach should be used in advanced stages. First, control of bleeding is essential. It is favored by preoperative embolization and obtained by step-by-step coagulation carried out with mono- or bipolar coagulation and a diode laser.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812454394">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812454394">19</xref></sup> Second, technological advances such as navigation, drilling engine development, and dedicated high-definition cameras allow for optimizing exposure. Finally, new procedures such as medial maxillectomy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812454394">20</xref></sup> or the transpterygoid approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812454394">21</xref></sup> allow for exposing far lateral lesions, whereas the 4-hands technique allows for dissection of tumor from soft tissues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0194599812454394">
<title>Limits</title>
<p>The actual limit is the basicranial posterior extension, not so much the inferior orbital fissure or orbital apex but the intracranial or pericarotid extensions. Preoperative assessment should aim to differentiate the different types of cavernous invasion: the anterior and the inferior invasion. When JNA spreads through the orbital apex to the cavernous sinus, so that removal is obtained by gentle dissection and traction, the removal results in a brief but abundant bleeding, as if removing a bathtub drain (case from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812454394"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). This can be controlled endoscopically in experienced hands. In the case of inferior invasion through the foramen lacerum, JNA surrounds the ICA, which drives it inside the cavernous sinus, from where it can hardly be dissected and with the risk of major bleeding and neurological complications. In the latter situation, the external approach is still preferred, knowing that total excision of these lesions may be associated with significant morbidity. In these cases, combined radiotherapy can be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812454394">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812454394">22</xref></sup> To illustrate this, we report the case of an 11-year-old patient with left eye blindness caused by direct compression of the optic nerve by JNA, which threatened the contralateral optic nerve. A combined approach (endoscopic and subfrontal) was performed to obtain complete and safe resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599812454394"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-0194599812454394">
<title>Recurrences</title>
<p>A special feature of JNA is their high propensity for recurrence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812454394">23</xref></sup> reaching 32% according to the literature on average and up to 40% or 50% in the case of invasion of the infratemporal fossa, sphenoid sinus, root of pterygoid, clivus, and cavernous sinus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812454394">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812454394">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812454394">6</xref></sup> In our series, a very low rate of recurrence (8.3%) underlines the benefit of an early postoperative CT scan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812454394">24</xref></sup> and validates the surgical strategy: to minimize the risk of recurrence, fine mapping of the tumor helps the surgeon to foresee surgical tactics. Dissection should be carried out following the numerous digitations and, if allowed by the tumor volume, performing resection in one piece, although there are some reports of a successful division of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812454394">25</xref></sup> This could be optimized by real-time imaging, but this imaging technique is not available in our department.</p>
<p>Some remnants might be undetected at the first postoperative CT scan or MRI but could grow secondarily. Indeed, we observed in a number of cases (7 cases) an image suggestive of residual disease. However, we also observed that they remained asymptomatic when not exposed in the nasal fossa, which did not warrant a complementary endoscopic excision, and also that they involute in this specific population, which comprised mainly boys older than 16 years. If a residual tumor is suspected on delayed imaging, it should be repeated every 3 months to ascertain whether it can be treated, waiting for the final involution, or if it warrants further surgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Progress in skull base anatomy, instrumentation, cameras, and surgical strategy allows for expanding the indications for endoscopic removal of JNA. This approach may have a better outcome in terms of blood loss, hospital stay, and local sequelae, although no gain could be evidenced in terms of efficacy. Still, an external approach should be considered only for selected cases due to massive intracranial extension or optic nerve or ICA entrapment by the tumor.</p>
