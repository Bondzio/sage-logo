<p>First- and second-wave feminism has always had an engagement with dominant religions as well as creating various forms of feminist spirituality (for example, Mary Astell, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Elizabeth Cady-Stanton, Mary Daly, Starhawk). Recently, feminism has become less engaged with religion and spirituality, particularly the latter. Feminism, it seems, has become much more secular.</p>
<p>Situated within the third wave of feminism, Chris Klassen’s edited collection <italic>Feminist Spirituality: The Next Generation</italic> is an attempt to bring feminist spirituality into third-wave feminist accounts. It does this by exploring “… what does feminist spirituality look like in the twenty-first century? How have young women taken the work of their mothers, aunts, grandmothers and other forerunners and shaped it into something they could own for themselves? How have some second-wave feminists morphed into third-wavers?” (7). The book aims to fill two perceived gaps: the absence of spiritual discourse within third-wave feminism as well as the absence of third-wave feminist spirituality in the discipline of religious studies, which she argues is neglecting the contributions of young feminists (2).</p>
<p>The framework of the book, couched within the discourse of third-wave feminism, is not uncontentious in itself, as Klassen readily admits. She acknowledges that the line between the second and third waves is not as distinct as between the first and second, and she admits that “some third-wave feminists have been involved in … second-wave work … [challenging] the notion that the ‘next generation’ of feminism is solely the purview of ‘young’ feminists” (1). Nevertheless, she retains the idea that what distinguishes the waves is primarily youth and a “different social and political era.” This generational thinking, however, tends to set up false dichotomies between the second and third waves throughout the book, at times obfuscating the main theme, feminist spirituality.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, Sarah Marie Gallant outlines the Goddess projects of second-wave feminists Carol P. Christ and Starhawk, along with their critics, and argues that if Christ’s imaginary Goddess does not reflect the spiritual needs of the next generation, then “the re-imagination process must be taken up again and a new figure, goddess or saint or something else entirely must be imagined” (27). Gallant concludes by pointing out that the next generation should be cautious, trying to avoid “utopian fantasy” by ensuring the newly imagined does not clash too much with historical and archaeological data (28). While scholars must provide constructive criticism as well as new ways forward, thinking in terms of feminist generations poses some significant problems here. Despite Carol Christ’s continued activity and engagement as a writer on feminist spirituality, her ideas are treated as though they are pieces of archaeological history themselves. Indeed, it is unclear why, were Gallant’s advice useful, new ways of imagining would be restricted to the young, and not to Christ herself.</p>
<p>In “Bound in the Spiral Dance: Spirituality and Technology in the Third Wave,” Anna Mercedes and Jennifer Thweatt-Bates provide one of the strongest contributions to this collection. A beautifully written and engaging essay, it skillfully incorporates Donna Harroway’s Cyborg theory into their own experiences with technology and child-bearing. Unfortunately they too fall prey to the dichotomous rendering of the second and third waves, at points oversimplifying second-wave feminism, which, perhaps unintentionally, depicts their own third-wave feminism as more progressive and superior. For instance, they question second-wave feminism’s supposed orthodoxy when it comes to advocating natural birth, reducing the latter to one side of an issue. The important work of second-wave feminists who argued in favor of the use of technology in reproduction, such as prominent feminist Shulamith Firestone, is effectively silenced.</p>
<p>To the editor’s credit, the last essay in the book thoroughly “entreat[s] against the unreflexive adoption of generational meanings of the wave metaphor” (192). Among the strongest essays in the collection, “Across Generations” by Dawn Llewellyn argues that age-based categorizations of feminisms foster misunderstandings and divisions, obfuscating the issues and viewpoints that overlap between the waves and generations. She writes: “[t]he artificial age-based parameters of the wave narrow feminist history too readily, and stimulate a view of feminism’s progression that can overlook generational crossings between and through different cohorts of women, or fail to notice where feminist currents coalesce, and second and third wave feminisms dialogue” (192).</p>
<p>The weakest chapter, “Fandemonium and Spirituality by Gena Meldazy,” argues that fandemonium is “beyond … the cult of celebrity” and ought to be considered a “unique brand of spirituality” that is “non-religious” (86–87). Linking fandemonium to non-religious spirituality is not difficult when the working definition of spirituality has little or no substance. She uses the example of anarchism as having a faith “in the freedom to choose …” and argues that the definition of spirituality is constantly changing “with the social demands of the context in which it is used …” (88). With this definition in mind, it is unclear what we could plausibly consider non-spiritual, and why it is important to link fandemonium to spirituality at all.</p>
<p>Many chapters in this collection are worthwhile reading for those interested in feminist spirituality. The talk of generations, however, detracts from what ought to be the book’s main focus: feminist spirituality substantively defined. Contributions would have been stronger by being more open and fair to the diversity of the second wave, as well as dialoguing with “older” feminists who continue to write and have insights on this issue today. To avoid the false dichotomy between the waves, the book might have been more usefully framed as “Feminist Spiritualities Today,” or “Contemporary Feminist Spiritualities.”</p>
