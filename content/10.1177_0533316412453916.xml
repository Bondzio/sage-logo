<p>Students in group analytic psychotherapy training are invited to submit an unpublished original paper integrating theoretical material with clinical issues. The paper should include consideration of the unconscious, transference and countertransference. Authors need to pay attention to issues of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Papers may have been submitted to the students’ institution during the course of training, but must not have been published elsewhere, or be under consideration for publication.</p>
<p>A panel of international senior group analysts will judge the papers. The reading panel includes: Professor Elizabeth Rohr from Germany, Jane Campbell from the UK, Ivan Urlich from Split, Miriam Berger from Israel and Goran Ahlin from Sweden.</p>
<p>Manuscripts should be a maximum of 5,000 words. They should be typed, double-spaced and on one side of paper. References should be in the order of the author date, title, place and publication together with details of volume and pages or city: publisher.</p>
<p>The name of the student should not appear on the manuscript but should appear on a separate page with address, telephone number, email, institute of training and the title of the paper. Manuscripts will not be returned and those over length cannot be considered.</p>
