<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Anatomic reconstruction of the coracoclavicular ligaments for the treatment of acromioclavicular joint separations provides superior biomechanical stability compared with other procedures. Clavicular and coracoidal footprints of the conoid ligament (CL) and the trapezoid ligament (TL) are well described. So far, little is known about their kinematics and the changes of the coracoclavicular distance during shoulder abduction.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis:</bold> The coracoclavicular distance along the coracoclavicular ligaments changes significantly with shoulder abduction and weightbearing.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design:</bold> Descriptive laboratory study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> With use of an open magnetic resonance imaging scanner, the shoulders of 13 healthy volunteers were examined in supine and sitting positions. Three-dimensional magnetic resonance images of the shoulders were obtained in 30° increments of abduction (0°-120°). A manual segmentation of the scapula, the clavicle, and the coracoclavicular ligaments was performed. The insertion points of the coracoclavicular ligaments were identified, and automated measures along the ligamentous course were carried out.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> During transfer from the lying to sitting position, the coracoclavicular distance showed significant lengthening of 3 mm along the center of the CL, which significantly increased another 3 mm during shoulder abduction to a total lengthening of 6 mm. In the supine position, the coracoclavicular distance along the TL did not elongate significantly. In the sitting position, the distance along the medial portion of the TL shortened significantly, whereas the distance along the center portion did not elongate significantly during shoulder abduction.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The distances between the coracoclavicular insertion points depend on both patient and shoulder positioning. To prevent overconstraining of the graft, the CL should be fixated during 90° to 120° of shoulder abduction in a sitting position. Isometric reconstruction of the TL can be achieved if precise fixation of the graft at the centers of the conoidal and clavicular footprints is performed.</p>

<body>
<p>Acromioclavicular (AC) joint separations account for approximately 10% of all injuries of the shoulder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511423015">19</xref></sup> These injuries predominantly occur in young active adults who engage in a high level of sport-related activity. Thus, the anatomy, the stability, and the physiological kinematics of the AC joint need to be restored at their best to obtain a high functional outcome level. Recent experimental studies suggest that anatomic reconstruction techniques of the coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments provide superior primary stability compared with extra-anatomic procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511423015">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423015">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511423015">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite very promising in vitro results, clinical studies revealed less favorable radiological outcome. Persistent horizontal instability and undercorrection and overcorrection of the clavicle of up to 20% to 50% have been reported after anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments for treatment of both acute and chronic AC joint reconstructions in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423015">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423015">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423015">33</xref></sup> Moreover, there have been reports in some cases of clavicle and coracoid fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511423015">34</xref></sup> or implant failure after anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments using flip-button devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423015">29</xref></sup> This is despite the fact that the coracoidal and clavicular insertion points and the ligamental lengths are well described in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423015">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423015">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423015">35</xref></sup> However, these measurements were performed either on human cadaveric specimens or on isolated clavicles and scapulae. Thus, there exists little knowledge about the coracoclavicular distance and its changes during shoulder motion in vivo.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the CC distance along the course of the conoid and the trapezoid ligaments at rest and during different positions of shoulder abduction in vivo. Comparative measurements in supine and sitting positions enabled determination of the influence of the arm’s weight.</p>

<title>Volunteers and Image Acquisition</title>
<p>The present study included 13 volunteers (6 men and 7 women). The age of the volunteers was 25 ± 2 years with a mean height of 173 ± 10 cm. There was no history of musculoskeletal disorders in any of these volunteers. In particular, no shoulder impairment and no relevant trauma to the examined shoulder had occurred in any of them before the examination. The local ethics committee approved the present study, and all volunteers gave informed written consent to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511423015">
<title>Experimental Setup/Kinematic Analysis</title>
<p>A 0.25-T open-bore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner with a rotatable bed (G-Scan, Esaote, Genova, Italy) was used for image acquisition. To evaluate the kinematics of the CC distance during abduction of the shoulder, 10 data sets were acquired in every volunteer: 5 in the supine position at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of shoulder abduction and the same degrees of shoulder abduction in the sitting position (0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120°). In the supine position, the arm was embedded in manufactured preshaped cushions, while in the sitting position, the volunteer’s hand was fixed in a custom-made cast glove hanging from the top of the rotatable patient table<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423015">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511423015">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>During image acquisition in the supine position, the arm’s weight was excluded, and in the sitting position, the arm’s weight was included into the kinematics of the CC distance. A 3-dimensional gradient-echo sequence was chosen for image acquisition to enable complex postprocessing of the images. Repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) were 28 milliseconds and 14 milliseconds, respectively, voxel size was 0.95 × 0.95 × 2.14 mm<sup>3</sup>, and the flip angle was 50°. Image acquisition time was 6 minutes and 18 seconds per data set. The image slices were oriented perpendicular to the coracoid process and parallel to the lateral clavicle.</p>

<sec id="section4-0363546511423015">
<title>Postprocessing and Distance Measurements</title>
<p>The scapula and the clavicle were manually segmented for each volunteer and each shoulder abduction angle using the freely available MITK software (Version 1.1, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">B</xref>). The shoulder in 60° of abduction in the lying position was chosen as a reference. For that sequence, 3-dimensional visualizations of the segmentations were fused with the anatomic MRI data using the freely available ParaView Software (Kitware, New York, New York) in a way that intersections of arbitrary oblique planes of the anatomic volume with the segmentations could be displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546511423015">D</xref>). In those views, data points were identified marking the lateral and medial borders as well as the center of each ligament footprint at the clavicle and the coracoid process. The center of the ligament was identified as the intersection of 2 lines connecting the medial with the lateral and the anterior with the posterior borders of each footprint. Thus, 12 points (3 points for each footprint of the conoid and the trapezoid ligaments on the clavicle and the coracoid process) were obtained for the reference shoulder abduction for each volunteer.</p>

</fig>
<p>The spatial transformations of the scapula and the clavicle at different arm abductions with respect to the reference abduction were obtained by rigid registration. With use of the open-source FSL software (University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom), transformation matrices were obtained that can map points in the coordinate frame of the reference abduction to the clavicle or the scapula at another arbitrary abduction. These matrices were used to map the manually marked points in the ligament insertion regions of the reference abduction to the insertion regions for all other abductions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546511423015">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, the Euclidian distances between the points in the 2 insertion regions of each ligament were computed for each position of shoulder abduction to estimate the ligament length variations. Additionally, the distance from the lateral border of the clavicle to the central, lateral, and medial sectors of the insertions of both CC ligaments was determined. Two orthopaedic surgeons performed a blinded evaluation of the points marking the center, medial, and lateral borders of the CC ligament footprint at the coracoid process and the clavicle in the first 6 volunteers. They were offered several other points and agreed in 88% with the points used for measurements to be correct. Mean distance of the other 12% toward the points used for measurements was 2 ± 2 mm. They recognized 94% of the automatically propagated points to be exactly the same as the ones on the reference site.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). For each increment of shoulder abduction in lying and sitting positions, a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc test (Bonferroni test) were carried out to compare the percentage changes of the conoid and trapezoid ligament length among the different degrees of shoulder abduction. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 for Mac (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

Moreover, persistent horizontal instability or secondary loss of reduction has been reported in up to 30% to 40% of cases after anatomic CC ligament reconstruction using arthroscopic or open procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511423015">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423015">33</xref></sup> We believe that one possible explanation for the latter high rates of unsatisfactory results is that little attention has so far been paid to the restoration of the genuine length and the physiological kinematics of the CC ligaments during replacement or reconstruction. In the knee, understanding of the in vivo kinematics of the knee joint has added crucial information to operative procedures during reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511423015">15</xref></sup> These findings increased primary stability due to preconditioning of the transplant and moreover decreased secondary loss of stability resulting from overstraining of the transplant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423015">13</xref></sup> Therefore, we investigated the kinematics of the CC ligaments during shoulder abduction in vivo.</p>
<p>Since the middle of the past century, extensive research of shoulder motion, especially with respect to the humerus and the scapula, has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511423015">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511423015">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511423015">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423015">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511423015">23</xref></sup> Only very few studies have focused on the AC joint and the clavicular motion so far. Cadaveric studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423015">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511423015">21</xref></sup> roentgenography,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423015">11</xref></sup> or the insertion of pins into the corresponding bones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423015">11</xref></sup> have been used as investigative methods during the 1990s. More recent studies used electromagnetic surface sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511423015">18</xref></sup> for investigative kinematic studies. Using this technique, a successful determination of the 3-dimensional clavicle motion can be performed; however, artifacts due to skin motion will develop in high abduction angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423015">26</xref></sup> Graichen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423015">7</xref></sup> successfully used an open 0.2-T MRI scanner to determine the changes of the glenoclavicular angle during arm abduction. Additionally, Sahara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423015">26</xref></sup> investigated the clavicular and scapular motion of 14 healthy volunteers during arm abduction using an open MRI scanner. The presented data were acquired using an open MRI scanner with a rotatable patient table. The latter enabled investigation of the influence of the arm’s weight on the CC distance. The advantage of the method used for distance measurements in the present study is that very precise determinations of lengths and the kinematic changes of distances can be performed. This is because of the automated propagation of the identified points of interest from one shoulder position to all other shoulder or volunteer positions. This ensures that measures from the same region are obtained at all degrees of shoulder abduction. However, the accuracy of the presented method is dependent on (1) the quality of the acquired images, as the coracoclavicular footprints are identified within these sequences; (2) the quality of the segmentation of the clavicle and the scapula; and (3) the quality of the registration performed. For evaluation of the image quality, the expansion of the conoidal and trapezoidal footprints (medial to lateral) as well as their distances to the lateral border of the clavicle were determined. Our measurements were comparable with the data published in recent anatomic articles that were manually determined on cadaveric specimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423015">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423015">28</xref></sup> Therefore, quality of the images has to be considered as sufficient for identification of the CC footprints to their full extent. For postprocessing of the images, we performed manual segmentation of the clavicle and the scapula and rigid registration of these segments. Graichen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423015">7</xref></sup> used a semiautomated region growing segmentation technique that was finalized manually, comparable with our method for segmentation of the scapula and the clavicle. They successfully performed accurate measurements of small changes down to 0.1° of the glenoclavicular angle.

They also reached high accuracy using these techniques for determination of the scapuloclavicular kinematics during shoulder abduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511423015">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423015">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423015">27</xref></sup> Therefore, the methods we used have to be considered as feasible to perform the distance measurements of the present study. Sahara et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511423015">26</xref></sup> presumed that during arm abduction, the scapula rotates along a screw axis, which passes through the footprints of the CC ligaments at the clavicle and the coracoid process. They hypothesized only minor changes of the CC distance along the course of the conoid or the trapezoid ligament. However, neither the kinematics of the CC ligaments nor the coracoclavicular space was investigated in detail. Moreover, these findings are in contrast with those of Kapandji et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511423015">14</xref></sup> who expected the AC joint to be the rotational axis of the scapula during shoulder abduction. The anatomy of the clavicular and the coracoidal footprints of the conoid ligament and trapezoid ligament have already been investigated in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423015">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423015">28</xref></sup> The distance from the lateral border of the clavicle toward the center of the trapezoid ligament is 25.3 ± 4.9 mm and toward the conoid ligament is 35.0 ± 5.9 mm. In the mediolateral dimension, the trapezoidal footprint measures 11.8 ± 1.0 mm, and the conoidal footprint measures 25.3 ± 4.9 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423015">24</xref></sup> At the coracoid process, the width of the trapezoid ligament is 12.1 ± 3.3 mm, and the conoid ligament width is 13.2 ± 2.7 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511423015">28</xref></sup> Ockert et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511423015">22</xref></sup> performed histological investigations of the CC footprints and identified fibrocartilage. This indicates that changes of the biomechanical load occur during shoulder movement as well as variations of the ligamentous insertion angle. Therefore, relevant changes of CC lengths have to be suspected. Thus, we wanted to investigate the kinematics of the CC ligaments in vivo during abduction of the arm.</p>
<p>To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that examines the changes of the distance along the CC ligaments during shoulder motion. An increase of the distance by 29% (11.2 to 14.4 mm) along the course of the conoid ligament (DcCL) from the lying to the sitting position appeared (<italic>P</italic> = .01). These findings may be explained by the fact that the CC ligaments are expected to be the primary suspension system of the upper limb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511423015">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511423015">25</xref></sup> and the conoid ligament is thought to be the major restraint against superior dislocation of the clavicle and inferior dislocation of the scapula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423015">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511423015">10</xref></sup> As early as 1986, Fukuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423015">6</xref></sup> hypothesized a tensioning of the conoid ligament during day-to-day activities. The further increase during shoulder abduction in the sitting position of the DcCL may be explained in a 2-fold way: First, the glenoclavicular angle increases during arm abduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511423015">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511423015">11</xref></sup> Second, during abduction of the arm, the resulting lever increases the effective arm weight by up to 3 times compared with the state with 0° of abduction.</p>
<p>The coracoclavicular distance along the course of the central trapezoid ligament (DcTL) was not significantly changed during the transfer of the volunteers from the lying to the sitting position. These findings agree with those of Fukuda et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511423015">6</xref></sup> describing the trapezoid ligament only as a secondary restraint to vertical loading after the conoid ligament has failed. However, Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511423015">16</xref></sup> described the trapezoid ligament as a primary restraint to posterior dislocation of the clavicle. In the present study, the DmTL significantly decreased during shoulder abduction. The DlTL showed a trend toward elongation during shoulder abduction, without gaining statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = .06). As the trapezoid footprint is located more lateral on the clavicle than the conoid footprint, it could be a secondary constraint during an increase of the glenoclavicular angle. In addition, the lateral portion of the trapezoid ligament might act as a restraint of clavicular rotation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423015">27</xref></sup> The central portion of the trapezoid ligament was not significantly changed, and the medial portion decreased during abduction of the arm significantly.</p>
<p>The minor changes of the center course of the trapezoid ligament might find an explanation in the study of Sahara et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511423015">27</xref></sup> They reported that the screw axis of the AC joint runs from the upper surface of the coracoid process to the lateral clavicle. Unfortunately, they did not provide distances from the lateral border of the clavicle or from the tip of the coracoid process toward this axis. However, macroscopically, they go well along with the center of the trapezoid ligament footprints at the clavicle and the coracoid process. The screw axis of a joint has only very minor length changes.</p>
<p>So far, different graft materials have been used for anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments, such as the gracilis tendon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423015">31</xref></sup> the semitendinosus tendon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546511423015">33</xref></sup> the toe extensor tendon, or suture-button devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511423015">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511423015">31</xref></sup> Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511423015">17</xref></sup> compared the biomechanical properties such as stiffness, load to failure, and elongation to failure of the above-mentioned tendon grafts. During their investigations, failure strengths were as strong as those of the native CC ligaments. The gracilis tendon and the toe extensor tendon had a similar elongation to failure as the native CC ligaments (approximately 12 mm). The semitendinosus tendon had a significant higher elongation to failure (approximately 25 mm). The native CC ligaments (110 N/mm) were significantly stiffer than the tendon grafts (40 N/mm). Walz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511423015">35</xref></sup> demonstrated that a double-bundle TightRope reconstruction (Arthrex, Naples, Florida) of the CC ligaments has a mean maximum static load to failure in the vertical direction of 982 N compared with 598 N of the genuine CC ligaments. The stiffness of the TightRope devices (Arthrex) was 80 N/mm compared with 140 N/mm for the CC ligaments. The elongation until failure was only 4 mm for the TightRope (Arthrex) compared with 10 mm for the CC ligaments. In summary, tendon grafts as well as the flip-button device TightRope (Arthrex) have biomechanical properties that allow their use for reconstruction of the CC ligaments. However, so far, little attention has been drawn to the preconditioning of the grafts, restoration of the genuine CC distance, and patient or shoulder positioning during CC ligament reconstruction. From the presented data, one cannot conclude a tension curve of the conoid or trapezoid ligament, and therefore, further investigations are needed to investigate the tension of the CC ligaments during shoulder movement in vivo. However, the elongation curve of the conoid ligament clearly demonstrates the dependence of the CC distance on arm weight and shoulder position. The in vivo kinematics of the CC distance should be considered during anatomic reconstruction of the CC ligaments to restore physiological joint kinematics, to reproduce normal anatomy, and to ensure long-term AC joint health. As the grafts should be fixated with pretension, we recommend reconstruction of the conoid ligament at 90° to 120° of shoulder abduction in a beach-chair position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511423015">13</xref></sup> In this way, the graft can be fixed at the largest CC distance, and postoperative overconstraining might be prevented. Plastic deformation of the hamstring tendons is a well-known issue and might lead to secondary insufficiency. Reconstruction of the conoid ligament in the lying position or in the beach-chair position with the arm fixed in an arm holder might lead to narrowing of the CC distance with overreduction of the clavicle and high tensile strain during shoulder movement.</p>
<p>The distance along the centers of the coracoidal and clavicular footprints of the trapezoid ligament was isometric. Therefore, careful identification of these footprints during ligament reconstruction and graft fixation at the centers is recommended, possibly increasing stability of repairs of AC joint injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546511423015">32</xref></sup> Rios et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511423015">24</xref></sup> have investigated the anatomy of the lateral clavicle and clavicular footprints of the CC ligaments. They reported that the center of the trapezoid ligament lies approximately 2.5 cm medial to the lateral border of the clavicle, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.1 to 4.9 cm. Therefore, meticulous identification of the clavicular footprint should be performed during surgery or preoperatively in each individual. Preoperative planning might be performed evaluating MRI. In contrast to the DcCL, the DcTL did not depend on the volunteer’s shoulder positioning.</p>
<p>In the present study, we demonstrated that there are significant dynamic changes of the distance along the conoid and the trapezoid ligament length in vivo, depending on both the individual and the arm position. The particular clinical relevance of this study is that it clearly indicates that the conoid ligament should be fixated at 90° to 120° of shoulder abduction with the arm in a weightbearing condition. The isometric trapezoid ligament can be fixated at any increment of shoulder abduction between 0° and 120°.</p>
