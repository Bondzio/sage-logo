<p><italic>Aftermath</italic> is the story of America’s latest imperial wars, told through the voices of those who have been victimised, dispossessed, displaced, wounded and embittered. It puts faces and voices to human beings whom America has reduced to numbers in the identity-based politicisation of the Middle East region. Rosen has deliberately eschewed the familiar tropes of ‘embedded’ journalists parroting the official line about the ‘US democracy project’ in Iraq and Afghanistan, or al-Qaida terrorism in the region, or ‘age-old Sunni-Shi’ite conflict’ in Iraq and Lebanon. Rosen embedded himself not in the US or other military, but in the homes, streets, mosques, churches and community centres of ordinary Iraqis, Lebanese, Palestinians, Syrians and Jordanians. The entire book is based on first-hand interviews; there is not a single published source cited. This, more than any other aspect, is the value of Rosen’s work: he makes the everyday horrors of the US’s Middle East conflicts real through the voices of the people living there. From local politicians to <italic>salafi</italic> jihadists, to refugees, to slum dwellers, to Mahdi Army militiamen, to religious leaders, Rosen gives them reasons and histories that make their actions understandable, if not justifiable. This is not a book for the faint of heart or for novices on the history and politics of the Middle East. Without some understanding of the historical, cultural, religious and political underpinnings of the countries of the region, much of the book will be difficult to follow. Dense, detailed, meandering at times, following the tales of hundreds of people, it is sometimes even difficult for the Middle East specialist to keep track of who is saying what and why.</p>
<p>Rosen begins his seven-year journey in Iraq in April 2003, a month after the US invasion. He relates the clash between the Iraqi people’s hopes for real liberation and the reality of the US’s ‘liberation’ project in Iraq. Despite the destruction of the initial invasion, there was widespread hope and even genuine goodwill on the part of many Iraqis towards the American invaders. The various Bush doctrines and the various US generals designated to carry them out are exposed as supremely ignorant, destructive, corrupt, greedy, bungling or downright stupid. They might be laughable if the consequences were not so deadly. In one example, Rosen describes how the Baathist Army had put up little resistance to the invasion, anticipating that it would be part of the new country, integrated into the new Iraqi army. But one of the first actions of the Bush administration was to dismantle the army and, in a single stroke, create a cadre of 300,000 unemployed men – angry, armed and militant. Potential allies became enemies of the US and the new Iraqi regime overnight.</p>
<p>The US occupation forces justified firing the Iraqi army on the grounds that they were supposedly part of the hated Saddam regime, with Bremer writing that the army, like Iraq, was divided on sectarian grounds. From his in-depth interviews, Rosen concludes that was completely false and that the army was ‘the most nationalistic institution in the country and one that predated the Baath Party’ (p. 19). Religious and sectarian differences did not play much of a role in Saddam’s Iraq, and there was virtually no Sunni-Shi’ite conflict in the country until the Bush administration made it a key factor in its Iraqi policy. Much like Tito’s Yugoslavia, Saddam’s Iraq had elevated nationalism and Iraqi identity beyond religious difference. Most of the country’s institutions were non-sectarian, every town and city was composed of a Sunni-Shi’ite mix, as well as Christian, and Iraqis intermarried to a very great extent. Once the Americans arrived, so did sectarianism:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The Americans viewed Sunnis as the bad guys and Shiites as the victims, and the US media followed suit. The Iraqi Governing Council, a symbolic body created in July 2003 as a concession to Iraqi demands for representation, was established on purely sectarian grounds, as Iraqis were quick to note. Members were chosen for being Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, or Turkmen, rather than for representing Iraqis. Even the Communist Party member was chosen for being a Shiite rather than for being secular or leftist. (p. 18)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The US occupation, both then and now, has relied on promoting its mythology about the reasons for the violence, the deep divisions in the country and other factors of the war in Iraq on a posse of know-nothings, whom Rosen exposes as having the most superficial knowledge of, and experience in, the Middle East. He points out that most could not speak Arabic, had never been to Iraq and, when they did tour the country, did so ‘with the military as their baby-sitter and escort’ (p. 17). They invented the terms that became household words: ‘Sunni Arab’, the ‘Kurdish north’, ‘Sunni Triangle’ and ‘Shi’ite south’.</p>
<p>What the Americans willed eventually transpired; Iraqis became ‘Sunni’ in the south or ‘Shi’ite’ in the centre, while Iraq erupted in intercommunal violence, which precipitated the ethnic cleansing that proved the stereotypes. Yet the reasons for the civil war were not ‘age-old sectarian rivalries’, but very deliberate divide-and-rule policies that the American occupiers put in place. Many Iraqis heroically resisted sectarian identification, and many intermarried families stood up to the ethnic cleansing, while millions fled the descent into chaos.</p>
<p>Alongside deliberate American policies that led to conflict along religious and sectarian lines were systematic policies to completely dismantle the state, remove public benefits and privatise services. One of the stated goals was to ‘transform Iraq into a free-market economy’. The American occupation almost immediately ‘liberalized capital accounts, currency trading, and investment regulations, and lifted price regulations and most state subsidies’. The Americans determined that there would be no investment in any state institution that could be privatised ‘in anticipation of the liquidation of state assets’ (p. 21). US-designed economic policies dismantled public services and replaced them with private interests – contracts that would be channelled to US corporations. This was another devastating decision for the Iraqi people. They had to cope with high inflation while state subsidies disappeared and cheap imported goods replaced Iraqi and locally made products. As state institutions crumbled, new private institutions took their place. US economic policies, such as those that Naomi Klein has described in <italic>The Shock Doctrine</italic> in the Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, post-Katrina New Orleans and other crises, were put in place by the Bush administration in Iraq.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306396811425990">1</xref></sup> These experiments were devastating to the people and the economies involved, yet ‘these same techniques were imposed on Iraq in extreme form. The measures taken in Iraq were neither democratic nor successful, but their ramifications will be felt for years’ (p. 21, note 1).</p>
<p>As the Iraqis fought the Americans, then each other, then al-Qaida militants, for whom US forces in the country were a magnet for recruitment, the country descended into the ‘dark ages’. A fully functioning, relatively wealthy state with highly developed educational, medical and social services and housing system disappeared, to be replaced by a desperate Third World country. Normalcy became a thing of the past; Iraqis faced water, food, electricity, medicine and other shortages that reduced their lives to a struggle for survival.</p>
<p>And then there was the imposition of a terror regime by the Coalition forces and the Iraqi provisional government. Thousands of Iraqis were imprisoned without charge or trial, disappeared into the maze of both known and secret prisons in the country, interrogated, brutally tortured and killed. Abu Ghraib, notorious only because American torture and brutality there was exposed to the world, was one of dozens of prisons and detention centres in which Iraqis were held for years, many without charge or trial, many killed or dead through brutality or neglect. Rosen talks about the 24,000 Iraqis in American prisons he was able to document during the peak of the surge, at least 900 of whom were juveniles. US prison programmes often seemed scripted from the Theatre of the Absurd: ‘[S]ome were forced to go through a brainwashing program called the “House of Wisdom,” in which American officers arrogantly arranged for prisoners to be lectured about Islam – as if a poor understanding of Islam, not the occupation itself, was the cause of the violence’ (p. 284).</p>
<p>Two aspects of the Iraqi conflict have, and will have, enormous consequences for the region. The first is the massive exodus of Iraqis into neighbouring states. Although the flight out of Iraq by millions of Iraqis had an immediate effect on Jordan and Syria, because of the sheer numbers and the length of the conflict, the refugee problem spread to Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen, Libya and beyond. Refugee experts claim the crisis is the largest in the region since the Palestinian exodus of 1948, with outflows of up to 50,000 people per month at the height of the conflict. At the same time, the US was very slow to act, unwilling to take responsibility for the consequences of the war it had started. Refugees remained packed for years into the Syrian and Jordanian camps of Al-Tanf and Al-Hod, while international and domestic efforts focused too slowly on getting them out of the camps and into the cities, where they could more easily obtain services or return to some kind of normal life. At the same time, moving refugees into cities required recognising that return may not be on the horizon. In addition, the host states are struggling to cope with this massive new influx of refugees, when they have borne the largest refugee population in the world for over sixty years. Syria’s extraordinary treatment of Palestinian refugees has extended to the Iraqis, but local hospitality has worn thin, as refugees drive up housing and food costs, social services and other benefits are sparse, and unemployment is high.</p>
<p>The second major aspect is the seismic shift in the power politics of the entire region. Like most US policies here, the consequences were directly the opposite of US goals. From supporting its allies in Jordan and the Gulf to weakening Iran and its political allies, the US’s grand design has backfired. The Jordanians and Saudis had an interest in supporting Sunni violence in Iraq, while Iran supported the Shi’ites. With the US-supported Shi’ite resurgence in Iraq, Iran and her alliances were strengthened – exactly the opposite of US policy goals in the region for decades.</p>
<p>Rosen traces intricate connections throughout the region: between the Jordanian and Lebanese governments and militant groups; between US support for the Jordanian and Lebanese regimes and the spread of the Iraqi conflict; between the rise of <italic>takfiris</italic> and al-Qaida in Jordan to those in Lebanon. We are introduced to the <italic>Jihadis</italic> in Jordan, some of whom were recruited in Jordan to fight in Iraq, others who came through and returned to Jordan on Iraqi fighting missions. Rosen investigates the champions of the jihadist groups recruiting in and out of Jordan and Lebanon and their various spin-off organisations. What he finds is no surprise to anyone paying attention. From the interviews in <italic>Aftermath</italic>, the reader learns that the US’s occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan brought flocks of recruits to fight Americans. Volunteers against ‘America’s wars on the Muslim world’ had to be turned away, according to some of the <italic>Jihadi</italic> leadership: ‘“Most people here hate and hate and hate the U.S. administration”’, (Jordanian) attorney Samih Khreis told me. “And most people say, if anybody has the opportunity to explode the White House, they would”’ (p. 146).</p>
<p>The consequences have been not just a rise in anti-US militancy, but a resurgence of political Islam. During the late 1990s and the post-September 11 period, experts on the region claimed that political Islam was finished, with 9/11 perhaps ‘its last nihilistic act’. The American grand plan was to replace Saddam with a flourishing democracy in Iraq that would spread across the region and take down other autocratic states. Looking back, the claims seem ludicrous. Iraqi politics have been taken over by religious parties; Hamas was the clear winner in the last Palestinian elections; Hezbollah has become a recognised political force; and, even after the recent revolution, the Muslim Brotherhood is the strongest single political force in Egypt. Rosen claims that radical Islam has experienced ‘a renaissance’ (p. 130).</p>
<p>The US-led Coalition displayed a callous indifference to, and little interest in taking responsibility for, the consequences of what it wrought. In fact, the military appears to have learnt all the wrong lessons from Iraq. General Stanley McChrystal transplanted the COIN (counterinsurgency) strategy the military had apparently honed in Iraq to Afghanistan, as if it were a magic formula. But after the American surge in Afghanistan, the Taliban became stronger than ever. For such a backward and widely hated organisation to be welcomed in many parts of Afghanistan, claims Rosen, is ‘a testimony to the regime that the US set up there, and to the atrocities that have been committed in Afghanistan by occupation troops and their Afghan allies’ (p. 513).</p>
<p>Like Iraqis, Rosen reminds us, ‘Afghans have a memory’. Their memory includes American bombings and killing missions that killed hundreds of thousands of Afghan civilians, starting in 1979 during the <italic>mujahideen</italic> anti-Soviet era. Their memory includes destruction of their country, much at American hands, and American alliances with brutal warlords, like the leaders of the Northern Alliance. Their memory includes destruction of thousands upon thousands of schools, homes, farms, towns and villages.</p>
<p>What happened in Iraq is the linchpin to the fallout in the region and beyond. Rosen’s own reaction describes it best:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I am often asked now if it was all worth it. Would it have been better to leave Saddam in power? Are Iraqis better or worse off than they were before the American war? I never know what to say. How do you compare different kinds of terror? Those who were spared Saddam’s prisons and executioners may be better off, though they have not been spared the American prisons, or attacks, or the resistance’s bombs, or the death squads of the civil war. The Kurds are certainly better off, on their way to independence, benefiting from their relative stability and improved economy. But the rest of Iraq? Under Saddam the violence came from one source: the regime. Now it has been democratically distributed: death can come from anywhere, at all times, no matter who you are. You can be killed for crossing the street, for going to the market, for driving your car, for having the wrong name, for being in your house, for being a Sunni, for being a Shiite, for being a woman. The American military can kill you in an operation; you can be arrested by militias and disappear in Iraq’s new secret prisons, now run by Shiites; or you can be kidnapped by the resistance or criminal gangs. Americans cannot simply observe the horror of Iraq and shake their heads with wonder, as if it were Rwanda and they had no role. America is responsible for the chaos that began with the invasion and followed with the botched and brutal occupation. Iraq’s people suffered under the American occupation, the civil war, and the new Iraqi government, just as they did under the American-imposed sanctions and bombings before the war and just as they did under the years of Baathist dictatorship. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>And, in the meantime, Americans have been passive about the obvious illegality of the wars in the Middle East and what their occupations have meant. Rosen’s ability to make this real, to put us in the place of ordinary civilians in the region, gives his story the credibility that neither glorified justifications of the US’s intervention, nor the plethora of ‘Rambo’ tales about US marine bravery in, for example, Fallujah, will ever have. If, for a single day, Americans in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles or Boston had to face these conditions, would they have an uprising? Demand to throw out their government? Take up arms? Turn on each other? Walking a day in Iraqi shoes helps us understand how they have responded – with anger, disgust, courage, fortitude, bloodshed and, by their millions, by just running away from it all.</p>
<p>Is it just arrogance that allows Americans to be indifferent? Is it that America has successfully demonised Iraqis, Muslims, Arabs, as somehow not human? Is it vengeance for what we believe we have suffered at the hands of Muslims on 9/11? Or is it a belief that we are indeed bringing ‘democracy’ to Iraq and the region and that there is a price to pay for the positive end our intervention will bring about? What is most interesting about these questions is that the answers do not matter. What matters is what Iraqis and the rest of the people in the Middle East <italic>experience</italic> and why <italic>they</italic> believe that America is destroying their countries and their people. In the end, this will be about them, Rosen argues, because they will respond, and are responding, as people anywhere would when their nations and homes are attacked: they will retaliate, and there will be thousands, if not millions, motivated to join the cause.</p>
