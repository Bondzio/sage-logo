<p>In his book <italic>Dark Green Religion: Nature, Spirituality, and the Planetary Future</italic>, Bron Taylor identifies and discusses the emergence and development of environmentally-oriented religion and spirituality. Distinguished from simply “green religion,” which Taylor associates with efforts (presumably within existing traditions) to formulate environmentally friendly behaviour as religious obligation, what he labels “dark green religion” (hereafter shortened to DGR) is a wide and diverse phenomenon <italic>outside</italic> of organized religious traditions, and made up of individuals and groups who consider nature to be “sacred, imbued with intrinsic value, and worthy of reverent care” (ix). Continuing in his own words, from the Preface: DGR<disp-quote>
<p>can be found in the minds and hearts of individuals who invent and are drawn to organizations that express its central convictions and moral commitments. It has charismatic figures and bureaucratic hierarchies devoted to its globalization. It is reinforced and spread through artistic forms that often resemble, and are sometimes explicitly designed, as religious rituals. It seeks to destroy forms of religiosity incompatible with its own moral and spiritual perceptions. It is considered dangerous by some, while others see it as offering salvation. (ix)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>“Dark” in his usage has a double meaning: it references the deep conviction of those participating in DGR, but also hints at the potential shadow side that can be found with any religion, including radicalism, exclusivity, and efforts toward hegemonic globalism. DGR, as Taylor identifies it, covers a broad range of positions in the environmentalist milieu, leading him to offer a fourfold typology of fluid and sometimes overlapping categories: Spiritual Animism, Naturalistic Animism, Gaian Spirituality, and Gaian Naturalism. Broadly, “Animism has to do with the perception that spiritual intelligences <italic>or</italic> lifeforces animate natural objects or living things,” while Gaian Earth Religion “understands the biosphere (universe or cosmos) to be alive or conscious, or at least by metaphor and analogy to resemble organisms with their many interdependent parts” (15–16). These categories, of course, can and frequently do overlap.</p>
<p>Taylor states that his objective in the book is to “provide readers with the lenses needed to see dark green religion for themselves, to recognize its growing importance, and to consider its implications” (xiv). He offers numerous historical and contemporary examples to help readers do so.</p>
<p>In what follows, I will address Taylor’s work specifically, by way of opening the more general discussion carried on by my fellow contributors. I think a number of questions arise from this book, but I will focus mainly on how we might take his choice to explicitly identify this phenomenon as <italic>religion</italic> (as will the other contributors, in their own way). At core are the risks and benefits of <italic>naming</italic> or <italic>defining</italic> a person, group or movement as “religious” or “a religion” when those terms are eschewed by the subject(s) him- or herself, or themselves. Our question is whether this term can be used unproblematically, as Taylor uses it, for analytical purposes in examining environmentalism <italic>outside</italic> the bounds of organized/traditional religions. I will return to this issue in my concluding remarks.</p>
<p>My initial reaction to Taylor’s book is to agree with his observations and conclusions. His documentation is thorough, and I take for granted that he has put his finger on a significant social phenomenon. In fact, it is somewhat gratifying, I admit, that my own research and conclusions jibe well with his: namely, that there is a level of commitment amongst many environmentalists at least <italic>bordering</italic> on religious (even if they themselves have no particular religious affiliation), that goes beyond the material level to something higher, deeper, and/or more profound. I refer to this as “secular spirituality” in my work, but I have been challenged on more than one occasion to call a spade a spade and refer to it as “religion.”</p>
<p>This, then, cuts to the chase of one the central questions: whether the term “religion” is appropriate. Taylor dismisses this as irrelevant, stating at the end of the book that it does not matter “what it [DGR] is called or whether one concludes that the term <italic>religion</italic> is aptly applied to the phenomena I have described” (220). Studying the phenomena themselves is more important than getting snagged in terminology. Yet he is also making an argument: that the boundaries of what we usually think of as “religion” get blurry indeed in the context of his studies. I agree with this; I think that at the core of value-formation (both belief and lived practice), it becomes very difficult to distinguish between “religious,” “spiritual” and “ethical” orientations. In environmentalist milieux – including those drawing exclusively on science rather than metaphysics or the supernatural – part of what connects individuals and groups is a commitment to a notion of a “higher” good that involves the well-being of non-human life, and an orientation of value-systems toward that good. How this is expressed differs depending on the language people are comfortable with; but, given that expressions of such deep commitment have traditionally been the province of religion, it is not surprising that both environmentalists and the scholars studying them make use of religious language and imagery.</p>
<p>And yet, I think Taylor dismisses a little too readily just how loaded the terms “religion” or “religious” are. As my colleagues will discuss in more detail, they are not neutral designations. This, I think, is clear in a number of ways, not the least of which is the fact that many of those whom Taylor connects with the practice of DGR would be very uncomfortable with, or would outright reject, such an association. This need not mean we dismiss the idea entirely, but it should at least give us pause to consider why people would reject the term “religion” as applied to their environmentalism. Clearly many people have negative associations with religion, including the perceived (and often real) dogmatism in many of its traditional forms. Indeed, this is why there is an important and now common distinction between <italic>religion</italic> and <italic>spirituality</italic>. Taylor acknowledges the perceived distinction, but taking a “family resemblances” approach (from Benson Saler) for the purpose of his own study, conflates the two categories: “… there is little <italic>analytical</italic> reason to assume these are different kinds of social phenomena” (3). Even if we grant this for his purposes, it is clear that many distance themselves from the idea of religion/spirituality, despite otherwise advocating a kind of kinship with and obligation toward other forms of life and/or the planet as a whole. Taylor leaves scope for this in his fourfold schema of DGR, at the “naturalist” end of his spectrum (whether “Naturalistic Animism” or “Gaian Naturalism”). Naturalists, of course, by very definition, would be unlikely to self-identify with terms and language traditionally linked to the supernatural; yet, Taylor points out examples of naturalists who nonetheless express deep care and reverence for nature, and argue for its intrinsic worth. It is for this group in particular that we must ponder the appropriateness of the term “religion,” particularly if we strain to observe anything traditionally religious about their behaviour.</p>
<p>But this is not simply a case of locating traditional characteristics of religion, which may not be important. For many with “green” values, bringing in terms such as “religion” or “spirituality,” or religious language generally, is <italic>harmful</italic>, unnecessarily obfuscating the science and even the ethics of environmentalism because of their traditional and actual links to metaphysical positions and conflicts. A recent article in the “Energy and Environment” supplement of the <italic>New York Times</italic>, for instance, quotes several people engaged in environmental policy research and leadership who are wary of this perceived “encroachment” of religious language, including a theologian. The author, Jeremy Lovell, begins with the observation: “Apocalyptic visions and the muscular language of religious fervor are invading the climate arena, replacing issues of fact with those of faith and bringing high emotion into science – an area where it should have no place – politicians and religious leaders complain” (“Language of Religious Fervor,” par. 1). The perceived contrasts here – fact and faith, emotion and science – highlight the way values associated with religion are negatively set in opposition to those associated with science and “reason.” It can be particularly unhelpful and counter-productive, notes climate change researcher Tom Burke (quoted in Lovell’s article), given that much of this language emerges from the US, where the climate change debate is more polarized than anywhere else, infused with the political and religious agenda of the religious right (“Language of Religious Fervor,” par. 8–10). The theologian cited in the article, Martin Palmer, states that the apocalyptic language found in environmentalism, which has been used unsuccessfully to persuade people by the church in the past, is self-defeating (“Language of Religious Fervor,” par. 12–15).</p>
<p>This is what I mean when I say that the term “religion” is loaded: it is, for many people, laden with too much metaphysical and political weight, connected too closely to conflict and divisiveness. I do not think this can be lightly brushed aside for “analytical” purposes, however benign the intent. Although there is, no doubt, scholarly fruit to be had in exploring the idea of “green (or dark green) religion” (including, potentially, benefits for non-religious environmentalists themselves, as Simon Appolloni and Chris Hrynkow discuss in their essays), too ready an imposition of religious language, and the term “religion,” on individuals or groups uncomfortable with it can do injustice to their sense of self-identity, as Sarah Kleeb discusses more thoroughly in her contribution.</p>
<p>Having said this, let me finish by returning to an earlier point: I like that Taylor challenges perceived boundaries between religion, spirituality, ethics, and even science. I believe that it is important to break down the perceived rigidity and mutual exclusivity of these categories, when understood as lived value-commitments and meaning-systems; I think the value of work such as Taylor’s outweighs the potential drawbacks of terminology. A greater challenge is needed, for instance, to the veil of value-neutrality that lies over everything scientific. Bringing to light, as Taylor does, the examples of people across the naturalist spectrum (including scientists) expressing their sense of kinship with and obligation toward the natural world, whether we call it “religious” or “spiritual” or not, helps lift this veil of value-neutrality; it demonstrates, in part at least, that deep value-formation and commitment, in opposition to a purely materialist and heedlessly anthropocentric way of being, is occurring and being more readily acknowledged across the spectrum within the environmentalist milieu.</p>
<p>In the end, to return to the central question of whether or not “religion” is an appropriate term to apply to certain observable forms of environmentalism: perhaps, indeed, we are making an issue out of nothing. This is a conclusion Taylor would no doubt heartily agree with. And yet this question cannot be ignored, especially if we ponder the <italic>implications</italic> of the emergence of DGR, or whatever else we choose to call it. Of all the stated objectives of his book, this is the least accomplished, in my opinion. If we are in fact witnessing the coalescing of a global or “terrapolitan” earth religion or quasi-religion, we should certainly study what <italic>kind</italic> of religion it is, and its impact on society (including other religions); as Simon Appolloni puts it in his piece (drawing from Saler), whether or not it is a kind of “stripe-less tiger.” If, on the other hand, we are witnessing a new kind of profound <italic>expression</italic> and sense of <italic>obligation</italic> – one that could be called religious, quasi-religious, spiritual but not religious, vocational (as Chris Hrynkow discusses in his contribution), or ethical, or some combination of these – this, I think, necessitates a different kind of study than one which simply identifies a new religious kid on the block. And I believe this latter is more likely to be what is occurring. As such, Taylor’s research remains of great value and interest, as it offers plenty of examples of non-traditionally religious yet powerful and meaningful forms of connection with, and obligation toward, the natural world. Bringing such examples to light demonstrates that, for many, forms of religious expression are not fading, but <italic>changing</italic>, enough that the term “religious” is now problematic, or at the very least fluid and contestable.<sup>
