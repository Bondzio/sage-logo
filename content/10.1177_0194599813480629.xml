<body>
<p>In rhinoplasty, the nasal tip presents a major challenge to the surgeon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813480629">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813480629">2</xref></sup> Many options are available to achieve satisfactory results, and the choice of an appropriate surgical technique should be based on the patient’s characteristics and the surgeon’s skill. Vertical dome division (VDD) is a versatile technique that can be used when nasal tip rotation, narrowing, symmetry restoration, and changes in projection are indicated. Goldman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813480629">3</xref></sup> first described VDD in the 1950s, and the technique has since been modified to create an approach with minimal tissue excision that is focused on the incision and mobilization of the lower lateral cartilages (LLCs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813480629">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813480629"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813480629"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813480629">7</xref></sup> The Simons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813480629">5</xref></sup> modification of VDD differs from the Goldman technique in that it preserves intact the underlying bridge of skin and mucosa and uses permanent nylon sutures to approximate and influence the rotation of the medial crura.</p>
<p>Although VDD can be considered a conservative, cartilage-sparing approach to nasal tip surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813480629">8</xref></sup> concerns about postoperative asymmetry and cartilage visibility remain, especially in thin-skinned patients. Some surgeons prefer to use the Simons modification of VDD only in thick-skinned or ethnic patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813480629">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813480629">8</xref></sup> whereas others also, or even more frequently, use it in thin-skinned patients. Several publications have addressed these issues in describing the surgical technique and its modifications, indications, complications, and reoperation rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813480629">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813480629"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813480629"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813480629">7</xref></sup> However, little effort has been made to study patients’ satisfaction and quality-of-life outcomes after VDD surgery using validated scales.</p>
<p>This study aimed to evaluate satisfaction and quality-of-life outcomes in patients undergoing the Simons modification of VDD using the Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (ROE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813480629">9</xref></sup> and Portuguese version of the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE-p)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813480629">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813480629">11</xref></sup> and to compare these outcomes between thick-skinned and thin- or normal-skinned patients.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>A consecutive sample of patients undergoing primary rhinoseptoplasty at a tertiary university center in southern Brazil between December 2010 and October 2011 was evaluated for eligibility. The research protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (No. 10-420). All eligible patients were informed about the study and provided written consent.</p>
<p>Eligible participants were aged ≥16 years, had nasal obstruction symptoms, and were candidates for functional and esthetic primary rhinoseptoplasty. Exclusion criteria were (1) no nasal tip concern, (2) previous nasal surgery, (3) turbinate hypertrophy as the sole cause of nasal obstruction, and/or (4) concomitant procedures, such as functional endoscopic sinus surgery, adenoidectomy, blepharoplasty, or otoplasty.</p>
<p>The patients were classified according to observed skin thickness intraoperatively. A patient was considered to be thick skinned if nasal tip definition was limited by excessive overlying soft tissue. If the nasal tip had thin overlying soft tissue, raising a concern about cartilage visibility, the patient was considered to be thin skinned. If nasal skin thickness did not raise any concern during surgery, the patient was considered to be normal skinned.</p>

<sec id="section9-0194599813480629">
<title>Surgical Procedure</title>
<p>A single surgeon (M.L.-W.) performed all surgeries with the assistance of medical residents. All procedures used an endonasal rhinoplasty technique with the Simon modification of VDD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813480629">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813480629">6</xref></sup> to treat nasal tip deformities. The LLCs were delivered by marginal incision combined with an intercartilaginous incision. The natural domal high point was determined by inserting a hook behind the soft-tissue facet, impaling the anatomical apex of the LLC. After delivery, the LLC was cleaned of overlying soft tissue and then vertically divided on either side of the apex to resect a variable portion of the medial and lateral crura, generally no more than 2 mm. The vestibular skin and mucosa were preserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813480629">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813480629"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). A cartilaginous strut was placed sagittally between the medial crura, and a 5-0 clear nylon suture was used to fix it in position and bring together the medial crural ends. In most cases, a small cephalic trim was also performed. No attempt was made to reconstitute the dome by suturing the medial to the lateral cut ends. After nasal tip surgery was completed, appropriate dorsal profile alignment was achieved. All patients underwent lateral and medial osteotomies.</p>

Each question is scored from 0 to 4 on a Likert-type scale, and total scores are converted to range from 0 to 100 by dividing by 24 and multiplying by 100. For questions 1 to 3 and 5, 0 indicates “not at all” and 4 indicates “completely.” For question 4, 0 indicates “always” and 4 indicates “never.” For question 6, 0 represents “definitely” and 4 represents “no.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813480629">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813480629">12</xref></sup> Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction, and a score of 0 represents major dissatisfaction. A 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) was also used to evaluate satisfaction with nasal appearance (0 mm = extremely unsatisfied, 100 mm = extremely satisfied) preoperatively and postoperatively.</p>

<p>All patients underwent rhinoseptoplasty with VDD, as described above. Inferior turbinate reduction was performed in 21 (48%) patients.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The VDD technique can be used to treat asymmetrical, over- or underprojected, broad, and/or underrotated nasal tips. According to Simons’ 30 years of experience with this technique, patients with poorly projected nasal tips, marked bifidity, heavy skin, and vertical displacement of the LLCs are most likely to benefit from VDD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813480629">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, patients’ initial mean ROE and VAS scores were low and initial NOSE-p scores were high, demonstrating that nasal aspects negatively affected their preoperative quality of life. Rhinoseptoplasty using the VDD technique resulted in significant improvement in all of these scores in the short-term follow-up period.</p>
<p>Despite several research efforts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813480629">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813480629">15</xref></sup> studies evaluating quality-of-life outcomes after nasal tip surgery with VDD remain scarce in the facial plastic surgery literature. To our knowledge, this study is the second to evaluate quality-of-life outcomes in patients undergoing VDD surgery. In 2011, Salari and Totonchi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813480629">16</xref></sup> reported results from a randomized clinical trial comparing the Goldman and suture techniques for nasal tip surgery. The authors used a modified ROE scale that focused on patients’ satisfaction with nasal tip appearance. After 16 months of follow-up, they found that the Goldman technique yielded better results (improvement in modified ROE score by 49 vs 23; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Although our surgeries were performed using the Simons modification of VDD rather than the Goldman technique, and we used the original ROE instrument, postoperative ROE scores were comparable between studies.</p>
<p>A few other studies have used the ROE scale to evaluate postoperative outcomes following surgeries that did not use VDD. Arima et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813480629">17</xref></sup> reported a mean postoperative ROE score (76 ± 19.5) very similar to ours in patients who underwent rhinoplasty to correct crooked nose. Patients who underwent secondary rhinoplasty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813480629">18</xref></sup> had a mean long-term postoperative ROE score of 59, which is considerably lower than our postoperative scores. This difference can probably be explained by the difficulty in achieving patient satisfaction inherent to secondary surgery.</p>
<p>Although the Goldman technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813480629">3</xref></sup> has been stigmatized since the 1950s, VDD has regained popularity and acceptance because of subsequently introduced modifications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813480629">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813480629">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813480629">7</xref></sup> Even so, experience with VDD differs among surgeons, and some strictly avoid it because of concerns about functional and esthetic postoperative results. Surgeons with more experience in the technique have expressed the main concern of potential asymmetry and cartilage visibility in thin-skinned patients, in contrast to the concern of potentially unnatural appearance experience by less-experienced surgeons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813480629">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nasal tip bossae, a recognized complication of rhinoplasty, involves asymmetry due to irregular knuckling or prominence of the alar cartilage. Some authors have suggested that the use of interrupted strip techniques in thin-skinned patients and VDD without suture reconstitution of the intact lateral crural strip cause postoperative bossae.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813480629">19</xref></sup> However, Gillman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813480629">19</xref></sup> demonstrated in a multivariate analysis that VDD with suture binding of medial crural elements reduced the risk of postoperative nasal tip bossae compared with complete strip techniques. They identified thin skin, instead of interrupted strip techniques, as an independent risk factor that increased the risk of postoperative bossae development almost 6-fold. Among thin-skinned patients, VDD and complete strip procedures were associated with similar risks of bossae development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813480629">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our data showed that thin- and normal-skinned patients were more satisfied (higher ROE score) with the outcome of surgery than were thick-skinned patients in the short-term follow-up period. This finding is in agreement with the argument that thin skin, although associated with a higher risk of nasal tip bossae development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813480629">19</xref></sup> is also associated with better outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813480629">20</xref></sup> irrespective of VDD use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813480629">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some limitations of this study should be considered. The first and most important limitation is the short follow-up period, as complications of surgery using VDD can occur in the long term. In addition, although the instruments used in the present study were able to capture quality-of-life outcomes related to rhinoplasty and nasal obstruction, they were not validated specifically for the assessment of nasal tip surgery outcomes. Despite these limitations, our results add relevant quality-of-life data to the rhinoplasty literature, including specific information about the outcomes of VDD surgery in Caucasian patients and a comparison of these outcomes according to skin thickness. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods can be developed and conducted on the basis of our findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>VDD is a versatile technique for nasal tip refinement that resulted in significant improvement in quality-of-life outcomes related to rhinoplasty and nasal obstruction, as well as satisfaction with nasal appearance in a short-term follow-up period. The VDD technique does not appear to be indicated in only patients with thick skin, as thin- and normal-skinned patients were more satisfied with the outcome of surgery than were thick-skinned patients. Long-term follow-up studies should be conducted to confirm these findings.</p>
