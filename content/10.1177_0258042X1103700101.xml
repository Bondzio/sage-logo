<p>XLRI was founded in 1949 within years of India attaining independence. It was a pioneer in meeting the managerial needs of the young nation. Management and Labour Studies (MLS) was conceived of in the early years of 1970s. In the days of isolation and real distance from the developed world, MLS could fast establish itself as a mouthpiece of management researchers, academicians and practitioners of India and also few contributions coming in from abroad.</p>
<p>The MLS Journal is devoted to the study and improvement of management practices by publishing research based articles in all the areas of management such as Economics, Finance, Human Resources, Marketing, Organizational Behaviour, Information systems, Production and Operations Management Strategy and also from related social sciences domains like sociology, psychology, anthropology and etc. MLS has a long standing tradition of publishing articles that:</p>
<list id="list1-0258042X1103700101" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Demonstrate substantial conceptual development and appropriate methodology</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are of high quality and thought provoking</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Are likely to extend the boundaries of knowledge and the discipline</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Challenge or modify dominant conceptual and methodological paradigms</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modify the perspectives and see phenomena in a different light</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>MLS is a scholarly journal devoted to the dissemination of theory and research in the larger domain of management and human resources management. The editorial policy favours no particular area of management, research paradigm or analytic approach. It publishes both full length articles and research notes. Replication studies, conceptual thought provoking articles with managerial implications fall in this category.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing authors with timely and constructive reviews, specific and when required extensive directions for revising the manuscript. The editorial office makes every effort to ensure that the manuscript turn around is done in less than 60 days time. Manuscripts are accepted for publication only after at least two reviewers who are either part of the editorial board or ad hoc reviewers recommend it for inclusion.</p>
<p>MLS Reviewers are encouraged to adopt a developmental perspective in their comments to authors. Instead of identifying manuscript’s weaknesses that become grounds for rejection, the primary focus of reviewers is to suggest ways to improve the quality of the paper. We at the Editorial Board see it as an important part of our academic responsibility to develop the quality of research output.</p>
<p>While getting ready to publish the 37th volume, we have joined hands with Sage Publications, an internationally acclaimed academic journal publisher. With this collaboration, we anticipate reaching out to different parts of the world and different disciplines; thus making a meaningful contribution to the management domain.</p>
