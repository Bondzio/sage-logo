<p>This film begins with several college students talking about their earliest experiences looking at adult videos and magazines. The brief interviews are intercut with pictures of their childhoods. <italic>The Price of Pleasure</italic> starts with the insinuation of the innocence and purity of childhood and the promising future that awaits and pornography as an early polluter of youthful virtue. Although not an overt statement of the filmmakers’ opinions, these early interviews reveal the underlying case being made: The adult entertainment industry is a monolithic enterprise with harmful and destructive effects.</p>
<p>The broad questions explored in this documentary concern the construction of gender, desire, and relationships. Also, how did the porn industry become part of the cultural and economic mainstream? The filmmakers’ exploration of these questions centers on two commonly addressed themes in most documentaries regarding adult entertainment: profit and the exploitation of women.</p>
<p>The adult film industry produces 13,000 videos and over 900 million rentals every year, generating between $10 billion and $14 billion annually, according to the filmmakers. The filmmakers establish porn’s mainstream presence by discussing how CBS, Time Warner, and News Corporation earn over $1 billion a year through their distribution of these videos and the production and licensing of programs such as <italic>The Girls Next Door</italic> on E! Entertainment and <italic>The Cathouse</italic> on HBO. The increasing political and legal clout of the adult entertainment industry is explored through the 1981 creation of the Free Speech Coalition. The coalition is best known for the 2002 Supreme Court decision <italic>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</italic>. According to the filmmakers, this increased presence of porn in mainstream media and the creation of the Free Speech Coalition have facilitated the omnipresence of porn. Ultimately, the filmmakers argue that adult content has saturated the public realm to such a degree that there is no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>In the next segment, “Porn Stars: Myths and Realities,” industry producers, actors, and a mass media scholar are interviewed. The myth that women in the adult entertainment industry earn bigger paychecks is explored. The producers of adult entertainment use legendary actress Jenna Jameson as an example of women’s ability to earn multimillion dollar incomes in the industry. Several critics of the industry confirm that the vast majority of profits from adult entertainment are earned by the white male producers. A contextual discussion of women’s economic vulnerability follows, asking the viewer, “Is this the best choice for women to strengthen their financial stability?” It is important to consider porn within the larger context of exploitation and limited economic choices for women. In a culture that offers women few economic opportunities for high salaries, do women have enough choices? The answer is a resounding “no.” However, some women in the industry find their satisfying. These missing voices maintain the monolithic image of the adult film industry.</p>
<p>The third segment, “Just a Fantasy?” discusses the role of pornography as a lens through which men, and women, create and view relationships. Anal sex is highlighted, relying on its association with filth. Anal sex is used to demonstrate that anal penetration is always a means to humiliate and degrade women, rather than a legitimate desire and source of pleasure. Another topic covered in this segment is how these videos reinforce racism. The portrayal of racial minority groups within adult films is compared with mainstream images of racial minorities. The sexual images are presented as more severe and debilitating. This discussion is followed by a man discussing his enjoyment of “aggressive sex.” Although his face is blurred, his dreadlocks are clearly visible. After a discussion of racist images in porn, it is problematic that a presumably African American man is presented as an aggressive sexual predator. The direct link between viewing a video and then directly demanding that one’s female partner perform the act regardless of her desire to do so is the weakest analysis of this documentary.</p>
<p>Men’s use of pornography is framed as preventing them from creating intimacy within sexual encounters and thus inhibiting an ability to create intimacy within their relationships. Women’s experience of porn is framed in terms of feelings of inadequacy in their inability to look like porn stars and enact the sexual scenes within the movies. I found this to be another weak argument in the documentary. “Just a Fantasy?” collapses ideas of porn and nonconsent, sex and intimacy, and sex and women. The links the filmmakers make are oversimplified regarding pornographic images and how men and women create relationships and have sex. The interviews of users of porn implicitly develop a link between porn and nonconsent. The links also reinforce ideas that sex is best when it is creating or maintaining emotional intimacy and that attitudes about porn are attitudes about relationships. Men are cast as developing negative attitudes about sex through the viewing of porn, thus resulting in negative attitudes about women. The oversimplified and poorly documented claims amount to porn being equated with assault, emotional isolation, that men’s ideas about sex are their ideas about women, and that all of us should desire the hegemonic models of intimacy and relationships.</p>
<p>In the segment “Empowered by Porn?” the filmmakers focus on women in college who participate in videos (<italic>Girls Gone Wild</italic>) and college sex magazines (<italic>H Bomb</italic>, published by Harvard University students). The interviews with these women reveal the shifting meanings that women attach to appearing nude or engaging in sex on camera. The easy access to producing and starring in one’s own explicit videos and pictures using inexpensive personal digital cameras and the use of desktop publishing software may be a contributing factor to how people are rethinking the definition and meaning of explicit images. Another explanation may be simply a generational difference between older feminists and younger ones. The women who produce explicit magazines and Web sites provide feminist arguments of empowerment and self-awareness, perhaps in response to an earlier generation’s (e.g., Andrea Dworkin, Catherine MacKinnon) antiporn work.</p>
<p>What is missing in the final segment, “Harder and Harder,” is the recognition that for many women, forms of consensual domination are arousing. The filmmakers would provide a unique and more complex analysis of explicit videos and images by discussing the role of women’s desire and the treatment of nonhegemonic behaviors as problematic. Their treatment of BDSM (bondage and discipline, domination and submission, and sadomasochism) activities themselves as a violent and harmful behavior perpetuates the severe prejudices against individuals with stigmatized desires. Yet the filmmakers repeat the construction of sex negativity through the acceptance of the heteronormative assumption that sex is inherently base and potentially dangerous and can be redeemed only by its coupling with hegemonic forms of intimacy.</p>
<p>This video offers updated examples that will make it relatable to students who think that last month’s celebrity scandal is no longer relevant. This video is useful for many classes but especially sexuality and gender classes, queer theory classes, and cultural studies courses. However, this documentary makes similar arguments as older ones. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11420383">Bonnie Sherr Klein’s (1981)</xref> <italic>Not a Love Story</italic> is the seminal documentary regarding these arguments. In classes that explore the disruption of hegemonic ideas regarding sexuality and relationships, the documentary provides many opportunities to question how the filmmakers perpetuate heteronormative standards that reproduce alienation and harsh sanctions against individuals who fall outside of mainstream ideas of sex, desire, pleasure, and relationships. Students’ critical thinking skills are enhanced by not only viewing the documentary but also asking questions about the filmmakers’ intentions and unacknowledged assumptions.</p>
