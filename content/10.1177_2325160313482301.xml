<p>Our Annual Meeting Program Chair Patti Geil and her committee have developed an educational program that is second to none.</p>
<p>I have a vivid memory of my first AADE Annual Meeting in 1995, which is surprising because I arrived sleep deprived and groggy. I had recently given birth to my son, Andrew, and hadn’t had a restful night in longer than I cared to remember. I’m sure many of you can relate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In spite of this, I had such a fabulous time. Not only did I earn a year’s worth of continuing education credit, but I was awed with being in the company of so many accomplished educators. I learned an extraordinary amount in those few short days, and I formed many professional and personal friendships that continue to this day.</p>
<p>I was also able to experience the host city, Boston, with its incredible history. We walked the legendary Freedom Trail and visited Faneuil Hall, a famous marketplace and meeting hall that’s been around since 1742.</p>
<p>Fast-forward 18 years and AADE is going to be in another city synonymous with our nation’s founding. Philadelphia not only has a treasure trove of sites offering a glimpse into the American Colonial Period but has a world-class art museum, zoo, gardens, and shopping. Local Host Committee Chair Nadine Uplinger and her committee are gearing up for the meeting and are excited to share their vibrant city with all of us.</p>
<p>I am particularly energized about AADE13 because not only are we celebrating our 40th anniversary, but this year’s theme is The Point of Possible, which perfectly sums up the essence of the meeting and what it can give you. My first meeting in 1995 opened up a world of possibilities for me and every year since has not only given me new knowledge and exposed me to unique and valuable viewpoints, but has served to inspire and encourage me to grow professionally. It can do the same for you.</p>

<title>Here’s What AADE 13 Has in Store for You</title>
<p>Our Annual Meeting Program Chair Patti Geil and her committee have developed an educational program that is second to none. Thanks to this amazing group, attendees will be able to choose from nearly 100 educational sessions and can receive up to 23 CE credits.</p>
<p>To help you create a meeting plan that best fits your learning needs, all sessions will be categorized into five learning tracks—Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, and Clinical Guidelines; Culturally Competent Supportive Care Across the Lifespan; Teaching and Learning Skills; Self-Management Education; and Program and Business Management—and divided into categories of expertise. You will find there are more advanced sessions than ever before. That has been a request received from many longtime educators. You asked, we listened and responded.</p>
<p>We are continuing our wildly successful interactive workshop series, where multiple presenters or panels will explore such topics as management of the bariatric surgery patient with diabetes, shared medical appointments, technology-driven best practices, meal planning, and diabetes apps. And, you will have the opportunity to register for pre-conference programs that are designed to enhance your online presence and give you the skills to represent yourself and your program in the media. Again, you asked for these sessions, and we listened!</p>
<p>AADE13 has also lined up an impressive array of keynote speakers. We will kick off the meeting with Phil Southerland, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was just 7 months old. At 30, Phil has outlived his predicted life span, founded Team Type 1, an organization for athletes with diabetes, and is a global ambassador for diabetes!</p>
<p>Other keynoters include obesity expert Arya Sharma, MD, PhD, of the University of Alberta, who will share his 5As of Obesity Management, a set of practical tools to guide health care professionals in obesity counseling; and B. J. Fogg, PhD, who directs the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford University. Dr. Fogg’s team focuses on methods for creating habits, exploring what causes behavior, and looking at what automates behavior change. How perfect for us!</p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least, is a fellow Southerner, Paula Deen. She came highly requested on attendee evaluations from AADE12. No, she’s not going to share her butter-laden recipes, but rather will take us on her journey of eating healthier and successfully managing her diabetes. No doubt she will give us plenty of tips and inspiration to share with our patients.</p>

<p>Another first for us this year is the ability to offer continuing medical education (CME) credit to physicians. We’re excited at the prospect of having physicians join us at the meeting and believe they can add another dimension to the discussions that occur during the sessions.</p>
