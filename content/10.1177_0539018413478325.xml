<abstract>
<p>The article defends a conception of ecology that considers what ecosystems mean not only in themselves but also for themselves. Each living being is thus a message for another living being, and not merely a functional piece in a physical process of energy exchange or in an evolutionary process in which individual reproduction is all that counts. The article deems that the hatred of the animal kingdom characteristic of Western history and the resulting atrophy of our imagination of the living world explain our blindness. The author suggests Westerners should be more open to non-Western ways of thinking, which might help overcome their difficulty in thinking through the existential, ethical and cultural stakes involved in the present collapse of biodiversity.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>L’article défend une conception de l’écologie qui considère que les écosystèmes biologiques ont une signification non seulement en eux-mêmes mais aussi pour eux-mêmes. Chaque être vivant est alors un message pour d’autres êtres vivants et pas seulement un pion purement fonctionnel dans un processus physique d’échanges d’énergie ou dans un processus évolutionnaire dans lequel la reproduction de l’individu est le seul critère à prendre en compte. L’article estime que la haine de l’animal qui caractérise l’histoire occidentale et l’imagination atrophiée du vivant qui en résulte expliquent les raisons de notre aveuglement. Il suggère que les Occidentaux devraient s’ouvrir plus largement à des pensées non occidentales pour pallier leurs difficultés à conceptualiser jusqu’au bout les enjeux existentiels, éthiques et culturels de l’effondrement actuel de la biodiversité.</p>

<body>
<p>Loss of biodiversity is a problem for which our culture does not propose a truly satisfying answer. Edward O Wilson points out that throughout our evolutionary history we have been more or less selected for short- or medium-range reasoning (what he calls physiological time) and not for long-range reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018413478325">Wilson, 2012 [1984]</xref>: 156ff) that is needed for thinking biodiversity. Despite my huge admiration for Wilson, his remark, like most evolutionist hypotheses of the sort, has more to do with fashionable chatter than with serious reflection. But I think there is another more pertinent reason for the difficulty we encounter: we unjustifiably neglect some of the fundamental issues at stake in this biological and cultural catastrophe – in particular the problem of the pathologies entailed in the sharing of life between humans and other living beings. Ecologists analyze biodiversity exclusively as a question of biological regulation, passing over not only the semiotic dimension of the living world but also the diversity of meanings carried in each living being and the connectivity that ensues for one and all. From this standpoint, contemporary ecology errs in two ways. First of all by considering that living beings occupy shared ecosystems whereas they actually live together. And then by thinking that this ecological crisis is a side-effect of our technological progress that could be remedied using tools advantageously selected from among the poisons that are killing us. In this sense, the collapse of biodiversity is not the unfortunate outcome of the technological bent of Western societies, but on the contrary the consequence of the nature of Western culture<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018413478325">1</xref></sup> from the outset – its technological mindset being ultimately only one of the components.</p>
<p>Far from being an unexpected side-effect of Western culture, I believe that the suppression of nature is on the contrary one of its most deeply seated aspirations dating from its Greek beginnings. The ideology of the human being as unique, which is one of the main pillars of Western culture, considers that human beings are not animals, that the latter are on the contrary always a threat to man and that culture must be substituted for a nature, which is, on the contrary, where animals live. Humans are therefore conceived as living beings who not only do not share a common life with other living beings and do not have to be concerned with them, but who must, on the contrary, do their utmost to protect themselves from these other beings. If this anthropological intuition turns out to be true, it means that a suitable response to the present ecological crisis must first be grounded in a radical critique of European humanism and culture.</p>
<sec id="section1-0539018413478325">
<title>Four forms of ecology</title>
<p>When the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess distinguished and opposed, in 1973, a deep and a shallow ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018413478325">Naess, 1973</xref>), he was distinguishing an ecology that thinks environmental problems have a technical solution from an ecology that believes biosystems should be considered for themselves, independently of the interest they may hold for humans. Erazim Kohàk later felt that a distinction should be made between a shallow ecology, a deep ecology and a <italic>depth ecology</italic> – one which considers that biological ecosystems, such as mountains, have their own subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018413478325">Kohàk, 2000</xref>: 180–182). However, yet a fourth way of conceiving ecology can be distinguished – an ecology that considers biological ecosystems have a meaning not only <italic>in themselves</italic> but also <italic>for themselves</italic>, and that every animal is a message for another animal, to generalize the idea expressed by Jesper Hoffmeyer, who considers that a dog is a message for another dog.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018413478325">2</xref></sup> The field of biosemiotics that emerged with the work of Jakob von Uexküll in the mid-20th century is still largely ignored by the majority of contemporary philosophers, despite the recent revival of its practice,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018413478325">3</xref></sup> or is simply superficially glossed over and rarely discussed as it deserves to be. And yet it opens potentially fertile perspectives on numerous aspects of the evolution and conservation of species. Furthermore it is very useful in gaining a better grasp of one of the major issues at stake in the present loss of biodiversity – for it is not only the diversity of biological species that is under threat here, but also semiotic diversity, which is at least as serious, in other words the capacity of living beings to live together. And this capacity cannot be reduced simply to that of co-inhabiting the same ecosystems.</p>
<sec id="section2-0539018413478325">
<title>The semiosphere</title>
<p>Discussing the notion of ‘semiosphere’, the Estonian semiotician Yuri Lotman extended Uexküll’s notion of <italic>Umwelt</italic> – the surrounding world or what we often term environment – to the whole planet, giving it a global connotation and at the same time helping to highlight some of the most important evolutionary stakes in play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018413478325">Kull, 1999</xref>). Speaking of a ‘semiotic niche’, Jesper Hoffmeyer takes an important step in the same direction. Suddenly, concern for the other takes on an unprecedented scope: it is no longer a question of simply allowing the individual to survive physically, but also of granting him the semiotic space that is an integral part of his lifespace. This perspective places semiotics at the highest level – that of a quest for meaning that is intrinsic to every living being.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018413478325">
<title>Paul Shepard’s ‘human ecology’</title>
<p>The path of the biosemioticians thus converges with that of Paul Shepard, who is to my knowledge the first Westerner to have explained that being human is first and foremost a way of connecting with other living beings and that to destabilize this connection puts the human being at risk. For Shepard, the split between humans and the surrounding living world is a purely artificial and ideological one – man is his environment and vice versa. This is what he called ‘human ecology’. As he writes: ‘Putting the environment “out there” external to us has made it invisible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018413478325">Shepard, 1998 [1973]</xref>: xxvi). Even if he has visibly not read von Uexküll, Shepard’s originality is to consider that the question of human ecology belongs to the sphere of cognitive eco-biosemiotics rather than biological ecology strictly speaking. For Shepard, the disappearance of species is not a purely biological phenomenon but a complex process that deeply alters what it means to be human.</p>

<sec id="section4-0539018413478325">
<title>Tim Ingold’s anthropology of lines</title>
<p>A semiotic ecology does not grow up in a wasteland, and there are many more resources for conceptualizing it than one might initially have thought. It can, for instance, be fuelled by the anthropology of lines as conceived by Tim Ingold,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018413478325">4</xref></sup> an anthropology of lines that could just as well be a zoology or a botany of lines. For this British anthropologist, all living beings are ultimately made up of intermingled lines that do not stop at the knots formed by each organism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0539018413478325">5</xref></sup> Ingold’s conception of the living world advocates an ecological vision no longer defined as the study of ecosystems but as the study of how living beings form into ecosystems and how these ecosystems are made material through differentiated biological individuals. In this way of thinking, living beings do not adapt to pre-existing ecosystems but are themselves an active part of the relevant ecosystem. Ingold’s weaving metaphor enables a fine-grained graduation of individuals’ proximity to each other in both an inter- and an intra-specific perspective. Thanks to such a metaphor, I can understand that my relations with myself and with those closest to me already partake of ecology. Through such a metaphor, I can conceive that ecology also has to do with my relations with all living beings on earth and not only with those I really or potentially encounter in a given ecosystem. This ecology of meanings is much more rich and complex than an ecology dealing uniquely with food chains, reproduction strategies and territory management.</p>

<sec id="section5-0539018413478325">
<title>Biodiversity and semiosphere</title>
<p>The notion of ‘species conservation’ is usually understood in an overly restrictive sense, considered as primarily a question of <italic>preserving</italic> species. The authors discussed above help us understand that it is not only the species themselves but the semiospheres induced by these species and the role these play in species dynamics that are destroyed (or at least considerably weakened) by loss of biodiversity, in other words the spaces of meaning in which living species can live together. Above and beyond the usual notions of scientific ecology, the conservation of species needs to take into account the spaces of meaning through which the individuals of each of the concerned species (human or not) establish their relationship with the world and consequently organize their lives. Explicitation of the significance of these spaces of meaning that do not fit into the usual categories through which biologists attempt to apprehend the nature of intelligence and the living world should lead us to develop a more complex vision of what it means for a living being to live with all of the other living beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0539018413478325">6</xref></sup> We need to understand what makes it possible to maintain the coherence of the living world and to what extent even the most primitive living being is intrinsically concerned by what happens to other living beings (an agent is ‘concerned’ by something when this something takes on importance for the agent). This kind of effort supposes that we have the capacities to conceive of other living beings as something other than more-or-less complex machines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0539018413478325">7</xref></sup> It is important in this regard to rethink the power of the imagination, to reconceptualize its place in life and to do this in a phylogenetic, semiotic and cultural perspective. It is also important to understand why we find it so difficult to do this and why we are so slow to make a satisfactory account of it.</p>

<sec id="section6-0539018413478325">
<title>Importance of the imagination</title>
<p>Focusing on interpreting the living world sensitizes us to a few of its aspects that have until now been undeservedly neglected, in particular the imagination, which plays a crucial role here. The imagination is one of the most remarkable competences of living beings, but also one that to date has been the most underrated. Even when it has been taken into account, an attempt has been made to make it exclusive to humans, with a few rare exceptions. Yet we could consider that every living being embodies a fundamental aspect of the imagination of living beings and that, far from being an exception, humans too participate fully in this dynamic, without exercising the slightest monopoly; humans merely do this with original cultural means that are exclusively theirs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0539018413478325">8</xref></sup> The problem of the imagination, which applies to all living beings, increases in pertinence in the case of modern humans owing to their capacities for transforming the world and other living beings; and the imagination plays a major role in the relations we entertain with the animals that share our world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0539018413478325">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section7-0539018413478325">
<title>The phylogenetic legacy of our imagination</title>
<p>The limitations of the human imagination, but also some of its most remarkable extensions, have first of all to do with its basis in phylogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0539018413478325">10</xref></sup> To consider the imagination as a purely cognitive competence does not do it justice. Imagination is a collective activity resting largely on the space of possibles revealed to us by the species with which we share our life. When we exterminate these cohabiting species, we reduce our imagination dramatically and drastically limit our existential potential to become constantly actualized human beings. <italic>Each species that disappears is a part of our imagination amputated perhaps permanently and irreversibly</italic>. To my knowledge, Paul Shepard is the only thinker to have had such an intuition, in particular when he evokes the notion of ‘minding animal’, an animal that thinks, that makes others think, an animal that thinks while making others think.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0539018413478325">11</xref></sup> For Shepard, human beings have potential competences that can be activated in certain configurations with certain animals. The disappearance of these animals entails <italic>ipso facto</italic> a reduction of all the possibles to which we can one day accede. We considerably impoverish our capacity to make sense of not only the living world but of our life itself when we reduce the diversity of the living beings that can act as semiotic and cognitive engines. In other terms, today’s collapse of biodiversity is not only a biological catastrophe that will prevent finding new medicines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018413478325">Bœuf, 2007</xref>), it is also, and perhaps above all, an existential catastrophe that substantially reduces the extent and complexity of our imagination and consequently of our humanity itself. But the problems connected with the interface between our imagination and the collapse of biodiversity are tied to certain features of our culture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0539018413478325">
<title>A pathological imagination that clouds our perception of living beings</title>
<p>A pathological imagination plays an important role in the withering of our capacity to share our lives with those of other living beings and in the loss of biodiversity that is one of its most tragic consequences. First of all, by being incapable of truly thinking through the consequences of our acts, as EO Wilson understood it; but also by orienting our preferences in a debatable direction. Günter Anders was not the first to recognize the importance of the imagination in our ethical behaviors, but it was he who gave it a coloration adapted to contemporary problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0539018413478325">12</xref></sup> For Anders, the absence of imagination should be viewed as a perceptual handicap. To be able to see what there is to see demands sufficient imagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018413478325">Anders, 2008 [1995]</xref>: 81–82). Education of the imagination, he writes, is even the main task to which we must devote our attention today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018413478325">Anders, 2008 [1995]</xref>: 143). Moreover, it would be all too easy to consider that only superficial individuals lack the necessary imagination to cope with the problem of loss of biodiversity. In their great majority even the experts are blind to the biosemiotic dimension of the catastrophe playing out before our eyes, and themselves have a limited practical imagination, powerless to make the political class understand the urgency of the situation and the scale of the disaster.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0539018413478325">
<title>A pathological imagination that blinds us to living things</title>
<p>The situation is even grimmer, in the sense that the limitations of our imagination lead us not only to <italic>not</italic> see but also to see <italic>badly</italic>. For it is precisely the role of the imagination to bring us to ask if emergent artificial animal life may not threaten the environment by making us prefer animalized artifacts to real animals, precisely because the first are closer to the representations of our imagination than the second. There, too, Günter Anders could be writing today; he was in effect no doubt the first to have intuited such an intellectual perversion with his notion of ‘Promethean shame’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018413478325">Anders, 2002 [1956]</xref>), in other words the shame a human feels that he was ‘born and becomes’ rather than ‘having been manufactured’. It is the shame of the human being who assesses the gap between the imperfection of the biological human and the perfection of the machines he has manufactured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0539018413478325">
<title>Man-made animals more real than non-made animals</title>
<p>The version of Promethean shame that particularly interests me is not discussed by Anders; this is the conviction that an animalized artifact is more convincing than an authentic animal. Sherry Turkle was the first to have observed this curious phenomenon – or more accurately the first to have described it, in the case of Galapagos tortoises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018413478325">Turkle, 2006</xref>). On the occasion of a trip to Orlando’s Disneyworld with her young teenage daughter they visited the real zoo there, and her daughter asked why they had used real tortoises when robotic tortoises look more real! The other teenagers present reacted similarly. A growing number of humans no longer have any direct contact with a living animal species and they now know animals only through what they see on television, where the latter are always ‘performing’, doing interesting things, since it is only those moments that have been selected. As a result, the ‘real’ animal becomes obviously extremely disappointing – since it does not even act like it does on TV! In the end, it is not so surprising that children or teenagers find animalized machines more convincing and it is hard to simply shrug this away. Gary Paul Nabhan, who carried out some disturbing studies with native populations in the American Southwest, noted that more than 50 percent of the children interviewed had never spent more than half an hour in a natural environment and that a very large number had never played with things from nature (a tree leaf, bird’s feather, small bones found on the ground, etc.) or had never collected them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018413478325">Nabhan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018413478325">Nabhan &amp; St Antoine, 1993</xref>). Moreover the number of words referring to natural phenomena, the names of species, etc., used by people has fallen dramatically in recent generations. The problem of a massive impoverishment of our relationship with nature is not only true of fragile populations but of the rising generations as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0539018413478325">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>The existential and cultural issues at stake in the collapse of biodiversity</title>
<p>The powerlessness of our imagination to apprehend the collapse of biodiversity is not only a major biological catastrophe but also a profound crisis in the capacity to share existence, which constitutes a problem heretofore largely neglected despite its fundamental importance. Our imagination depends in large part on the room given it by the culture in which we live, and to make of the imagination an essentially psychological phenomenon is highly reductionist. Ernst Bloch was no doubt one of the contemporary philosophers most sensitive to this aspect of our times, and he perceived with exemplary lucidity that the quality of our existence depends to a great extent on the richness of our imagination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0539018413478325">14</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section12-0539018413478325">
<title>A simplistic view of living things</title>
<p>The atrophied Western imagination when it comes to living beings is no accident nor does not come as a surprise. On the contrary, Western culture has from the start discredited complex views of living beings, stressing instead the need to conceive of a living being as belonging to an impoverished category devoid of any real existential experience, and cut off, to boot, from all experience with other living beings. It has considered that animals can no doubt be complex, but has persisted in thinking such complexity is not comparable with that of human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0539018413478325">15</xref></sup> It has remained convinced that animals share no aspect of life with other living beings outside of fairly superficial relations such as that of prey/predator, social hierarchy, territorial defense, seduction of a sexual partner or relations between young and adults. Only humans have been credited with authentic sociability, that is to say with a shared life that is not limited to simple functional relations. As for plants or mushrooms, they have always been considered so insignificant that they have rarely been discussed; for most Western thinkers, they simply do not exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0539018413478325">16</xref></sup> And yet it would be a mistake to consider that this expressed simple indifference to nature; traditionally the Western elite has felt a veritable hatred for it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0539018413478325">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0539018413478325">
<title>Hatred of nature</title>
<p>Western culture has always entertained a complicated relationship with nature, which has constantly posed a major problem for its elites. No culture has completely assimilated humans to other animals, but from the time of its origins in Greece, Western culture has gone further than any other in its <italic>hatred</italic> for nature and in its desire radically to declare its independence. Very early on, in effect, Western elites defined humans as opposed to nature, before emptying the latter of all substance, that is of all <italic>intelligence</italic>, and instrumentalizing it as they wished. Even though all peasant societies have perceived wild animals with a suspicion tinged with fear, Westerners have reached summits unattained anywhere else – in fact one could characterize Western culture as a super-peasant culture, a pathologically peasant culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0539018413478325">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greek mythology was already populated with animals, although a myth like that of Prometheus is highly ambivalent in this regard since it expresses the conviction that man is a victim with respect to the other animals and that he therefore has a legitimate score to settle. Greek philosophers, like Aristotle for example, resolutely opposed man to animal, and Christianity accentuated this zoophobic tendency by identifying the body as the animal part of man and making its rejection a moral priority. Despite many eminently positive aspects, Renaissance humanism opened a period especially hostile to animality. Even as it sought to bring all humankind together, it underscored the hygienic barrier separating humans and animals, and made it stricter than ever. Was it really necessary to erect an ideological war machine against animals in order to counter the scandal of human hierarchies? I doubt it. European humanism turned man in upon himself and gave him a monopoly on morality: only humans have a moral sense and only humans are the object of moral attention on the part of other humans. To this way of thinking, man is not an animal that is different; <italic>he is no longer an animal at all.</italic></p>
<p>French Cartesianism sharpened the human/animal opposition by drawing an ontological<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0539018413478325">19</xref></sup> connection between animals and machines. Retrospectively the beast-machine thesis constitutes a disgrace by setting reason <italic>against</italic> living beings and linking the animal to the machine in order to oppose him to man. The detour via the machine lastingly and deeply perverts the question of the status of animals in the West and goes hand in hand with the degradation that is industrial farming and predatory experimentation on animals: why ever should one care about the well-being of machines? The 17th-century French philosopher and priest Malebranche played an important role in this sordid story by denying that animals had feelings, whereas Descartes remained vague. Determining the absence of feeling in animals on the grounds of the distinction between soul and body, he explained in the fourth book of <italic>La Recherche de la Vérité</italic> that, since animals do not sin, they cannot suffer. Having no feelings they therefore lack consciousness. Hence the fundamental correlate of the beast-machine thesis: if the animal is a machine, man can do with it whatever he pleases. For Malebranche, Descartes’ thesis of the beast-machine makes it legitimate to place animals outside the sphere of ethics. Furthermore, the philosopher-priest strengthened his reasoning by coupling this ethical premise with a psychological premise concerning the illusion of the human senses: someone who is moved by an animal’s suffering, he explains, is simply deceived by his senses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0539018413478325">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>When all is said and done, the beast-machine thesis appears to be less the cause than the expression of a perverted relationship to the animal world running through Western history as a whole. We see a truly sadistic dimension in the European relation to animals, which has until now received little study. The massacre and torture of animals are constants singularly minimized in Western history. One of those who have understood this the best is indisputably John Ray, who was a famous naturalist with the 17th-century Royal Society, a much-admired representative of Cambridge’s Platonic school and one of those who enabled Linneaus and Jussieu to establish their classifications of plants and insects. This eminent thinker wrote a book, published in 1691, entitled <italic>Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation</italic>, in which he mounted a fairly harsh attack on a Cartesianism driven by a tyrannical reason that wholly denies the pertinence of feelings. He underscored in particular and with remarkable acumen that, if animals were really machines, they would not be tortured so often and no one would for one minute imagine that they were capable of suffering. Indeed, has anyone ever seen someone be cruel to a machine? John Ray demonstrated very simply the monstrous perversity of Malebranche, who justified cruelty to animals by taking as the premise of his reasoning that which should be its logical conclusion. In effect, it is not because animals are machines that they do not suffer, but because one wants to make them suffer there is every reason to consider them as machines.</p>

<title>Machinization of animals and animalization of artifacts</title>
<p>Over the second half of the 20th century, this same Western culture went through a process that, to my mind, has not received enough attention: having convinced itself that animals were <italic>nothing but</italic> more or less complex machines, and having conceived hybrid installations that reduced animals to cogs in factory farms, it set about developing, with the help of cybernetics, animalized artifacts – in other words machines that not only behaved like animals, but which could be <italic>psychologically</italic> taken for animals. This trend turned out to be correlated with a dynamic that gave this complex neutralization of nature a very particular connotation: global population has massively urbanized, since over half of the world’s population now lives in cities. The classic peasant did not like nature, but the post-peasant urban dweller no longer has any direct knowledge of it at all, which leads him easily and unquestioningly to accept that the artificial nature with which he increasingly deals is in the end more natural than nature itself. This sort of mental self-intoxication is all the more effective when this artificial nature, which is no longer a controlled nature but a substitute nature, can be totally manipulated at will.</p>

<title>Nature 2.0</title>
<p>Nature 2.0 is a peasant’s ultimate dream. This is a highly impoverished view of nature as subordinated, instrumentalized and manipulated. For the peasant, the good kind of nature is not one that acts as a partner in producing multiple meanings and resources with which one is constantly obliged to compromise, but a nature that is submissive and productive. Nature is forcibly enslaved through hybridization, campaigns to eradicate plants and animals that are or are assumed to be noxious, and through ideological, often religious, discourses that grant humans absolute supremacy over other living beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0539018413478325">21</xref></sup> Nature 2.0, which appears at the end of the 20th century, adopts this stance but radicalizes its expression through genetic manipulation, exo-hybridization<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0539018413478325">22</xref></sup> and the creation of wholly artificial ecosystems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0539018413478325">23</xref></sup> This conception of nature forgets that other-than-humans are perhaps not only an opposite but those with which humans share their lives and whose disappearance would <italic>ipso facto</italic> entail that of humans, thus giving way to post-humans who would prefer to share their lives with artifacts rather than with animals or plants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0539018413478325">24</xref></sup> And yet nature is not only a space containing resources and devoid of any value of its own on which humans can draw at will and free of charge; it is a partnership of communities with which humans, to be fully human, must share their lives. Within this perspective, the ecological crisis we are experiencing today is far from being an unexpected consequence of Western technical development; on the contrary: ‘the end of nature’ is the most shocking outcome of an ideology of continual material progress, and to attempt to resolve this crisis without stepping outside Western culture as it has been developing for several centuries is a sheer absurdity, which merely has the pathetic advantage of avoiding what is no doubt one of the fundamental philosophical questions of the 21st century: <italic>how can a culture step outside itself and invent itself anew and differently?</italic> Naturally I do not claim to have an answer to such a question, but I can at least suggest that it cannot do this without radically redefining what it should understand by ‘ecology’. Not to dwell on this point, I will simply say that ‘ecology’ as it is construed in universities today is not the solution to the major crisis humanity is traversing in its relations with nature (whatever one means by the term); it is part and parcel of the problem. In other words, Western culture and its offshoots have managed to put forward as a remedy a poison capable of definitively neutralizing the patient. This is yet one more expression of the deeply perverse and suicidal face of a toxic culture that has managed to bring about the original and improbable marriage of unequalled instrumental reason and an even greater intellectual unreason.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0539018413478325">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>The cultural structures of ecology</title>
<p>The present situation calls for a fairly radical rethinking of what ecology is, refusing the primacy of the biological over the cultural and the highly problematic opposition between a scientific ecology (which would come under biology) and a political ecology (which would come under the social sciences). Ecology cannot be reduced to either. The collapse of biodiversity is as much a cultural tragedy as it is a biological catastrophe, and this extreme crisis is not only the outcome of the material consequences of loss of diversity but also of the consequent cultural withering. To be sure, I am not claiming that biologists are wasting their time taking an interest in ecology; I am instead alerting social scientists to a problem of which they are conscious in only a very marginal and incredibly simplified manner. The destruction of our natural ecosystems means not only the appearance of famines, of uncontrolled and therefore violent population movements, etc., but also a major impoverishment of what it means to be human, and no doubt also of what it means to be an animal.</p>
<p>In this sense, any classical approach to ecology comes up against two major difficulties. The first is, <italic>grosso modo</italic>, reducing ecology to a matter of biochemical regulation. Such a process, which is consistent with Western science-bound ideology,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0539018413478325">26</xref></sup> completely neglects the semiotic, ontological and existential dimensions of ecology, and considers, without the slightest justification, that ecology is a discipline that must always be practiced from a third-person point of view – for example, in the form of general propositions such as ‘Galapagos tortoises are endangered’. The second difficulty is assessing whether all of the actors that should be taken into consideration are effectively considered. This approach becomes problematic as soon as one accepts that ecology should be addressed from the first-person viewpoint or from the second-person viewpoint; that is to say, that a healthy ecosystem ensures not only the elementary survival of its inhabitants but also fulfills their semiotic, psychological and existential needs. Living in an ecosystem is not simply a matter of exchanging energies so as to arrive at an equilibrium, but also of establishing a space of meaning together with <italic>all those beings</italic> with which we share our lives in order to give meaning to life, to find fulfillment and to achieve satisfying psychic balances. In other words, ecology should not be concerned only with survival but also with a fulfilled life, which is necessarily a life shared with other agents. We must break with autistic conceptions of ecology, which still largely prevail. The term autistic may come as a surprise for it is usually reserved for individual mental pathologies. But Western culture has managed to collectivize, if I may be so bold, an individual pathology and turn it into a cultural trait by considering that living beings communicate with each other only on a superficial level; that human beings themselves are incapable of communicating with other living beings not because humans have cognitive problems but because there is no such thing as true communication; and that living beings are driven only by primitive and conflicting interests that vie blindly with each other and where any significant agreement is excluded <italic>a priori</italic>. Even worse, in the culture of Western elites, whoever speaks of communication with any kind of non-human being is regarded as a crackpot. Hence the necessity of developing a first-person (or second-person) ecology as a complement to a more classic third-person ecology.</p>
<sec id="section17-0539018413478325">
<title>First-person ecology</title>
<p>Such a stance would lead us to make a fairly radical change in our conception of ecology, to give up the idea that ecology is only the science of regulating ecosystems and to fully accept that it is also an art of shared living and the (more or less fraught) coexistence of viewpoints and personal perspectives, and that the latter can differ deeply from one to the other.</p>
<p>All of the agents involved in the dynamic of an ecosystem have a point of view with which the others must deal – whatever their ontology. It is not necessary to know what matters to an agent from <italic>the agent’s point of view</italic>, but it is important to realize that the agent has a point of view, and that I will not be able to impose my own unilaterally. On the contrary, I myself will have to make compromises, alliances and pacts with what can rapidly be characterized as other-than-human viewpoints in order to establish my own existence, even if I am also perfectly aware that it is no doubt an illusion to seek in these non-human partners what a psychology as primitive as our own will want to find.</p>
<p>Such a perspective is fairly close to that of the Amazonian Indians described by the Brazilian anthropologist, Viveiros de Castro, and which he generalizes to numerous hunter-gatherer peoples the world over. For these peoples, animals and spirits have their own perception of the world: the animal or the spirit sees itself as human and the others as animals. The difference is thus not between humans and animals, but is relative and depends on the viewpoint of the subject under consideration. Animals thus see in the same way as humans, but what they see is different because their bodies are different.</p>

<sec id="section18-0539018413478325">
<title>Who is part of our ecosystems?</title>
<p>It is not because it is impossible for me to determine all those who might share my existence that I cannot try to do it at least in part. One strong but implicit hypothesis of contemporary scientific ecology is to think that all actors that play a significant role in an ecosystem can immediately be identified by an observer outside the ecosystem, that all these actors belong to a single ontological class (that of biological living beings) and that a biologist is therefore in the best position to draw up an inventory. An anthropologist interested in Western culture will not fail to be intrigued by such a certainty, which is all the more fragile for never having been supported with serious arguments. It is an article of faith and not an empirical or experimental finding, and even less the logical consequence of a rigorous demonstration.</p>
<p>Such a simplistic ecological view is a peculiarity of Western culture and very recent as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0539018413478325">27</xref></sup> In all other cultures,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0539018413478325">28</xref></sup> a very large number of other-than-human agents share humans’ ecosystems, and cannot be assimilated to the natural agents on the lists drawn up by scientific ecologists. Among them we find in particular those disembodied agents that, as an initial approximation, we can call ‘spirits’, a generic term that is most unsatisfactory because it is too vague; we use it here only because we do not have up-to-date intellectual tools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0539018413478325">29</xref></sup> with which to refer to them and to characterize them in a more satisfactory manner. Contrary to a positivist belief widely shared in scientific circles, it is hard to consider that what one has difficulty knowing and, even more, measuring should be held not to exist. Contemporary Western intellectuals are alone in claiming never to encounter these disembodied agents,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0539018413478325">30</xref></sup> and this kind of singularity needs to be argued more seriously than by a vague denial evoking some kind of intellectual immaturity. When, for example, a Japanese person is convinced he shares his territory with <italic>kami</italic>, who must constantly be taken into consideration when acting, these are indisputably part of his ecosystem, and I have no cause to doubt this conviction or its legitimacy, short of adopting a stance that smacks of colonialism (I know better than this Japanese person what is important to him), scientism (nothing exists outside of what science can demonstrate) and ethnocentrism (the Western materialist view of the world is the only right one).</p>
<p>Two positions and only two have, in the end, a minimum of pertinence. First a weak position which considers that the West has no say over what other people believe, but that the West must at least take these beliefs into account in the organization of <italic>their</italic> worlds. For these peoples, an ecosystem includes spirits, and preserving these ecosystems also means these ‘spirits’ must be preserved. And then a strong position, which considers that it is these non-Western peoples who have something to teach us and that to scorn belief in ‘spirits’ is a mistake that has turned out to be costly and which it is time to reconsider. It should be stressed that, in a constructivist perspective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413478325">James, 2003 [1912]</xref>), admitting the reality of ‘spirits’ does not necessarily mean I can prove their existence, in the modern scientific sense of the term, or even that they are ‘real’. Whether or not ‘spirits’ exist is not the question; all that matters is that the peoples concerned believe they exist and act accordingly. The fact that belief in these ‘spirits’ affects my acting is enough to ascribe them reality (which is not the same thing as authenticity) and to take them seriously, at least from an anthropological point of view but also from the standpoint of philosophy. Whatever position we adopt, in the present state of affairs the arrogant attitude of the West toward this subject is a return of neo-colonial attitudes that is all the more shameful for being unacknowledged.</p>

<title>Post-colonial thinking</title>
<p>The present ecological crisis is a cultural problem rooted in the impasse of Western thinking and the deadly ideology bred by it – namely a highly simplistic worldview (based on the idea of a never-ending technological progress free of harmful side effects)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0539018413478325">31</xref></sup> coupled with an instrumental power unequalled in human history, culminating in our nuclear capacity, biotechnologies and cognitive technologies, and in a superiority complex all the more pernicious because it is not easily expressed. Of course Westerners are not the only ones to have adopted practices leading to ecological catastrophe (as a number of authors have shown, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018413478325">Diamond, 2005</xref>), but only Westerners have arrived at a <italic>global</italic> ecological crisis.</p>
<p>One way a Westerner can manage these handicaps is to look a little less condescendingly on different systems of thought, those that on the contrary pay fundamental attention to relations with the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0539018413478325">32</xref></sup> Contemporary Western history is shot through with alternative currents of thought that have always remained in the minority – e.g. panpsychism – but which have never been completely eliminated in spite of the disdain of intellectuals close to the powers that be, repeated attempts at disqualification and marginalization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018413478325">Skrbina, 2005</xref>), and the propensity of academia to mobilize against them.</p>
<p>In this context, an open mind to non-Western ways of thinking is both a political challenge and an intellectual promise. A political challenge because such an approach is awkward for the worldview advocated by intellectuals in power and those who emulate them; an intellectual promise because acknowledging the actual relevance of a system of thought that has in the end preserved all that has been destroyed by several centuries of European positivism and humanism is of inestimable value today. To this must no doubt be added a certain moral satisfaction, that of living at a time when worldviews hitherto scorned by the dominant powers have the distinct possibility of coming into their own.</p>
<p>The recent development of a postcolonial anthropology that calls into question the paternalistic posture of the lordly scientist surveying the beliefs and practices of the peoples he studies lends increased pertinence to worldviews close to the native thought systems some anthropologists are attempting to rehabilitate today. But it is not only a matter of giving the floor to those who have been deprived of the right to speak, as Gayatri Chakravorti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018413478325">Spivak (1987)</xref> so aptly puts it; these <italic>different</italic> (to use the most neutral term possible) voices are found in some of the most technologically advanced cultures, like Japan, as I mentioned above.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From an anthropological point of view, Western culture is an object of curiosity; it is no doubt the first time in the history of humankind that a major culture recognizes only biological agents as existing, denying the importance of non-human agents and refusing to understand that it is in the nature of human existence to share life with other intelligent beings – <italic>whatever they may be</italic>: animals, plants, gods, spirits, etc. – for any purpose other than to derive some material gain. The wake-up call from most biologists who are distressed by the loss of biodiversity because it entails loss of the possibility to find future drugs is characteristic of this point of view. Such ‘intellectual monotheism’, i.e. recognizing a single form of intelligence and worshipping it alone, has dramatic practical consequences that will lead, in the end, to the suicide of humankind and the eradication of most kinds of life on earth. After all, if man is alone, he can do what he wants without consideration of those that do not exist.</p>
<p>One way of changing our way of seeing the world is to address the issue of loss of biodiversity from an unusual semiotic and cultural standpoint, defining ecology as the art of heterogeneous subjectivities sharing life in hybrid communities, rather than seeing it as the study of the distribution of energies in biochemical ecosystems in equilibrium. Such a perspective is resolutely existential and assigns a central role to the sharing of meaning, interests and feelings among heterogeneous agents; the first is a perspective that characterizes the hybrid communities discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018413478325">Lestel (1996a)</xref>, whereas the second is a physical perspective content with energy transfers and balanced equilibriums.</p>
<p>The collapse of biodiversity resulting from the hatred of the animal world cultivated by Western humanism has led to the massive impoverishment of humankind – psychological, intellectual, moral and spiritual. Loss of biodiversity leads to a dramatic narrowing of the semiosphere on earth and entails a problematic drying up of the very substance of humankind, which is woven into the texture of <italic>all</italic> living beings. The problem is that we are not even aware of what we are losing with the collapse of biodiversity because we approach the question with a maimed imagination and as a consequence we have a truncated representation of the role of other living beings in the constitution not of <italic>what</italic> we are but especially of <italic>who</italic> we are. Even worse, our dramatically impoverished imagination is becoming an increasingly pathological imagination that drives us to confuse living beings with poor substitutes that show only the symptoms of being alive instead of having the fundamental psychic properties of life. These illusions are as effective as they are because we have conceived them in order to deceive ourselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0539018413478325">34</xref></sup> From an evolutionist viewpoint, one may therefore wonder if an explosive mixture of intelligence and stupidity might not be the human equivalent of the anatomical features of certain animals that enabled them to adapt for a time before leading to their extinction. Clearly I do not advocate that we reject these artifacts: on the contrary, we must progressively learn to find a place for them within our hybrid communities. But we must take them for what they are (new other-than-human agents with which we must increasingly find a way to work) and not for what they are not (causal equivalents of semiotic living systems).</p>
<p>Defending an ecology that is both non mechanistic and open to non-embodied agents leads to interesting perspectives for the development of what could be a fundamental anthropology of Western culture, palpably different from a symmetrical anthropology that acknowledges the ideas of anthropologists from cultures that were only recently the object of traditional anthropological discourses. From this standpoint, one could say that the increasing Western concern for the animal kingdom is the forerunner of another and deeper upheaval that would lead to rediscovering the full richness of our ecosystems and those non-embodied entities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0539018413478325">35</xref></sup> with which we must learn to live, if indeed we are to live.</p>

He was one of the first to develop the idea that the passage from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic was not a major step toward progress, as most prehistorians parrot, but an absolute catastrophe that led to generalized enslavement, permanent war, the rise of state religions and ecological catastrophe. Nietzsche is still important, however, in particular for his very modern treatment of religion and morality as sophisticated techniques of control.</p>

<p>The position I defend is noticeably different from the spiritualistic approaches to ecology found, for instance, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018413478325">Fox (1995)</xref>, which stress the moral dimension of ecology and make no reference to the problem that engages me here, namely: that our ecological thinking is excessively rooted in contemporary Western culture and does not take into account a large proportion of the agents that make up an ecosystem on the pretext that theirs is not a physical ontology.</p>

<p>This qualification alludes to the thinking of Antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, which possessed an extraordinarily diverse range of concepts for discussing angels, devils, etc. If one does not want to come down on one side or the other, one can always read the remarkable work of Frances Yates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0539018413478325">1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018413478325">1983</xref>) or ER Dodds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018413478325">1952</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018413478325">1965</xref>). The fact that today’s intellectuals are no longer sensitive to the concept shows the extent of the ravages inflicted on Western intellectual and academic circles by a primitive and materialistic ideology.</p>

<p>I introduce this important nuance because an anthropologist of Western culture will quickly realize that a very large proportion of Westerners have encountered such agents. But the majority of intellectuals prefer to make fun of the beliefs of these people, whom they regard as gullible, rather than seriously endeavor to understand what is going on. This is not completely true, however, since the situation turns out to be much more complex for anyone who takes the time to do some serious documentation. The psychiatrist John Edward Mack has done remarkable work on ‘abductees’, the thousands of people who are convinced they have been abducted by aliens. Two important remarks here: first, Mack did not detect any obvious mental disorder in these people of all ages and conditions; second, following these studies, Mack was dragged before an internal disciplinary commission at Harvard, which eventually concluded that they could not find any fault with his work, from either a deontological or a methodological standpoint. Another psychiatrist, Rick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018413478325">Strassman (2001)</xref>, conducted the first research, financed by the Food and Drug Administration, at the University of New Mexico on the effects of DMT (dimethyltriptamine). He writes that a great number of people in the course of this work reported an encounter with beings having a complex ontology.</p>

<p>That these may be incompatible with physics could mean that our physics is not satisfactory, rather than that these beings have no place in our lives. To mindlessly refer to physics in defense of an autistic conception of humanity is not without its dangers: indeed contemporary physics is becoming less and less materialistic in the sense of the positivists of the last century.</p>
