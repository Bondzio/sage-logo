<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In comparison to mass media, the interactive characteristics of online communication make it possible for audience members to take more active roles in information delivery. Furthermore, new audiences can involve themselves in traditional media organisations’ news production. These changes require theoretical reconsiderations and empirical investigations into the societal role of journalists and media institutions as well as audiences’ activities in terms of interaction with journalism and participation in the public sphere. When <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1354856512472608">Splichal (2000</xref>: 48) described the main developmental steps in the history of journalism, he argued that the distinction between journalism and non-journalism became especially delicate in computer-mediated communication, ‘where millions of internet visitors continuously create, recreate and disseminate information’. It is therefore not surprising that scientific attention to such changes has grown intensively in recent years, especially in relation to new online forms of communication and the production of online news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512472608">Meikle and Redden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512472608">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512472608">Singer et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The debates on new communication patterns between journalists and their audiences have been coupled with the concept of interactivity, which has become one of the pillar terms in debates on the future evolution of journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354856512472608">Dahlgren, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512472608">Gitlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>). By exploring the general understanding of interactivity between new editors and organisational circumstances where interactivity as a set of new communication practices is articulated in journalism, this article shifts the attention from the user perspective<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1354856512472608">1</xref>
</sup> to occupational ideology, news production culture and the organisation of news production. These factors are the dominant elements that shape the adoption or non-adoption of interactive technology in respective institutional settings and, accordingly, provide different modes of audience engagement in news production. There are many indications that journalists tend to retain control as primary information deliverers, even when the audience is engaged in news production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512472608">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512472608">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip (2010</xref>) suggests that the degree of media organisations’ control over information delivery, the institutional setting and the hierarchal organisational structure of news production are crucial aspects to consider when exploring interactivity and audience involvement in traditional media organisations’ online media. The aim of this study is to explore to what extent the mentioned dimensions imply the implementation of interactivity to Slovenian online news culture that has gone through many changes in recent years. While most print organisation editors in the late 1990s were reluctant to embrace the emergence of online news delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512472608">Oblak and Petrič, 2005</xref>), journalists themselves are still sharply divided into two opposite camps: one that is more conservative and mostly objects to online news and another that believes moving news and stories online might bring about a closer and more democratic relationship with the audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1354856512472608">Oblak Črnič, 2007</xref>). Besides such internal professional tensions, the news market in Slovenia, as elsewhere in Europe, faces severe reductions in news consumption, especially among younger Internet users. News organisations face difficult challenges finding the proper equilibrium between normative expectations of ‘good’ journalism and demands from the public for personalised versions of news delivery. Research on the transformation of online and traditional news is particularly relevant in the Slovenian media environment, where journalism studies only recently began debating the normative concept of ‘journalism as a public forum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2009</xref>), and where the ‘pseudo-interactive communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2010</xref>) offered by online media limits the transformation of the media’s traditional role as gatekeeper and agenda setter. Following this research over a specific period of time allows this study to test the thesis of whether Slovenian news production culture still develops, with the aim of retaining control over information delivery despite various interactive features provided on news websites.</p>
<p>By adopting two ethnographic methods – news website analysis and in-depth interviews with print and online editors – this article offers a case study of the new websites of three prominent Slovenian print media organisations: Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal. Editors-in-chief of printed newspapers and editors of online editions act as power holders in the organisational structure and continue to be the main actors in decision-making in news production; however, news production has evolved as a continual sequence of processes resulting in traditional top-down management, linear hierarchy and a clear division of labour, all of which the processes of newsroom convergence contest (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512472608">Klinenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512472608">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>). It is therefore important to evaluate how editors-in-chief perceive the ‘new’ or ‘digital’ relationship between audiences and journalists, and how these perceptions relate to decision-making in respective news production settings. To evaluate the relationship between media organisations and the extent of interactivity in online media,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1354856512472608">2</xref>
</sup> the selected research topic requires a more systematic understanding of the notion of interactivity.</p>
<p>Different approaches to interactivity demonstrate the complexity of the notion in journalism studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>). Approaching interactivity primarily as a phenomenon, grounded in articulations between technological and social changes in media and journalism, this article begins with the following research questions:</p>

<p>The aim of the article is not just to present the special conditions of the Slovenian media environment but also to challenge general concerns regarding recent news production culture, especially with respect to two trends: the intensive work overload of online journalists and intriguing search for user-generated content. Although often referred to as ‘old-fashioned’ or as a ‘loose concept’, interactivity plays an important role in a constant battle between distinctive opposing discourses. Interactivity – whether understood as feedback, personal choice, time constraint, financial limit or user input – is always accompanied by financial constraint, norms and editorial decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512472608">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>; Meikle and Redden, 2011). In this context, new online journalism faces the important but far from new challenge of keeping the balance between trends towards citizen journalism and supporting its gatekeeping model.</p>

<sec id="section2-1354856512472608">
<title>Dimensions of interactivity and consequences for online media</title>
<p>From the beginning of Internet research, interactivity in scientific discourse was considered an implied feature of computer-mediated communication. Following the history of Internet studies, we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354856512472608">Jensen (2002</xref>: 184) that the frequent use of the term narrowed its exact meaning. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1354856512472608">Rafaeli (1988</xref>: 10) remarked over 20 years ago, ‘Interactivity is a widely used concept, which is not properly defined. It’s a highly relevant term, in relation to which there has been made no consensus as to what it actually means’. This lack of common understanding demands a delineation of different approaches to interactivity and an evaluation of what kind of typology to apply to the analysis of online journalism.</p>
<p>Since the early 1990s, several studies on computer-mediated communication have given much credit to computer-mediated communication’s implied potential for interaction building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856512472608">Rafaeli and Sudweeks, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1354856512472608">Walther, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1354856512472608">Rafaeli and Sudweeks (1998</xref>) investigated the degree of interaction between participants in computer-mediated newsgroups by analysing interactivity as the dependency among sent messages in threads. Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512472608">Heeter (1989</xref>) identified interactivity in a more complex way and differentiated six dimensions of interactivity: complexity of choice available, effort users must exert, responsiveness to the user, monitoring information use, ease of adding information and facilitation of interpersonal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856512472608">Kenney et al., 1999</xref>). Following this structure, most empirically driven studies try to explore the differences in the degree of interactivity between news websites by showing the trends, limitations and availability of interactive potentials.</p>
<p>The notion of interactivity is also an important concept for changes in journalism since it implies the possibility of a more direct connection between media producers and audiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512472608">Deuze, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512472608">Domingo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1354856512472608">Meikle and Redden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512472608">Nip, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512472608">Singer et al., 2011</xref>; Thurman and Hermida, 2008). From this perspective, interactivity enables website users to become actively involved in journalistic practices through direct contact with journalists or through engagement with discussion forums or commentary sites provided on news websites. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354856512472608">Deuze (1999</xref>: 377–379), these kinds of responses are part of the most relevant distinctions between ‘new’ online media and ‘old’ mass media as they radically transform the established cultural characteristics of journalism. When applied to new online media forms, however, the understanding of interactivity is very specific. Further, although interactivity is a very popular concept for reflections on online journalism, it is not always clear which dimensions of effects are in question when focusing on interactivity in online media.</p>
<sec id="section3-1354856512472608">
<title>Interactivity as a form of audience engagement</title>
<p>Previous empirical research on the use of interactive potentials in online media (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1354856512472608">Heeter, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354856512472608">Kenney et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354856512472608">McMillan and Downes, 1998</xref>) focused primarily on interactivity as a user–medium relationship. Such research focused on the technological dimension of online media and only vaguely explored its social dimension. Interactivity is not just a question of the technical implementation of specific interactive mechanisms – it also has implications for the effects of communication aims and preferences on the side of news producers. Recent debates conceptualise interactivity primarily as a new form of audience participation in online journalism. At the same time, research reveals that traditional media organisations are continuously embracing new technological features to speed up and rationalise their online news production by offering content that attracts a heterogeneous audience and increases the number of unique users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512472608">Dahlgren, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512472608">Klinenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856512472608">Singer, 2004</xref>). While concentrating on productivity, efficiency and profitability, online media organisations put less effort into realising the democratic potential of the web (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354856512472608">Tunney and Monaghan, 2010</xref>). Even with audience participation, journalists tend to retain control over published content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512472608">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512472608">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The question therefore remains to what extent news websites provide interactive features for audiences and how are these features articulated in the production of websites’ respective online news? The answer to this question varies because of the complex understandings of what interactivity as a potential computer-mediated communication means, how it is conceptualised and how it is measured. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512472608">Domingo (2008</xref>: 685–689) sticks to the concept of interactivity, ‘as it is the common token in professional discourses’, to refer to the development of different levels of audience participation in online journalism: content customisation refers to the digital management of news that makes it technically possible to filter content based on the preferences of each user. Audience feedback turns readers and viewers into commentators, critics and collaborators. The audience can also be the ‘eyes of the journalist’, uncovering hot new topics and submitting first-hand accounts, photos and videos to enhance a story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512472608">Domingo, 2008</xref>: 687). Citizens’ debate in online news brings to the public arena discussions that are often restricted to family and friends. Such debates can create solid virtual communities around news websites, increasing user loyalty and the audience’s knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512472608">Domingo, 2008</xref>: 687). Citizen journalism, the fourth level of audience interactivity, refers to the idea that users can be part of the news production process in the form of blogs and citizen stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354856512472608">Domingo, 2008</xref>: 687). Domingo’s conceptualisation of interactivity resembles the groundwork of Nip’s (2006) distinction between traditional, interactive, public, participatory and citizen journalism that was later redeveloped into a continuum of several modes of audience connection in news production, based on the degree of organisational control of outside involvement in the news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1354856512472608">
<title>Interactivity and gatekeeping: In coalition with or in opposition to organisational control?</title>
<p>Many scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856512472608">Allan and Thorsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512472608">Bruns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512472608">Singer et al., 2011</xref>) agree that consolidation of interactive communication in news moves power away from journalists as gatekeepers over to the ‘people formerly known as the audience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1354856512472608">Rosen, 2006</xref>). At the same time, these scholars clarify that editors and journalists tend to retain different degrees of control in making news with increasing audience engagement in news. In the debate of whether interactivity in journalism is in coalition with or in opposition to organisational control in news making, interactive communication presents a challenge to traditional gatekeeping, calling for further examination of the new regimes of control.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are strong indications that the media world’s gatekeeping model is being subjected to transformation. The audience is not only assuming a more active role as an entity of assemblers, editors and even creators of their own news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1354856512472608">Project for Excellence in Journalism, 2006</xref>) but is also ‘gate watching’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512472608">Bruns, 2009</xref>), that is, observing media output gates to identify important material as it becomes available. In this context, the debate on public journalism as a new path towards revitalisation of contemporary journalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354856512472608">Allan and Thorsen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354856512472608">Bowman and Willis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512472608">Nip, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856512472608">Rosenberry and St. John III, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512472608">Singer et al., 2011</xref>) is again reopened. What these studies have in common is a vision of journalists, not necessarily working for traditional media organisations, who operate as catalysts between individuals and the community, identifying problems and finding solutions through deliberation. On the other hand, theoretical and empirical examinations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512472608">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1354856512472608">Singer et al., 2011</xref>) have found that editors and journalists try to hold onto the role of traditional gatekeepers and to retain substantial organisational control in news making. In this light, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856512472608">Deuze et al. (2007</xref>: 335) argue that communitarian ideals do not go well with notions that journalists should keep their distance – ‘notions that tend to exclude, rather than include’. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512472608">Domingo et al. (2008</xref>) stress that despite the opportunity for readers to debate current events, the principles and practices of news making in traditional media organisations (in Europe and United States) remain mostly unchanged. Because journalists are universally convinced that the division between users and producers of news provides society with better information, traditional media organisations do not engage non-press news providers on equal footing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Interactivity as a challenge for news production culture</title>
<p>For more than a decade now, the Web has challenged news production culture as a set of unwritten rules, tacit norms and common values that define how news is produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512472608">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512472608">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354856512472608">Thurman and Lupton, 2008</xref>). According to these studies, media organisations have been keener to embrace new technologies due to declining newspaper readership and television news viewership by following trends in the contemporary news industry worldwide, such as cross-media mergers and newsroom convergence processes that have blurred the distinct practices and identities of newsrooms, news workers and news outlets, whether print, broadcast or online. According to a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1354856512472608">Project for Excellence in Journalism report (2009)</xref>, the majority of interviewed journalists believed that the Internet was ‘changing the values of journalism’ and a considerable majority of the journalists stressed that journalism was ‘headed in the wrong direction’.</p>
<p>A cross-section of theoretical reconsiderations and empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354856512472608">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; Paterson and Domingo, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512472608">Klinenberg, 2005</xref>) suggests that cultural aspects of news production have been altered to increase the productivity, efficiency and profitability of convergent media organisations, mainly as follows:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>advocating multi-skilling and multi-tasking, that is, gathering, selecting, producing and disseminating content via several media platforms;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>speeding up the news production process and tightening deadlines in the almost round-the-clock news cycle;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>challenging journalistic practices of newspaper, radio, television and online journalistic culture; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>increasing the rate of monitoring other media and mimicking their content.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These alterations are especially the case in the online news production teams of established media organisations, where continuous newsroom reorganisations and news work alterations influence journalistic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512472608">García Avilés and Carvajal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354856512472608">Klinenberg, 2005</xref>). According to the aforementioned authors, because they are required to continuously produce news throughout their daily shifts, online journalists work under more intense time pressures than their counterparts in print and broadcast do. Where the goals of productivity, efficiency and profitability have pushed traditional journalistic values even further to the margins, online journalists hardly leave their computers or work spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354856512472608">Dahlgren, 2009b</xref>: 229). This situation has led some authors to suggest that journalists nowadays increasingly resemble computer-bound ‘mouse keepers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1354856512472608">Preston, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, because of pressure for immediacy and frequency, online journalists are forced to rationalise the news production, which in recent years has transformed from the ‘shovelware’ of reproducing the content of in-house print and broadcast colleagues to predominantly ‘recycling’ contents from press agencies and other media news to such an extent that ‘original’ news production has almost been put on hold. At the same time, the interactive character of online communication is neglected – not in terms of technical adoption of interactive features but rather in its social and cultural articulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354856512472608">Tunney and Monaghan, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology and case subjects</title>
<p>To tackle the set research questions, this study adopted a case study approach that was previously used to explore online news production cultures and its wider implications in journalism as a cultural practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354856512472608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354856512472608">Domingo and Paterson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354856512472608">García Avilés and Carvajal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1354856512472608">Paterson and Domingo, 2008</xref>). The aim of the case study was to create a precise description and reconstruction of the case, revealing the relationship between the case and broader societal structures and processes, and to establish a reliable theoretical and empirical link between the phenomenon and its context. The study focused on three case subjects to study the discourses and practices of interactivity in Slovenian print media organisations’ news production culture. Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal are three of the largest print media organisations in Slovenia, based on readership of their daily print newspapers (Slovenian Advertising <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1354856512472608">Chamber, 2010a</xref>) as well as the number of unique visitors to their news websites and share of 76.4% of visits to online editions of Slovenian printed newspapers (Slovenian Advertising <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1354856512472608">Chamber, 2010b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1354856512472608">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the last 2 years, all three organisations began convergence of their work environments in terms of space, staff and content, making all three chosen organisations attractive case subjects in terms of articulations between journalism, technology and culture.</p>
<p>To analyse the interactive potentials of Delo’s, Dnevnik’s and Žurnal’s news websites, an ethnographic content analysis was conducted, which was earlier used in researching news formats and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354856512472608">Altheide, 1987</xref>). As general news portals, Delo.si, Dnevnik.si and Žurnal24.si provided particular online news items yet relied on primary print production; they were therefore also regarded as ‘extensions’ of printed newspapers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1354856512472608">Oblak and Petrič, 2005</xref>). These news websites mostly based their original production on monitoring and mimicking competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2010</xref>) and hardly went beyond articulations between text and photos in their multimedia formatting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2011</xref>). Credibility seemed to remain an obstacle for all three online print versions: according to a recent study, journalists did not consider the sites as credible as their print editions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512472608">Poler Kovačič et al., 2010</xref>). In comparison to quantitative-oriented content analysis, this ethnographic method referred to an integrated technique for locating, identifying, retrieving and analysing documents for their significance. The meaning of a message is assumed to be reflected in various modes of information exchange, rhythm, form and style. In July 2009, news websites were analysed with emphasis on their use of interactive features, where the types of interactive features and their roles on individual websites were identified.</p>
<p>To explore the main factors that determined the ambivalent outcomes found in the first stage of analysis, in-depth expert interviews were conducted with three editors-in-chief of printed newspapers as well as three editors of the newspapers’ online versions at Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal24. Similar interviews were used in prior research on news production culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354856512472608">Dupagne and Garrison, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1354856512472608">Rosenberry and St. John III, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1354856512472608">Singer, 2004</xref>). The editors selected were at the top of their respective hierarchal structures and possessed most of the news production decision-making power in their respective news production settings. The interviews were conducted during July and August 2009. The in-depth interviews revealed the editors’ perspectives on interactivity and the various ways the practitioners gave meaning to their work. Four strategies were used to interview the editors: conversational entry, general prompting, specific prompting and ad hoc questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354856512472608">Flick, 2006</xref>: 161). This interview method was selected to gather data on the informants’ perceptions beyond their official declarations, thereby generating a spectrum of different editorial discourses on interactivity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The results of the ethnographic content analysis of the three news websites and in-depth interviews with the print and online editors showed that Slovenian traditional print media organisations had started to deal with issues connected to the notion of interactivity in recent years, yet news production culture had not embraced interactivity as a set of necessary practices. In this context, the study revealed that Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal were highly ambivalent towards incorporating interactive practices in their news production, suggesting that Slovenian print media organisations approached interactivity more through its technical dimensions than as a continuous social adaptation. The results in the next sections fall into two separate dimensions: first, the study discloses ambivalence between technical and social interactivity, which is assessed through Domingo’s (2008) typology of interactivity; and second, the study analyses editorial discourses on interactivity, which include somewhat stretched economic needs, utilisation of user content and protection of traditional gatekeeping roles.</p>
<p>The results should be viewed within specific media and cultural contexts. Slovenian journalism underwent profound transformations since the collapse of ‘self-managed socialism’; rapid changes to the relationship between communication and media occurred in the last two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1354856512472608">Splichal, 1994</xref>). Uneasiness is still a prevailing characteristic of contemporary Slovenian journalism: it lacks a sense of stability, affords no reassurance and acts awkwardly towards the prospect of further social, cultural and technological changes in journalism. In this sense, Slovenian online journalism more or less reflects relations between journalists and audiences from the mass media world, where traditional media news is still regarded as more credible than that of news websites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1354856512472608">Poler Kovačič et al., 2010</xref>). This strong preference for traditional media is also reflected in media audiences, which mostly prefer traditional domestic media genres to online news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1354856512472608">Oblak, 2012</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the leading news websites according to number of unique visitors and clicks were those of traditional media organisations, especially of two main TV stations; among those, Delo.si, Dnevnik.si and Žurnal24.si were the most read online editions of printed dailies in Slovenia (Slovenian Advertising Chamber, 2010a).</p>
<sec id="section8-1354856512472608">
<title>The ambivalence between technical and social interactivity</title>
<p>The results of the ethnographic content analysis revealed that all three news websites offered users the ability to personalise their news consumption and provide content for online media. The three news websites offered their content via RSS feeds and email newsletters. Additionally, users could follow and customise their news consumption through iGoogle and Facebook. The process of personalisation had thus taken a new step in a purely technical sense in the Slovenian online market. The news websites incorporated opinion polls, interactive games, quizzes, star grading of journalistic content and a users’ comments section; yet, the analysis revealed a slight decline in the diversity of interactive features available on respective news websites in comparison to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2010</xref>). For instance, none of the websites analysed in this study offered the opportunity to engage in online forums. Delo.si closed down its blog section and journalists at Žurnal24.si were no longer updating their respective blogs; only Dnevnik.si maintained a blog that was collectively produced by members of the online news team.</p>
<p>At the same time, by applying Domingo’s (2008) typology of interactivity, the results demonstrated that, on the level of content customisation, users of all three websites were able to filter their content according to their own preferences. Moreover, readers could expand their news consumption to other media platforms, such as mobile phones and other handheld devices. In terms of audience feedback, the users’ comments sections and the star grading of journalistic content gave users the role of up-to-date commentators, critics and collaborators and created an opportunity for users to participate in debate with journalists and other users. These functions transformed users from passive receptors of news into more active users; however, citizens’ debate was hardly realised as most online forums for these websites that were present in the past were closed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512472608">Oblak, 2005</xref>). If users wanted to engage with the news, they could, for instance, write comments in sections entitled ‘Say what you think’ on Dnevnik.si. Nevertheless, the motivation for a news production site to stimulate a communitarian ideology via online interactive features – where users are connected with their wider community – was scarce. In terms of citizen journalism, users engaged in producing their own news, despite the fact only one online journal integrated users’ blogs (Žurnal24.si). Dnevnik.si usually published users’ news in a separate section, ‘Your news’, but Dnvenik.si did not publish any news without editorial approval; furthermore, Dnvenik.si rarely used content gathered here to enhance stories packaged by online journalists. In contrast, Žurnal24.si took user content to build cover stories and even paid for photographs published in print and videos transmitted online.</p>
<p>In sum, an array of facilitated possibilities existed that converged practices of consuming and producing, thus engaging users as ‘produsers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354856512472608">Bruns, 2009</xref>) or ‘prosumers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354856512472608">Jenkins, 2006</xref>). Users’ interactive integration in these websites, however, was only ‘an add-on’, giving users the ability to personalise and customise news consumption and to communicate interpersonally among themselves with hardly any deliberative outcomes. In terms of Nip’s (2010) modes of audience engagement in the production of news, citizen response within the comments sections was common for the analysed websites. Guided citizen submission and guided professional reporting were realised only in one news portal – Žurnal24.si – where journalists guided members of the audience to send content related to a certain topic. Citizen submission with content initiated by the audience alone was only at one website – in Dnevnik.si’s ‘Your News’ section. Despite these interactive features, the content produced by the users ‘enjoys a secondary status’ as it was posted in the users’ sections, separate from the other news, or repackaged by teams of journalists.</p>

<title>Editorial discourses on interactivity: Between economic needs and utilisation of user content</title>
<p>On the basis of the interviews, four common reasons for incorporating interactive features in respective news websites were identified:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>strengthening loyalty of users and building a closer relationship with them;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>receiving users’ feedback and disclosing lack in argumentation or mistakes made by journalists in their published content;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>receiving ‘personalised content’ (in text, photos, and/or video formats) that might be included in news items; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>building a future ‘net of users’ by providing an additional information channel on a daily basis.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Different obstacles were encountered in relation to these stimulating factors, consequently producing different faces of interactivity in news production and making interactivity a very ‘loose concept’ without a single understanding.</p>
<p>When asked about how they understood interactivity, editors appeared to hardly operate with the term. Interactivity meant a lot of different things. Within Žurnal, interactivity referred to interactions and user-generated content: ‘For us, content generated by users is not just an important information channel, but also a strategic one. We should develop it even further. You get two things at once: entertainment content and important stories at national and local level’ (Žurnal editor A, interview). Žurnal’s online department further integrated this understanding as ‘having contact with the world outside. It is something very vivid. Not for a dialogue, but something which communicates, and we get a response to it’ (Žurnal editor B, interview).</p>
<p>The same ‘vividness’ was mentioned at Delo, ‘Interactivity … I see moving pictures, video content; something vivid, more than just a text’. While this view is based more on the technical dimensions of interactivity, interactivity for the same editor was also ‘related to challenging people to send their own records. So, it is about creating the media from the audience’ (Delo editor A, interview). Here, interactivity implies a set of techniques as a union of print and online news. ‘Interactivity is something where web and print get merged. It’s the usage of printing techniques on the internet and usage of web techniques in print’ (Delo editor B, interview).</p>
<p>Only Dnevnik seemed to have a different understanding of interactivity, ‘We talk about interactivity a lot; this feedback information, which we receive in our house, is very important. We check it regularly’ (Dnevnik editor A, interview). Judging from the statements given by Dnevnik’s print editor, however, interactivity was not understood so narrowly companywide. On the contrary, connecting interactivity to Brecht’s idea of radio as an interactive medium and to the concept of ancient agora as an example of a public forum, Dnevnik’s print editor saw interactivity as ‘a great ideal’ (Dnevnik editor B, interview).</p>
<p>The following sections elaborate four distinctive editorial discourses on interactivity that analytically frame the tensions related to the unclear definition of what interactivity means in journalistic work:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>interactivity as a feedback;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>interactivity as a personal choice;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>interactivity as a problem of time; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>interactivity as a user</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Interactivity in news production culture remains on a rather complex continuum: a journalist’s personal choice becomes a problem of time and a wish for dialogue becomes a tendency for collecting and publishing user content. In this context, the interviews disclosed that a superior and mostly profit orientation prevailed, particularly among editors working for print outlets. Here, social adaptations of interactivity had foremost an economic character, and the need for constant online news production without deadlines and absence of a stable economic model for online media constrained interactivity. Following such needs, online news media incorporated interactive features and even utilised user content for further news work, but they generally neglected the communicative dimension of interactivity that would, in perspective, evolve into a more prominent change in the relationship between journalists and audiences.</p>
<sec id="section10-1354856512472608">
<title>Interactivity as a feedback: ‘No money, no moderation’</title>
<p>Despite the fact that editors stressed how users’ comments were ‘full of xenophobia and hate speech’ (Delo editor B, interview), they were aware that newsrooms were responsible for every published opinion on their websites. In this respect, it is surprising that the studied online media had no system for moderating users’ content. Instead, they practiced ad hoc moderation due to lack of financial resources. ‘The problem cannot be solved technologically, only manually. We had moderators, but we lost them in the financial crisis. Now everybody, journalists, editors, and other workers moderate content when they find time’ (Delo editor A, interview). This situation was similarly acknowledged at Dnevnik and Žurnal. ‘We do not have moderators, not even proofreaders, due to financial difficulties. Now, daily editors do the job, but not always successfully’ (Dnevnik editor A, interview). ‘Each and everyone in the newsroom is a moderator. We do not have special people hired for that. Not yet’ (Žurnal editor B, interview). Interviewees, however, agreed that a priori moderation – moderating all users’ content before its first publication – would improve the situation, but they feared the negative consequences, such as the ‘big financial burden’, ‘dissatisfied users who want their messages to be published right away’ and ‘losing the battle for users with other news websites’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1354856512472608">
<title>Interactivity as a personal choice: ‘A robocop journalist’</title>
<p>When discussing future visions of the journalist’s role, interactivity was hardly mentioned as a set of expected practices. Rather, interactivity was perceived as journalistic ‘individual choice’. Although some of the journalists used social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, they believed that nurturing interactive relationships with the audience was not their duty. ‘It is up to them. We are not against it. It is actually good to communicate with readers. But we are not forcing anybody. Some like it; some don’t’ (Žurnal editor A, interview). Dnevnik, however, explicitly suggested that ‘uniforming such communication’ was possible.</p>
<p>However, this is a question of systematisation of work and journalists’ contracts. When you want to change decades-long rules in traditional media organisation, this brings up administrative issues – and financial consequences as well. I don’t have the mandate to implement two-way communication as a duty of journalists, neither does the print editor-in-chief (Dnevnik editor A, interview).</p>
<p>At the same time, Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal started a newsroom convergence process, bringing print and online journalists together and stimulating their cooperation and coordination. According to previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2009</xref>), goals behind such projects are similar: optimising journalistic resources, speeding up the news production process and increasing cooperation among editorial teams. In Dnevnik, where such convergence was in its early stages, the plan was to raise ‘robocop journalists’. ‘Journalists have to be universal: to know all the platforms and to be responsive. We have to adapt to the market’ (Dnevnik editor A, interview). However, the media organisations did not perceive multi-skilled journalists who gather information for multiple media platforms as the ultimate transformation. Instead, the organisations saw multi-skilling as something optional: ‘We do not want to pressure older journalists who are good at what they do. But, when hiring new journalists, handling a camera and editing video for example will be pre-conditioned’ (Delo editor B, interview). A similar stance was adopted at Žurnal, ‘The concept of everybody doing everything is on a slippery floor; we have to be careful that print and online do not end up too similar. Homogenization is one of the biggest dangers of convergence’ (Žurnal editor A, interview).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1354856512472608">
<title>Interactivity as a problem of time: ‘Time pressure without deadlines’</title>
<p>Interviewees indicated constant time pressure, derived from news work without deadlines, as the main reason for limited interactive contact with users. Journalists were occupied with continuous news production and there was a shortage of journalists to do the work: ‘We do not have a big enough workforce. Online journalists simply do not have time for two-way communication. Tempo makes it impossible. Frequently, they even do not have time to go through the article, which they just finished writing’ (Delo editor A, interview). However, the editors expressed that journalists regard distinctive interactive features with different importance – they tend to respond to emails and content in special user-generated sections if users identified themselves with names. In addition, the interviewees said that users’ comments sometimes ‘bring a lot of pain’ to journalists who find it hard to respond to messages that are ‘low’ and ‘negative’ (Žurnal editor B, interview).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the interviewed editors agreed that a lack of motivation among journalists to communicate with users in the comments sections derived from the fact that most of the comments were ‘salad’ and ‘ballast’ (Delo editor B, interview). ‘We can easily throw 90 percent of all users’ comments away. Only a very small share of them is useful and gives a new perspective. This happens also to me. Useful responses help you to identify your flaws over time. For some it is painful, but in the long run it raises the quality level of journalism’ (Delo editor B, interview).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1354856512472608">
<title>‘Interactivity is the user’: The power of user-generated content</title>
<p>It appeared that the editors’ future goal for online media was to strengthen user-generated content processes, especially by encouraging users to send photos and video on a daily basis. ‘Our plan is to start the project Your Delo. We would like to receive foremost videos from our users, dealing with topics they are familiar with. Textual information or photos would be published online and also in the print edition every week or month’ (Delo editor A, interview). Dnevnik had a similar vision, ‘We want more photos from the users. This is very selfish. But, if somebody makes a good photo, we are very interested in publishing it. In particular, if it is free. However, we would also pay for it’ (Dnevnik editor B, interview). Every published photo or video sent by users was already paid for by Žurnal. ‘We want to stimulate younger users in a sense: “We are prepared to pay for your social responsibility”’ (Žurnal editor B, interview).</p>
<p>Moreover, Žurnal wanted to build a ‘network of citizen journalists’ (Žurnal editor B, interview), gathering information from their local communities, producing news items of human interest and receiving multimedia products through different interactive features. ‘They could only be half-products. We want to make users alert to the world around them. A lot of important events and issues are hidden, but members of local communities are familiar with them. And it would be good to share these stories with us’ (Žurnal editor B, interview).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Investigations of the relationship between news production culture and interactivity in Slovenian online journalism suggest there is a gap between technological incorporation of interactive features on Slovenian news websites and the realisation of interactivity as a new set of practices in newsrooms. It is not surprising that Slovenian online news production is characterised as ‘pre-interactive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>). Namely, the normative concept of ‘journalism as a public forum’ was only recently embedded in journalism education and journalistic self-imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2009</xref>). Instead, commodification of news has become a prevailing concept in the Slovenian media environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1354856512472608">Splichal, 2005</xref>). Goals of productivity, efficiency and profitability have pushed traditional journalistic values further to the margins, resulting in instrumentalised news work. Online journalists work in shifts; they are required to continuously produce up-to-date news and fulfil the news production norm by the end of the day. In such a hectic work environment without deadlines, online journalists are forced to use in-house, other media and press agency content as primary sources of information, making their work mostly computer bound. In this sense, ideology of immediacy ignores the idea of the Web as a creative environment, neglecting the possibilities of thorough interactive communication and co-production of knowledge.</p>
<p>Online news is mostly a contrast to the deliberative notion of Web environment thus, it is flashy, short and decontextualised and does not involve users as citizens to create a big difference in journalistic routines. In this sense, the technological functioning of interactive features alone on news websites does not create a space for dialogical interconnection. On the contrary, interactivity seems to be a fulfilled reality only in its technical sense, changing itself into a potential for receiving additional workforce in the form of user-generated, primarily visual content in the form of videos, photos or other imagery. As a phenomenon that would empower communication between audiences and media, interactivity seems bound to face more obstacles. In the near future, the studied online media channels plan to include the audience in the production of stories and encourage audiences to report from their local communities in multimedia formats. Such strategies come close to the ‘second phase of the public journalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512472608">Nip, 2006</xref>), creating the illusion of engaging citizens in the deliberation process, identifying the problems of the community and searching for consensual solutions. Overall, however, journalists tend to embrace new technological possibilities only if they can enhance status and prestige, allowing them to do their jobs as they did before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 157). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1354856512472608">Tunney and Monaghan (2010</xref>) suggest, Internet users are active in posting comments and sending stories to online media, but they get relatively little response from journalists, editors and other news workers, indicating a media world of ‘pre-interactivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>). Such narrowing focus on the societal dynamics might be devastating for the character of people’s interconnection in late-modern contingencies and the complexities of ‘multi-epistemic order’ (Dahlgren, 2009), where it becomes generally accepted that all storytelling is situated, all perspectives are contingent and all is ‘cultural chaos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1354856512472608">McNair, 2009</xref>) – that is, unpredictability and instability dominate the information environment, rather than control and order. Hence, if mimicry in high-modern journalism persists and expands, dilemmas of participation and democracy will be deep indeed – not only online.</p>
<p>In this sense, this study indicates how ambivalent recent online news media are towards the idea of bringing users closer to the news production process. This ‘pseudo-interactive communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2010</xref>), also identified in previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354856512472608">Deuze et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354856512472608">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354856512472608">Fortunati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354856512472608">Hermida and Thurman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512472608">Poler Kovačič and Erjavec, 2008</xref>), limits transformation of the traditional journalists’ gatekeeping role. It denies communitarian ideas of changing the audience into interactive citizens who could dynamically enter news production – either to deliberate with journalists or to suggest solutions to communal problems. Namely, this study shows that tacit rules, norms and values in newsroom production culture have hardly changed as editors still retain organisational control in news making. As a consequence, traditional media journalism tries to remain an authoritative voice in online news relay as well, as shown in previous research in Slovenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1354856512472608">Oblak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1354856512472608">Poler Kovačič and Erjavec, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1354856512472608">Vobič, 2010</xref>). Considering the question of gatekeeping, there has been only a small shift in the role of journalists – not in terms of changes in the regime of control over news publication but rather in traditional media’s adjustments to journalists–audience power relations so that the gatekeeping regime does not change.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is a bit surprising that, even in the era of the Internet and digital television, the interviewed Slovenian print and online editors did not relate to the ideas of communitarianism more, which in journalism presupposes greater cooperation between journalists and audiences in news making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1354856512472608">Nip, 2010</xref>), and might, according to some, revitalise journalism by re-establishing concepts such as public, community and civic journalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1354856512472608">Nip, 2006</xref>). Communitarian approaches to journalism imply that journalists act as catalysts between individuals and communities and act to identify and resolve existing problems of a community. This study shows that Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal editors do not regard transformative communitarianism as an ideal, let alone a principle of online news work. With this absence, this study argues that Slovenian online journalists reproduce paradoxes of classical journalism, which, by ‘objectively’ mediating reality, reproduces established power relations in society and brings ‘partiality’ instead of the promised ‘impartiality’ in its representations (Splichal, 1999: 299–300).</p>
<p>The issues reconsidered in this article reached the top in the last few years, when the crisis of journalism as a cultural practice interlinked with the recent global financial and economic crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354856512472608">Gitlin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1354856512472608">Monaghan and Tunney, 2010</xref>). In this context, journalism is ‘coming to an end’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354856512472608">Deuze, 2007</xref>: 141) and ‘classical journalism’ is ‘waning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354856512472608">Dahlgren, 2009a</xref>: 148) due to the prevailing business logic of media organisations, negative popularisation of news content, fragmentation of the audience and self-referential nature of news production that becomes increasingly detached from citizens and societal processes. Declining newspaper readership and television news viewership result in media organisations’ eagerness to embrace new technologies and incorporate them in journalistic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1354856512472608">Thurman and Lupton, 2008</xref>). A gradual process of newsroom convergence in print media organisations means implementing the cooperation, collaboration and combination of technologies, and converging staff and space between formerly distinct editorials. These dynamics have already started to affect news production culture at Delo, Dnevnik and Žurnal, without challenging the existing articulations between interactivity, organisational control and news production culture.</p>

<p>The notion of ‘user’ seems to generalise different ways of possible reception of online media platforms, which include texts, video, photo, radio and even TV viewing. Although the term itself sounds technical and denotes a more appropriate notion of ‘audience’ in media studies, ‘user’ is used in this text in a very general way; it includes every Internet user who surfs news websites, regardless of his or her motives, levels of attention and time of usage.</p>

<p>The authors distinguish two common but still different phenomena in the online context: news websites and online media. With respect to the first term, we refer to the concrete websites that produce and distribute news to different Web audiences. The concept of online media is used in a much broader sense, as it includes not only the ‘results’ of news production but also the structure of online media as a news organisation and its production culture, values, traditions and practices.</p>
