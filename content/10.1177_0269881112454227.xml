<abstract>
<p>This study analyzed repeated methylphenidate (MPH) administration and its effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens of male and female adolescent rats. In Experiment 1, rats were administered intraperitoneal (ip) saline, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg dose of MPH every second day from postnatal day (P)33–P49. Locomotor activity was analyzed for 10 min after each administration. Results revealed that the 1 mg/kg dose of MPH produced locomotor suppression, however, the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH produced locomotor sensitization and robust behavioral activation in females as compared to males. In Experiment 2, animals were administered ip saline or the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH using an identical regimen but a 30 min behavioral test was employed. Dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens tissue was assayed for BDNF at P50. Females demonstrated sensitization to MPH and increased locomotor activation compared to males. Interestingly, females given MPH demonstrated a significant 42% decrease of striatal BDNF whereas males administered MPH demonstrated a significant 50.4% increase of striatal BDNF compared to controls. There were no effects on accumbal BDNF. This report demonstrates robust sex differences in the behavioral response, but sex-dependent changes in striatal BDNF in response to MPH in adolescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Methylphenidate (MPH) is a psychostimulant that is used clinically for the treatment of narcolepsy and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112454227">Dupont et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112454227">Klein-Schwartz and McGrath, 2003</xref>). According to recent reports by National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Monitoring the Future survey from the University of Michigan, MPH is also abused: approximately 3.8% of high school seniors and 2.1% college-aged individuals admit to abusing this drug within the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112454227">Parran and Jasinski, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269881112454227">Volkow and Swanson, 2003</xref>). Methylphenidate use has increased markedly over the past several years. According to current estimates, approximately 5–9% of school-aged children are receiving stimulant drugs for the treatment of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112454227">Mayes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112454227">Polanczyk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269881112454227">Wilens et al., 2008</xref>), and MPH is a first line treatment, accounting for the majority of prescriptions written for the treatment of this disorder in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112454227">Goldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112454227">Kimko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0269881112454227">Zito et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0269881112454227">Zito, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, it is now estimated that a significant proportion of these children taking MPH may not actually have ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112454227">Mayes et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The therapeutic action of MPH is believed to be due to its ability to bind and block the dopamine transporter (DAT) and to a lesser extent, the norepinephrine transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112454227">Schweri et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881112454227">Solanto, 1998</xref>). Much attention has been given to the MPH blockade of the DAT, as it has been hypothesized that the phasic dopamine neuronal response to a cue that predicts reinforcement is reduced in amplitude to the point of being ineffective in ADHD, and that MPH normalizes this response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112454227">Scheres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112454227">Tripp and Wickens, 2009</xref>). However, given the fact that MPH increases synaptic dopamine through blockade of the DAT, the neuropharmacological profile of MPH is similar to cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269881112454227">Volkow et al., 1999</xref>) and legitimate concerns about the abuse liability of MPH have been raised, although it is known that MPH abuse in the context of clinical use is quite limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112454227">Parran and Jasinski, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the past work analyzing the effects of MPH on the brain and behavior has used males as subjects. This is sensible, based on findings that have shown ADHD is 2–9 fold more prevalent in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112454227">Dafny and Yang, 2006</xref>). However, although there have been data to suggest females with ADHD may be more severely affected than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112454227">Biederman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112454227">Ernst et al., 1994</xref>), other studies suggest that gender differences are slight. For example, adolescent girls have shown slightly lower self-efficacy and coping strategies, as well as slightly higher levels of anxiety and depression as compared to adolescent boys, whereas aggression appears lower in ADHD adolescent girls (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881112454227">Rucklidge, 2010</xref>). Regarding psychostimulant research, it has been established that females typically demonstrate a higher level of sensitivity to the behavioral activating effects of the drug, as well as a higher dopaminergic response in the nucleus accumbens and striatum in response to the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112454227">Booze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112454227">Castner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112454227">Dow-Edwards, 2010</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112454227">Becker, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there have been relatively few studies to analyze sex differences in the response to MPH. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0269881112454227">Wooters et al. (2006)</xref> have shown that adult female rats demonstrated increased conditioned hyperactivity to a 3 mg or 10 mg/kg dose of MPH as compared to adult male rats. Relevant to the developmental effects of MPH, one study has reported that juvenile (20 days of age) exposure to MPH (2 mg/kg) twice daily for 15 days resulted in aversions to cocaine-paired environments in young males, but this effect was the opposite in females. In fact, juvenile exposure to MPH enhanced place preferences for cocaine-paired environments in female adolescent rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112454227">Brenhouse et al., 2009</xref>). There appear to be sex differences in particular behavioral responses to MPH, but the neurochemical basis has yet to be delineated.</p>
<p>It has been established that repeated exposure to psychostimulants produces behavioral sensitization, which is sensitization by an augmented locomotor response to a subsequent psychostimulant challenge injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112454227">Pierce and Kalivas, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, in adolescent rats, studies have shown a lack of sensitization to MPH. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112454227">Kucenski and Segal (2002)</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0269881112454227">Yang et al. (2006)</xref> have reported a failure of locomotor sensitization to doses of MPH ranging from 0.6 mg to 10 mg/kg but only males were used as subjects. However, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112454227">Chelaru et al. (2012)</xref> reported sex differences in MPH sensitization in adolescent rats, with females demonstrating sensitization to 2.5 mg/kg using a daily dosing regimen, whereas males failed to demonstrate sensitization to this same dose.</p>
<p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is in the neurotrophin family, and is known to play a primary role in cell differentiation and synaptic maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112454227">Bibel and Barde, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112454227">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</xref>). BDNF is located throughout the central nervous system, and changes in BDNF and other neurotrophins have been implicated in substance abuse and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112454227">Bolaños and Nestler, 2004</xref>). For example, increases in BDNF have been shown to enhance sensitization to cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112454227">Horger et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, MPH has been shown to decrease hippocampal and cortical BDNF mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112454227">Banerjee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112454227">Scherer et al., 2010</xref>). Regarding dopaminergic brain areas, one study has reported that a 1 mg/kg dose of MPH from postnatal (P)29 to P42 increased BDNF mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, but decreased BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112454227">Fumagalli et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112454227">Chase et al. (2007)</xref> showed that MPH (2 and 10 mg/kg) given for 14 days from P25–P38 or acutely at P38 did not affect BDNF expression in the striatum, hypothalamus, or prefrontal cortex. Likewise, more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0269881112454227">Warren et al. (2011)</xref> reported no effect on BDNF mRNA in the ventral tegmental area after MPH administration (2 mg/kg) from P20–P34. There are no studies to date that have analyzed sex differences in effects of MPH on accumbal or striatal BDNF protein.</p>
<p>The focus of Experiment 1 in the present study was to analyze a dose-response profile of MPH on locomotor sensitization in adolescent male and female rats. A second experiment was performed in which the daily time period of behavioral testing was extended, and the nucleus accumbens and striatum were assayed for BDNF protein levels after the highest dose of MPH of the dose-response curve of Experiment 1 was administered (5 mg/kg). The hypothesis tested was that females will demonstrate a dose-dependent enhanced locomotor response to MPH as compared to males, which will be echoed by an increase in striatal and accumbal BDNF protein as compared to controls.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 10 untimed pregnant females were ordered from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) and their offspring were used as subjects. Animals were weaned from the female dam at P21 and socially housed 2–3 per cage. Only one male and one female per litter were assigned to each drug condition to control for within litter variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112454227">Holson and Pearce, 1992</xref>). A total of 60 males and 58 females were used in this experiment. All animals were housed in an Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) accredited facility with food and water available ad libitum, and all animals were maintained on a 12:12 on/off light/dark cycle. All behavioral testing occurred during the light cycle. All procedures in both experiments were approved by the East Tennessee State University Committee on Animal Care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112454227">
<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>The locomotor arena was a square wooden box which measured 30 cm on each side. All behavioral testing was recorded using an automated computer program (Any Maze, Stoelting, Wood Dale, Illinois, USA). The computer program superimposes a grid of lines on the arena, and every instance the animal crosses each of these lines is counted as an activity count. Horizontal activity was recorded as the number of intersections each animal made with a line on this grid during the behavioral testing period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881112454227">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The day of birth was counted as P0 and all rats were raised to P30 when behavioral testing begun. All animals were habituated to the locomotor arena, 10 min a day for three consecutive days from P30–P32. For habituation, animals were administered intraperitoneal (ip) saline 10 min before being placed into the arena and locomotor activity was recorded as horizontal activity counts using Any Maze software. Adolescent drug treatment began on P33, and rats received ip saline or a 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg dose of MPH. Adolescence in a rat has been defined elsewhere and the age range varies from P28 to P60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112454227">Smith et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112454227">Spear et al., 2000</xref>). The age range of dosing here corresponds to early to mid-adolescence according to past studies. The choice of the 1 mg/kg dose was based on findings showing that this dose is equivalent to a clinically relevant dose for the treatment of ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112454227">Berridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112454227">Deviliss and Berridge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112454227">Klein-Schwartz and McGrath, 2003</xref>) whereas the 3 mg and 5 mg/kg dose may be more representative of an abused dose. This supposition is based on clinical work stating that participants often crush pills and inhale or snort them, thus, this may be representative of an abused dose although this has yet to be completely verified in the clinical literature. As with habituation, a 10 min behavioral testing period was used and activity counts recorded. Rats were administered MPH or saline every other day beginning on P33 for a total of nine exposures, with the last MPH or saline administration given on P49. The rationale for using an every second day drug treatment and testing methodology follows the paradigm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112454227">Pierce and Kalivas (1997)</xref>, and this dosing regimen has been traditionally used with psychostimulants. However, as compared to other psychostimulants, plasma clearance for MPH is relatively rapid. There were two further reasons contributing to the choice of using this type of dosing regimen. First, traditionally, dosing every other day has been used with most other psychostimulants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112454227">Robinson and Becker, 1986</xref>) and we wished this data to be compared to past studies using a similar dosing method. Second, the data gleaned from this study should be translatable to recreational use of MPH, and initial recreational dosing is often separated in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112454227">Gawin, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112454227">Griffiths et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112454227">
<title>Research design and statistical analysis</title>
<p>For both Experiments 1 and 2, there were three independent variables: sex (male, female), adolescent drug treatment, and day of testing. For Experiment 1, adolescent drug treatment had four levels: saline, 1, 3, or 5 mg/kg MPH. For Experiment 2, the adolescent drug treatment factor had two levels: saline and 5 mg/kg MPH. For both experiments, activity count was the dependent variable and analyzed at days 1, 5, and 9 of drug treatment, although animals were identically tested on all nine days of drug treatment. The rationale for using these three days of testing for analysis was that this provided an initial, middle, and late sampling of activity counts during drug treatment, as well as simplifying the analysis. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to initially analyze group differences for both experiments, and the Bonferroni test was used for all post hoc analyses (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Follow up two-way ANOVAs were used to analyze group differences when males and females were analyzed separately. Also, a one-way ANOVA was used to analyze whether each group demonstrated an increase in activity over days of drug treatment. Animals were tested at the same time each day, between 0900 and 1200 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881112454227">
<title>Initial behavioral analysis</title>
<p>An initial analysis of the average activity counts for the three days of habituation revealed no significant main effects or interactions. For sensitization, a 2 (sex) x 3 (day of testing) x 4 (adolescent drug treatment) three-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects of sex (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=52.11, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), adolescent drug treatment (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=140.09, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), and day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=9.23, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.004), as well as significant two-way interactions of sex x day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=14.34, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and adolescent drug treatment x day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=4.83, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005), and finally, a significant three-way interaction of sex x adolescent drug treatment x day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(1,50)=13.48, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Post hoc analysis of this initial ANOVA will focus solely on effects where sex differences were found to be significant. The clear robust group difference was that females administered the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH demonstrated a significantly higher number of activity counts on each day of drug treatment compared to all other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112454227">Figures 1(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112454227">1(b)</xref>). In addition, females given the 1 mg/kg dose of MPH demonstrated decreased locomotor activity relative to males given the 5 mg/kg MPH and saline controls across all three days. Females given the 3 mg/kg dose of MPH demonstrated a significant decrease in activity relative to males administered the 5 mg/kg of MPH at Day 1, and males given 3 mg/kg of MPH demonstrated significantly lower activity counts than control females given saline at Day 1. Also of interest, female saline controls were equal to males given 5 mg/kg MPH throughout testing. These data show that there are drastic sex differences in sensitization to MPH that are dose-dependent. Based on the number of significant interactions involving sex as a factor and the number of group differences, we decided to analyze males and females separately below.</p>

<p>Adolescent females are presented with locomotor activity counts as a function of drug group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269881112454227">Figure 1(a)</xref>. A 2 x 3 ANOVA revealed significant main effects of adolescent drug treatment (<italic>F</italic>(3,25)=296.09, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(2,25)=13.63, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), and a significant interaction of adolescent drug treatment x day of testing (<italic>F</italic>(6,25)=12.79, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Females given 5 mg/kg MPH demonstrated a significant increase in activity relative to all other groups throughout testing.

Also, females given 1 mg/kg MPH demonstrated a significant decrease in activity compared to saline controls throughout testing. Finally, a one-way ANOVA was conducted for each group to determine whether there was an increase in activity counts across days. Although not significant for females given 1 mg or 3 mg/kg MPH, a significant main effect of day of testing appeared in females given 5 mg/kg MPH (<italic>F</italic>(2,10)=16.37, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). A Bonferroni post hoc test revealed a significant increase in this group from Days 1 to 5, as well as Days 1 to 9, although Days 5 and 9 did not significantly differ. Thus, it appears that adolescent females administered a 5 mg/kg dose of MPH are demonstrating rapid locomotor sensitization in the first five days of drug treatment which subsequently does not increase after further dosing.</p>

<sec id="section11-0269881112454227">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>A total of 10 untimed pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were ordered from Harlan Inc (Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) and their offspring were used as subjects, with one male and one female assigned to each drug condition per litter. However, in this experiment, only one dose of MPH was analyzed (5 mg/kg). A total of 20 males and 19 females were used in this experiment, and other animals in these litters were used in other experiments in our laboratory. Animals were housed identically as described in Experiment 1.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269881112454227">
<title>Research design and procedure</title>
<p>The research design in Experiment 2 was very similar to Experiment 1, with sex, adolescent drug treatment, and day of treatment as the three factors, and Days 1, 5, and 9 served as the three days that were analyzed. The behavioral procedure was identical to Experiment 1, with the exception that rats received either saline or a 5 mg/kg dose of MPH and each sensitization trial testing was 30 min in length. Rats were administered MPH or saline every other day for a total of nine exposures, with the last MPH or saline administration on P49. The rationale for using a 30 min trial was to more thoroughly analyze the change in behavioral response to this higher dose. In addition to the overall analysis of the 30 min trial on Days 1, 5, and 9 of drug treatment, we analyzed Days 3, 6, and 9 of in three separate 10 min periods to ascertain the change in behavioral response to the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH over the 30 min period. Days 3 and 6 were chosen for these analyses in contrast to Days 1 and 5 of treatment to provide a more complete profile of the behavioral response to MPH.</p>

<title>BDNF Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) procedure</title>
<p>Twenty-four hours after the last saline or MPH injection, animals were rapidly decapitated. The brains were immediately frozen with isopentane and were then stored in a −80°C freezer. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and striatum (Str) were dissected from whole brains and stored at −80°C. In brief, 250 μL of a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) cell lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) plus protease and phosphatase inhibitors (P5726, P8340, P0044, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) was added to each tissue sample. Brain regions were homogenized on ice with 10 passes of a Teflon pestle homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatants were removed and stored at −80°C until used. All samples were analyzed according to manufacturer’s instructions using a BDNF sandwich ELISA kit purchased from Promega (Kit G7610, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). For the BDNF assay, anti-BDNF monoclonal antibody (mAb) was added to a carbonate coating buffer (pH 9.7, per specifications included with the Promega protocol for BDNF), and 100 μL of the coating buffer was added to each well of a 96-well polystyrene ELISA plate (MaxiSorb, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, New York, USA) and incubated overnight at 4°C. All wells were washed using a TBST wash buffer, incubated at room temperature for one hour, and nonspecific binding was blocked through adding Block and Sample 1× buffer to each well and incubated at room temperature for one hour. The BDNF standard curve was prepared using the BDNF standard supplied from the manufacturer (1 μg/mL). The standard was diluted in Block and Sample 1× buffer to achieve a concentration range of 0 to 500 pg/mL. Tissue samples were further diluted 1:2 before being assayed. The standards and samples were incubated with shaking at room temperature for two hours. Anti-Human BDNF pAB was then added to each well plate, incubated at room temperature (two hours), which was followed by incubation (one hour) with Anti-IgY horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate. Visualization was achieved by adding TMB One Solution to each well followed by an incubation period of 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 1N hydrochloric acid to each well and plates were read within 30 min. Optical density was measured using a Bio-Tek ELx 800 microplate reader (Winooski, Vermont, USA).</p>

Bonferroni post hoc analyses revealed that on Day 1 of drug treatment, males and females given 5 mg/kg MPH were equivalent but demonstrated significantly higher activity counts than male and female saline controls. At Days 5 and 9 of drug treatment, females administered 5 mg/kg MPH were significantly greater in activity than all other groups, and males given 5 mg/kg MPH were greater than male and female saline controls. As in Experiment 1, a one-way ANOVA was conducted for each group to determine whether there was an increase in activity counts across days within each group. As in Experiment 1, although the main effect of day of testing was not significant for male and female saline controls as well males administered 5 mg/kg MPH, a significant main effect of day of testing was revealed for females given 5 mg/kg MPH (<italic>F</italic>(2,9)=5.54, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.013). Activity counts in this group significantly increased from Day 1 to 5, but there was a significant decrease in activity from Day 5 to 9, and activity counts on Day 9 did not significantly differ from Day 1. Thus, there appears to be a change in behavioral responding in females when tested for longer periods that begins to emerge after sub-chronic treatment with the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH. As in Experiment 1 with the 10 min behavioral test, only adolescent females given the highest dose of MPH (5 mg/kg) demonstrated sensitization to MPH from Days 1 to 5 of treatment.</p>

<p>A final analysis was performed on Days 3, 6, and 9 of drug treatment to analyze the change in locomotor activity over each 30 min trial. We chose these three days to obtain a slightly different sampling of behavioral performance as compared to previous analyses. Each day of behavioral testing (3, 6, and 9) is presented in activity counts as a function of drug treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881112454227">Figure 3</xref> for adolescent males and females.

Post hoc analyses also revealed that females administered 5 mg/kg MPH did not demonstrate a significant decrease in activity over the three time periods on each of the three days analyzed. However, males given 5 mg/kg MPH as well as male and female saline controls all demonstrated a significant decrease in activity over all three time periods analyzed, presumably due to metabolism of MPH and habituation to the context. This result appears to show a sex difference in sensitivity to the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH, and the increased sensitivity to the activating effects of this dose of MPH in females is persistent for at least 40 min after drug administration.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present results demonstrate a robust sex difference in the behavioral and neurochemical response to MPH. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the lowest dose (1 mg/kg), which has been shown to be a clinically relevant dose of MPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112454227">Berridge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112454227">Devilbiss and Berridge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112454227">Klein-Schwartz and McGrath, 2003</xref>), produced locomotor suppression in both males and females, whereas the 3 mg/kg dose of MPH resulted in an increase of activity after sub-chronic dosing in females, but not in males. The behavioral results with the 5 mg/kg of MPH revealed that females demonstrated an increased acute response compared to males as well as sensitization during the first five days of MPH treatment, which interestingly, did not further increase by the final day of treatment. Males did not demonstrate sensitization to any dose of MPH. This result was somewhat echoed in Experiment 2 which was a longer behavioral test as compared to Experiment 1 (30 min vs 10 min). Adolescent females demonstrated sensitization from Days 1 to 5, however, there was a decrease in activity from Days 5 to 9. In addition, females did not demonstrate an increased response to acute dosing of 5 mg/kg MPH as compared to males as they did in Experiment 1, however, animals were tested for a longer period in Experiment 2. It is also important to point out that the females’ lack of change or decrease in activity in response to the 5 mg/kg MPH from Days 5 to 9 may be due to focused stereotyped behaviors (e. g. grooming, sniffing, paw treading) that may preclude locomotor activation, and this may have been manifested as a decrease in activity during the longer behavioral test in Experiment 2. The behavioral scanning system used was not able to detect this type of behavioral stereotypy. Regardless, it appears that these behavioral results indicate a much higher sensitivity to the behavioral activating effects of MPH in females in terms of induction of locomotor sensitization. An analysis of the 30 min behavioral test in Experiment 2 revealed that females demonstrated a persistent increase in activity in response to 5 mg/kg MPH during the entire 30 min test, however, males given 5 mg/kg MPH as well as males and females given saline demonstrated a significant decrease in activity during the 30 min test. This finding may be related to an interaction of both sex and dose in MPH pharmacokinetics, MPH metabolism, or differences in the dopamine system in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112454227">Andersen and Teicher, 2000</xref>). Finally, the striatal BDNF response to the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH was sex-dependent, in that males demonstrated a significant 50.2% increase in BDNF in response to MPH relative to controls, whereas females demonstrated a significant 42% decrease in this same brain area. With the known role of BDNF in cell differentiation and synaptic maintenance, this is an especially important finding relative to the sex differences in the response to MPH in adolescence.</p>
<p>Importantly, these data must also be interpreted with caution, as an ip route of administration was used. One past study has shown that locomotion in response to a 5 mg/kg dose of MPH was greatly exaggerated in comparison to an oral administration of this same dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112454227">Gerasimov et al., 2000</xref>). This past study demonstrated that ip administration has been shown to be twice as potent as oral administration in terms of increasing extracellular dopamine in the brain, as was demonstrated through higher uptake of MPH as compared to when taken intragastrically. On the other hand, it is also important to understand that MPH may be taken through different routes of administration. In fact, past work has shown that when MPH is abused, approximately 75% of abusers administer MPH through inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112454227">Bright, 2008</xref>) which avoids first pass metabolism of the liver before entering the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112454227">Grilly and Salamone, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Behavioral findings here are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112454227">Chelaru et al. (2012)</xref> who reported a robust sex difference in the locomotor response to both 2.5 mg and 10 mg/kg MPH on the horizontal activity count measure in response to acute dosing at P40. However, after 11 consecutive days of treatment, females demonstrated sensitization to the 2.5 mg/kg MPH dose whereas there was no sensitization to the higher 10 mg/kg MPH dose, although females demonstrated an enhanced locomotor response as compared to males. Consistent with the current results, males also failed to demonstrate sensitization to any dose of MPH. Thus, although there were some important methodological differences between these two studies, including different ages of animals used when behavioral testing commenced (P33 vs P40), and daily vs every second day dosing, it appears that there are robust sex differences in the behavioral response to MPH that may follow an upside-down U-shaped curve. It appears that females sensitize MPH doses within a specified range, as higher doses do not appear to produce a similar effect. This could also reflect age-dependent characteristics in response to MPH, because adult males have been shown to sensitize over a range of doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112454227">Browne and Segal, 1977</xref>) whereas adolescent males did not sensitize to MPH in the current study, or in the recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112454227">Chelaru et al. (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the effects observed here may be entirely due to sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of MPH. For example, if metabolism of MPH is more rapid in males and thus accompanied by a shorter half-life, then males would demonstrate lower peak concentrations as compared to females, and this could account for lower levels of activity in males as we observed in Experiment 1 and a more rapid decrease in behavioral activation in males as we observed in Experiment 2 in the 30 min test. Although there have not been any studies to analyze sex differences in MPH pharmacokinetics in adolescence, cocaine has been analyzed in adult rats and females demonstrated greater levels of norcocaine in the brain compared to males given an identical treatment regimen, which may help to explain higher levels of behavioral activation to cocaine in females compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112454227">Festa et al., 2004</xref>) as norcocaine is a metabolite that stimulates behavioral activation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112454227">Schuelke et al., 1996</xref>). These results may suggest that there are sex differences in pharmacokinetics of compounds that have a mechanism that is similar to cocaine, such as MPH. However, with no data on sex differences in MPH pharmacokinetics in adolescent rats, and the results observed here, this will be a focus of future studies.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation for the sex differences observed could be in the development of the dopamine system through adolescence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112454227">Andersen and Teicher (2000)</xref> have shown that males demonstrate significantly lower levels of striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptors compared to females at P25, but significantly higher levels of striatal D<sub>2</sub> receptors by P40 which subsequently drop to equivalent levels to females by early adulthood at P60. In addition, males demonstrate higher levels of accumbal D<sub>1</sub> receptors compared to females throughout early postweaning and adolescent periods, and a robust increase in D<sub>1</sub> receptors in the striatum at P40. Thus, there appears to be sexually dimorphic development of the dopamine receptor system in adolescent striatum. Andersen and colleagues have further shown this is not related to hormonal production in males or females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112454227">Andersen et al., 2002</xref>). We have shown in a recent study that acute treatment with either eticlopride, a D2-like antagonist, or nafadotride, a D3 receptor antagonist, had no effect on locomotor activity in males at P33, whereas both drugs given at identical doses produced a decrease in locomotor activity in females tested at the same age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112454227">Sheppard et al., 2009</xref>). These results suggest a possible difference in dopamine D2-like receptor sensitivity at this age. Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0269881112454227">Walker et al. (2000)</xref> have shown that females demonstrate increased dopamine release and increased maximal velocity of dopamine uptake in response to electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle as compared to males in the striatum. A suggested explanation for this result was greater dopamine neuron terminal density in the female dorsal striatum. Studies have also shown an overall increase in the number of dopamine transporters in both the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112454227">Harrod et al., 2004</xref>) and substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112454227">Rivest et al., 1995</xref>) in females as compared to males, although at this point, this has only been shown in adult rats. Our hypothesis is that females may have a baseline increased dopaminergic tone, based on the increased number of dopamine transporters in females as compared to males, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112454227">Harrod et al. (2004)</xref>. If this is the case, then blockade of the dopamine transporter by MPH in females may result in an increased dopaminergic response and, thus, an increased behavioral response.</p>
<p>Regarding the BDNF results, the current report revealed a significant increase in striatal BDNF of adolescent males administered the 5 mg/kg dose of MPH, whereas females demonstrated a significant decrease of striatal BDNF in response to this same dose. The effects of MPH on BDNF have been mixed, and appear to be dose and brain-area dependent. Thus far, there have been four studies to analyze the effects of MPH on neurotrophins in preclinical models, and all used male animals as subjects. Most relevant to the present study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112454227">Fumagalli et al. (2010)</xref> utilized a 1 mg/kg dose of MPH given twice daily from P29–P42 and, after an 18 hour washout, results showed that BDNF mRNA was increased in the nucleus accumbens and striatum but BDNF expression was significantly decreased in prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, we did not report any effects on BDNF protein in the nucleus accumbens which is contrary to mRNA results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112454227">Fumagalli et al. (2010)</xref>, and a higher dose (5 mg/kg vs 1 mg/kg) and protein levels were analyzed in the present study in a slightly older animal. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112454227">Chase et al. (2007)</xref> showed that MPH (2 mg and 10 mg/kg) did not produce any effect on BDNF expression in the striatum, hypothalamus, or prefrontal cortex when given for 14 days from P25–P38 or acutely at P38, and BDNF expression was analyzed 1, 3, 6, or 24 hour after the final injection. Integrating present results, the data from the 5 mg/kg MPH dosing of males was consistent with striatal data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112454227">Fumagalli et al. (2010)</xref> but inconsistent with accumbal data from this same study. Undoubtedly, age of the animal, dose of MPH, and treatment regimen are all critical factors relative to the effects of MPH on BDNF and brain plasticity in general.</p>
<p>Much of the past work with BDNF and drugs of addiction has focused on cocaine, which obviously has a similar mechanism of action as MPH. When given exogenously into the nucleus accumbens or ventral tegmental area, BDNF has been shown to enhance sensitization or conditioned responding to cocaine, and BDNF knockout mice demonstrated attenuated sensitization to cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112454227">Horger et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, repeated administration of BDNF antiserum into the nucleus accumbens during chronic cocaine self-administration attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112454227">McGinty et al., 2010</xref>). BDNF has been shown to maintain cocaine self-administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112454227">Graham et al., 2007</xref>) and increase during cocaine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112454227">Filip et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112454227">Grimm et al., 2003</xref>). There have not been any studies to reveal sex differences in the interaction of BDNF with cocaine or any other psychostimulants, although a study from our laboratory has shown that sub-chronic nicotine administration in adulthood resulted in a significant decrease of BDNF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112454227">Brown et al., 2006</xref>) whereas other past studies have shown nicotine to increase BDNF in these same brain areas of male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112454227">Kenny et al., 2000</xref>). These results would suggest that sex differences interact with psychostimulants and that the effect on neurotrophins may be sex-dependent.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study reveals robust and important sex differences in both the behavioral and BDNF response to MPH in adolescence. Importantly, this study used normal rats and not a rodent ADHD model so results from the highest dose employed here (5 mg/kg) may be better applied to recreational use of MPH, whereas results using lower dosing in Experiment 1 (especially 1 mg/kg, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112454227">Berridge et al., 2006</xref>) may be more translatable towards a population misdiagnosed with ADHD. These results point to the importance of sex differences in the behavioral and neurotrophic factor response to MPH in brain areas that mediate drug reward. Future studies are aimed at discovering underlying mechanisms of the results reported here, especially focusing on the interaction of MPH with dopamine and plasticity proteins of the reward system of the brain.</p>
