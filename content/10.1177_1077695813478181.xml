<abstract>
<p>This study used the Students’ Attitudes toward Statistics Scale (STATS) to measure attitude toward statistics among a national sample of advertising students. A factor analysis revealed four underlying factors make up the attitude toward statistics construct—<italic>Interest &amp; Future Applicability, Confidence, Statistical Tools</italic>, and <italic>Initiative</italic>. Advertising students’ attitudes toward statistics were shown to be more positive than negative. Students in this study were most positive about the use of Statistical Tools and displayed attitudes well above neutral on Interest &amp; Future Applicability and Initiative. Confidence received the lowest evaluation. Advertising students who were drawn to the major because of its creative aspects had significantly weaker attitudes toward statistics than did those who came to study advertising because of the business aspects. Strategies for improving negative attitudes toward statistics in advertising courses are discussed.</p>

<p>In 1980, an advertising media-planning instructor wrote a short article for <italic>Journalism Educator</italic> in which he lamented the “math problem” among advertising students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695813478181">1</xref></sup> The professor pointed to “weak backgrounds in mathematics, coupled with a fundamental aversion to anything associated with numbers” as factors contributing to the trauma advertising students encounter when they enroll in the advertising media planning course. Decades later, professors report the math problem still exists among advertising students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695813478181">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advertising coursework in media planning, research, and campaigns requires the ability to perform simple mathematical calculations and apply statistical concepts; therefore, most advertising degree programs require a basic statistics course for all majors, usually taken outside the department. Advertising curricula reflect the needs of both academe and industry. A survey of advertising media directors revealed professionals believe students should have a mastery of basic math, percentages, and index numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695813478181">3</xref></sup> In another study, advertising account managers indicated that the job requires “analytical skills, math abilities, and a comfort with all kinds of data.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695813478181">4</xref></sup> Some believe that basic math and statistics mastery may be more relevant now as the advertising industry has become increasingly dependent on research and consumer analytics to satisfy return-on-investment pressures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695813478181">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The math problem then is this: most advertising students are required to take some math and particularly a statistics course during their college years mostly because the demands of the industry require basic analytical ability, but according to their professors, advertising students suffer from varying degrees of “quantiphobia.” This article therefore attempts to identify levels of student anxiety by measuring attitudes toward statistics among a large national sample of advertising students.</p>

<title>Attitude toward Statistics and Statistics Anxiety</title>
<p>In this study, the dependent variable under examination is <italic>attitude toward statistics</italic>. There is a subtle yet important distinction between math and statistics. Statistics is a subset of mathematics. The definition of mathematics is the systematic treatment of magnitude, relationships between figures and forms, and relations between quantities expressed symbolically; and mathematical procedures, operations, or properties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695813478181">6</xref></sup> The <italic>Business Dictionary</italic> defines statistics as a branch of mathematics concerned with collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of numerical facts, for drawing inferences on the basis of their quantifiable likelihood (probability).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695813478181">7</xref></sup> <italic>Attitude toward statistics</italic> has been defined broadly as a multidimensional construct pertaining to the favorable or unfavorable feelings toward statistics and statistics learning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695813478181">8</xref></sup> Attitude toward statistics measures levels of statistics anxiety, which has been described as a situation-specific anxiety about taking a statistics course and understanding statistical concepts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695813478181">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Statistics anxiety and math anxiety are different constructs, although they are closely related. A relationship between math experience and attitudes toward statistics has been found in numerous studies,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695813478181">10</xref></sup> but they are not the same. Both students <italic>and researchers</italic> have confused statistics anxiety and math anxiety and/or have used them interchangeably, perhaps because both constructs involve the use of numbers and are commonly taught in math departments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695813478181">11</xref></sup> According to some researchers, the cognitive processes involved in statistics go beyond the ability to calculate numbers and are more closely related to verbal reasoning than to mathematical reasoning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695813478181">12</xref></sup> Mastering statistics emphasizes more logical skills than math skills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695813478181">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Understanding student attitudes toward statistics is important as it may influence the learning process, students’ ability to apply the concepts outside the classroom, and their willingness to enroll in future statistics courses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695813478181">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Measuring Attitudes toward Statistics</title>
<p>The reform movement in statistics education in the past few decades, largely driven by new technology, has changed the way statistics is being taught at all levels and brought more research attention to measuring student attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695813478181">15</xref></sup> Numerous instruments exist for measuring attitude toward statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695813478181">16</xref></sup> Bendig and Hughes constructed a scale to measure student attitudes toward a statistics course and found that attitudes, in part, determine student achievement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695813478181">17</xref></sup> Roberts and Bilderback administered the Statistics Attitude Survey to graduate students taking an introductory statistics course and found it to be a good predictor of statistics grades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695813478181">18</xref></sup> Wise developed the Attitude Toward Statistics instrument, which contained two subscales—Attitude toward the Course and Attitude toward the Field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695813478181">19</xref></sup> The Survey of Attitudes Toward Statistics was developed by Schau, Stevens, Dauphinee, and Del Vecchio,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695813478181">20</xref></sup> and it has been used, reanalyzed, and adapted in numerous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1077695813478181">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sutarso developed the instrument used in this study to measure students’ attitudes toward statistics, which he labeled the Students’ Attitudes toward Statistics Scale (STATS), for the purpose of identifying the underlying dimensions of the construct.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1077695813478181">22</xref></sup> The original STATS scale consisted of twenty-four items (alpha = .82). Sutarso used a sample of education and business students in developing the instrument and, after dropping the three weakest items, found it to have strong reliability and validity, with an alpha reliability coefficient of .86. Using factor analysis, he later identified six underlying factors: (1) students’ interest and future applicability, (2) relationship and impact of the instructor, (3) attitudes toward statistical tools, (4) self-confidence, (5) parental influence, and (6) initiative and extra effort in learning statistics. The STATS instrument was chosen for this study to provide consistency with earlier studies of advertising students’ attitudes toward statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1077695813478181">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695813478181">
<title>Related Variables</title>
<p>In a separate study using STATS, Sutarso found that students’ anxiety in learning statistics was related to variables such as student achievement, preknowledge of statistics, and current class level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1077695813478181">24</xref></sup> No relationship was found between attitudes and other variables such as gender and ethnicity. In an earlier study, anxieties about math, mathematics achievement, and previous math experience were related to performance in introductory statistics, while age, gender and academic major were not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695813478181">25</xref></sup> Roberts and Saxe found men to be more positive about statistics than women, but found no relationship between attitude toward statistics and other variables such as birth order, age, or year in school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695813478181">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recently, Mills reported that student attitudes in introductory statistics courses may be more positive than older studies had suggested; however, variables such as mathematics ability, statistics experience, and student confidence continued to relate to attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695813478181">27</xref></sup> Evans found significant relationships between attitude and achievement both before and after the course, but did not find a change in attitudes after taking the course, or more positive attitudes than expected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695813478181">28</xref></sup> Scott tested the ability of the STATS instrument to predict success in an introductory statistics course. The study revealed that the number of math classes taken, elapsed time since the last math class, and grade in the last math class were better predictors of performance than were attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695813478181">29</xref></sup> Baloğlu investigated differences in statistics anxiety in terms of age and gender. Older students were found to have higher anxiety than younger students, but to better appreciate the usefulness of statistics. The study found no gender differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695813478181">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Gender differences and attitudes toward statistics have been studied with mixed results. In a study of education majors, gender was not significantly related to attitudes toward statistics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695813478181">31</xref></sup> Bradley and Wygant found that while women had more anxiety about taking a statistics course, they performed as well as the men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695813478181">32</xref></sup> In a study of an introductory to statistics course, men were less likely to say they were scared of statistics and more confident in their ability to learn statistics and master the material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695813478181">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>Attitude toward Statistics among Advertising Students</title>
<p>Accrediting bodies acknowledge the importance of statistical competency for students. Students in advertising programs accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications are expected “to apply basic numerical and statistical concepts.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695813478181">34</xref></sup> While a listing of required courses for all advertising programs in the United States is not available, in an unpublished national survey conducted for the American Advertising Federation, 88 percent of advertising students reported being required to take at least one math course to earn their degree, and 61 percent indicated that a statistics course was required.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695813478181">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Attitude toward statistics studies generally have been conducted with students in introductory statistics courses. Some studies have measured attitudes among business students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695813478181">36</xref></sup> but fewer with advertising students specifically. Advertising students may have increased anxiety toward statistics because, as researchers noted, “students are drawn to marketing by a desire to use their creative or persuasive ability and seldom define themselves in terms of numeracy skills.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695813478181">37</xref></sup> The same could be said of advertising students. In a survey of advertising majors, a majority of students said that they were drawn to the advertising major because of its creative aspects. Almost half of the advertising majors surveyed (47.2 percent) reported that math was their least favorite subject in high school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695813478181">38</xref></sup> In a separate study, researchers found that advertising majors had the lowest quantitative SAT scores compared with other groupings of majors on a university campus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695813478181">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>In one of the few studies of advertising students, Fullerton and Umphrey used the 5-point STATS instrument to gauge attitudes among advertising majors based in communications/journalism schools at two universities. The students in the study were predominantly female (64 percent) and white (85 percent), and almost all (96 percent) were between eighteen and twenty-three years old. The survey reported attitudes to be generally low, although average mean scores for the underlying dimensions hovered near the midpoint. Students scored <italic>Interest &amp; Future Applicability</italic> at 3.11, <italic>Statistical Tools</italic> at 3.26, <italic>Confidence</italic> at 3.11, and <italic>Initiative</italic> at 3.07.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1077695813478181">40</xref></sup> In a separate analysis of the same data, Fullerton and Umphrey examined differences in attitudes among groups of advertising students. Those who indicated a dislike for high school math courses scored lower overall. However, few differences in attitude were found between students who expressed an interest in management or sales jobs after graduation versus students who were mostly interested in creative jobs such as art direction or copywriting. Women showed slightly better attitudes than did men, as did those who were currently enrolled in a statistics or a media-planning course.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1077695813478181">41</xref></sup> The current study extends this work by surveying a larger, national sample of advertising students—members of the student advertising club of the American Advertising Federation (AAF)—about their attitudes toward statistics.</p>

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>The literature review indicates that proficiency in statistics is important for advertising students as they prepare to enter the workforce;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1077695813478181">42</xref></sup> however, advertising students have a high level of anxiety regarding statistics in general and toward taking the statistics course in college.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1077695813478181">43</xref></sup> The research literature further indicates that understanding attitudes toward statistics better enables educators to address potential levels of anxiety and help students overcome their “math problem.” Therefore, this study seeks to measure attitudes toward statistics among a national sample of students who are taking coursework in advertising—as majors and nonmajors in communications, fine art, business, and other departments at four-year colleges and universities across the country and who are members of AAF college student chapters. It applies an adapted version of the STATS instrument and uses a factor analysis to identify the underlying dimensions of the construct.</p>

<sec id="section7-1077695813478181" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>An online survey was made available for six weeks via the SurveyMonkey platform in the spring of 2011. A total of 4,613 advertising club college chapter members at 224 universities were invited via personal email outside of class to participate. Participants were entered into a drawing to win one of 100 Starbucks gift cards valued at $5 each. A questionnaire consisting of closed- and open-ended responses was designed to gather information about students’ academic status, demographic profile, career plans, and attitudes toward several issues including coursework in statistics.</p>
<p>The instrument for measuring attitude toward statistics consisted of eighteen of the twenty-four original items from Sutarso’s STATS questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1077695813478181">44</xref></sup> Items related to parental and teacher influence and one related to initiative were dropped because the researchers believed that they were written ambiguously and were potentially confusing and therefore presented validity and reliability problems. Students were asked to respond to each item on a 5-point scale ranging from <italic>strongly agree</italic> (5) to <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1).</p>
<p>Students responded from 119 of the 224 schools included in the email invitation, for a 53.1 percent institutional response rate. A total of 484 students completed the survey, for a student response rate of 10.5 percent. Of the 484 responding students, only 325 students from 101 schools from across the country had taken or were enrolled in a statistics course, 82 percent of whom reported that the course was required by their university. These 325 students represent the sample under study.</p>
<sec id="section8-1077695813478181">
<title>Respondent Profile</title>
<p>Almost three-fourths (71 percent) of the 325 respondents were female. More than half (53.8 percent) were graduating seniors, and the average age was 21.8 years. Race/ethnicity distribution was 71.9 percent Caucasian, 8.6 percent Hispanic, 8.0 percent Asian American, 2.2 percent African American, and 9.3 percent “other” including “mixed race” and international students. Respondents’ average overall self-reported GPA was 3.45. The demographic makeup of advertising students in this study is similar to those reported in other national studies of advertising students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1077695813478181">45</xref></sup> and in Fullerton and Umphrey’s study using the STATS instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1077695813478181">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>More than half (52.6 percent) of the students indicated they were advertising majors, 18.1 percent said they were majoring in marketing, and the remainder were undecided or in other majors or “premajors.” About three-quarters of the respondents (77.8 percent) said they planned to work in advertising after graduation and indicated that they would like to work in a variety of positions, most often in account management (59.7 percent). Creative-oriented jobs such as art director (30.5 percent) and copywriter (26.2 percent) were chosen at about the same rate as more analytical jobs such as media planner (32.9 percent) and research/account planner (29.8 percent).</p>
<p>To understand the students’ orientation toward the field of advertising and what drew them to the major, they were asked to complete the statement: “I majored in advertising/marketing/communications because of the: (a) Business aspects; (b) Creative aspects (c) Both business and creative aspects; (d) Neither.” The majority of the students (68 percent) chose both; however, about one in four (24.8 percent) chose “creative” only and just 7.2 percent chose business only. None of the students chose “neither.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1077695813478181">
<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>To gain better understanding of the underlying dimensions that constitute the attitude toward statistics construct, the adapted STATS scale was subjected to a principal components factor analysis (with varimax rotation). Factor analysis was deemed appropriate because the respondent (<italic>N</italic> = 325) to item ratio exceeded 10:1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1077695813478181">47</xref></sup> Four criteria for factor extraction were followed: (1) three or more questionnaire items had to load on a factor; (2) items had to have loadings of at least .60 on a factor, but not have loadings greater than .40 on any other factor; (3) factors had to have eigenvalues of greater than 1.00; and (4) on the scree plot, factors had to fall to the left of the point where eigenvalues appeared to level off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1077695813478181">48</xref></sup></p>

<title>RQ1</title>
<p>The STATS scale was used to measure the construct <italic>attitude toward statistics</italic> and to determine students’ overall attitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1077695813478181">49</xref></sup> An initial factor analysis was conducted with the eighteen STATS items from this study. Five factors were extracted, which explained 68.65 percent of the total variance. On close examination, factor 3 had only one item loading on it and four other items cross-loaded on multiple factors. The single item that loaded on factor 3 (“I did not like statistics before I took this class”) as well as two of the four cross-loaded items (“I feel that statistics is only for men” and “If a statistics course were not required for my major, I would not take one”) were items that Sutarso deemed unreliable in his study;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1077695813478181">50</xref></sup> therefore, these three items were dropped from further analysis.</p>
<p>After dropping the three items, a second factor analysis was conducted with the remaining fifteen items. In the second factor analysis, one additional item cross-loaded (“I like statistics now”) and therefore was removed. A third factor analysis was conducted with the remaining fourteen items. In the third factor analysis, four factors were extracted and explained 70.488 percent of the total variance. The items loaded similar to in Sutarso’s study and were therefore named as Sutarso named them—<italic>Interest &amp; Future Applicability, Confidence, Statistical Tools</italic>, and <italic>Initiative</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1077695813478181">51</xref></sup> For item loadings and means, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695813478181">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Factor 1, Interest &amp; Future Applicability, captured the students’ appreciation for the purpose and future usefulness of statistics. Items such as “Statistics will improve my research ability” and “Statistics will be important for my future career” loaded on this factor. Factor 1 explained 34.40 percent of the total variance and had an eigenvalue of 4.816. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .86, which indicated good internal consistency for the Interest &amp; Future Applicability factor. The items measuring Interest &amp; Future Applicability were subsequently collapsed into a single variable (<italic>M</italic> = 3.62, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73492), which indicated a slightly positive interest and appreciation for the purpose of statistics among students in this sample.</p>
<p>Factor 2, Confidence, encompassed the students’ personal feelings about their ability to do statistics with items such as “Learning statistics is easy for me” and “I understand/understood statistics better than the majority of people in my class.” This factor had an eigenvalue of 2.114 and explained 15.101 percent of the common variance. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .86, which also indicated good internal consistency. The collapsed variable measuring students’ self confidence in statistics showed the weakest evaluation (<italic>M</italic> = 3.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.92128).</p>
<p>The third factor, Statistical Tools, measured students’ affection toward working with numbers and using mathematical tools such as a calculator and computer. The eigenvalue for Statistical Tools was 1.714 and accounted for 12.246 percent of the variance. The alpha coefficient for this factor was weaker at .643. The alpha coefficient could be improved to a more acceptable .767 by removing the item “I like working with computers” from the factor; however, because the item loaded according to the criteria and because it was retained in Sutarso’s study,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1077695813478181">52</xref></sup> the researchers chose to retain it for this analysis. The conceptual connection between computers as tools for numerical computation has undoubtedly changed over the past twenty years, possibly explaining the weak alpha on this factor. However, Statistical Tools produced the highest evaluation of the four factors (<italic>M</italic> = 3.81, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.69791), largely driven by students’ affection for working with computers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695813478181">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The final factor of attitude toward statistics, Initiative, reflected students’ likelihood to seek help when they do not understand statistics. Only two items loaded on this factor, but it was retained because they were conceptually linked—“I see/saw my statistics instructor when I do/did not understand something that class” and “I ask/asked questions when I do/did not understand something in my statistics course.” Factor 4 produced an eigenvalue of 1.224 and accounted for 8.740 percent of the common variance, with a good alpha reliability coefficient of .82. The collapsed variable measuring Initiative scored slightly above neutral (<italic>M</italic> = 3.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.89062).</p>
<p>The four factors were moderately high in discriminant validity. A test of correlation showed that for all but one of the significant bivariate correlations, Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> was less than .40, which is considered a weak correlation. Statistical Tools and Confidence had a moderate correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .46).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1077695813478181">53</xref></sup> See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077695813478181">Table 2</xref> for factor correlations. Furthermore, a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to measure statistically significant differences among the factors’ mean scores. The test revealed that Interest &amp; Future Applicability (<italic>M</italic> = 3.62) and Initiative (<italic>M</italic> = 3.57) were not significantly different, <italic>t</italic>(316) = −980, <italic>p</italic> = .32); however, Confidence (<italic>M</italic> = 3.33) was significantly lower than the other three factors (<italic>p</italic> = .0001) and Statistical Tools (<italic>M</italic> = 3.81) was significantly higher than the other three factors (<italic>p</italic> = .0001).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study used STATS to measure attitude toward statistics among a national sample of advertising students. A factor analysis revealed four underlying factors make up the attitude toward statistics construct, Interest &amp; Future Applicability, Confidence, Statistical Tools, and Initiative, similar to the factors found in Sutarso’s study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1077695813478181">54</xref></sup> Item loadings in this study were similar to those in Sutarso’s work and similar reliability coefficients were found, indicating that the STATS, even in an abbreviated from, is a good measure of the <italic>students’ attitude toward statistics</italic> construct.</p>
<p>In this study of advertising students, attitudes toward statistics were shown to be slightly more positive than negative, a finding similar to that of Mills, who suggested that attitudes among students seemed to be more positive than earlier studies had indicated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1077695813478181">55</xref></sup> Students in this study were most positive about the use of Statistical Tools and displayed attitudes above neutral on dimensions of Interest &amp; Future Applicability and Initiative. Though student attitudes overall were still above neutral on the dimension of Confidence, it received the lowest evaluation from the students, indicating that students’ perceived self-efficacy could possibly be a source of statistics anxiety.</p>
<p>Attitudes toward statistics in this study were somewhat higher than those found by Fullerton and Umphrey, who used the same instrument among a smaller although similar sample ten years earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1077695813478181">56</xref></sup> In both studies, however, students’ overall attitude scores were slightly above the mean. In Fullerton and Umphrey’s study, students reported the lowest scores on Initiative, while in this study the most negative attitudes were found on the Confidence dimension.</p>
<p>Gender differences, which were found with mixed results in the literature, were only partially present in this study. Other than on the dimension of Initiative, where women showed a greater likelihood to seek help with statistics, men and women were similar in their attitudes. Similar to Baloğlu’s finding, older students were more likely to be interested and appreciate the value of statistics in their future careers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1077695813478181">57</xref></sup> Students with overall better GPAs showed significantly more positive attitudes on Interest &amp; Future Applicability and Confidence. As found by Sutarso, racial and ethnic differences were not related to attitudes in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1077695813478181">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Advertising students who were drawn to the major because of its creative aspects had significantly more negative attitudes toward statistics, although still above the mean, than did those who came to study advertising because of the business aspects, a finding that should not surprise most advertising educators. Students with creative ambitions may have difficulty appreciating the future applicability of statistics to their careers, not enjoy working with numbers, and find no reason to seek help with their statistics course work. These students, who represented one out of every four students in the sample, may have more anxiety about statistics than their classmates and may need special attention when they enroll in the required research or media planning course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1077695813478181">
<title>Suggestions for Educators</title>
<p>Findings in this study show that for advertising students, attitudes toward statistics are fairly neutral and in fact above the midpoint on the evaluative scale. At first glance, the neutral to moderately positive mean scores might be interpreted as favorable attitudes toward statistics. However since none of the means was 4 or above, researchers in this study believe that students’ attitudes are rather neutral and attribute the above-midpoint scores to an upward bias in the data, which can be expected from students who are members of professional clubs, such as AAF’s ad club. Based on data from the current study and previous studies, there is reason to believe that advertising students may be more anxious about statistics coursework than the raw scores indicate. A firmly positive attitude toward statistics among this sample would likely produce means of 4 (<italic>agree</italic>) or 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>Previous studies found that almost half of advertising majors said math was their least favorite subject in high school,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1077695813478181">59</xref></sup> and that they had the lowest quantitative SAT scores on a major university campus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1077695813478181">60</xref></sup> The literature also suggests a strong correlation between math anxiety and statistics anxiety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1077695813478181">61</xref></sup> Taken together, this may explain why advertising students in this study did not report more positive attitudes—they did not like their math classes in high school and do not have a strong aptitude for math. In this case, professors might remind students that while math and statistics are somewhat related in that they both involve numbers, they are not the same discipline. A course in statistics is more about reasoning and problem solving than it is about doing numerical calculations. Students may be surprised to learn that they are better at statistics than at math. Making students aware of the differences between math and statistics in terms of the cognitive processes involved may be especially effective with creative-oriented students.</p>
<p>Zanakis and Valenzi recommend that stronger cases should be made to help students appreciate the value of statistics to their career field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1077695813478181">62</xref></sup> Reminding students that strategies emanate from data that are properly and thoroughly analyzed can highlight the importance of acquiring statistical knowledge and practice.</p>
<p>In the current study, students showed the lowest evaluation for Confidence or their personal ability to learn statistics, but showed the most positive evaluation for Statistical Tools. The high evaluation on this factor was driven by the high scores garnered for the item about working with computers, which students may only loosely associate with numerical computation. Professors could leverage students’ interest in computers to overcome their reluctance with statistics. Students could be reminded that finding statistical solutions is made easier by computers and statistical software.</p>
<p>The fact that most statistics courses in universities are taught outside of schools of journalism may cause even further anxiety for advertising students. Dobni and Links emphasized the importance of using real-world examples that relate to the students’ area of study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1077695813478181">63</xref></sup> Statistics courses taught in departments of statistics may not feature examples that relate to advertising. Therefore, advertising faculty should contact faculty who teach the statistics course and offer advertising-related examples for integration into the course.</p>
<p>The findings of this study revealed that students were not overly positive about taking the initiative to seek help from a statistics professor and that male students were less likely to do so than females. Beyond encouraging students to communicate with the statistics professor, advisors should recommend other university resources of support for student learning, such as tutorial sessions or study groups.</p>
<p>A list of recommendations for advertising professors to help students overcome anxieties they may have toward statistics can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077695813478181">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>This study presented a survey of a self-selected national sample of advertising students who belong to student ad clubs; however, there is no way to know if those who responded were representative of the entire population of advertising students. Response bias may exist in that ad club students may be more motivated than their peers. If so, the reported findings may contain an upward bias. The research is also limited because the questionnaire did not capture variables about the students’ statistics courses such as specific content, number of statistics courses taken, the disciplinary focus of the course (e.g., business vs. social science), if a statistics course was required for their degree plan, or what level of math they had taken in high school. Future studies should make an effort to record these variables to provide more in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Future research could employ before-and-after surveys of student attitudes and examine specific aspects of the statistics course that may cause anxiety. Tracking student performance in future coursework and eventual successful employment relative to their attitude toward statistics could also be helpful in understanding the math problem. Better understanding of the students’ source of statistics anxiety can go far to cure what Professor Fikes called the advertising student’s “math problem.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1077695813478181">64</xref></sup></p>
