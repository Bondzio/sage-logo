<p>Most people see the border between the United States and Mexico as just a line, but Hendricks’ use of stories throughout <italic>The Wind Doesn’t Need a Passport</italic>, challenges that idea. From the title alone, Hendricks prepares the reader for her idea that the border is more than just a line; it is in fact a unique region rich with culture. By combining stories from residents of that region and accounts of historical and contemporary events, Hendricks conveys to the reader the idea that the borderlands are more like a “third nation,” where people have developed an outlook that transcends both nations. These people are accustomed to intermingling, which allows this region to be an ideal ground for the creation of a binational area due to the cultural, economic, familial, and psychological ties that the people have created by taking advantage of their geographical position. Hendricks primarily uses eight different narratives to set the stage to discuss different issues that arise in the borderlands ranging from drug cartels to education opportunities that demonstrate how each issue affects not only the individuals who live in the area but also both countries as a whole.</p>
<p>Hendricks’ first narrative focuses on Maribel Saenz, whose dreams for her future don’t match up with her parents’ ideas for her. Rather than hoping to stay close to home, which is in South Texas and only 20 min from the border, and join the family business, Maribel plans to attend college further north. The chapter’s goal is to demonstrate how powerful the mixing of American and Mexican cultures is in the borderlands. Speaking in “Spanglish” is common. One woman put it beautifully: “I love living at the border because it’s not a crash of cultures, it’s a flow of cultures. Coming here tonight I can enjoy baseball but still be Mexican.” This idea follows throughout the book as many people note that inhabitants do not see this region as a place where cultures collide and create tension, but rather it is an area that provides everyone with an opportunity to learn, grow, and create. Maribel exemplifies that life as she goes from volleyball practice to a fitting for a quineañera dress, from Fourth of July fireworks to Norteño dancing. The chapter also discusses the obstacles that Mexicans have historically faced when trying to access equal education. One resident mentioned that when she was younger there were three schools, “one was for Anglo Americans, another was for Mexican Americans and then African Americans had their own little shack.” This segregation created an environment in which it became normalized for Mexican American students to receive inferior educations due to lack of resources and funding. Eventually in 1987, two Latino civil rights groups brought a lawsuit against the state of Texas for cheating the borderlands’ largely Mexican population out of full access to higher education. The work of the two groups, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the League of Latin American citizens, led to the passing of the South Texas Initiative, which provided US$600 million into various public colleges in the region and brought them into the state university system. This initiative combined the dedication to education that was common for the residents of the borderlands due to their traditional upbringing and desire to make the most of their parents’ sacrifices, which allowed more students to be able to seriously consider college as a future option, an option that hadn’t been available just a generation earlier. Along with the new resources come the new challenges that both parents and children have to face of separation and growing accustomed to new environments. The chapter ends with Maribel sharing that while she feels like a minority for the first time in college since she can no longer speak “Tex-Mex,” she has found a new family at her school that is also rich with traditions and love.</p>
<p>Later chapters focus on different aspects of life in the borderlands. One chapter focuses on an issue that isn’t often discussed: the life of the original inhabitants of the Sonoran Desert who live on the Tohono O’odham Indian Reservation in southern Arizona. The creation of the barriers along the border have split the land that the Tohono O’odham had hunted, harvested, and planted on for thousands of years and the tribe has lost already scarce resources. In addition, the Desert People have had their ability to move freely across their ancestral land impeded. Hendricks highlights how it is unfair that these people, who have existed long before the line separating the two countries was created, have to possess tribal identity cards to be able to move freely on what has been their own land for centuries. In addition, the Desert People are being increasingly put in harm’s way due to the increasing presence and danger of the battles over drug and immigrant smuggling. This chapter highlights more than any other how much the people who reside in the borderlands have had to adapt to the volatile nature of the region and how common it is for those inhabitants to move frequently between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>Several of the people whom Hendricks worked with expressed that the idea of residency is more fluid along the border. While people may say that they reside in one place, they may spend half or more of their time in a different location that may even be across the border. Alternatively, people may provide different answers for the question of where they reside depending on with whom they are speaking. This fluidity lends itself to code-switching, a frequent occurrence along the border that refers to the ability of people to change how they speak, dress, act, and so forth, based on their location and the people around them. While code switching can provide advantages and open doors to different opportunities, it can also be stressful, as people have to constantly change who they are and how they present and may lose a sense of self. Throughout the other chapters, Hendricks delves into issues that also aren’t often presented in the media, such as issues of emergency care for undocumented immigrants, life on the ranches in the borderlands, environmental issues such as cleanliness of air and water on both sides of the border and the presence of Minutemen who take it on themselves to enforce immigration policy. Hendricks uses these anecdotes to present the true multidimensionality of life in the borderlands. She serves as a pioneer in her field with her view of the border as a permeable region and not something to be sealed, but rather an area that can use more efficient regulation for the inevitable flow of goods and people.</p>
<p>Hendricks’s perspectives are refreshing and allow for a more in-depth understanding of the truly unique experiences of living in that region. By seeing the region as a region, as opposed to just a line, Hendricks infinitely increases the possibilities for research, both qualitative and quantitative alike, that sociologists, political scientists, psychologists, and other professionals can use to better and more fairly serve the residents of the borderlands. In addition, this perspective humanizes those residents and allows for stories to be told from both sides and all areas in between. These stories that can be told are not limited to just people either. In her works, Hendricks also mentions the importance of considering the effects that work along the border and throughout the region affects the animals in the region as well. One concern that is raised is the concern that habitats of already endangered species are being put at risk by construction and migrants. Creating a wall along the border also creates problems with animals’ (such as jaguars, bobcats, and bighorn sheep) ability to roam freely throughout their natural habitats. Considering the comparatively narrow view that most people have surrounding issues in the borderlands, I would recommend this book to anyone hoping to gain a significantly in-depth analysis on a wide array of issues that arise in the borderlands. It also provides a balance of personal and emotional appeal and statistical and logistical analysis that makes the realities and implications of the facts easier to understand.</p>
