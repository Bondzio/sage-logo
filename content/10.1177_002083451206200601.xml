<p>62.6831 ADAMS, James — <bold>Causes and electoral consequences of party policy shifts in multiparty elections: theoretical results and empirical evidence</bold>. <italic>Annual Review of Political Science</italic> 15, 2012: 401–419.</p>
<p>The spatial model of elections identifies factors that motivate party elites to shift their policy positions, including changes in voters' policy preferences, rival parties' policy shifts, past election results, and changes in party elites' valence images with respect to dimensions of evaluation such as competence and integrity. I review empirical studies on multiparty elections, i.e., elections involving three or more major parties, that evaluate party elites' policy responses to these factors, along with empirical studies on the electoral consequences of parties' policy shifts. This review reveals a paradox: empirical studies conclude that parties systematically shift their policy positions in response to the factors that spatial modelers have identified. On the other hand, there is only weak and inconsistent empirical evidence that voters actually perceive parties' policy shifts, and/or that these shifts have significant electoral consequences.

<p>Adding value to existing aggregate cross-national analyses on forced migration, I use subnational-level data to investigate circumstances that affect people's decisions of whether or not to flee their homes during civilian conflicts. Building on existing literature, I argue that conflict by itself is not the sole factor affecting people's decisions to flee or stay. Apart from a direct physical impact, civil war can destroy economic infrastructure and expose people to economic hardships, which can contribute to displacement. In addition, flight may be impeded or facilitated by such factors as geographical features, physical infrastructure, and social conditions under which people live. Using count-data from the Maoists “people's war” in Nepal, a subnational analysis of displacement is conducted to provide a more refined test of existing large-n studies on the causes of forced migration.

<p>62.6833 AISTRUP, Joseph — <bold>Structured partisan competition: a vote shares model of party alignments and realignments</bold>. <italic>Social Science Quarterly</italic> 93(3), Sept. 2012: 750–778.</p>
<p>This study develops and tests an aggregate “vote shares” model of party alignments and realignments, building a theoretical framework around “structured political composition”. The vote shares model conceptualizes party alignments as latent class constructs, or factors, and changes in these latent class constructs as party realignments. Confirmatory factor-analysis (CFA) model with bias-corrected bootstrap estimates and standard errors is used where the cases are counties and the variables are aggregate election outcomes. The data come from Kansas [USA] from 1900 to 2010. The vote-shares model of party alignments and realignments provides a viable alternative for analyzing historic and current election returns where the votes are aggregated by a geographically defined government jurisdiction (parish, county, city, or district).

<p>We argue that the successful use of new technologies by Tunisian protestors marked the birth of a new repertoire of social protest. Social movement repertoires, as originally conceptualized by theorist Ch. Tilly, consist of “a limited set of routines that are learned, shared, and acted out through a relatively deliberate process of choice”. This particular repertoire involves a novel mixture of elements, some relatively new and others more familiar. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8196]</p>
<p>62.6835 AKSOY, Deniz; CARTER, David B.; WRIGHT, Joseph — <bold>Terrorism in dictatorships</bold>. <italic>Journal of Politics</italic> 74(3), July 2012: 810–826.</p>
<p>We have few explanations for why some dictatorships experience substantial threats from terrorism while others do not. A growing body of work on authoritarian politics focuses on political institutions in these regimes to explain a broad range of political outcomes. Building on this literature, we argue that opposition political party activity increases the collective action capacity of regime opponents and that elected legislatures can channel this mobilized capacity into support for the government. However, when active opposition parties operate in the absence of legislatures, political opponents increasingly turn to terrorism. We find evidence that terrorist groups are most likely to emerge in dictatorships with opposition political parties but no elected legislature. These regimes also experience the highest volume of subsequent attacks. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.6836 ALBERTUS, Michael; MENALDO, Victor — <bold>If you're against them you're with us: the effect of expropriation on autocratic survival</bold>. <italic>Comparative Political Studies</italic> 45(8), Aug. 2012: 973–1003.</p>
<p>This article advances a theory of why some dictators weaken the elite through expropriation whereas others do not. When the organization that launches a new dictator into power is uncertain about whether he will remain loyal to them, a dictator's decision to expropriate the pre-existing elite may contribute to political stability by signaling his exclusive reliance on this group. The authors corroborate this claim empirically. Using new data compiled on land, resource, and bank expropriations in Latin America from 1950 to 2002, the authors show that large-scale expropriation helps dictators survive in power. The history of autocracy in Mexico between 1911 and 2000 further illustrates the importance of expropriation in promoting autocratic survival as well as how the codification of new property rights can transform a dictator's launching organization into a new economic elite.

<p>How do governments find the political capital to raise interest rates in pursuit of inflation stabilization? Against common wisdom, this article shows that the ability of governments to exercise tight monetary policy largely depends on the level of unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is particularly useful to social democratic parties since their core constituency — labor — is the hardest hit by economic downturns. Empirical evidence from 17 OECD countries over thirty years demonstrates that high levels of unemployment insurance present a strong incentive for social democratic governments to respond more aggressively to positive changes in inflation. These findings resolve the puzzle of why partisan monetary cycles are not often observed in the literature and have important policy implications, given continued calls for scaling down social insurance.

<p>I explain why majority voting can be assumed to have an epistemic edge over lottery voting. This would provide support for majority voting as the appropriate decision mechanism for deliberative epistemic accounts of democracy. I first recall the usual arguments for majority voting: maximal decisiveness, fairness as anonymity, and minimal decisiveness. I then show how these arguments are over inclusive as they also support lottery voting. I then present a framework to measure accuracy so as to compare the two decision mechanisms. I go over four arguments for lottery voting and three arguments for majority voting that support their respective accuracy. I then provide two case scenarios for each voting mechanism that illustrate my point. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.6839 ALLSOBROOK, Christopher — <bold>Blackout: freedom, without power</bold>. <italic>Theoria</italic> 132, Sept. 2012: 60–78.</p>
<p>This article attributes the conception of “freedom-without-power” which dominates contemporary Western political philosophy to a reification of social agency that mystifies contexts of human capacities and achievements. It suggests that Plato's analogy between the structure of the soul and the <italic>polis</italic> shows how freedom is a consequence, rather than a condition, of political relations, mediated by inter-subjective contestation. It draws on the work of R. Geuss to argue against pre-political ethical frameworks in political philosophy, in favor of a more contextually sensitive, self-critical approach to ethics. Such reciprocal ethical-political integration addresses problems of ideological complicity that may arise if freedom is discretely abstracted from history and power in political philosophy. Finally, the article roughly reconstructs a critical account of African identity from writings of Steven Biko to illuminate symptoms of “meritocratic apartheid” in South Africa today.

<p>This essay presents interpretations of state sovereignty prevalent in the 20th c. and the beginning of the 21st c., from paradigmatic points of view that are rational and reflective, centric and peripheral, concerning foreign policy and the historical reality within which they are formulated. The author sketches a possible guide to reflection on historical change and seeks to address the concept of sovereignty as an explanatory tool and a means for political action, and upholding, or seeking to transform, established mechanisms of power.

<p>Existing theory on the form of government suggests that a parliamentary system promotes a larger size of government than does a presidential system. This paper extends the existing theory by allowing for distortionary taxation. A main result is that if taxation is sufficiently distortionary, the parliamentary system may promote a smaller size of government than the presidential system. The proposed mechanism appears consistent with several empirical patterns in the data that cannot be explained by other theories. [R]</p>

<p>For contemporary constitutional theory, the key challenge posed by globalization undermines the traditional link between constitutionalism and the state: in response to multi-level governance, theories of constitutionalism beyond the state have been advanced. This focus on levels obscures more fundamental epistemological questions raised by globalization about the nature of constitutionalism itself. Critical analysis of three leading schools of constitutionalism beyond the state — supranational, societal, and new constitutionalism — highlights their shared assumptions with state-based thought regarding the separation between economics and politics, and the necessarily hegemonic character of constitutionalism. However, globalization intensifies critique of these assumptions, and questions their translation to the transnational context. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Electoral institutions shape the incentive that elected representatives have to cultivate a personal vote, a geographically-concentrated personal vote in particular. But are electoral institutions able to make representatives do what they would not do otherwise and to make them not do what they otherwise would have done? Using data from the cross-national PARTIREP MP Survey, it is demonstrated that electoral institutions shape elected representatives' local orientation. Local orientation decreases as district magnitude grows — regardless of what representatives think about political representation. But representatives' conceptions of representation do shape their uptake in the legislative arena from their contacts with individual constituents. The effect of the electoral incentive grows stronger as elected representatives think of representation as a bottom-up rather than a top-down process. [R]</p>

<p>Government efforts to prevent corruption vary from reformulating laws and regulations to establishing control and oversight mechanisms such as integrated public management systems within central and local governments. However, several technical issues as well as social-political events may critically affect its effectiveness. This article addresses this issue by analyzing the Integrated Management System and Administrative Modernization (SIGMA for its acronym in Spanish) established in Bolivia through a World Bank US$15 million loan. Possible solutions and next steps to improve its effectiveness that can be applied to other countries are suggested. [R]</p>

<p>In recent years, radical-right political parties have become a substantial electoral force in many countries around the world. Based on the vision of a mono-ethnic state, anti-immigration is these parties' core message. Connecting research on discrimination, social exclusion, and social identity threat, it was assumed that this anti-immigrant propaganda undermines the intellectual performance of immigrant adolescents. In an experiment conducted at Austrian schools, the intelligence test performance of adolescents with an immigration background decreased after they were exposed to radical right election posters whereas ethnic majority adolescents remained unaffected. The results further suggest that individuals with a strong ethnic minority identity are less vulnerable to the detrimental impact of the radical-right propaganda. [R]</p>

<p>The relationship between globalization and national identity is puzzling. While some observers have found that globalization reduces people's identification with their nation, others have reached the opposite conclusion. This article explores this conundrum by examining the relationship between globalization and people's feelings towards national identity. Using data from the International Social Survey Program National Identity II (2003) and the World Values Survey (2005), it analyses these relations across sixty-three countries. Employing a multilevel approach, it investigates how a country's level of globalization is related to its public perceptions towards different dimensions of national identity. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper emphasizes the importance of assessing measurement equivalence when using cross-national and longitudinal surveys. We illustrate how to test for measurement equivalence using multiple group confirmatory factor-analysis and clarify under what conditions both meaningful comparisons of construct means and relationships between constructs are possible. Using data from the International Social Survey Program, empirical applications dealing with attitudes towards welfare policies are provided to illustrate the procedure. [R]</p>
<p>62.6849 ARMELLINI, Mauricio — <bold>The democratic factor in the education-growth relationship</bold>. <italic>Kyklos</italic> 65(3), Aug. 2012: 285–312.</p>
<p>This paper proposes that the “ring” set of institutions can increase the impact of education on economic growth, and argues that democracy encapsulates that set of institutions appropriately. Therefore, while education is generally conducive to increases in individual income, its effect on economic growth is mediated by the level of democracy of the political system, so that different democratic performances yield different effects of education on economic growth. This can help explain the apparent micro-macro paradox. The reviews some of the literature on education and economic growth; looks at the possible interactions between education, democracy and growth, seeking to explain why democracy could be a key institutional factor; [and] presents empirical evidence to support to the main hypothesis.

<p>62.6850 ARREGUIN-TOFT, Ivan — <bold>Contemporary asymmetric conflict theory in historical perspective</bold>. <italic>Terrorism and Political Violence</italic> 24(4), Sept.-Oct. 2012: 635–657.</p>
<p>This article offers an intellectual history of theoretical work devoted to explaining asymmetric conflict outcomes since World War II. Three factors are critical to understanding how the literature has evolved: First, the concept of “asymmetric conflict” encompasses a number of overlapping literatures, including insurgency, terrorism, counterinsurgency, and most recently, civil wars. Second, and interrelated, the field of inquiry has been unproductively divided between military and academic thinkers, with insufficient engagement between the two communities. Third, the popularity of the field of inquiry following the events of 11 September 2001, and the subsequent American-led military operations in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003) have resulted in analyses that are empirically rich, but have provided little in the way of theoretical advances. The conclusion assesses the field of inquiry into asymmetric conflict outcomes. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6883]</p>
<p>62.6851 ASHWORTH, Scott — <bold>Electoral accountability: recent theoretical and empirical work</bold>. <italic>Annual Review of Political Science</italic> 15, 2012: 183–201.</p>
<p>Competitive elections create a relationship of formal accountability between policy-makers and citizens. Recent theoretical work suggests that there are limits on how well this formal accountability links policy decisions to citizen preferences. In particular, incumbents' incentives are driven not by the voters' evaluation of the normative desirability of outcomes but by the outcome's information about the incumbent's type (e.g., competence or ideology). This review surveys both this body of theory and the robust empirical literature it has spawned. It concludes with a short discussion of ongoing work that attempts to integrate this theoretical perspective with a richer view of policy-making institutions. [R]</p>
<p>62.6852 ATZILI, Boaz; PEARLMAN, Wendy — <bold>Triadic deterrence: coercing strength, beaten by weakness</bold>. <italic>Security Studies</italic> 21(2), Apr.-June 2012: 301–335.</p>
<p>Triadic deterrence is the situation when one state uses threats and/or punishments against another state to coerce it to prevent non-state actors from conducting attacks from its territory. We argue that the complex asymmetrical structure of this conflict requires attention to the targeted regime's relationship to its own society. The stronger the targeted regime, the more likely deterrent action will prove effective. Moving against non-state actors requires institutional capacity, domestic legitimacy, and territorial control, which only strong regimes are able to furnish. Whereas strong regimes can act to uphold <italic>raison d'état</italic>, weak regimes lack the political tools and incentives to undertake controversial decisions and enforce them. We illustrate this argument through analysis of between- and within-case variation in Israel's attempts to deter Palestinian groups operating from Egypt between 1949 and 1979, and from Syria since 1963.

<p>62.6853 AYDIN, Aysegul; REGAN, Patrick M. — <bold>Networks of third-party interveners and civil war duration</bold>. <italic>European Journal of International Relations</italic> 18(3), Sept. 2012: 573–597.</p>
<p>With growing attention to peace-building in civil wars, scholars have increasingly focused on the role that international and regional organizations play in conflict-resolution. Less attention has been paid to unilateral interventions undertaken by third-party states without the explicit consent of organizations and to the impact of unilateralism on how long civil wars last. We claim that unilateral interventions exert a cumulative impact on civil wars depending on interveners' interrelations. States with a cooperative rapport have an easier time in bringing civil wars to an end though they act unilaterally and follow their interests in the civil war environment, whereas states that compete for influence over war combatants prolong the fighting. Analysis results from post-1945 civil wars support our expectations and show that interveners supporting opposing sides of the war increase war duration. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.6854 AYERS, Alison J. — <bold>An illusion of the epoch: critiquing the ideology of “failed states”</bold>. <italic>International Politics</italic> 49(5), Sept. 2012: 568–590.</p>
<p>Although initially developed by policy networks, the proliferation of academic literature on “failed states” accepts largely uncritically the accounts of foreign-policy-makers, taking the notion of state failure entirely as given, as an unproblematic descriptive and analytical term. This article argues that the concept of the “failed state” remains essentially contested and under-theorized. In particular, the term immediately embodies a set of assumptions that obfuscate any serious understanding of the causes of social conflict and crisis. The article interrogates the concept of the “failed state”, the assumptions from which the thesis of “state failure” is derived, its ideological character and integral relation to the history and current order of imperialism. The notion of the “failed state” is descriptively weak and analytically inadequate in furthering an understanding of the causes and conditions of such crises. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.6855 BABIK, Milan — <bold>Beyond totalitarianism: (re)introducing secularization theory to liberal narratives of progress</bold>. <italic>Politics, Religion and Ideology</italic> 13(3), Sept. 2012: 289–309.</p>
<p>This article concerns secularization theory and the concept of political religion, specifically their analytic scope. It notes that their recent revival after the Cold War displays a strong fixation on totalitarian ideologies: whereas Nazism and Bolshevism have received extensive attention, liberalism has been ignored. The article argues that this secularization-totalitarianism nexus is arbitrary; ample space exists within secularization theory to accommodate other modern narratives of progress and perfection, including liberal ones. The article unlocks and recovers this space by revisiting the early stages of secularization theory to reveal that many of its initial proponents, such as classical realist scholars of international relations, included liberalism on their agenda.

<p>The article analyzes how economic constraints limit the action of the state. The budgetary constraint dictates that the sum of public spending should be inferior or equal to government revenue, in a timeless manner. The article then looks at the debates that emerged, around the work of Keynes and his followers, regarding the importance of the budgetary constraint and the possibility of avoiding it. One of these debates regards the taking into account of the behavior of agents who anticipate public action and, thereby, limit it and create the grounds for a new constraint, i.e., self-constraint. Another debate deals with the issue of tax competition and globalization, which represent a new constraint on public action. Finally, New Public Management leads to a renewed analysis of the constraint on the state's margins for maneuver. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6971]</p>
<p>62.6857 BACCINI, Leonardo — <bold>Democratization and trade policy: an empirical analysis of developing countries</bold>. <italic>European Journal of International Relations</italic> 18(3), Sept. 2012: 455–479.</p>
<p>I show that the process of democratization in developing countries constitutes an important factor in the formation of preferential trade agreements. Specifically, democratizing developing countries are more likely to form a preferential trade agreement with richer countries. Put simply, the median voter gains from trading with the richer states and loses from trading with the other poor states. Since preferential trade agreements allow countries to waive the most-favored nation principle, the need for both trade openness and protectionism against competitors might explain why preferential trade agreements constitute one of the main features of the current wave of globalization. I quantitatively test this hypothesis using a newly compiled dataset that covers 135 developing countries from 1990 to 2007. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In theoretical debate, prediction represents a central issue regarding the extent to which the study of politics is scientific. In methodological development, much effort and resource have been devoted to a diverse range of predictive approaches, with varying degrees of success. Expectations that scholars forecast accurately come as much from the policy and media worlds as from the academy. Since the end of the Cold War, scenario development has become prevalent in future-oriented research by area studies scholars. This approach is long due critical reassessment. For all its strengths as a policy tool, scenario development tends towards a bounded methodology, driving the process of anticipating futures along predetermined paths into a standardized range of options, and paying insufficient attention to theoretical and contextual understandings available within the relevant scholarly disciplines.

<p>62.6859 BAGOZZI, Benjamin E.; MUKHERJEE, Bumba — <bold>A mixture model for middle category inflation in ordered survey responses</bold>. <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(3), Summer 2012: 369–386.</p>
<p>Recent research finds that, for social desirability reasons, uninformed individuals disproportionately give “neither agree nor disagree”-type responses to survey attitude questions, even when a “do not know” option is available. Such “face-saving” responses inflate the indifference (i.e., middle) categories of ordered attitude variables with non-ordered responses. When such inflation occurs within the middle category of one's ordered dependent variable, estimates from ordered probit (and ordered logit) models are likely to be unreliable and inefficient. This article develops a set of mixture models that estimate and account for the presence of “face-saving” responses in middle categories of ordered survey response variables, and applies these models to (1) simulated data and (2) a commonly studied survey question measuring attitudes toward EU membership among individuals in EU-candidate countries.

<p>We adopt a critical realist notion of power to address the ongoing economic and financial crisis and responses by left actors and institutions to it. While correct in its assessment of the reduced prospects of social democratic parties and representative trade unions, much of the current literature on “the left-under-crisis” equates the left too narrowly with these two forms of strategy and fails to recognize adequately the potential of other more radical strategic forms. Consequently, the current literature is too gloomy when considering the prospects of the left as a whole. A realist framework on power allows us not only to order the structural and agential factors affecting the left, but also to demonstrate why certain strategic forms are better able both to identify and disrupt existing power relations and offer the potential for emancipation.

<p>This paper discusses the contemporary sovereignty experience of small states and territories in the context of unfolding “strategy games”. It charts and illustrates some of the most salient issues over which this dynamic is played out, using binary (small state versus big state) relations as its analytic constituency. These practices are understood as part of the evolution of the conduct of government, or governmentality, as envisaged by M. Foucault: states, no longer concerned with threats to their very existence, can flex their clout extra-territorially, and in so doing provide new and creative opportunities, but also raise threats, for the exercise of sovereignty.

<p>62.6862 BAMFORTH, Nicholas — <bold>Sexuality and citizenship in contemporary constitutional argument</bold>. <italic>International Journal of Constitutional Law</italic> 10(2), March 2012: 477–492.</p>
<p>Recent debate about the legal regulation of minority sexual orientations (including in relation to same-sex marriage) has come to assume a distinctly constitutional focus. The association of ideas of citizenship with aspects of this debate, not least through litigation, provides a basis for reconsidering the definition of citizenship generally, together with the extent to which there are continuities between citizenship and sexual citizenship. This article suggests that while citizenship may focus, at an abstract level, on equal membership of and inclusion within society, the specific rights one associates with it are likely to vary according to one's political philosophy.

<p>Since M. Olson's free-rider paradox, scholars have questioned the applicability of rational choice analyses to the study of nationalism and other forms of collective action. The most heated debates have centered on the participation of ordinary group members rather than elites. Leaders lack the material resources to remunerate grassroots activists adequately for their exploits or to punish defectors individually. This article posits that the problem lies not with the strategic thinking of non-elites but with the way rationality has been conceptualized in the scholarly literature. We should challenge the standard assumption that rational behavior is limited to accruing material rewards. This article re-examines this conjecture in light of alternative interpretations underscoring that individuals endeavor to maximize nonmaterial utilities. [R]</p>

<p>Scholars of democracy-promotion foreign aid often claim it has substantially increased, yet they shy away from explaining by how much, nor investigate comparative trends in giving. This paper [asks]: (1) Has democracy-promotion aid increased since the end of the Cold War? (2) Has the “assumed” trend of increasing aid persevered through the difficulties encountered in democratizing Iraq? (3) Did aid increase from states that supported the invasion of Iraq compared to states that did not? The author's analysis purports that the answer is yes to the first two, yet it is harder to draw conclusions regarding Iraq. Another finding: contrary to claims in the scholarly literature, in terms of percentage and overall spending, the US gives more democracy-promotion aid than the EU. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article outlines the composition by sex of political scientists in the UK. The data show that there are fewer women working in the profession than men and that there is a “seniority sex gap”. The data are then broken down in terms of university membership groupings and individual departments in order to produce snapshot rankings. These rankings are then combined to produce an overall ranking of female presence within UK political science departments. Our findings suggest that a “leaking pipeline” persists and that numerical and seniority inequality will continue for a considerable time unless further action is taken. [R]</p>

<p>Analysis of survey data from five continents shows that individuals who report recent crime victimization participate in politics more than comparable nonvictims. Rather than becoming withdrawn or disempowered, crime victims tend to become more engaged in civic and political life. The effect of crime victimization is roughly equivalent to an additional five to ten years of education, meaning that crime victimization ranks among the most influential predictors of political participation. Prior research has shown that exposure to violence during some civil wars can result in increased political participation, but this article demonstrates that the effect of victimization extends to peacetime, to nonviolent as well as violent crimes, and across most of the world.

<p>What determines whether policy environments attract or deter investment? Scholars worried about the vulnerability of market-supporting institutions to political manipulation have identified delegation to independent actors as way to increase policy environments' predictability. Extant arguments, however, risk overgeneralizing from the experience of developed democracies. I argue that investors' response to bureaucratic discretion-agents' leeway to make decisions and act independently of political bodies-depends upon the broader institutional context. Where robust political institutions are lacking, bureaucratic discretion acts as a source of unpredictability that deters investors; conversely, political institutions that share the cost of monitoring help to mitigate uncertainty about how bureaucrats will use discretion in applying regulatory rules. Using survey data from over 600 enterprises in Russia, I find that perceptions of bureaucratic discretion are negatively associated with firm managers' willingness to invest. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Advocates of moral hazard theory argue that the “responsibility to protect” causes genocidal violence that would not otherwise occur. After summarizing the main elements of the moral hazard approach, this article demonstrates that there is no empirical evidence to support the general claim that the “responsibility to protect” is a remote cause of genocide. This is followed by an analysis of the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo and Darfur, which demonstrates that moral hazard does not provide a plausible account of the proximate causes of genocidal violence in these cases. We suggest that a major part of the explanation for why moral hazard theory performs so badly is its reductionist account of the dynamics of armed conflict and its simplistic understanding of the dynamics of provocation.

<p>This study examines the balance of power among all players influencing the adoption of structural reforms: politicians, regulators, and interest groups. Special attention is devoted to the effect of conflicts between regulators. Professional conflicts signal to politicians that there is a high level of risk in implementing a given reform, thereby weakening their confidence in it. Conflicts also benefit interest groups, increasing their effectiveness vis-à-vis politicians. Using a unique data-set on 32 attempts to reform Israel's financial market, I find that the greater the extent of conflict among regulators and the greater the intensity of the opposition of interest groups, the lower the probability that a reform will be approved.

<p>Coding non-manifesto documents as if they were genuine policy platforms produced at election time clearly raises serious issues with error when these codings are used in the standard manner to estimate left-right policy positions.

<p>Over the last decade, policy transfer has emerged as an important concept within public policy analysis, guiding both theoretical and empirical research spanning many venues and issue areas. Using D. P. Dolowitz and D. Marsh's 1996 stocktake [“Who learns what from whom? A review of the policy transfer literature”, <italic>Political Studies</italic> 44(2), June 1996: 343–357] as its starting point, this article reviews what has been learned by whom and for what purpose. It finds that the literature has evolved from its rather narrow, state-centred roots to cover many more actors and venues. While policy transfer still represents a niche topic for some researchers, an increasing number have successfully assimilated it into wider debates on topics such as globalisation, Europeanisation and policy innovation. This article assesses the concept's position in the overall “tool-kit” of policy analysis, examines some possible future directions and reflects on their associated risks and opportunities.

<p>Rather than market forces driving governments to compete for mobile taxpayers, procedures known as “yardstick competition” promise to achieve policy-learning and -transfer. Governments have to be willing to participate, which cannot be taken for granted unless we know what motivates them to compete. According to theory, parliaments or voters can drive executives to meet best practices. But members of parliaments or voters are regularly guided by party competition or by media debates inside their jurisdiction and less interested in what other governments do. The article discusses conditions that can impede or promote successful yardstick competition and policy-learning. Empirical evidence is based on studies of inter-regional policy competition in Germany. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7369]</p>

<p>It is well established that all interactions are symmetric: when the effect of X on Y is conditional on the value of Z, the effect of Z must be conditional on the value of X. Yet the typical practice when testing an interactive theory is to (1) view one variable, Z, as the conditioning variable, (2) offer a hypothesis about how the marginal effect of the other variable, X, is conditional on the value of Z, and (3) construct a marginal effect plot for X to test the theory. We show that the failure to make additional predictions about how the effect of Z varies with the value of X, and to evaluate them with a second marginal effect plot, means that scholars often ignore evidence that can be extremely valuable for testing their theory.

<p>We suggest that the relationship between age and turnout has the shape of a roller-coaster, instead of a solely curvilinear effect of age on turnout. We [first] briefly discuss the relationship between age and turnout in the existing literature.

<p>Much scholarship in the political economy literature has investigated the influence of the democratic advantage on sovereign bond ratings by credit rating agencies (CRAs). Missing from earlier work, however, is inquiry into the effects on bond ratings of factors that lower political risk, such as adherence to the rule of law, the presence of a strong and independent judicial system, and protection of property rights. Using panel data for up to thirty-six developing countries from 1996 to 2006, we find that rule of law, strong and independent courts, and protection of property rights have significant positive effects on bond ratings. Policymakers wanting to obtain higher bond ratings and increased revenue from bond sales would do well to heed the message contained in these findings. [R]</p>

<p>Mixed compensatory systems have risen in popularity in recent years. Under such systems, single-seat districts elect only the leader of the local suffrage, but the systems nevertheless produce (nearly) proportional outcomes overall, via compensatory mandates. Elections in Albania, Italy, Lesotho, and Venezuela, however, demonstrate a particular loophole for such systems: strategic voting, organized by political parties. Large parties can achieve over-representation by encouraging their voters to split their votes. In this way, they outsmart the compensatory mechanism designed to lead to proportional results. These disproportional results are particularly controversial, since they are deliberate and strategic. This article takes the 2005 Albanian elections as its main case study, and uses simulations to illustrate its political consequences. [R]</p>

<p>While there is much debate about the merits of dichotomous versus continuous measures of democracy, surprisingly little attention is paid to the question as to how to go from degree to dichotomy. This study identifies no less than 38 different ways in which Freedom House and Polity scores have been used to distinguish between democracies and non-democracies. The analysis shows that it is difficult to draw the line in measures of democracy, even for Freedom House and Polity themselves. These problems are illustrated with the help of a recent study on democratization in Africa. The conclusion formulates some guidelines for good practice and points at the potential of disaggregated scores to distinguish between democracy and dictatorship. [R]</p>

<p>This article substantiates theoretically M. Sageman's claims of a “leaderless jihad” through the application of the conceptual framework offered by the novel scientific paradigm of complexity theory. It is argued that jihadist networks, such as those behind the 11 September [2001] attacks and the bombings in London [2005] and Madrid [2004], can be profitably understood in terms of complex adaptive systems, emergent organizations that coalesce and self-organize in a decentralized fashion. Complexity sheds new light on the jihadist movement by providing an account of the bottom-up self-organization of its networks and the systems of distributed intelligence which allow those networks to operate and pursue successful attacks on the basis of partial and localized information, and this despite the strenuous efforts at counter-terrorism deployed by states.

<p>The study of political violence has undergone dramatic changes in its orientation, scope, and empirical approach over the last twenty years. Increased sophistication has fragmented the field into highly specialized studies of types of political violence, themselves often divided by theoretical assumptions and methodological approaches. As a way of encouraging the cross-pollination of ideas, this special edition has asked leading scholars in the field to produce “state of the field” survey pieces on each type of political violence and to identify directions for future research. This introduction lays out the rationale for this special edition, highlights some of the key themes and findings in the included articles, and identifies several insights from this literature that will also be applicable to the study of terrorism.

<p>We suggest a new approach to narrowing the field in elections, based on the “deservingness” of candidates to be contenders in a runoff, or to be declared one of several winners. Instead of specifying some minimum percentage (e.g., 50) that the leading candidate must surpass to avoid a runoff, we propose that the number of contenders depends on the distribution of votes among all candidates. Divisor methods of apportionment provide measures of deservingness, but they can prescribe a runoff even when one candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote. We propose a new measure of deservingness, called the Next-Two rule, which compares the performance of candidates to the two that immediately follow them. It identifies as contenders candidates who are bunched together near the top. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Multivariate count models are rare in political science despite the presence of many count time series. This article develops a new Bayesian Poisson vector autoregression model that can characterize endogenous dynamic counts with no restrictions on the contemporaneous correlations. Impulse responses, decomposition of the forecast errors, and dynamic multiplier methods for the effects of exogenous covariate shocks are illustrated for the model. Two full illustrations of the model, its interpretations, and results are presented. The first example is a dynamic model that re-analyzes the patterns and predictors of superpower rivalry events. The second example applies the model to analyze the dynamics of transnational terrorist targeting decisions between 1968 and 2008. The latter example's results have direct implications for contemporary policy about terrorists' targeting that are both novel and innovative in the study of terrorism. [R]</p>
<p>62.6886 BRENNAN, Geoffrey — <bold>The political economy of public debt</bold>. <italic>Constitutional Political Economy</italic> 23(3), Sept. 2012: 182–198.</p>
<p>Public debt alters the inter-temporal pattern of tax rates: it reduces current rates and increases future rates. Accordingly, whether the share of the cost of a given public expenditure is reduced or increased by debt for a given individual depends on the time-profile of that individual's income vis-à-vis others' incomes. Therefore, given the age-profile of income in virtually all Western countries, individuals will tend to be better off under current taxes the younger they are. If individuals vote according to their economic interests, and if they are tolerably well-informed, then the pattern of support for public debt will track age. And increases in the median age of the population will lead to larger public debt. In other words, public debt policy collapses to a kind of demographic politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Climate and environmental changes pose emerging and unique challenges to international security — as the global community experiences issues of food insecurity, severe droughts and floods — and have cascading impacts on energy supplies and infrastructure. Environmental hazards may shift abruptly, posing new risks to vulnerable systems and critical nodes in ways that diverge from historical experience. Effective risk assessments and planning will require understanding of how climate change will affect natural disasters and disaster response, and how hazards may be more extreme or unique from past experiences. This article discusses the role of climate change in affecting security planning from a military perspective, and how integration of scientific data and intelligence methods can foster assessment and effective response.

<p>By relating the concepts of “civil society” and “recognition”, I explore how associations are a potential locus of mutual recognition in any society, democratic or undemocratic. While there are many theorizations of both civil society and recognition in relation to democratic political contexts, normative theories seeking to explain the existence of associations in authoritarian societies are less robustly developed. Recognition, more specifically mutual recognition, is theorized not only as one key “good” sought through the act of forming the associations of civil society, but also as a human need which will prompt the act of association within dangerous contexts. This analysis informs thinking behind acts of civil disobedience springing from civil society, as well as rationalizations for dissident activities undertaken by associations within authoritarian regimes.

<p>In formal analysis of collective action, usually attention is focused on problems arising in aggregating the separate orderings into coherent collective results. Our concern is not with the aggregation problem. Instead, our focus is on the particular characteristics of the alternatives themselves. Alternatives in collective actions are fundamentally different from alternatives in market choice (apples and oranges). Regardless of motivation, collectivization forces attention on the distribution of benefits and costs among others in the sharing community. We first examine the formal structure of alternatives as these are confronted by a participant in the collective action. The second feature involves distributional patterns made necessary by collectivization. [R]</p>

<p>Theories that link domestic politics, domestic institutional structures, and leader incentives to foreign affairs have flowered in the past 25 years or so. By unpacking institutional variation across states and by drawing attention to agency issues between leaders, key backers, and citizens, models and empirical studies of linkage help explain even such fundamental phenomena between states as war and peace. In addition, theories of linkage politics explain phenomena not envisioned under earlier unitary-actor state models. We address how the linkage literature explains war-and-peace decisions, the democratic peace, nation-building, foreign aid, and economic sanctions by tying international politics and foreign policy to domestic political considerations.

<p>Advocates of complexity theory describe it as a new scientific paradigm. Complexity theory identifies instability and disorder in politics and policy-making, and links them to the behavior of complex systems. It suggests that we shift our analysis from individual parts of a political system to the system as a whole; as a network of elements that interact and combine to produce systemic behavior. This article explores the use of complexity theory in public policy, highlighting a small literature using the language of complexity directly to describe complex policy-making systems, and a larger literature identifying complexity themes. It then highlights the main problems to be overcome before complexity theory can become truly valuable in politics and policy-making. [R]</p>

<p>This review examines policy feedback effects among the mass public, with a focus on social policies in the US and Europe. It shows that existing policies feed back into the political system, shaping subsequent policy outcomes. Policies exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests, and beliefs of political elites and states but also those of the public. Public policies can shape political participation and attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects originate in elements of program design, such as the size, visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of beneficiaries, and modes of program administration. Thus, public policy itself shapes the distance of citizens from government, with profound implications for democratic governance. [R]</p>

Using data from the 2006–2007 Latin American Public Opinion Project AmericasBarometer surveys, the author develops a taxonomy to categorize democratic conceptualizations in terms of structural complexity and substantive content. The author then examines the effects of the structure and substance of democratic conceptualizations on attitudes toward democracy and on patterns of political participation. Findings indicate that variance in the structure of citizens' democratic conceptualizations brings several effects on political attitudes and behaviors. [R, abr.]</p>

It argues for the need to look back to the traditional political arena as an area of public statement, aggregation of social demands and the main option for political participation by large groups in Latin America. Strengthening democracy goes through the development of politics, rather than an escape into the networks of governance. [R, abr.]</p>
<p>62.6900 CARPENTER, Daniel — <bold>Is health politics different?</bold> <italic>Annual Review of Political Science</italic> 15, 2012: 287–311.</p>
<p>Is the politics of health different from the politics of other policy domains? I conclude that it is. Voters and politicians in the developed world appear more likely to accept redistributive claims with respect to health than they are in other policy areas. Nations vary less widely in spending on health than on other functions of government and policy. Moral claims made about health are more likely to attach to its politics than are moral claims about the environment, labor, finance, and energy. Bureaucratic agencies of state are more involved in the provision and regulation of health politics than in other areas. The article concludes with reasons why political scientists should approach cross-policy generalizations cautiously, and with a call for greater engagement with health politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Principal-agent relations are replete in politics; politicians are agents of electorates, bureaucrats are agents of executives, lower courts are agents of upper courts, etc. Commonly, principals are modeled as the rule-making body and agents as the rule-implementing body. However, principals often delegate the authority to make the rules themselves to their agents. The relationship between the lower federal courts and the [US] Supreme Court is one such example; a considerable portion of the law (rules) is made in the lower federal courts with the Supreme Court serving primarily as the overseer of those lower courts' decisions. We develop and test a principal-agent model of law-(rule)-creation in a judicial hierarchy. The model yields new insights about the relationship among various features of the judicial hierarchy that run against many existing perceptions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This rejoinder takes issue with two criticisms [L. Stanley, “The difference between an analytical framework and a theoretical claim: a reply to Martin Carstensen”, <italic>ibid</italic>. 60 (2), 2012: 474–482] of my article [“Ideas are not as stable as political scientists want them to be: a theory of incremental ideational change”, <italic>ibid</italic>., 59(3), 2011: 596–615; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 61.7136]. It argues that by presenting my critique of historical and discursive institutionalism as focused on the lack of “realism” in their standard conceptualization of ideas, Stanley creates a straw man. Instead, my criticism aims at the analytical outcomes of the mainstream understanding of ideas as generally coherent and stable, an approach to ontological criticism that Stanley explicitly approves of. Second, using examples from recent analyses of the financial crisis, I show the relevance of an ontology conducive to theories that capture and explain incremental ideational change. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In the information era, in which reigns the iconic representation of the news, which with its power to define acts on social perception provides interpretive keys that guide attention and shape the knowledge, the media are fundamental reducing or amplifying agents of the dynamics that affect the level of order/disorder of the social system. The social representation of risks is, in fact, influenced by the media system, which affects processes and hierarchies, reconstructing the symbolic universe for their evaluation. This implicates a great power of the media, in calming or alarming, justifying or claiming potentially hazardous situations. The civic function that they play, then, ends up colliding with the commercial logics of profit that are not exempt from sinking their hand in collective fears. [R]</p>

<p>A growing number of Asian scholars have been engaging in indigenous theory-building that seeks wider recognition for their local experiences and intellectual traditions in an IR discipline still dominated by Western theories and methods. After examining recent attempts to develop a distinctive Japanese approach to world politics, I argue that such attempts should proceed with great caution, for their epistemological underpinnings remain Eurocentric. A close look at the Japanese conceptions of international society indicates that they reproduce, rather than challenge, a normative hierarchy embedded in the English School between the creators of Westphalian norms and those at the receiving end. Japanese IR should recognize the plural origins and constitutional structures of international society and learn from social science and humanities communities in Asia and beyond. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>There are, broadly speaking, two distinctive constructivist approaches in security studies as well as IR according to their different meta-theoretical stances: conventional constructivism, and critical constructivism. Indeed, regarding how to understand state identity which is integral to national security, there has meta-theoretically been fierce contention between conventional and critical constructivist security studies. This article presents a pragmatic application of the two different constructivisms to capturing a more complete picture of state identity-formation in substantive empirical research of constructivist security studies. The pragmatic approach is that both constructivisms should be treated as different analytical frameworks for examining different (internal and external) faces of state identity-formation: the external construction of state identity can be well addressed by conventional constructivism, while the internal one by critical constructivism.

<p>62.6906 CLINTON, Joshua D. — <bold>Using roll call estimates to test models of politics</bold>. <italic>Annual Review of Political Science</italic> 15, 2012: 79–99.</p>
<p>Measuring the preferences of political elites is critically important for analyzing the determinants and consequences of elite behavior. The decisions that elites make when casting roll-call votes seem to provide an ideal opportunity for measuring elite preferences and testing theories of the political process. The fact that the resulting ideal points are a consequence of applying a statistical model to a model of individual choice, however, may affect their usefulness for measuring elite preferences and testing predictions regarding individual and collective decision-making. I use simulations to illustrate how the nonrandom selection of roll-calls may affect the ability to estimate ideal points that accurately reflect the preferences responsible for generating the observed votes, and I discuss work integrating the many models involved in the production and consumption of roll-call estimates.

<p>The idea of a separate (dyadic) peace among (liberal) democracies remains an alluring proposition for Western intellectuals and policy-makers, despite criticism from non-Western circles. We contend that explanations of the democratic peace have degenerated into theoretical stalemate, with the structuralist bias depicted in (neo)realist theories and, conversely, the individualist nature of liberal theories of the democratic peace, providing little room for alternative conceptions. As a distinct theory of foreign policy in which the relationship between agents and structures, and their intersection across differing levels of analysis, is more fully explored, neoclassical realism could hold potential for transcending the explanatory dichotomies plaguing the theorization of the democratic peace. Moreover, it could open up room for an alternative theoretical framework for theorizing the dyadic peace and its implications for how peace-building initiatives are approached. [R]</p>

<p>This article offers a critique of the so-called “new” legal pluralism within liberal constitutional democracies.

The author assesses the flaws of the legal pluralist approach with respect to gender equality and democratic legitimacy. She offers a different model of transformative accommodation that rests on a mix of legal approaches to the problems faced by religious women in constitutional democracies.

<p>The growing tendency to the privatization of state functions has opened a new chapter in the management of intercultural relations: the experiences with identity-based legal pluralism.

The effects of legal pluralism are neither emancipating nor alienating by themselves, but depend on their insertion in a wider context of legal and political practice. The recognition of multicultural jurisdictions can only be granted as a well justified exception under the control of an open, deliberative public sphere; on the other hand, the reasonability of cultural immunities, i.e. their rational legitimation in an open space of political discussion, largely depends on the possibility of interpreting social goods and principles of justice beyond their original cultural frame.

<p>While some types of democracy can sustain ethnic and cultural diversity, others can clearly undermine it. In <italic>The Dark Side of Democracy</italic> [<italic>Explaining Ethnic Cleansing</italic>, Cambridge, 2004], M. Mann argues that extreme crimes like genocide and ethnic cleansing tend to occur, or at least be legitimized, within a majoritarian democracy framework. This article broadens Mann's approach in two directions: first, it confirms that majoritarian democracy in plural societies can provide the pre-existing institutional context where conflict, nationalism and exclusion can thrive, eventually degenerating into self-destruction. Second, it focuses on the tendency by some governments to turn to patriotism and populism as sources of legitimacy at a time when the latter appears to be crumbling. In addition, the article questions both the “democratic peace” and the “failed democratization” approaches for their reliance on an ideal type and fixed notion of democracy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Third-party states' intervention in ongoing interstate conflicts is a triadic phenomenon which involves ties between a joining state and the two originators of the dispute. Existing studies on this topic focus either on the joiner's motivations or on the distinct dyadic relationships between joiners and the two separate combatants. Building on classic structural theories of triadic balance and on prior work by Z. Maoz, <italic>et al</italic>. (2007), we address the triadic aspect of both mediation and “joining behavior”. The nature of the triadic relations among disputants and third parties influences not just the likelihood of intervention, but also the type of intervention. We construct a triadic data-set that combines Corbetta and Dixon's (2005) data on partisan third-party interventions and Frazier and Dixon's (2006) data on neutral (intermediary) interventions in militarized interstate disputes.

<p>The multifaceted and strategic interactions inherent in the formation of international military pacts render the alliance decisions of states highly interdependent. We model the network of alliances in such a way as to capture the effects of covariates and account for the complex dependencies inherent in the network. Regression analysis, due to its foundational assumption of conditional independence, cannot be used to analyze alliance decisions specifically and interdependent decisions generally. We demonstrate how alliance decisions are interdependent and define the problems associated with the regression analysis of nonindependent dyads. We then show that alliances can naturally be conceived of as constituting a network, where alliance formation is an inherently interdependent process. We introduce the exponential random graph model for analyzing interdependence in the alliance network and estimating the effect of covariates on alliances.

<p>Recently, many prominent Chinese scholars have invested significant time and resources into searching for a distinctly Chinese approach to theorizing international relations. One of the potential sources often cited as a foundation for such an approach is China's long and rich history of political theorizing and political/cultural leadership. This article considers one of the key contributions to that debate from a Tsinghua University scholar, Yan Xuetong. Despite his rejection of the “China school” project, Yan has invested significant resources in a project that seeks to apply pre-Qin thought to contemporary international politics. Through a careful reading of this work, the article reveals a compelling narrative about China's future rise. Through discursively linking pre-Qin classical texts with China's modern rise, Yan Xuetong is using China's past to write its, and the world's, future.

<p>Recent developments in deliberative democratic theory have witnessed a renegotiation of classic deliberative principles to conceptualize the form deliberation could take under suboptimal speech situations. Application of deliberative virtues is negotiated, suggesting that different contexts warrant different deliberative expectations. Such approach presents a topical model of deliberation but it also raises concerns regarding the extent of these norms' negotiability, whether there remain core deliberative virtues that cannot be compromised regardless of the context. This piece addresses this theoretical challenge by putting forward a sequential analysis of democratic deliberation. It draws on “pragma-dialectics”, an approach to the study of argumentation that examines how a “difference of opinion” is handled in practice. [R, abr.]</p>

(1) Certain bureaucratic factors, particularly meritocratic recruitment, reduce corruption, even when controlling for a large set of alternative explanations. (2) The analysis shows that other allegedly relevant bureaucratic factors, such as public employees' competitive salaries, career stability, or internal promotion, do not have a significant impact.

<p>Researchers have been exploring government repressive behavior for decades, but the greatest improvements have come in the last two. For example, greater theoretical specification has allowed us to determine a great deal about what repression is and why it occurs, while greater methodological sophistication has allowed us to test these theories rigorously.

This article reviews our general knowledge of the topic and attempts to improve our understanding of how repressive action influences behavioral challenges to governments.

<p>Since the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, there has been much discussion about whether the international community has moved into a new post-Westphalian era, where states increasingly recognize certain shared norms that guide what they ought to do in responding to infectious disease outbreaks.

<p>The Trayvon Martin tragedy, the optimistic spectacle of the election and inauguration of B.

I argue that that the events are in fact closely linked in fundamental ways that are important not only to political scientists, but, more importantly, to all who care about the health of democracy within the US. Each event demonstrates the massive racial cleavages within the US. Each illustrates the nature of evolving racial order. I highlight the themes and processes that tie together these seemingly disparate events, some marked by hope, others by despair. [R, abr.]</p>

It is a fundamental mistake to understand and treat the UN Charter as an adaptation of traditional just war principles.

We use three key concepts of this theory (duality of structure, knowledgeability, and time-space) as sensitizing concepts for our analysis. We conclude that the greatest potential of Structuration Theory for management and organization studies is to view it as a process theory that offers a distinct building block for explaining intra and interorganizational change, as exemplified through concepts such as routine, script, genre, practice, and discourse.

<p>This article looks at a battery of organizational options aimed at transforming health care systems and argues that more attention must be paid to reforming the delivery mechanisms that are so crucial for health care systems' overall performance. To support improvement, policies can rely on organizational assets in two ways. First, reforms can promote the creation of new organizational forms; second, they can employ organizational levers (e.g., capacity development, team-based organizations, evidence-informed practices) to achieve specific policy goals. In both cases organizational assets are mobilized with a view to creating complete health care organizations — that is to say, organizations that have the capacity to function as high-performing systems.

<p>Some authors have speculated that carbon can be considered as a form of money. Not only is making money from carbon possible via several market devices but this process has also enabled the construction of carbon as a form of money. The importance of the social underpinnings of the commodification of carbon is highlighted and, following arguments about the performativity of economics, it is shown that carbon can perform functions similar to those of money. Following Actor–Network Theory, market devices such as registries or exchange platforms are explored to show how the market is constructed through them. Using the work of Zelizer and others on the sociology of money, it is argued that the construction of carbon money should be seen as a fundamentally social process.

<p>Ideology's crucial theoretical and empirical role in explaining political behavior makes it imperative that scholars understand how individuals conceptualize and apply ideological labels. The existing literature relies almost exclusively upon [US] data from the 1970s and 1980s, and does not examine how psychological factors influence conceptualizations of ideological labels. This article uses data from two original laboratory experiments to test the relative impact of four major policy dimensions on participants' evaluations of candidate ideology and to test authoritarianism's role in shaping ideological conceptualization. These analyses indicate that individuals most often define liberalism and conservatism primarily in terms of social policies closely associated with religious values, each of which invert traditional ideological orientations toward the appropriate size and role of government.

<p>Followers wish to coordinate their actions in an uncertain environment.

He learns about his world by listening to leaders. Followers fail to internalize the full benefits of coordination and so place insufficient emphasis on the focal views of relatively clear leaders. A leader sometimes stands back, by restricting what she says, and so creates space for others to be heard; in particular, a benevolent leader with outstanding judgment gives way to a clearer communicator in an attempt to encourage unity amongst her followers.

<p>Computer Network Attacks (CNAs) do not automatically come within the framework of the definition of “attack” in conformity with the law of armed conflict (LOAC). Consequently, some so-called CNAs (especially, those used only as means of intelligence gathering) do not qualify as “attacks” in the sense of LOAC. Only CNAs entailing “violence” do. CNAs constituting “attacks” in the LOAC sense are governed by the same rules that apply to kinetic attacks. In particular, they are subject to the application of the cardinal principle of distinction between combatants/military objectives and civilians/civilian objects. Consequently, deliberate attacks against civilians/civilian objects are prohibited, and so are indiscriminate attacks. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7430]</p>

<p>Federal political systems come in a variety of forms. In some, regional governments exercise considerable policy-making, taxation and administrative power. Other systems have a mixture of local units — some having limited policy-making and administrative powers, others having fairly extensive policy-making and administrative authority. Still other federal states have developed in ways that allow territorial diversity within fairly strong structures, principles and floors that are devised by the central government to ensure a unity of services across different regional governing units. For members of the EU, these levels of governance are overlaid by a further level of governance, expressed though directives, regulations, and benchmarking exercises developed in Brussels. It is this multi-layered environment that creates both opportunities and issues when it comes to policy-learning and policy-transfer. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7369]</p>

Some of these come from the increasingly larger and influential commercial sector which includes large multinational companies, while others are raised by ordinary people who are part of different networks. On the one hand, social networks influence and change methods of raising the awareness concerning human rights, yet on the other new media also contribute to the aggravation of global inequalities.</p>

<p>Order has been ascribed both to nature and to society. There is a long tradition of claiming that the social order and the natural order are closely linked. Radical enlightenment challenged that tradition. According to Spinoza (<italic>Ethica</italic>, Pars 1, Appendix) to call something orderly simply means that we can easily imagine and remember it; ascribing order thus betrays merely something about us, not about things. This challenging idea never became Enlightenment mainstream. In fact, ties between an objective natural order and our own human order were widely popularized in the 18th c. Yet one strand of thinking, set out to undermine traditional views of order, turned up trumps. The British Enlightenment succeeded in undoing the time-honored equation of order and hierarchy.

<p>An influential literature in IR argues that democratic institutions allow leaders to credibly signal their resolve in crises, thereby making their threats more likely to work than threats by non-democracies. This article revisits the quantitative evidence for this proposition, which we call the “democratic credibility hypothesis”, and finds that it is surprisingly weak. Close examination of the data-sets most commonly used to test this hypothesis reveals that they contain few successful democratic threats, or indeed threats of any kind. Moreover, these data-sets' outcome variables do not properly measure the effectiveness of threats, and therefore yield misleading results. The article then reassesses the democratic credibility hypothesis using the Militarized Compellent Threats data-set. The analysis indicates that threats from democracies are no more successful than threats from other states. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Its enthusiasts believe global civil society presages a more congenial kind of politics that transcends the system of sovereign states. Its critics deride its unrepresentativeness and complicity in established power relations. The critics can be answered by more subtle accounts of representation and by highlighting contestatory practices. Appreciation of the promise and perils of global civil society requires moving beyond preconceptions rooted in dated ideas about civil society and democracy as they allegedly function within states. Irrespective of the sophistication of such post-Westphalian moves, global civil society remains contested terrain, involving interconnected political and intellectual disputes. IR theory proves less useful than it should be in clarifying what is at stake. Democratic theory can be brought to bear, and this encounter sheds new light on what democracy itself can entail.

<p>Institutional design for democracy and its functioning in post-communist contexts have been a favorite topic in much of the literature on politics in the past two decades. However, many studies have failed to account for the effects of past legacies and institutions, as well as values and beliefs, many of which have crept into emerging democratic systems. These processes are best explained by joint utilization of historical and sociological strains of the New Institutionalist approach to institutional and policy analysis. This article outlines the debate on theoretical approaches within the public policy field and implications from the literature on New Institutionalism for the study of much contested concepts of institutions and policy. The framework [helps] explain political action embodied in specific institutional and policy design, its origins, functioning and reproduction. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6957]</p>

<p>D. Benson and A. Jordan's article “What have we learned from policy transfer research? Dolowitz and Marsh revisited” [<italic>ibid</italic>. 9(3), Sept. 2011: 366–378; <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6873] is debatable (1) because it more or less assumes that D. Dolowitz and D. Marsh's works have provided the intellectual foundations of the policy-transfer approach; and (2) because Benson and Jordan use a rather restrictive understanding of what counts as “policy transfer” studies. This article argues that we can find conceptualizations and questions about policy transfer in earlier works by other scholars; that Dolowitz and Marsh's definition of “policy transfer” is widely used, but has been subject to more criticisms than Benson and Jordan acknowledge; that a thorough assessment of our knowledge about policy transfer requires the use of a less restrictive approach; and that developments in policy transfer and associated research areas should be further integrated to improve our understanding of how and why governments use foreign experiences in devising their own policies.

<p>Current research has argued that direct legislation makes democracies better by helping to encourage better democratic citizenship. I test whether these effects are conditional on the diversity of the electorate. Theoretically, policy-making by majority rule will create conflict because of the perceived threat of large numerical minorities by majority groups. I hypothesize that in areas of greater diversity, democratic citizenship socialization effects can be mitigated, especially as it relates to trusting strangers. Using pooled data from the American National Election Study, I demonstrate the diversity conditional effects of ballot initiative context on generalized trust. [R]</p>

<p>This article investigates whether victims of torture and other serious human rights violations have an independent and enforceable right to reparation in international law. It analyzes whether international responsibility rules apply to individuals as they do to states and whether individual claims can be brought in domestic or foreign courts when no international remedy is available. By examining the different doctrinal positions in regards to individual rights and reparation, it concludes that it is incoherent to acknowledge the existence of substantive individual rights under general international law while contesting a corollary right to reparation. It further establishes that if it were considered that only states have the corresponding secondary rights, there would be clear gap in the human rights protection system.

<p>Much of what can be subsumed under the label “political cosmopolitanism” calls for the empowerment of international institutions because of increased global interdependencies. Surprisingly, however, few scholars have asked whether ordinary citizens share this way of thinking. To address this question, falsifiable hypotheses about the quality of and scope conditions for a minimally defined “public political cosmopolitanism” are derived from the literature and tested using the results of a representative survey of German citizens. I show that there is significant support for what I call the “interdependence model” of cosmopolitan politicization: German citizens' perception of transnational interdependencies (in terms of functional sensitivity as well as moral commitments) fosters beliefs in the capacity of international institutions to solve problems.

<p>Quantitative assessments of “country risk” produced by private rating agencies have become influential among multinational firms considering investment in the developing world. This article considers whether developing countries exhibiting more labor rights violations are associated with higher risk ratings. It draws from existing literature on the determinants of FDI and the relationship between labor rights and FDI to illuminate the ways in which labor repression may indicate increased risk for potential investors. It implements a set of time series of cross-sections models for 95 developing countries, from 1985 to 2003. These models present predictors of a long-established risk index, plus an additional latent risk measure created through factor analysis of three separate and distinct risk ratings. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The world is entering a new energy era marked by concerns over energy security, climate change, and access by the poor to modern energy services. Yet the current energy path is not compatible with sustainable development objectives. Global demand for energy will continue to grow; so will CO2 emissions. Achieving a low-carbon energy world will require an unprecedented technological transformation in the way energy is produced and used. That transformation has begun, as renewables capacity continues to grow, prices continue to fall, and shares of global energy from renewables continue to increase. Government policies are the main driver behind renewable energy's meteoric growth. Still, the world is tapping only a small amount of the vast supply of renewable energy resources.

<p>The EU is regarded as an alternative pole of attraction for ethnic and regional nationalists, as it facilitates the formation of regional self-governance and multilevel governance.

A comparative study of Scotland and Wales, which present different models of decentralization and paradiplomacy, helps define the direction of European paradiplomacy. What are the reasons for the successful and rapid development of certain diplomatic regions? What exactly is paradiplomacy as part of diplomacy, other than its academic definition?</p>

<p>This paper identifies “participative politics” and what is here called “self-service politics” as distinct political themes in many advanced democracies, in order to investigate their main elements and chart their interrelationships. These two themes are examined from the viewpoint of politicization and depoliticization tendencies. Participative politics consists of three main forms, defined as active citizenship, citizen networks and coproduction. Self-service politics, in turn, connects each of these forms to a larger political transformation by pitting themes of activating politics, social governance and accountability against them. The paper investigates what bearing participative politics, and self-service politics as its inevitable attendant, have on the sphere of democratic deliberation. [R]</p>

<p>How can democracies satisfy citizens' demands for legitimate decision making? This article reports findings from a randomized field experiment designed to mimic decision-making in large-scale democracies. Natural collectives of individuals with a shared history and future (high school classes) were studied. They were asked to make a decision about how to spend a sum of money under arrangements imposed by the researchers and distributed randomly across classes. Within this setting, empirical support for three ideas about legitimacy enhancing decision-making arrangements is tested: participatory constitution-making; personal involvement in the decision-making process; and fairness in the implementation of arrangements. Throughout the analyses it was found that personal involvement is the main factor generating legitimacy beliefs. [R]</p>

<p>Why do some voters support income-redistribution while others do not? Public assistance programs have two entangled effects on society: they equalize wealth, but they also cushion people against random catastrophes (like natural disasters). The authors conduct a laboratory experiment to determine how individuals' responses to the environment are related to their self-expressed political ideology and their self-interest. The findings support the hypothesis that ideology is associated with a person's willingness to use redistribution to reduce income inequality that is caused by luck, but it is not related to preferences for inequality that are not related to luck.

<p>Ratios of public debt to GDP are much discussed these days and questions concerning debt relative to taxation have long been explored by fiscal scholars. When public debt arises through parliamentary assemblies, the similarity of form between public and personal debt vanishes because a parliamentary assembly does not trade on its own account; to the contrary, it is an intermediary that brings together people who buy bonds and people who later pay the bondholders. In a republic, there is no sovereign who is indebted to ruled subjects. The institutional framework of republican governance transforms public borrowing into a process of intermediation among citizens, which leads in turn to the alternative orientation toward public debt that this paper explores.

<p>Income inequality is frequently given a central role in explaining diverse political outcomes, but the specifics of how, when, and [in] what circumstances inequality really matters are far from clear. This paper addresses these questions by examining whether greater levels of inequality raise the risk of expropriation associated with foreign investment. The results demonstrate that inequality matters in two distinct ways: (1) inequality elevates risk, although consistent with the argument developed herein, the effect is strongest when chief executives face high constraints on their decision making; (2) inequality mitigates the otherwise protective influence of political institutions on the risk of expropriation.

<p>Political scientists are beginning to come to terms with the importance of the internet to politics. The most promising way to study the internet is to look at the role that causal mechanisms such as the lowering of transaction costs, homophilous sorting, and preference falsification play in intermediating between specific aspects of the internet and political outcomes. This will allow scholars to disentangle the relevant causal relationships and contribute to important present debates over whether the internet exacerbates polarization in the US, and whether social media helped pave the way toward the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Over time, ever fewer political scientists are likely to study the internet as such, as it becomes more and more a part of everyday political life. [R, abr.]</p>

Then, after discussing the practicalities of crafting this type of governance structure, four Portuguese case studies are examined. The empirical evidence on mixed companies operating in the water, waste, transportation, and education sectors shows that the extreme complexity involved in the whole life-cycle management of these companies usually leads to a poor protection of the public interest.

Second, that trial processes are robust: being genuine attempts to decide according to proof and law, rather than returning decisions that it is hoped will placate the powerful. Third, that no individual entities, be they corporations or individuals, be they economically or politically or militarily powerful, are able to act outside the reach of legal remedy. The work of D. C.

<p>Diasporas have been contributing to their motherland for a long time, without waiting for policies to rally them and very often finding them to be the major obstacles for establishing the partnership. However, diaspora-motherland partnership is closely related to institutional framework, socio-economic settings, political milieu as well as issues of perceptions, images, trust and social identification, in both the home and host country, most of which are within the scope of public administration. Moreover, the evolution of policy awareness and a thorough understanding of the diaspora and development nexus are, in some countries, the result of the efforts of public administration. As a part of the effort to formulate effective and just policies used to respond to the brain drain, the paper analyzes and recommends different policy types. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article deals with the relation between politics, the political and violence. Western political theory has historically ended to reduce politics to the state and to dissolve violence in political ends. This tradition was broken by Max Weber and Carl Schmitt. The conceptual distinction between politics and the political is consolidated in contemporary political theory, but it does not resolve some of Weber's and Schmitt's insufficiencies. One is the relationship between <italic>the political</italic> and violence, which is analyzed in Cl. Lefort, J. Rancière and P. Bourdieu. We can formulate two questions: is it not true that conceiving politics as something not reduced to the state, (1) ends up omitting violence which is also present in the political, as if the only violence were that of the state?; and (2) downplays the monopoly of legitimate violence as a characteristic feature of politics?

Three constitutive features of public life, competition, publicity and uncertainty, compromise the potential of these traditions to affect in any fundamental way the practice of politics. Dissatisfaction with real existing democracy is not the consequence of some intellectual or moral failure uniquely characteristic of the <italic>persona publica</italic>, and attempts to reform it are misdirected to the extent that they imagine a better public life modeled on academic ideals.

<p>Wrestling with basic problems of causal inference between institutions and outcomes has been a central focus of political science over the last decade, and as elsewhere in the discipline, scholars of post-communism have begun to make some headway on these problems. Their efforts have not only advanced important debates about post-communism, but also in many cases addressed long-standing concerns in political science. This is in itself a sign that after years on the periphery of political science prior to 1989, the study of politics and economics in post-communist Eurasia has come in from the cold. [R]</p>

It is argued that there are a number of concepts of politics in play and that greater awareness regarding these conceptual differences helps clarify not only theoretical differences but also the possibilities for new theoretical development and reflection. Three conversations on politics are identified: (1) how politics concerns action and intentionality; (2) the modern organization of politics, spheres and sectors; and (3) the relationship between politics, ethics and science. Where the first and third conversations refer to politics as an act, in the second politics is inherently tied to the institutional or spatial structures of government — the state, the public, the political field, spheres, sectors or function.

<p>In the past decade, political science has witnessed a substantial amount of research using formal models to explicate the rationale for and effects of myriad aspects of bureaucratic institutions. Whereas previous waves of formal modeling on bureaucratic structure emphasized bureaucracy as a device for making policy commitments last, more recent formal research has grappled with information asymmetries and more explicitly considered the principal-agent relationship between bureaucracies and political authorities. We review several major recent themes in this literature, particularly the effects and development of bureaucratic hierarchies, the agency dilemmas inherent when policy-making authority is delegated to bureaucrats, and the effects of institutional structure on the development and sharing of expertise and capacity in bureaucracies.

<p>Recent analyses have demonstrated that personality affects political behavior. According to the mediation hypothesis, the effect of personality on political participation is mediated by classical predictors, such as political interest, internal efficacy, political discussion, or the sense that voting is a civic duty. This paper outlines various paths that link personality traits to two participatory activities: voter turnout in European Parliament elections and participation in protest actions. The hypotheses are tested with data from a large, nationally representative, face-to-face survey of the Spanish population conducted before and after the 2009 EP elections using log-linear path models that are well suited to study indirect relationships. The results clearly confirm that the effects of personality traits on voter-turnout and protest participation are sizeable but indirect. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the effect of governmental structures on the deterrent calculus of nation-states. It identifies certain governing structures, and their functional relationships, that are likely to influence a particular regime's propensity to take risks and engage in war. The article then explores the institutional dimension of three familiar case studies in which American or Western efforts at deterrence (or compellence) failed: Nazi Germany in the late 1930s; Imperial Japan during the early 1940s; and Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 1990 and 2003. These case studies highlight the point that there are significant differences in governmental structure among regimes that are generally classified as “nondemocratic” or “ideological/theocratic”.

<p>Social-psychological models of voting behavior systematically downsize the relevance of party leader evaluations by conceiving them as mere consequences of causally prior partisan attachments. However, the validity of this interpretation depends heavily on the effectively exogenous status of party identification. Empirical research shows that the assumed exogeneity of partisanship is, at best, doubtful. In such a context, single-equation models of voting are likely to provide seriously biased estimates. By employing the proper econometric procedures (instrumental variable estimation) and the most appropriate data sources to address causality issues (panel data) this study provides strong support in favor of the personalization hypothesis.

<p>Much of the literature on the ethics of international politics has downplayed the role of individuals in constituting the understandings and actions in this practice. However, individual agency and accountability are apparent in recent world events. Meanwhile, developments in moral philosophy have increasingly led scholars to re-examine the role that individual character traits — virtues — have in affecting how norms are selected and operationalized. Building on these insights, I argue here that a fully realized appreciation of the morality of international politics requires us to consider what virtues its individual participants are expected to exhibit to support and realize its norms. I outline how the virtues are deemed to underpin ethical practice and highlight two forms of analysis that may be used to explore this: decision-oriented virtue ethics and constitutive virtue ethics.

<p>This paper considers the issue of document type diversity in the Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP). For many years the CMP has been collecting and coding a variety of documents, such as speeches, pamphlets, newspaper articles and leaflets, as manifesto proxies. By using previously unexplored archival material to perform controlled comparisons between different types of documents, this paper argues that the coding of such documents introduced considerable measurement error to party position estimates. Statistical analyses indicate that this measurement error is systematic rather than random as it is often manifested as centrist bias in parties' left-right position estimates. Consequently, the paper argues that random error-correction methods cannot always correct for error attributed to the coding of proxy documents.

<p>Current literature offers models that predict a radicalization of minority demands as the result of diverse factors, including modernization processes, discrimination, and a mother country's support for the minority's demands. The article offers an alternative approach, combining the type of minority with the type of regime as fundamental elements that shape a minority's demands. The model distinguishes between four situations in which minorities might find themselves: an indigenous minority living in a democratic regime; an immigrant minority living in a democratic regime; an indigenous minority living in an ethnocratic regime, and an immigrant minority living in an ethnocratic regime. The demands that a minority develops in these different situations range along an axis from radical to moderate and from secession to integration on the basis of equality in a reconstituted state.

<p>The past three decades have witnessed the development of a rich literature that applies the formal tools of game theory to understanding international cooperation and international institutions. We divide this literature into three “generations” of scholarship. With a few notable exceptions, the first generation used very simple models — 2 2 normal form games — to understand why states need to cooperate and why they comply with their cooperative agreements under conditions of anarchy. Second-generation scholars began to use tailor-made models to address the neorealist–neoliberal debate and to turn to new questions, such as how international agreements are created and how domestic political divisions affect international cooperation. With answers to the key questions of how international agreements are created and complied with, third-generation scholars could turn to increasingly refined models to answer specific questions about international institutions.

<p>This article analyzes how civil society and its relation to democracy were conceptualized by its East European and South American proponents in their pre-democratic contexts, through an examination of declarations, newspaper articles, <italic>samizdat</italic> essays, diaries, letters from prison, academic articles and prize acceptance speeches written at the time. The analysis is organized under three main themes: activists' understanding of the nature of the regime, its aims and its relation to society; the features of the emergent civil society the writers of these documents desired, observed, and helped to create; and their strategies and aspirations in relation to “democratization”. On the basis of an analysis of commonalities in ideas across these two very different regional and ideological contexts, hypotheses are formulated as building blocks for a political theory of civil society under authoritarian rule.

<p>Terrorist actions are neither irrational nor dispassionate. This analysis contributes to the building of a theory of political passions. Motivations, beliefs, desires, feeling of indignation and injustice must be re-thought in the prospect of a theory of political passions which would be not opposed to reason. we are thus led to define, as far as terrorism in general is concerned, a kind of altruism at odds with any other moral or political standard, although not paradoxical in the least; rather than a rationality that would be only logical or efficient. The relation to the population, the social and political relationships between refusal, support and involvement can therefore be analyzed in terms of political emotions so that the distinction between terrorism and resistance should become conceptually possible.

<p>Scientific evidence suggests that to have a 75 percent chance of limiting warming in 2100 to 2°C above the pre-industrial level, the cumulative emissions of CO2 over the period 2010–2050 should be capped at 657.1 Gt. This article examines the distribution of such an emission budget by applying different ethical perspectives. It first analyzes the paths for sharing the emission budget, that is, the major families of distributive patterns that vindicate a number of elementary principles and criteria of distribution. Subsequently, it presents and discusses the shares of the emission budget attributed to states, regions and groupings of states according to the paths investigated and it draws some reflections on the implications of such shares for the ethics of mitigation. Finally, it advances some lessons for international climate policy. [R]</p>

(2) If the unit of analysis is the individual, and if the individual's primary project is his or her liberty, must this approach threaten the communitarian self-understandings of some groups? (3) Does it fundamentalize political liberalism? (4) What about addressees likely to reject thin norms, such as persons guided by an otherworldly authority or an authoritarian ideology? (5) Is this approach defeated where territorialized membership rights clash with thin norms, for example in the EU: a political and economic community internally somewhat thin yet externally thick?

<p>Real reforms attempt to change how health care is financed and how it is rationed. Three main explanations have been offered to explain why such reforms are so difficult: institutional gridlock, path dependency, and societal preferences. The latter posits that choices made regarding the health care system in a given country reflect the broader societal set of values in that country and that as a result public resistance to real reform may more accurately reflect citizens' personal convictions, self-interest, or even active social choices. “Conscientious objectors” may do more to derail reform than previously recognized.

<p>This article contributes to the emerging literature on transparency by developing and empirically testing a theoretical framework that explains the determinants of local government website transparency. What institutional factors determine the different dimensions of government transparency? The framework distinguishes three dimensions of transparency — decision-making transparency, policy-information transparency, and policy-outcome transparency — and hypothesizes three explanations for each: organizational capacity, political influence, and group influence on government. Results indicate that each dimension of transparency is associated with different factors. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Despite the centrality of party identification to our understanding of political behavior, there remains remarkable disagreement regarding its nature and measurement. Most scholars agree that party identities are quite stable relative to attitudes. But do partisans defend their identities, or does this stability result from Bayesian learning? I hypothesize that partisans defend their identities by generating “lesser of two evils” justifications. In other words, partisan identity justification occurs in multidimensional attitude space. This also helps to explain the weak relationship between attitudes toward the two parties observed by proponents of multidimensional partisanship. I test this hypothesis in an experiment designed to evoke inconsistency between one's party identity and political attitudes. To establish generalizability, I then replicate these results through aggregate level analysis of data from the ANES. [R]</p>

<p>The study of religion holds great promise for the study of identity, institutional origins, the state, and the strategies of institutional actors in comparative politics. Doctrinal differences translate into distinct patterns of state institutions, economic performance, and policy preferences. Religious attachments affect voting and popular mobilization. Churches can become powerful institutional players that lobby, influence policy, and form effective coalitions with both secular and denominational partners. Finally, natural religious monopolies and (conversely) resolutely secular countries show how churches have played a central role in the struggle of nations and states. The relationship is thus mutual: religion influences political attitudes and institutions, and politics affects religious practice and political activity. [R]</p>

<p>There is growing evidence that preferential trade agreements (PTAs) provide strong institutional incentives to prevent international conflict among member states, often creating the conditions of trust that can help prevent militarized aggression. We provide an approach to the study of how international institutions influence conflict behavior that considers how PTAs exclude as well as include members and create asymmetrical relationships among members that could exacerbate conflict. PTAs do more than create expectations of economic gains and reduce opportunism; they also create hierarchical relations between states, which can encourage conflict under different conditions due to distrust. We theorize these conditions for militarized international disputes, develop appropriate measures using social network analysis, and test our expectations on new PTA data during the period 1950 to 2000.

<p>Recent work by C. Boix and D. Acemoglu and J. Robinson has focused on the role of inequality and distributive conflict in transitions to and from democratic rule. We assess these claims through causal process observation, using an original qualitative dataset on democratic transitions and reversions during the “third wave” from 1980 to 2000. We show that distributive conflict, a key causal mechanism in these theories, is present in just over half of all transition cases. Against theoretical expectations, a substantial number of these transitions occur in countries with high levels of inequality. Less than a third of all reversions are driven by distributive conflicts between elites and masses. We suggest a variety of alternative causal pathways to both transitions and reversions. [R]</p>

<p>The article analyzes scientific publications on citizen participation in local governance. It asks how empirical studies on local sustainable development planning (SDP) and New Public Management (NPM) practices construct legitimate citizen participation. In general, studies on citizen participation have not conceptualized the relations between citizens and power-holders as questions of legitimacy. However, the studies approaching citizen participation in the local processes of SDP and NPM include various empirical, theoretical and normative arguments for citizen participation. These arguments recognize, accept and support particular activities, arguments and outcomes of citizen participation, and include and exclude agents and issues. They construct and reflect the definition of legitimacy in the local governance. As constructed by scientific texts, justifications for citizen participation reproduce a discursive structure in which citizen participation becomes marginalized and citizens' views excluded.

<p>This article examines how the effect of education on institutional trust varies cross-nationally as a function of the pervasiveness of public-sector corruption. We approach institutional trust as a performance-based evaluation of political institutions. Given their greater capacity to accurately assess the level of corruption coupled with their stronger commitment to democratic values, we hypothesize that higher-educated citizens should react differently to corruption from those with less education. Employing multilevel models, we find that education has both a conditional and a conditioning effect on institutional trust. (1) Education is negatively related to institutional trust in corrupt societies and positively related to institutional trust in clean societies. (2) The corrosive effect of corruption on institutional trust worsens as education improves. The article discusses the implications of these findings for the functioning of contemporary democracies.

<p>We argue that in the real world leaders do not simply look at costly signals, but they rely to an important extent on their personal impressions of other leaders, taking these as credible indicators of sincerity. Our approach thus builds both upon the literature on interstate communication and perceptions and upon more recent research in the field of neuroscience regarding affective information. To probe the plausibility of our theory, we focus on the indicators British Prime Minister N. Chamberlain used to evaluate German sincerity in the late 1930s and R. Reagan employed to make sincerity judgments about Soviet intentions in the late 1980s. Additionally, we briefly discuss the 1961 Vienna Summit between J.F. Kennedy and N. Khrushchev as an illustration of how personal impressions can also result in negative assessments of sincerity. [R, abr.]</p>

Armed groups become empowered in these states and then pose threats to local, regional, and even global stability. As a result, weak, failing, and failed states will constitute a major international security problem well into the 21st c., because they provide havens in which increasing powerful armed groups can recruit, plan, train, and build up a resource base and from which they can deploy to execute operations.

<p>What unites the political theory and the applied literature is a concern with the normative-political potential of desecuritization.

The last part provides a reading of the varied use of desecuritization in applied analysis and shows how these can be seen as falling into four forms of desecuritization, each identifying a distinct ontological position as well as a set of more specific political and normative questions.

<p>This article documents that pre-colonial state development was an impediment to the development of democracy outside Europe, because indigenous state institutions constrained the European colonial endeavor and limited the diffusion of European institutions and ideas. Some countries were strong enough to resist colonization; others had enough state infrastructure that the colonizers would rule through existing institutions. Neither group therefore experienced institutional transplantation or European settlement. Less developed states, in contrast, were easier to colonize and were often colonized with institutional transplantation and an influx of settlers carrying ideals of parliamentarism. Using OLS and IV estimation, I present statistical evidence of an autocratic legacy of early statehood and document the proposed causal channel for a large sample of non-European countries.

<p>The struggle for the right to health in the face of health inequalities requires embracing three critical considerations: redistribution, representation, and recognition. While the analysis of the right to health has been formulated predominantly around theories of distributive justice, I suggest that a more normatively compelling account will link the politics of economic redistribution to the politics of sociocultural recognition. A recognition approach, which views rights claims as grounded on the vulnerability of the human condition, can show how rights are emergent in political action and that the ability to claim and exercise the human right to health is contingent upon recognition of diverse sociopolitical statuses. This theme is illustrated by comparing conservative, affirmative, and transformative processes of recognition in the struggle for access to essential antiretroviral medicines by South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign.

<p>This paper engages the ongoing soft-balancing debate by suggesting a new analytical framework for states' countervailing strategies — a negative balancing model — to explain why states do not form alliances and conduct arms races to balance against power or threats as they previously did. Negative balancing refers to a state's strategies or diplomatic efforts aiming to undermine a rival's power. By contrast, positive balancing means to strengthen a state's own power in world politics. I argue that a state's balancing strategies are shaped by the level of threat-perception regarding its rival. The higher the threat-perception, the more likely it is for a state to choose positive balancing. The lower the threat-perception, the more likely it is for a state to choose negative balancing.

<p>The sovereign debt crisis has revived the debate about the dictatorship of the markets. It is argued that the sole goal of the markets is speculation; they are short-sighted; they base their decisions on ratings issued by irresponsible agencies and put inadmissible pressure on borrowing countries. Most of these criticisms essentially result from the need, for governments, to find a scapegoat to justify sacrifices in the eyes of a reluctant citizenship. These sacrifices seem all the more unjust to public opinion, as they aim to reimburse a debt for which citizens do not feel individually responsible. The fact remains, however, that by adopting unsustainable budget policies, the states have put themselves in a position of dependency on the markets, thereby leading to a situation where the supervisory roles have been reversed.

Ideological bias towards Weberian modes of governance and rational-actor models of political behavior, and a growing belief in the power of “evidence-based policy-making” fail to reflect the extent to which informal and patronage-based forms can sometimes play a positive role in enabling poverty reduction, as well as the fact that political elites respond to a wider range of incentives than commonly assumed, including a role for political ideology and discourse rather than evidence per se. These findings offer further support for a fundamental rethinking around the role of politics in shaping development. [R]</p>

<p>The extreme optimism that shaped the nascent democracy-promotion community in the 1980s and early 1990s has been strongly tempered by an increasing number of setbacks to the global expansion of democracy. F. Zakaria's influential “illiberal democracies” argument was an early example of this trend towards a more uncertain outlook about democracy's prospects. His argument was useful in focusing attention on the conceptual underpinnings of these practices. Despite the promising starting point, Zakaria reached limited and conservative conclusions, essentially calling for the revival of a Whig approach: liberalism first, democracy later. Furthermore, his conceptual analysis was overly restricted: democracies are liberal or they are illiberal. This article challenges, revises, and extends Zakaria's arguments, by examining alternative models of democracy that lie both within and beyond liberalism. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The information economy is undergoing fundamental changes, concerning the ways in which information goods are owned and traded, and how they are regulated through public and private rules. Prompted by the predominantly juristic discussion on the copyright regime in the information age, this article offers a regulatory perspective on the evolving governance arrangements that shape the market for cultural goods. Google Books, the unsuccessful but very well documented attempt to reutilize the vast amount of out-of-print works, serves as an example to illuminate the ongoing transformation of information governance. Embedded in an evolving mode of industry self-regulation, a whole new set of information assets is emerging that implies close monitoring of users and communication practices in order to unfold its economic potential.

<p>We assess whether recent research has become more theoretically coherent, more attentive to context, and broader in both scope and topical focus, all of which are crucial to advancing the systematic study of interest groups and their policy-making activities. Overall, we observe more large-scale and longitudinal studies between 1996 and 2011 than F. Baumgartner and B. Leech [<italic>Basic Interests: The Importance of Groups in Politics and in Political Science</italic> (1998)] observed between 1950 and 1995. This newer literature also is much more likely to focus on key issues for students of politics, and to give attention to the context in which organizations operate to affect public policy. However, we see minimal evidence that scholars addressing similar questions within the subfield are operating from one or a few shared theoretical frameworks. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Following costly military defeats, political elites usually attempt to persuade their publics that the battlefield outcome was not a shameful defeat but a “moral victory”. Yet, only sometimes do their public accepts these claims. The paper explains this variation in the domestic publics' perceptions in the cases of non-democratic entities. The key variable that determines actors' success in claiming a moral victory is the existence of certain battlefield elements, or at least symbolic military acts/achievements of the defeated actor which can persuade his public that these battlefield elements existed. Propaganda efforts to misrepresent the battlefield facts can play only a secondary role and only under certain conditions. [R]</p>

<p>This article analyzes the social potential of regional integration processes by using the example of European integration. Recent case law from the ECJ has led some observers to argue that judicial decisions increasingly provide European politics with a “Polanyian” drive. We test this claim by distinguishing three dimensions to European economic and social integration: market-restricting integration, market-enforcing integration, and the creation of a European area of nondiscrimination. We also identify two forms of integration that have different speeds, scopes, and potentials: political integration and judicial integration. The evidence shows that the EU has come closer to Hayek's vision of “interstate federalism” than is usually warranted because market-enforcing integration and European nondiscrimination policies have asymmetrically profited from “integration through law”.

<p>Can we devise mechanisms that allow voters to express the intensity of their preferences when monetary transfers are forbidden? As opposed to the usual voting system (one person — one decision — one vote), we propose a voting system where each agent is endowed with a fixed number of votes that can be distributed freely among a set of issues that need to be approved or dismissed. Its novelty relies on allowing voters to express the intensity of their preferences in a simple manner. This voting system is optimal in a well-defined sense: in a strategic setting with two voters, two issues and preference intensities uniformly and independently distributed across possible values, Qualitative Voting Pareto dominates Majority Rule and, moreover, achieves the only <italic>ex ante</italic> optimal (incentive-compatible) allocation.

<p>Over the past four decades, violence against women (VAW) has come to be seen as a violation of human rights and an important concern for social policy. Yet government action remains uneven. Some countries have adopted comprehensive policies to combat VAW, whereas others have been slow to address the problem. Using an original dataset of social movements and VAW policies in 70 countries over four decades, we show that feminist mobilization in civil society-not intra-legislative political phenomena such as leftist parties or women in government or economic factors like national wealth-accounts for variation in policy development. In addition, we demonstrate that autonomous movements produce an enduring impact on VAW policy through the institutionalization of feminist ideas in international norms. This study brings national and global civil society into large-<italic>n</italic> explanations of social policy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The phrase “resource wars” covers an ever-widening list of categories that range from minerals and oil to rhino horn, timber and much more; anchored around this milieu are phrases like “natural security” and “environmental security”. While this proliferation has splintered the identity of the phrase “resource wars”, the more worrying impact is that it has allowed governments to ignore pressing problems related to biodiversity and the environment because the solutions are deemed too complex, time-consuming, and expensive with indeterminate outcomes. However, failing to address these problems not only increases the risk of conflict but also leads to a lack of trust in governments with the result that they risk being seen as “the enemy of the people”.

<p>We address the question of why in some de facto states something like “dominant party” politics has emerged, whereas in others there at least appears some form of real political competition. We empirically assess some of the commonly cited factors that affect the character of politics within de facto states (the wealth of the entity, the militarization of society, the level of ethnic homogeneity, and political institutional features). Using Fuzzy-Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), a method developed specifically to deal with the “small <italic>N</italic> problem” in empirical inquiry, we apply this framework to 13 post-secessionist unrecognized states.

<p>Political discourse tends to deal with economic constraints on an incantatory mode, as if they resulted from “market forces” or “speculation”.

Far from actively plotting or speculating against the states, most of these actors work in total symbiosis with them. Their operating logics are different, depending on whether they are public or private. Private agents tend to focus on pursuing their economic interests, while public organizations defend the institutional logics that define them. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6971]</p>

<p>Constitutional revolution can mean either revolutions that establish a new constitutional and even a constitutionalist order, as well as political processes that accomplish revolutionary results through constitutional means, whether open or silent. Evidently, all four possibilities seem to have been realized in contemporary political upheavals. Tunisia, despite having initially employed non-constitutional means, may be on its way to a constitutionalist outcome, while the revolutionary process in Egypt appears to be generating a non-constitutionalist regime. Furthermore, fundamental legal transformation can be open as in South Africa or silent as in Israel. All the differences aside, however, a false dichotomy between restoration and novelty underlies all these understandings of constitutional revolution.

<p>The existing literature on the political economy of taxation explores how the mobility of firms affects the ability of governments to tax capital. In this article the author tests the relationship between corporate tax rates and multinational investment decisions in advanced, industrialized economies. He utilizes a time-series cross-sectional general error correction model to explore the impact of corporate taxation rates and FDI inflows in up to 19 OECD economies from 1980 to 2000. To mitigate potential endogeneity problems, the author's identification strategy takes advantage of delays between the passage of tax reductions and the implementation of these policies. The author finds no relationship between corporate tax rates and flows of foreign direct investment. This finding has implications on the link between globalization and domestic politics. [R]</p>

<p>We treat economic inequality and collective action as endogenous, and examine whether economic inequality can foster collective action even when all individuals can gain from free-riding. Using evolutionary game theory and computer simulations, we study whether cooperation can evolve when agents play multiple, one-shot prisoner's dilemma (PD) games per generation and employ strategies that condition cooperative play on their game partners' wealth holdings. In this game environment, we find that collective action succeeds via a strategy in which players choose to cooperate when joining a PD with an economic equal and defect when partnered with a player possessing wealth holdings unequal to their own. These results signal an alternative avenue through which economic inequality can influence the viability of collective action. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Transatlantic IR theory has more or less neglected the international relations of East Asia. This relative neglect has come in different forms: excluding East Asian cases from analysis, including East Asian cases but miscoding or misunderstanding them, or including them but missing the fact that they do not confirm the main findings of the study. A review of the East Asia–related literature on three important clusters of theorizing — structural theories of conflict, institutional design and efficacy, and historical memory — suggests that this neglect of the region (and other regions) may come at a cost to transatlantic IR, not only in terms of data problems but also in terms of omitted or downplayed explanatory variables and theoretical arguments.

<p>This study questions the assumptions and relevance of the thinking behind counterinsurgency doctrine. It suggests that the ultimate effect of its dominance is to reduce the highly contingent nature of war to a list of techniques, the application of which are regarded as a sufficient precondition whenever states deem that they are confronted by conflicts that can be described as an “insurgency”. Such assumptions are both arbitrary and risk crowding out necessary, although by their nature very difficult, political judgments that are required for the effective construction and implementation of strategies that seek to ensure that the ends sought are proportional to the means employed.

<p>We address the information problem from the politicians' perspective. We investigate to what extent politicians are able to make accurate assessments of the electorate's signals. In practical terms, we analyze to what extent politicians can predict the election outcome for their party in an upcoming election. Our focus is on how such assessment is affected by the electorate's complexity. We hypothesize that complexity, which has two dimensions — the electorate's size and heterogeneity — has two distinct effects on assessment: (1) it makes assessment of voters' preferences harder as it complicates communication between voters and politicians; (2) as complexity leads to more uncertainty about voters' preferences, it increases wishful thinking, leading to systematically biased predictions.

<p>This paper first argues that the present use of “ideal theory” is unhelpful, and that an earlier and apparently more natural use focusing on perfection would be preferable. Second, it shows that revision of the use of the term would better expose two distinctive normative issues, and shows how some contributors to debates about ideal theory have gone wrong partly through not distinguishing them. Third, in exposing those two distinct normative issues, it reveals a particular way in which ideal theory even under the more specific, revisionary definition will often be central to working out what to do in non-ideal circumstances. By clarifying the terms, it clears the ground for turning to the actual problem, which is what to do in our non-ideal and often tragic circumstances. [R, abr.]</p>

We explore the implications of this uncontroversial claim for the practice of political philosophers.

<p>The article reviews recent advances in the study of violence in civil wars. It describes the baseline “control-collaboration” model, discusses alternatives to it, and reviews recent empirical studies that supply additions, corrections, extensions, and refinements to the baseline model. It highlights some of the assumptions that can be relaxed based on this new research, e.g.: that in civil war context information is produced exclusively or even primarily by civilian denunciations at the local level; that violence is only used to deter civilian defection; that conflict is always locally dyadic; and that rival factions are organizationally indistinct from each other and resort to similar repertoires of violence. These refinements and extensions have the potential to produce a novel set of predictions that can be tested against both existing and new data. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6883]</p>

<p>This article argues that the concept of “state feminism” no longer adequately captures the complexity of emerging feminist engagements with new forms of governance. It suggests that “market feminism” offers a new conceptual framework from which feminist engagements with the state can be analyzed and evaluated, and the changes within state feminism can be understood. The article documents the growing feminist embrace of the logic of the market, which manifests itself in changed practices and priorities. The article gives examples of “market feminism” and argues that the move from state feminism to market feminism impacts on both the political practices and policy priorities of women's policy agencies.

<p>Political frameworks such as assimilation, accommodation and multiculturalism that have sought to address difference have failed to achieve political equality and inclusion for immigrants, driven primarily by the flawed understanding of culture and identity in multicultural states. Offering a brief critique of these models, this essay advocates the use of deliberative theory in citizenship education as instrumental to building capacities for inclusive citizenship and cultivating belonging and inclusion in diverse societies. Deliberative practice enables the reconceptualization of citizenship as performative, involving responsibilities for dialogic engagement. Such capacities and responsibilities are indispensable for a just political order in multicultural societies. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7138]</p>

<p>Can men and women have equal levels of voice and authority in deliberation or does deliberation exacerbate gender inequality? Does increasing women's descriptive representation in deliberation increase their voice and authority? We answer these questions and move beyond the debate by hypothesizing that the group's gender composition interacts with its decision rule to exacerbate or erase the inequalities. We test this hypothesis and various alternatives, using experimental data with many groups and links between individuals' attitudes and speech. We find a substantial gender gap in voice and authority, but as hypothesized, it disappears under unanimous rule and few women, or under majority rule and many women. Deliberative design can avoid inequality by fitting institutional procedure to the social context of the situation. [R]</p>

<p>The current model of celebrity leadership is based on three mainstays: mass media, political advisors' activity, and public opinion polls. The mediatization of politics has provoked both negative and positive effects. The former include the tabloidization of politics, the superseding of political discourse by simplified advertising, and the creation of newsmakers. Positive effects of increased media participation in political life include faster information flow and the enforced competitiveness and professionalization of political action. The reverse phenomenon (i.e., demediatization) also plays a crucial role. It consists in a specific form of communication that happens between political actors and the public where the media are no more than a tool for political actors. Both politicians and voters thus let themselves be seduced by media's magic.</p>

<p>When the economy in a single country contracts, voters often punish the government. When many economies contract, voters turn against their governments much less frequently. This suggests that the international context matters for the domestic vote, yet most research on electoral accountability assumes that voters treat their national economies as autarkic. We decompose two key economic aggregates — growth in real gross domestic product and unemployment — into their international and domestic components and demonstrate that voters hold incumbents more electorally accountable for the domestic than for the international component of growth. Voters in a wide variety of democracies benchmark national economic growth against that abroad, punishing (rewarding) incumbents for national outcomes that underperform (outperform) an international comparison. Tests suggest that this effect arises from “pre-benchmarking” by the media when reporting on the economy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Practitioners and politicians have long debated the wisdom of pushing countries to hold elections, with some arguing for its necessity and others warning of its futility and even danger.

This article discusses the myriad international forms of engagement with elections and reviews the research on their ability to improve election quality. It also explores the more nefarious international activities, which are even less well understood than the efforts to improve elections. Given the mixed outcomes and findings, much work remains to be done, especially in specifying the conditions under which various effects occur. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The current economic crisis challenges the constitutive rules of global finance. The current reform debate focuses on possible changes of Basle II and thus banking regulation only. The idea that the asymmetric dispersion of information is the “real” cause of the crisis is reiterated constantly in public documents. However, the argument rests upon two assumptions: that crises are exogenous to otherwise efficient and stable markets, and that finance is an autonomous field where the primary focus of the current reform can then concentrate on its laws. It is thought that it is enough to reform financial markets to stabilise the global economy. This article suggests that this belief is utterly misguided and argues that a more comprehensive picture of the current turmoil needs to abandon exactly these two assumptions. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>No state can ever be sure that it will never be attacked by hostile military nation-states or by non-nation state actor (terrorists). Therefore, all states are under compulsion to maintain defense establishments sufficiently strong and powerful to deter aggression. The security dilemma is dynamic. One state's efforts to increase its security by building up its armed forces generally motivate neighboring states to follow the same policy. Therefore, whatever might be a contributing factor, the risk of conflicts is inherent in an anarchic world of sovereign states. Moreover, the contemporary problem of global terrorism has manifested the changing nature of the security dilemma. This paper focuses on the concept of anarchy, the security dilemma and terrorism as New Security Dilemma embedded in international politics. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Despite the significant government focus on community engagement, there is some question as to how effectively community views are incorporated and heard by government. In exploring these concerns, we suggest that it is more effective to consider the issue from the perspective of communities engaging government rather than government engaging community. In doing this, we have developed a methodological approach that focuses on building the capacity of community to more effectively engage government in an effort to strengthen their own community in ways that are meaningful within that community. We illustrate this process with a case study of government engagement undertaken by representatives from the small rural community of Tara in western Queensland. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>When compared to the strategies of superpowers, the strategies of medium powers are often different due to a medium power's frequent desire to act independently while being comparatively more constrained by available material and fiscal resources. For this reason, the space strategy of medium space powers is different from either emerging or super space powers. The fundamental purpose of any medium space power's space strategy should be to ensure access to and use of celestial lines of communication to support national objectives, whether during peace or conflict. When deciding how best to protect its interests in space, a medium space power will have a variety of non-military and military options. These options may include diplomacy, economic measures, benign defensive technologies, or the employment of offensive actions in space. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Strategies that seek to assure other states about their security have the potential to reduce international conflict and dissuade states from seeking nuclear weapons.

To facilitate further empirical research on assurance strategies, this article identifies variations in the terminology scholars and policy-makers have used to refer to such strategies and describes the concept of assurance associated with each variant. It clarifies and standardizes usage and shows that there is a general, overarching concept of assurance that links the different variants. It also summarizes existing bodies of empirical research that are relevant to assessing the utility of different forms of assurance. [R]</p>

<p>This study tests the effectiveness of naming and shaming by transnational advocacy networks in reducing the severity of ongoing instances of genocide or politicide.

I test whether naming and shaming by NGOs, the media, and IOs significantly reduces the severity of the killing. Ordered logit analyses of ongoing genocides and politicides from 1976 to 2008 reveal that naming and shaming by Amnesty International, the Northern media, and the UNCHR have significant ameliorative effects on the severity of the most extreme atrocities.

We present relevant findings from psychology and behavioral economics, notably those of “construal level theory” (CLT), and explore these findings' implications for three classic questions — international cooperation, preventive war, and coercion. We argue that experimental evidence regarding how people discount future value and construe future events challenges the conventional wisdom on international cooperation. We further maintain that CLT helps explain a longstanding puzzle about preventive wars — namely why they are often initiated too late by declining powers but too soon by rising competitors. Finally, we rely on these findings to explain who wins coercive contests and why compellence is often, but not always, harder than deterrence. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Rational choice theory (RCT) constitutes a major approach of sociological theorizing and research in Europe. We review key methodological and theoretical contributions that have arisen from the increasing empirical application of RCT and have the potential to stimulate the development of RCT and sociology more generally. Methodologically, discussions have evolved around how to test RCT empirically and how to realize its ambition to give theory-guidance to social research. These discussions have identified the strengths and shortcomings of direct and indirect test strategies using survey or experimental data. Metatheoretically, different views have emerged about how to deal with counter-evidence from applied fields of sociological research. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article explores the conditions under which political modernization leads to nation-building, to the politicization of ethnic cleavages, or to populism, by modeling these three outcomes as more or less encompassing exchange relationships between state elites, counter-elites, and the population. Actors seek coalitions that grant them the most advantageous exchange of taxation against public goods and of military support against political participation. Modeling historical data on the distribution of these resources in France and the Ottoman Empire from 1500 to 1900 shows that nation-building results from strong state centralization and well-established civil societies; ethnic closure, from weak state capacity and civil societies; and populism, from medium centralization and weak civil societies. The results are consistent with French and Ottoman political histories of the 18th and 19th c. [R]</p>

<p>Recently, some countries have witnessed changes in the number, gender, and/or prestige of women's appointments. What accounts for this variation in women's access to ministerial power? To answer this question, we posit three competing theoretical explanations: political institutions, social indicators of gender equality, and broader trends in women's political recruitment. To test these hypotheses, we compile an original dataset of 117 countries and construct a new measure — the Gender Power Score — which differentially weights cabinet positions based on women's numbers and the gender and prestige of the ministries to which they are assigned. Using a finite mixture model to evaluate competing hypotheses, we find that political variables — rather than social factors — have the strongest impact on gender parity in cabinets. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Based on a review of experiences in Lyons, Stuttgart and London, this article reflects upon the implications of metropolitanisation for democracy. It examines the institutional set-up of metropolitan authorities, the election procedures of representatives as well as dynamics of decision-making within them. Despite contrasted institutional settings, political logics and territorial interest representation are present in policy-making at the metropolitan level to a strikingly similar extent. This results in power-sharing strategies among the major political forces and a move away from majoritarian towards more consensual patterns of decision-making.

<p>A growing majority of the world's citizens lives in metropolitan areas. The question of how these areas can be governed has been the subject of a long-running scientific and political debate. This introductory article retraces the main arguments in this debate and argues that it has gained a new scope. Metropolitan governance is no longer a question of local interest limited to single metropolitan areas, but increasingly relates to changes and developments in the organization of the wider state apparatus.

<p>This article analyzes the role that expectations about particularistic expectations of the political public play in the relationship between political actors and voters. It questions the system-theoretical assumption that political elections and public communication about politics create an unknown public and that parties therefore can attract voters only with the help of relatively universalist programs. Beyond the universalism induced by the mass media parties and politicians utilize opportunities to distinguish segments of the political public in attempts to attract votes by appealing to particularistic expectations. This is possible without recourse to the politically relevant general public when administrative decision-making and individual voting behavior are linked by clientelism and/or by local embeddedness in electoral districts. The article proposes a perspective that assumes variable weight for this distinction. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Modern democracy is based on pluralism (of ideas, values, interests) and therefore on a certain measure of conflict. However, in a democracy — when the model works — conflict is deradicalized: into competition without violence where peaceful means (primarily elections) are used to resolve divergences. The article seeks how that is possible, in particular in what ways democracy is able to tame political conflict. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Assuming that migration threat is multi-dimensional, this article investigates how various types of threats associated with immigration affect attitudes towards immigration and civil liberties. Through experimentation, the study unpacks the “securitization of migration” discourse by disaggregating the nature of immigration threat, and its impact on policy positions and ideological patterns at the individual level. Based on framing and attitudinal analysis, we argue that physical security in distinction from cultural insecurity is enough to generate important ideological variations stemming from strategic input (such as framing and issue-linkage). We expect then that as immigration shifts from a cultural to a physical threat, immigration issues may become more politically salient but less politicized and subject to consensus. Interestingly, however, the effects of threat-framing are not ubiquitous, and may be conditional upon ideology. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>To revisit G. Burdeau allows us to take a fresh view of current political science. Looking for the reasons put forward to explain why Burdeau's “constitutionalist” outlook is seemingly forgotten, the author denies that it is due to the dominance of political sociology, which is much more diverse than its “sociologist” version. Actually, Burdeau represents a “Political Science-I” offering a total vision of political reality devoid of any “philosophical prejudices”. It is questioned today by a “Political Science-II” which tries to elicit specific mechanisms, including legal mechanisms, which leads to the re-incorporation of philosophy into political science.

<p>Pragmatism has recently taken up the “practice turn” in order to overcome the neglect of agency in post-structuralist accounts. To explore potential advantages if such an approach is used for an analysis of carbon markets, I first ask whether a practice approach could allow us to go beyond the dichotomy of agents vs. structures and thus lead to an understanding of carbon assets as a specific configuration of power and authority. Second, might it be possible to gain a complex understanding of knowledge that is embedded in commensuration, commodification, and trading, which all can be described as daily routines that reify a specific approach towards the climate. Finally, might a focus on practice also tell us something about the accountability of academics as “practitioners”. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7141]</p>

<p>Political marketing consultants who offer specialist skills and experience in political marketing travel around the world sharing ideas from one campaign to the next, raising concerns that these unelected advisors wield global power; that political products will become all the same, and political leaders are prevented from offering an appropriate vision geared to the needs of their individual country. Whilst previous literature on political consultancy generally debated whether such global activities represented Americanization or globalization, this article presents new qualitative interview data with consultants that suggest alternative perspectives. Political marketing strategy and tools are shared, but not just from the US but between all countries, and they are adapted to suit the particular situation of each country, or indeed, each election.

<p>This article examines the relationship between evidence-based policy-making and policy-transfer. The policy-transfer framework has attracted criticism for its failure to adequately explain why policy officials engage in transfer at all. This article considers the changed political landscape after the election of New Labour in the UK in 1997 and argues that the policy transfer of welfare-to-work policy ideas from the US was at least partly driven by pressure to develop evidence-based policy. It asserts New Labour's injunction to use evidence-based welfare policy provides an important explanation as to why UK officials adopted US welfare approaches. Second, using a series of interviews and document-analysis, this article finds that, in addition to welfare policy ideas, UK policy officials adopted policy evaluation techniques from the US.

<p>Ever since the end of the Cold War and, in particular, since the terrorist attacks of 9/11 [2001], a fierce debate has been taking place both in the academic and the political world about the problems traditional concepts and theories of IR and foreign policy have in explaining change in international politics. Complexity as a conceptual framework for explaining international politics emerged as a result and has been making important contributions to it. This article assesses the impact complexity has had on this debate over the last 20 years. One can identify three distinct phases of complexity's emergence into the field of international politics. The framework still has some way to go in developing clear alternative strategies for the development of foreign policies processes which use this complexity to improve policy-outcomes.

<p>In liberal democracies, citizens are entitled to a substantive package of rights, including the right to participate in politics. Without this right, citizens cannot be self-determining in any rich sense. As more and more people cross borders, the number of residents without citizenship is rising, as is the number of people who have little say in the political life of the communities in which they reside. I assess the normative status of long-term, non-citizen residents and conclude that, without the right to vote, and without the right to run for office, long-term, non-citizen residents are denied political self-determination. Using the “thick-thin” lens that unites the contributions to this issue, I propose granting non-citizen residents more expansive political rights. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6980]</p>

<p>Scholars have made substantial progress toward understanding the connections between ethnic relations and civil war, but important theoretical and empirical gaps remain. Existing explanations often ignore the constructivist origins of ethnic group formation, or are too proximate to the outcome under investigation, so that the link between ethnic political competition and ethnic violence is difficult to pick apart. An alternative approach is an explanation of ethnic violence rooted in the microfoundations of social identity theory (SIT). When states consistently employ ethnic categories across institutions, they lay the foundation for conflicts over status and power, facilitating recruitment and mobilization on the basis of emotion-laden intergroup comparisons and competition. The strength of these claims is demonstrated through a comparative-historical analysis of ethnic violence in eleven Southern African countries. [R]</p>

<p>This article examines the implications of the proliferation of cyberwarfare capabilities for the character and frequency of war. Consideration of strategic logic, perceptions, and bargaining dynamics finds that the size of the effect of the proliferation of cyberwarfare capabilities on the frequency of war will probably be relatively small. This effect will not be constant across all situations; in some cases the advent of cyberwarfare capabilities may decrease the likelihood of war. On the other hand, the use of computer network attack as a brute force weapon will probably become increasingly frequent. [R]</p>

<p>When democracies wage war, they “know” that they have the law on their side. The same holds true when they condemn war. But what if democracies take divergent legal positions to one and the same war? Relying on governmental and public “Iraq” discourses in the US and Germany, this article argues that governments can no longer define the law in isolation from their societal environments. The critical relation of “politics”, “law”, and “democracy” is increasingly established not only in the political centers of states but also in the periphery: in the public discourse. This discursive process of international law becoming “public” cannot be ignored. However, the patterns of meaning of international law vary remarkably. While there is public politics of international law in democracies, a per se “democratic” politics of international law is hardly recognizable. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8015]</p>

<p>How does linguistic recognition in the courtroom affect popular confidence in the justice system among minorities? The authors argue (1) the recognition of either a minority language and/or a third-party's language (<italic>lingua franca</italic>) during judicial proceedings increases confidence levels but (2) the use of a <italic>lingua franca</italic> is more effective. This is because minorities are more likely to favor an arrangement that levels the playing field by having everyone speak a <italic>lingua franca</italic> (relative fairness) than one that allows them to use their own language in a courtroom that is otherwise dominated by the majority language (absolute fairness). Using original data measuring the linguistic recognition in the judiciary, the authors find a significant and robust relationship between languages of the court and popular confidence in the justice system.

<p>Public administration scholars often note that government should engage in more effective external communication to improve citizen trust and maintain political legitimacy. An important part of the belief is that more effective communication can lead to more favorable media coverage that ultimately shapes citizen trust in government. However, the link between government communication and media coverage remains empirically untested. Through a survey of 881 government and business communicators, this study tests the relationship between external communication activities and media coverage. The study shows that government organizations report being less likely to have favorable news coverage than their private counterparts, but most government organizations do report that their media coverage is favorable.

<p>Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs or P3s) are a form of privatization of public-sector projects and services and, hence, are an important aspect of public policy.

<p>This article unpacks the implications of technocracy for contemporary peace-building. It illustrates how the bureaucratic imperative explains much about the ascendancy of certain actors to positions of prominence on the peace-building landscape, and the types of activities that these actors engage in. In line with world polity theory, it is interested in the construction and institutionalization of discourses, understandings, expectations and practices of peace-building. It argues that there has been a “technocratic turn” in relation to peace-building, whereby there has been a gradual but persistent trend towards the application of technocracy in the framing of conflict and approaches to it. Two key claims advanced on behalf of technocracy – neutrality and efficiency – are discussed. The article then argues that a complex mix of structural and proximate factors have reinforced the technocratic turn in peace-building. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>It is a widely shared belief that genocide — the “crime of crimes” — is more morally significant than “mere” large-scale mass murder. Various attempts have been made to capture that separate evil of genocide: some have attempted to locate it in damage done to “individuals”, while others have focused upon the harm done to “collectives”. I offer a third, neglected, option. Genocide damages “humankind”: it is here that the difference is to be found. I show that this understanding has a venerable legal history, and argue that it has the significant benefits of legitimizing intervention and justifying universal jurisdiction. [R]</p>

<p>Research in political communication devotes growing attention to the role of visual information relayed through different media, including the news media, in forming political impressions, attitudes, and opinions. An increasing body of research indicates that exposure to visual information on the facial appearance of politicians from one's own state or country affects the favorability of attitudes towards these politicians as well as affecting voting intentions. However, the impact of visual information regarding politicians from the opponent side in a conflict has not been systematically examined. The current study examines the effect of visual news coverage — regarding the facial features of political leaders from the opponent side in a conflict — on support for peace. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This study examines the extent to which network-formation processes in international relations parallel models that characterize the formation processes of physical, biological, and social networks. I introduce two influential models from networks sciences: Preferential Attachment (PA) models state that the probability of a new node forming a link with an existing node is a function of the latter node's centrality. Networks that form through a PA process tend to have a power-law degree distribution. The Homophily (HO) model states that nodes tend to attach to similar other nodes. Such networks evolve into a set of homogenous subgroups. An analysis of alliance and trade networks over the 1816 (1870)–2003 period reveals strong evidence that alliance networks are affected by homophily processes. Trade networks form via a preferential attachment process. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6986]</p>

<p>What are the sources of popular opposition to economic globalization? A common answer is the adverse impact of trade liberalization on some people's labor-market standing and earning prospects. Recent studies also note a correlation between nationalist and ethnocentric sentiments and support for trade protectionism, yet do not test whether these non-economic sentiments are actually a cause of the opposition to freer trade. I argue that many individuals fear not only the oft-cited material consequences of trade openness, but also what they perceive to be its social and cultural consequences. I use cross-national survey data and a survey experiment to test this causal claim. The argument also helps explain why less-educated individuals are consistently more apprehensive about international economic integration than more educated individuals, even in the countries in which economic theory predicts otherwise.

<p>This article engages with recent methodological debates in political theory concerning the role of political theory and in particular the criticism that ideal normative theorizing is too abstracted from the real-world circumstances that it hopes to change. We suggest that feminist research has an important contribution to make to these questions, which has tended to be under-recognized within mainstream debates. Specifically, feminist critical theory points to important limitations within both ideal political theory and orthodox empirical social science. Rather than trying to combine these two approaches, feminist critical theory offers an alternative approach to standard political research methods. We detail a dialogical approach and recommend it as a resource to mainstream political theorists. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007–2008 hit most of the Western world hard and fast, presenting governments and citizens with a set of stark, undeniable and immediate realities. This article examines the attempts of three prime ministers — G. Brown in the UK, B. Cowen in Ireland and K. Rudd in Australia — to meet the key leadership challenge set up by the GFC: to publicly assess, explain and account for the GFC and the accompanying economic turbulence and uncertainty as financial markets went from boom to bust. By focusing on meaning-making, we examine how the leaders responded to the public expectation to explain: How bad is the situation? How did it occur? Who or what is to be held responsible? What needs to be done to cope with it? [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Although “horserace journalism” is thought to be central to contemporary election news coverage and has generated a great deal of criticism, there is no general model of the nature and dynamics of horserace journalism or “poll reporting”. This paper proposes and empirically evaluates such a model. The model builds on and extends J Zaller's “theory of media politics” to consider specifically what citizens demand from polls and what journalists supply. Aside from the generic motivations of politicians, citizens and journalists, the model emphasizes the unique features of polls as objects of news coverage. The paper finds considerable support for the model in an analysis of newspaper coverage of horserace polls (that is, vote-intention polls) in the Canadian general election of 2006. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>When delivering international development assistance, states should not be able to place the goal of protecting their citizens from transnational terrorism above that of alleviating poverty in developing countries. And yet this is precisely what they do on a regular basis when they use their policy on international development assistance to achieve security goals, as Canada, the US, and the UK have done in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is bad development policy, it does not increase the safety of those in developed states, and it is objectionable on political and moral grounds. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Copyright and data-protection rights are rarely described as related individual rights over information. However, we can construct narratives which would imply a theoretical, structural and historical linkage. Counterarguments against such a commonality include the distinct political economies of their creations and enforcements, as well as Olson's collective action challenge. A more detailed analysis of the creation of these rights does in fact show similarities, but the stark differences in enforcement remain. Copyrights are routinely enforced before the courts, while data-protection rights are not. The reasons for this difference may offer us a better understanding not only of information rights, but also of political dynamics of collective action more generally. One possible starting point is to look at the distinct function of intermediaries. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7146]</p>

Its point of departure is their claim that “policy transfer is a useful concept that transfers easily across different sub-disciplines and analytical contexts”. In reviewing a growing heterogeneous body of work on policy assemblages, mobilities and mutations, we argue that policy transfer research has already travelled well beyond political science, that it has been critiqued and modified along the way, and that its future is an interdisciplinary one; a future in which we invite political scientists to join.

<p>Individual role-playing is also a core aspect of state activity. I demonstrate the potential of this concept for constructivists on the basis of a reconsideration of the roles states play in international politics — drawing on symbolic interactionism and the thought of G.H. Mead. From a Meadian perspective, roles are sets of appropriate behaviors, not bundles of fixed duties; they emerge in interaction and give the actor a sense of its structure and the scope of possible action. Using the illustration of the Suez Crisis of 1956, I develop a “Meadian interactionist” conceptual approach that builds on previous attempts to harness the potential of the role concept in IR and sharpens constructivist understandings of the links between role, identity, norms, and action in IR.

<p>In practice, democracies privilege plurality parties. Theories of the democratic process challenge the democratic credentials of this practice. Abstract social choice theory wonders whether an electoral majority even exists. A more optimistic line of argument, prominent in research on collective representation, assumes that the policy position of the median voter embodies the majority electoral preference. The conflict between what democracies actually do and what two leading theories of the democratic process say calls for a comparative inquiry into electoral majoritarianism. For each of a dozen countries, the authors ask whether any political party commands a predominant majoritarian position among voters — that is, is a Condorcet winner — and, if so, which party it is.

<p>Supranational human rights bodies are generally moving away from a practice of issuing declaratory orders and deferring to the state on the means to comply with their decisions to the issuance of more specific reparation orders, including requiring guarantees of non-repetition such as law reform at the national level. Notwithstanding this general evolution, I suggest that they have not had as significant an impact on strengthening the national remedial framework where torture is alleged. Focusing on the practice and jurisprudence of the European Court, I identify key factors that support this finding and suggest ways in which they can do more to accommodate the objective of strengthening the national remedial framework for torture while continuing to prioritize their role as forums for individual access to justice.

<p>I address questions about the politics of mourning through a critical engagement of the work of J. Butler. I argue that Butler's work remains tethered to an account of melancholic subjectivity derived from her early reading of Freud. These investments in melancholia compromise Butler's recent ethico-political interventions by obscuring the ambivalence of political engagements and the possibilities of achieving and sustaining non-dogmatic identities. To overcome this impasse I argue for an alternative framing of mourning by turning to the psychoanalytic theory of M. Klein. An account of mourning that leans upon Klein's work cashes in on the ethical and political promises that are immanent yet unrealized in Butler's recent work while providing a new orientation for mourning in, and for, democratic politics.

<p>This article advances a novel theoretical account of what a “method” is and what makes one “rigorous”, and shows how it could advance contemporary debates in political theory and empirical methodology. Plato's Socrates invented the notion of method, and his characteristic practice of immanent refutation through questioning escapes key problems in more familiar views. Socratic method is (1) anti-foundational, (2) non-algorithmic, and (3) indirect and relative to competing hypotheses, and it (4) develops its own standards of objectivity from the logic of asking questions. The article reconstructs Socrates' method from the Platonic texts and shows how it provides reasonable criteria for judgment while remaining critical, sensitive to difference, and open to innovation. Socratic method avoids a forced choice between universalism and particularism in political theory. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>I examine the consequences of intra-party dissent for coalition governments in parliamentary systems. Drawing on the principal–agent literature, I develop a model in which party agents, namely cabinet ministers and legislators rather than parties as collective actors, decide on specific policies. The individuals' amount of loyalty determines the degree of party unity. I use simulation techniques to analyze the power of an agenda-setting minister in a two-party coalition conditional on the level of party unity. The results suggest that the minister's agenda-setting power diminishes if MPs and cabinet members aim at implementing their personal policy preferences. However, the party not in charge of the respective portfolio may benefit from disunity within its own ranks. This counter-intuitive result raises doubts about the widespread view that internal unity strengthens the bargaining power of political parties. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Increasingly, individuals and small groups are responsible for lethal acts of terrorism. In many [places], the setting is not conducive to large, clandestine groups insofar as many foreign governments are coordinating their counterterrorism efforts with the US government, as they seek to dismantle terrorist organizations and deny them funding and resources. On the other hand, the emergence of new technology, such as the internet, allows like-minded activists to operate on their own initiative without the direction of a formal organization — hence, the emergence of leaderless resistance as a new operational strategy and the miniaturization of terrorist and insurgent movements around the world today. The article discusses the development of the leaderless resistance concept and examines four case studies — the American extreme right, the anti-globalization movement, eco-terrorism, and the global Islamic resistance movement.

<p>The author argues on balance against the inclusion of such a clause. Using examples from Hungary and South Africa, he doubts that such a clause can, if included as a fundamental support for other basic rights, resist interpretations by constitutional courts that directly go against the intentions of the constitutional legislator. As the foundation of a rule formalist defense of assets against all forms of state encroachment, furthermore, the clause would be in the defense of a fundamental right that simply does not exist. Alleged injuries to liberty, dignity, equality, or due process should be adjudicated through value-oriented, substantive forms of inquiry that a property clause could very well short circuit.

<p>Twenty years [after] the emergence of sustainable development, significant strides have been taken to integrate environmental considerations into humanitarian development, but such considerations still remain largely ostracized from core security and humanitarian theory and practice. This article argues that an evolutionary step is now required. To enable this transition, this article suggests adopting the concept of “ecological development”. This concept of using the management and development of the environmental resources of water and biodiversity to mitigate conflict, promote peace-building and a transition from conflict towards peace — and a subsequent durable post-conflict recovery — is then expounded, demonstrated through case-studies of two very different conflicts, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Afghanistan.

<p>International security concerns about ballistic missile proliferation have frequently highlighted the links between ballistic missiles and space launch vehicles. This article examines the extent of these links through a comprehensive survey of ballistic-missile and space-rocket programs in regional powers. It notes that missiles were derived from existing space launchers in just a small fraction of these cases. In a slightly greater fraction, space launchers were drawn from existing missile programs. This analysis suggests that though security concerns about space launchers being used as ballistic missiles are valid, the reverse trend, that of ballistic missiles being used as space launch vehicles, cannot be ignored.

<p>62.7079 MONTGOMERY, Jacob M. — <bold>Improving predictions using ensemble Bayesian model averaging</bold> <italic>Political Analysis</italic> 20(3), Summer 2012: 271–291.</p>
<p>We present ensemble Bayesian model averaging (EBMA) and illustrate its ability to aid scholars in the social sciences to make more accurate forecasts of future events. EBMA improves prediction by pooling information from multiple forecast models to generate ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average of component forecasts. The weight assigned to each forecast is calibrated via its performance in some validation period. The aim is not to choose some “best” model, but rather to incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit in various forecasting efforts via statistical postprocessing. [Then] we show that EBMA increases the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts relative to component models in three applied examples: predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around the Pacific Rim, forecasting vote-shares in US presidential elections, and predicting the votes of US Supreme Court Justices.

<p>Much of the political science literature argues that commitment to beliefs renders the attitudes of policy actors inflexible. Belief commitment encourages alliances among actors who think alike and creates a distance with those whose beliefs differ. As it cuts the flow of information between disagreeing actors, belief commitment constrains the attitudes of actors to consistency across a variety of objects and over time, preventing policy compromises. This article examines the possibility that different beliefs have different effects on attitude. Specifically, it hypothesizes that actors holding purposive beliefs have more consistent attitudes than actors holding material beliefs. A survey of North American and European biotechnology policy actors shows that a strong commitment to purposive beliefs encourages attitude consistency across objects and over time, while equal commitment to material beliefs enables more attitude flexibility.

<p>How do states and other international actors go about establishing their credibility while undermining that of opponents? This article employs rhetorical theory, impression-management theory, and account theory to situate contests of credibility within the broader context of the accountability of social conduct. The theoretical part discusses the rhetorical strategies that actors use to credit their accounts and discredit those of their rivals. The empirical part addresses the debate between Israel and human rights groups over the Qana bombing incident of July 2006. The analysis of the blame-imposition strategies used by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch and the accounts offered by Israel, indicates the range and variability of credibility talk and the rules for crediting accounts that underlie it.

<p>I distinguish the concept of freedom from that of power. I suggest that freedom differs from power in focusing on the constraints that we are (or are not) under. When we are interested in freedom, the importance of these constraints is not particularly that they stop us doing things, because that is covered by considering our powers. I suggest that the constraints are important — if they are important at all — because some constraints insult our dignity. This suggests an alternative approach to the current focus on freedom as a property of actions: that of freedom as a property of persons. This idea is explored and defended.

<p>Capitalism has emerged as a force for peace in studies of interstate conflict. Is capitalism also a force for peace within nations? This article shows how a market-capitalist economy — one where most citizens normally obtain their livelihoods contracting in the market — creates citizen-wide preferences for universal freedom, peace, and the democratic rule of law. Granger tests of causality show that market-capitalism causes higher income, but higher income does not cause market-capitalism, and from 1961 to 2001 not a single civil war, insurgency, or rebellion occurred in any nation with a market-capitalist economy. Market-capitalism is the strongest variable in the civil conflict literature, and many of the most robust relationships in this literature are spurious — including income, state capacity, and oil-export dependency.

<p>Counterterrorist law is all too often made in a rushed, reactive, and repetitious way, marginalizing the deliberative, critical, and democratic functions of legislatures and leading to outcomes that later prove to be unconstitutional and counter-productive for public security. Using a political sociology approach, the article offers an analysis and theorization of the practice of counterterrorist lawmaking. Through the UK example, the article argues that counterterrorist lawmaking compounds the existing unequal power relationships of the parliamentary field, and presents legislators with an inscrutable dilemma about the true stakes involved in legislative security politics.

<p>The authors discuss how scholars can bring theories of spatial policy dependence and empirical model specifications closer in line so that the empirical analysis actually tests the theoretical predictions. Comprehensive theories of spatial policy dependence typically suggest that the jurisdictions receiving spatial stimuli systematically differ in their exposure to such signals as a function of the intensity of their interaction with other jurisdictions. Similarly, theories often predict that governments also differ in their responsiveness to any given spatial stimulus as a function of the institutional, political, economic, or social context in which they operate. The authors show how scholars can adequately model both forms of heterogeneity with properly specified interaction effects models. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>What impact does the way a civil war is terminated have on the post-conflict democratization process? This study analyzes whether certain types of conflict-termination are positive for post-conflict levels of democracy. It is argued that negotiated settlements, being at large more cooperative, are more conducive for democratization than truces or military victories. Stabilizing measures rarely leave possibilities for contestation of elites and thus few incentives to open up post-war society. The empirics reveal that negotiated settlements are the best way to end a conflict if democracy is to develop in its aftermath. [R]</p>

<p>Even though many researchers devoted considerable attention to political discussion and its individual-level antecedents and outcomes, insights are based on single-country studies. Cross-national variations were either never studied or implicitly equated to the US context. This study integrates explanations from communication and comparative politics to test whether political system features (e.g., electoral competitiveness and multiple parties) affect the macrosupply of political information, and thus either amplify or diminish the effects of individual characteristics on discussion. Analyses of cross-national data show system features correlate with greater discussion frequency and moderate the contribution of individual differences to discussion. The potential of systems to narrow gaps in mass public discussion and implications for future research are considered in conclusion. [R]</p>

In a panel of 165 countries, 1950 to 2000, we find our prospectively generated estimate of the external threat to be a powerful variable in explaining military spending. [R, abr.]</p>

Its main aim is to articulate and carry its members' interests into the political system while simultaneously keeping the members informed on current political processes related to their field of interest. Applying this definition, interest groups can be easily distinguished from other actors such as parties, social movements or foundations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Legislative reforms and litigation frequently form the focus of strategic interventions by lawyers and civil society.

The article examines these developments and demonstrates the contribution that these approaches and interventions can make in strengthening the normative framework and promoting accountability and justice. However, the very focus on legal interventions, with its underlying faith in the law and legal systems, may fail to tackle structural factors perpetuating violations and impunity, such as inequalities, discrimination and weak or corrupted institutions. Approaches relying predominantly on legal tools must therefore be mindful of their inherent limitations and consider what complementary strategies are likely to make the prohibition of torture more effective.

<p>As the concept of human security has become part of the mainstream discourse of international politics, it should be no surprise that both realist and critical approaches to international theory have found the agenda wanting. This article goes beyond both the realist and biopolitical critiques by situating all three — political realism, biopolitics and human security — within the history and theory of the modern rise of the social realm from late 18th- and 19th-c.

Human security is the further expansion of social forms of governance under capitalism, more specifically a form of <italic>Socialpolitik</italic> than <italic>Realpolitik</italic> or biopolitics.

Is such a belief in the causative power of law and fully justified given the theoretical knowledge and empirical evidence obtained in areas such as sociology of law, political science, economics, and more? In order to address this question, it is first necessary to focus on the issue of what is “good law” and consider how the term is being used as well as whether this concept is at all possible to implement in modern politics.</p>

<p>This work assesses the conceptual relations between “power” and “freedom”. The two concepts are normally thought of in a relation of mutual exclusion: while being free means not being subject to someone's power, to have power is to constrain someone's freedom. I propose a more detailed interpretation of their conceptual relations, distinguishing between two different cases. In the case in which power and freedom are understood as properties of two different individuals involved in a social relation, I argue that they are not necessarily in a relation of mutual exclusion: power can be exercised in ways which do not reduce, and which might even increase, the power-subject's freedom. In the case, by contrast, in which they are understood as properties of the same individual, I claim that power and freedom show a significant degree of correspondence.

<p>To provides an overall framework for thinking about the construction of carbon markets, we adopt J. Der Derian's “virtuous war” theory to develop an argument about carbon as a virtuous commodity. This refers to the close affinity between virtuality and virtue — the technological and the ethical — in the construction of carbon markets. The figure of virtuous carbon draws attention to both the fictitious character of carbon units (as imagined things, complex abstractions that exist only by way of agreement) and their virtue (how those units are only provisionally stabilized, and where their ethical contestation is part of their construction). We explore virtuality and virtue at five moments in the commodification of carbon (invention, proliferation, verification, and differentiation into two forms).

<p>The number of deaths on both sides of the Arab-Israeli conflict fell during the period of 1948 to 2010, and the per-capita death rate declined even more sharply.

<p>We describe what has happened in the transition countries since the end of communism and why it has happened.

<p>This article examines the effect of foreign armed intervention on human rights conditions in target countries. It is argued that military intervention contributes to the rise of state repression by enhancing the state's coercive power and encouraging more repressive behavior, especially when it is supportive or neutral toward the target government. Results from bivariate probit models estimated on time-series cross-section data show that supportive and neutral interventions increase the likelihood of extrajudicial killing, disappearance, political imprisonment, and torture. Hostile interventions increase only the probability of political imprisonment. The involvement of an intergovernmental organization or a liberal democracy as an intervener is unlikely to make any major difference in the suggested negative impact of intervention. [R]</p>

<p>A central argument in the literature on economic crises and policy reform is that currency crises lead governments to liberalize their capital accounts in order to establish their credibility to international markets. I argue that the reverse is true: currency crises lead governments to restrict capital flows as a form of self-help. Using instrumental variables to account for the possibility that capital account liberalization causes currency crises, I show that currency crises are robustly associated with capital account closure across developing countries. The findings refocus the debate on currency crises and capital account liberalization and contribute to larger debates about the role of critical junctures in prompting neoliberal policy reform.

<p>Policy-makers and policy-oriented scholars concerned with development and reform commonly appeal to “political will” as a cornerstone of development. We question the circular and voluntaristic view of leadership behavior inherent in such an approach, and argue that the discourse on political will should be firmly integrated into a more systematic framework of analysis. In particular, we suggest that it should engage in more active dialogue with the combined insights offered by principal-agent theory and state theory. More specifically, in the framework we develop, the principal-agent framework offers the analytical tools for analyzing leadership behavior at the micro level, while state theory provides crucial insights regarding the macro-level factors shaping leadership behavior.

<p>The symbiotic relationship between terrorism and the media is widely taken as self-evident; theoretical analysis from an economic perspective is rare. In this paper, a game-theoretic model with two players — the media and a terrorist organization — is developed and then extended to multiple terrorist groups. The number of terrorist groups is first modeled exogenously and then, in a market entry game, endogenously. It can be shown that media attention not only encourages terrorism, but also has a stabilizing effect. With increasing terrorism and constant media preferences, the probability that a single terrorist incident is reported on diminishes, reducing the expected payoff from a successful terrorist attack.

<p>This essay engages critically with the recent emergence of “political realism” in political theory (centrally in the work of R. Geuss and B. Williams). While sympathetic to and convinced of the importance of the core of the enterprise which it identifies, the essay is critical of some of the claims made about the independence of politics from morality and the historically contingent character of political values, and suggests that realism may itself succumb to illusion. The final section sketches an account of the nature of evaluative judgment in the study of politics and, in conclusion, defends both the pluralist character of political theory and the pressing importance of the questions that realism raises and that are inadequately attended to by the bulk of post-war political theory.

<p>For all its rhetorical potency, the policy implications of the “squeezed middle” are yet to be fully explored. This article looks at what the phenomenon means for the design and prosecution of progressive economic policy. It argues that any progressive government today needs to adopt a new first-order goal of economic policy: ensuring that the material wellbeing of ordinary working people rises when the economy grows, a project referred to as “building a rising tide economy”. This objective would sit in addition to the traditional goals of sustained GDP growth, high employment, low inflation and poverty reduction. It would have real implications across a range of important policy areas. [R]</p>

<p>Throughout the 20th c., H.

<p>This article contrasts the current individual rights-based paradigm of privacy with an alternative one that emphasizes the social value of privacy. In criticizing the implications of the first but not rejecting it, it establishes a better grounding and justification for the second in terms of locating privacy within complex social relationships and a particular conception of the public interest that such an approach to privacy helps to sustain. Drawing upon a range of philosophical and social science literature that reinforces this position, it distinguishes between social-value and communitarian approaches before examining the contributions made by several writers in terms of their insights into the value and functioning of privacy. The article draws out some of the policy implications of a social-value understanding of privacy. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7146]</p>

<p>This article reviews major issues in the historiography of the Russian/Soviet side of the Cuban missile crisis, as it has developed since the early 1990s. Focusing on key works, including A. Fursenko and T. Naftali's <italic>One Hell of a Gamble</italic> [New York, 1997] and S. Mikoyan's <italic>Anatomi'ia Karibskogo Krizisa</italic> [Moscow, 2006], the article explores three issues: why N. Khrushchev decided to send missiles to Cuba, why he withdrew them, and how close the world came to “the brink”. I contend that in our understanding of the Kremlin's motivations in the Cuban missile crisis, we have come to over-rely on disparate pieces of “evidence”, which, at closer investigation, turn out to be one-sided, undocumented, or demonstrably false. I urge caution in drawing far-reaching conclusions from the crisis. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.8221]</p>

<p>Are IR scholars objective observers of political events, or do our political preferences influence the way in which we see the world? This article explores that question using data from a survey of IR scholars. It develops and tests hypotheses about how we might expect adherents of particular paradigms to identify themselves politically on a left-right scale based on the resonance between the content of ideology and the key propositions of different schools of thought in IR. Although they are relatively centrist, I find that realists are the most conservative and right-leaning of IR scholars, while Liberals are more liberal and left-leaning. Although neither approach has any intrinsic ontological content, rationalism and constructivism also have a distinct ideological profile, the former being more conservative than the latter.

<p>This article seeks to help understand interagency cooperation.

We discuss model that employ the concept Articulated Segments Model, Models by Hierarchical Flux Process and Network Decisions Models which shows that if an agency cannot plan, it will not survive in the interagency environment. The plan becomes the relation between how and why interagency collaboration works, giving a practical meaning to the term's theoretical conception. [R]</p>

<p>Large majorities in nearly every country support democracy, according to studies of cross-national surveys.

This article discusses the consequences of excluding such nonsubstantive responses and offers suggestions to improve the study of popular support for democracy. [R]</p>

<p>Why do some successor states experience conflict with their predecessor states, while others do not? Are there any notable asymmetries between the two? How important are territorial claims and cross-border ethnic ties in this respect? Are treaties effective in ensuring post-independence peace? Examining 166 instances of independence in the 1816–2001 period, this study shows that territorial claims and cross-border ethnic ties serve as significant predictors of post-independence conflict, much as they do with regard to conflict in general. Treaties, by contrast, are only weakly associated with post-independence conflict. Thus, while treaties cannot in themselves be expected to substantially reduce the likelihood of post-independence conflict, partition along demographic lines can. Moreover, post-decisional dissonance can explain the fact that successor state claims are more conflict-prone than predecessor state claims. [R]</p>

<p>Social scientists from a variety of disciplines have employed concepts drawn from cultural theory (CT) to explain preferences across an array of issues.

This study reconsiders and expands upon this contention. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Many political philosophers who embrace some version of a Lockean-based theory of justice have accepted Locke's Proviso concerning the duty of appropriators of natural resources to leave enough and as good for others. I argue that if the Lockean Proviso should be applied to the appropriation of natural resources, then it should also be applied (extended) to the use of unappropriated natural resources. To demonstrate the plausibility of applying the Lockean Proviso to use of unappropriated natural resources, I consider cases where agents engage in the destructive use, degrading use, overuse and restricting access use of unappropriated natural resources. I maintain that the removal of a natural resource (either by means of appropriation or use) is the relevant moral feature that triggers the duty to leave enough and as good for others. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This article presents a call for political scientists to look seriously at videogames. Beginning with a demonstration of their growing importance, the article then sets out the existing game-related literature which demonstrates their persuasive potential. The importance of games for political studies is illustrated through an in-depth discussion of the link between videogames and the militarization of politics and society: exploration of the role of the military–entertainment complex, felt in particular through the militarization of the content of games, suggests that this complex is influencing the militarization of society. Finally, the article explores some of the ways in which such militarization is being challenged through the use of games for political activism, centered on protests within game spaces and the development of “critical” games.

<p>Identifying causal effects attributable to network membership is a key challenge in empirical studies of social networks. We examine the consequences of endogeneity for inferences about the effects of networks on network members' behavior. Using the [US] House office lottery (in which newly elected members select their office spaces in a randomly chosen order) as an instrumental variable to estimate the causal impact of legislative networks on roll call behavior and co-sponsorship decisions in the 105th–112th Houses, we find no evidence that office proximity affects patterns of legislative behavior. These results contrast with decades of congressional scholarship and recent empirical studies. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for selection processes and omitted variables in estimating the causal impact of networks. [R]</p>

<p>This article joins in and extends the contemporary debate on the right to privacy. We go beyond the dominant view according to which privacy protects the interests of individuals and argue that privacy protection is significant for society as such. In order to demonstrate this point, we explore the social dimensions of privacy: we argue that by protecting individual privacy, not only the interests of individuals are being protected, but also the interests of society. We are defending the thesis that it is only the possibility of individual autonomy which is at stake in threats to privacy but also the possibility of different social relationships, social practices, and, lastly, the social order of society as such.

<p>This paper argues that the justice budget is likely to have a positive and significant impact on individuals' trust in justice, thanks to its role as a signal when individuals face uncertainty regarding the judicial environment. We test this hypothesis empirically using three different budget-related variables: the justice budget per incoming case, the number of magistrates and the intensity of legal aid. Across our three regressions, we find a positive and significant correlation between judicial resources and individuals' declared trust in the justice system. This positive relationship is robust to the introduction of socio-demographic, cultural, institutional and economic control variables. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper uses data from an online voting experiment to examine the impact of institutional socialization on the vote decision process. More specifically, we examine how Canadian and American voters differ in their vote-decision processes in two- and four-party elections. Our expectation is that Canadian voters, who are more familiar with multiparty electoral context, will adjust to the increased complexity of the four-party competition by engaging in a more detailed decision process. Alternatively, we expect US voters, who are less familiar with multiparty competitions, will not undertake such an adjustment, perhaps even engaging in a less detailed vote calculus under more complex conditions. Results lend support to our expectations, offering insight into how institutional design and socialization can affect voter decision processes. [R]</p>

<p>This article investigates the relationship between natural resources and post-conflict peace by analyzing new data on natural-resource conflicts. We argue that the effect of natural resources on peace depends on how a country's natural resources can constitute a motive or opportunity for armed conflict. In particular, three mechanisms may link natural resources to conflict recurrence: disagreements over natural-resource distribution may motivate rebellion; using natural resources as a funding source creates an opportunity for conflict; and natural resources may aggravate existing conflict, acting either as motivation or opportunity for rebellion. We code all internal armed conflicts between 1946 and 2006 according to the presence of these resource-conflict links. We claim such mechanisms increase the risk of conflict recurrence because access to natural resources is an especially valuable prize worth fighting for. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The discussion of the place of language in politics has generally revolved around its relationship to nation-building and ethnic conflict. Yet, these are not always causally connected nor is language easily given up for a greater national or individual good. Attitudes regarding language can be influenced by anticolonialist resentments, memories of past injustice, status paranoia, xenophobia, collective megalomania, religion, ideology, and the desire on the part of a group to base its collective identity on a demarcation from a real or imagined enemy. This applies to many dimensions of language policies, including officialization, alphabetization, gentrification, and glossonym changes. We argue that governments choose language policies for strategic reasons. Whether it is to legitimize or subordinate a language or whether or not the policy is itself the objective, these choices may have unintended consequences. [R]</p>

<p>The legal and constitutional systems should move forward in guaranteeing the right to free development of affectivity and sexuality, beyond its strict protection through the prohibition of discrimination. This involves recognizing a generic “right to identity”, closely connected with the dignity and the free development of personality. Both dimensions of the individual, emotions and sexuality, have obvious public projections that demand protection beyond the privacy. This affects the depth on the principle of equality and the review of a symbolic order that for centuries has refused diversity. [R]</p>

<p>For quite some time, explicit attention has been paid to the changing context of communication processes and political communication in particular. The role of the media in the process of public communication is, on the one hand, quite traditional: to inform the public, popularize information and mobilize citizens to action, all in the name of the public good. On the other hand, however, modern media also play roles such as providers of entertainment, scandals, sensation, and enjoyment. Which of these functions tells us about the future of media? How do they change the process of political communication in the public sphere? And is this what we want?</p>

<p>The recent civil war literature suggests that negative economic shocks in low-income countries increase the risk of civil war. Foreign aid can be an effective conflict-prevention tool in times of severe economic conditions. Aid cushions government spending from the downward pressures of economic shocks, providing recipient governments with resources they can use to make rebellion a less attractive option for aggrieved domestic groups. Using Official Development Assistance (ODA) data covering 1990 through 2004, we find that foreign aid appears to be a useful tool for preventing civil wars in the wake of negative economic shocks, and as such aid should be assessed by donors with these conflict-suppressing aspects in mind.

<p>Recently, theorists have sought to justify transnational democracy by means of the all-affected principle: that people have a right to participate in political decision-making that affects them. I argue that this principle is neither logically valid nor feasible as a way of determining the boundaries of democratic communities. First, specifying what it means to be affected is itself a highly political issue, since it must rest on some disputable theory of interests; and the principle does not solve the problem of how to legitimately constitute the <italic>demos</italic>, since such acts, too, are decisions which affect people. Second, I discuss three possible replacements for the all-affected principle: (1) applying the all-affected principle to second-order rules, not to decisions; (2) drawing boundaries so as to maximise everyone's autonomy; (3) including everyone who is subject to the law.

<p>This article examines the classification of conflicts consisting of only cyber operations under international humanitarian law. “International armed conflicts” are those that are “armed” and “international”. The article contends that the former criterion is met when cyber operations amount to an “attack” because they injure individuals or damage objects, whereas the latter requires that the operations be between or attributable to states. “Non-international armed conflict” occurs when hostilities between a state and an “organized” armed group reach a particular level of intensity.

<p>The chapter discusses different theories which explain intellectual property rights in general, and patent-protection in particular concerning their efficiency and legitimacy, or problematize both their foundations and effects. It departs from the paradox that intellectual property rights have been expanded, both nationally and internationally, but also have become contested and strongly criticized by a growing number of civil society groups and organizations. As patents have become subject of strong politicization, it became evident that patent-protection is a Janus-faced matter which generates both desirable and undesirable effects. This thesis is scrutinized by examining various patent theories with regards to their assumptions about the innovation process and concerning related goals and effects of patent protection. Traditional theories are contrasted with empirical economic research and more recent theories. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7146]</p>

<p>Within the scholarship on substantive representation, representation is increasingly perceived in terms of “claiming to speak for” the represented. Although this constructivist turn to substantive representation creates promising avenues for further research, it makes it ever more difficult to set processes of representation apart from other, more generic, forms of communication. This article redresses this situation: first, by introducing the concept of “substantive claims” as a more apt translation of substantive representation into the “claims-making” paradigm; and second, by developing an interpretive schema which allows for identifying and analyzing these substantive claims.

<p>Backed by studies finding only limited propensity for free-riding when communities have an interest in self-provision, the last few decades have seen a surge of interest in community-based development. A major caveat to the “second wave” of collective action studies, however, is that collective action often breaks down under hierarchical social relationships. This is unfortunate news for developing countries' rural societies, often entrenched in patron-client networks. Using a natural experiment found in the construction of a motorway, the article finds that clientelist relationships do not, in and by themselves, block peasant collective action. Rather, it is the interaction between clientelism and isolation that empowers patrons to block community-based projects. Peasants in connected villages rely on their patrons' assistance in collective projects, making the hierarchical network an additional resource. [R]</p>

<p>This article contributes to the growing subfield of research on religion and IR by discussing ways to take substantial and <italic>sui generis</italic> aspects of religion into account. It is argued that IR scholars need more critical methodological and conceptual reflection on how to integrate religion in order to navigate between two typical analytical positions: either focusing on the instrumental relevance of religion only or treating religion as an unchangeable meta-category and delinking it from its practitioners or context. The article first discusses why there is a need to be attentive to distinctive aspects of religion and then moves on to scrutinize three IR-relevant pathways to include these aspects of religion in analysis, namely religion as belief community, religion as power, and religion as speech act.

<p>This essay explores competing claims on dignity in late 20th-c. debates over abortion and in decisions on the constitutionality of abortion legislation that these debates prompted. Advocates and judges appealed to dignity to vindicate autonomy, to vindicate equality, and to express respect for the value of life itself. Appeals to these distinct conceptions are now appearing in debates over the regulation of same-sex relations. Analyzed with attention to competing claims on dignity, we see that in the debate over same-sex relations, as in the debate over abortion, a crucial question recurs: Do laws that restrict non-procreative sexuality violate or vindicate human dignity? Agonists who hold fundamentally different views about sexuality share an allegiance to dignity, enough to fight for the authority to establish dignity's meaning in debates over sexual freedom.

However, the implications of this literature for how the total production of legislation changes if all members gained seniority is less clear. Increased levels and dispersion of seniority within Congress generate a cartel-like effect, whereby legislators restrict the quantity of legislation enacted and increase the average price of each passed bill. The analysis provides a natural experiment to gauge the impacts of the emergence of the [US] congressional committee system. [R]</p>

<p>The dominant explanation of public attitudes vis-à-vis economic globalization focuses on re-distributional implications, with an emphasis on factor endowments and government-sponsored safety nets (the compensation hypothesis). The empirical implication is that in advanced economies, individuals endowed with less human and financial capital will be more likely to experience income losses, [and] will oppose economic openness unless they are compensated by the government. Including social capital in the analysis can fill two gaps in explanations relying on factor endowments and the compensation hypothesis. First, generalized trust constitutes a personal endowment alongside human and financial capital. Second, structural social capital can be regarded as a nongovernmental social safety net that can compensate for endowment-related disadvantages of individuals. The empirical testing relies on survey data for Switzerland and the US. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper questions some assumptions about citizenship which are more or less taken for granted in academic, political and social contexts: e.g., that there is a clearly defined conceptual link between citizenship and the identity of citizens; that conceptions of citizenship inevitably vary from one cultural context to another; that the values underpinning citizenship are public or objective; and that the concept of citizenship has moral or ethical connotations which justify the inclusion of citizenship (or civics) education in school curricula. I argue that with respect to individuals, matters of identity are not directly tied to citizenship or to any other “collectivist” conception. Instead, these identity conditions are grounded in the actual concept of person, and are best construed in relational terms.

<p>The debates over global and historical justice much preoccupy contemporary political theory. Yet they have not been analyzed in tandem. And this, despite the fact that a number of theoretical frameworks, principal among them contractarianism and utilitarianism, configure arguments in both debates. I show that such arguments, as advanced by either side in each of the two debates, all rest on a set of patterned assumptions about the nature of the self. Specifically, the debates over historical and global justice resemble each other as parallel contests over the physical, meta-social, metaphysical and social natures of the self. At their cores, the debates over historical and global justice thus display a common and symmetrical structure. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Creating a mechanism for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation in tropical developing countries has become, [since] 2005, a central element in international climate-protection discourse. The goal is to create financial incentives for forest-protection by making avoided deforestation a tradable good that can be sold on the carbon market or to government funds. A discourse-analytical perspective on the process of commodification and market-creation is developed in order to assess how avoided deforestation is being made tradable. Such a perspective enables us to highlight the contestedness and contingency of the commodification and market-creation process. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7141]</p>

<p>This overview of the existing political analysis of carbon markets identifies three broad strands in the literature. The first is concerned with the processes by which particular carbon market schemes are established. The second focuses on the role of particular actors in the creation of carbon markets. The third strand assesses carbon markets on efficiency, legitimacy or justice grounds. This existing literature is contrasted with the framework developed by the contributions to this volume. Broadly drawing on constructivist and poststructuralist approaches, the carbon economy is deconstructed, its history scrutinized and the practices and technologies that have been used to bring these markets into being are highlighted. Thus it is demonstrated that politics is also present in the forms of knowledge claims that underpin these markets, as well as the various daily practices that constitute them.

<p>This article examines developments in the analysis of communal conflict over the past twenty years, exploring insights regarding the relationships of economic structure, conceptions of deprivation, and the constructions of narratives making sense of civil strife. The piece compares analyses from differing paradigms and disciplines, including terrorism studies, the sociology of violence and war, and the anthropology of violence. The article explores how shifting emphases from both participants and analysts cast incidents of violence in a different light, proscribing differing potential intervention strategies and interpretations of outcomes. Highlighting these shifts provides new space for analyses and greater understanding of the potential costs and consequences of intervention. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6883]</p>

<p>This article argues that sovereign equality was not present as a normative principle at Westphalia. Further, while arguments for sovereign equality were present in the 18th c., they did not rely on, or even suggest, a Westphalian provenance. It was, for good reasons, not until the late 19th c. that the linkages of Westphalia and sovereign equality became commonplace, and even then sovereign equality and its linkage with Westphalia were disputed. It was not until after the Second World War, notably through the influential work of L. Gross, that the linkage of Westphalia and sovereign equality became not only widely accepted, but almost undisputed until quite recently. The article suggests that not only did Gross bequeath a dubious historiography but that this historiography is an impediment to contemporary IR. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Aside from the commonsensical conclusion that institutions (e.g., quota rules) boost women's parliamentary representation, there is little consensus in the academic literature on the relative and absolute impact other economic, cultural or societal factors have on the number of women in parliament. One variable that is particularly debated in the literature is women's labor force participation. The indicator's reported impact ranges from substantively positive to nil to even slightly negative. We aim to resolve these controversies. Our pooled time-series analysis — based on the largest possible data-set, namely all countries for which the data are available from 1995 to 2010 — indicates that the number of women in the workforce strongly influences women's parliamentary representation.

<p>The analysis of knowledge orders, knowledge regimes or “civic epistemologies” has recently gained importance in research on regulation and governance. These concepts focus on institutional and cultural arrangements, which influence the production and legitimation of politically relevant knowledge. The question is posed how certain modes of expertise and practices of knowledge production become to be perceived as reliable and how in a given society such knowledge claims are used as a basis for justifying collectively binding choices. Knowledge orders are boundary-crossing arrangements between science, politics and the public.

<p>Based on an analytic review of recent scholarly advances in genocide studies, this article investigates the causes, concept, and logic of genocide while suggesting a set of theoretical propositions and avenues for future research. Two emerging theoretical streams of literature on causes highlight different dimensions of genocide and should be thought of as compatible. To develop existing theory and to bring the study of genocide closer to the literature on violence, studying variation in outcomes is essential: students of genocide should ask why genocide and not another outcome occurs, rather than only studying common patterns among genocide cases. Similarly, rather than study primarily sources of escalation and accelerators of violence, scholars should also theorize restraint and decelerators of violence.

<p>Ever since a 2001 World Bank report, many policy-makers have come to accept a gender-based approach to corruption control, which posits that women in government reduce corruption because females are more ethical than males. An alternative explanation asserting the spuriousness of the gender-corruption link suggests that both gender equality and lower corruption result from a functioning liberal democracy. In this study, eight hypotheses are formulated and tested with longitudinal data for 204 countries. Findings demonstrate that neither the level of women in government nor a change in it has any impact on the prevalence and/or short-term trend of corruption. But both the strength of liberal institutions and an increase in this strength predict the prevalence and trend of corruption. [R]</p>

<p>The question of the role of the government or of the regulation of the economy and the financial system has taken a new urgency since the beginning of the crises of the banking and financial systems and sovereign debts. A historical perspective and comparative approach reveal that the economy, which was long run principally by the state, is now managed by an increasing number of public and private actors operating at different institutional levels. Public administrations, companies, interest groups, think tanks all produce complex and changing regulations in a weak institutionalized framework, sometimes giving the impression of a chaotic and depoliticized self-government. The question of the regulation of the economy also raises the broader question of the role of the state and the government in contemporary societies. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.6971]</p>

<p>Philosophers and politicians can never be a perfect match. The reason is the philosopher's peculiar inclination towards violence, a propensity which is uncommon for real politicians. The antagonism between philosophy and politics is especially noticeable in the contemporary world because of a change in the way of conducting political discourse and due to the priority of politics to philosophy. Such a priority in turn suggests that politics is assessed in terms of efficiency. An overview of philosophy's place in the modern world put in parallel with an evaluation of modern politics implies that while politics treat philosophers as dangerous dreamers, philosophy gradually resigns from its traditional social role.</p>

<p>This paper examines the process of norm-diffusion in international peace-building to assess why it is often unsuccessful or incomplete. Although there is a strong international consensus on the norms that compose peace-building, the practical record shows that international actors have difficulty transferring that consensus to the local context. Close analysis suggests that diffusion gets stuck in its initial stages, in large part because the mechanisms through which it usually takes place are not effective in the peace-building context. Processes of competition, learning, and emulation are all inhibited through peace-building, in part because of international reactions to conflict and in part because of local obstacles to liberalization. The ultimate result is that the local behaviors developed within peace-building contexts often violate the very norms they purport to represent. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This paper presents “strategic hedging” as a way to conceptualize much of the strategic behavior currently employed by second-tier states like China, Russia, Brazil, and France. Hedging is an alternative to strategies like balancing, bandwagoning, and buck-passing. Like those other strategies, hedging is driven by structural incentives associated with the current polarity of the international system and power concentration trends within it. Hedging will be most prevalent in international systems that are defined by a leading state that, while in a position of power preponderance, is also in the process of relative decline. I define strategic hedging behavior, present a mechanism for identifying empirical evidence of strategic hedging, and apply that mechanism to three case studies: the Sino-Russian strategic partnership, Brazil's approach to regional leadership, and French opposition to the 2003 us invasion of Iraq.

<p>In the era of the career politician, the presidentialization of leadership and the political celebrity, and with intensified and personalized media coverage of politics and leaders, it has become more difficult for former leaders to retire quietly and fade from the scene — even if they want to, and many do not. Individual agency is only part of the picture, however. Contextual factors play a crucial role. There is the importance of the immediate political situation in terms of the circumstances of the former leader's exit from office, alongside the internal party dynamics and relations with the successor-leader. Second, institutional factors structure the opportunities and choices that former leaders face. Finally, the broader environment of modern politics, from the 1960s and 1970s onwards, has clearly opened up new opportunities and possibilities for former leaders. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>This essay reviews recent literature on Varieties of Capitalism, proposing a new, more differentiated way of thinking about contemporary changes in the political economies of the rich democracies. The framework breaks with the “continuum models” on which much of the traditional literature has been based, in which countries are arrayed along a single dimension according to their degree of “corporatism” or “coordination”. It reveals combinations — continued high levels of equality with significant liberalization, and declining solidarity in the context of continued significant coordination — that existing theories rule out by definition. I argue that these puzzling combinations cannot be understood with reference to the usual dichotomous, structural variables on which the literature has long relied, but require instead greater attention to the coalitional foundations on which political-economic institutions rest.

<p>Anthropologists have paid less attention to the study of political revolutions as real historical events. This article advances a series of reasons why anthropology can enrich and supplement existing political science and history traditions in the study of political revolutions. Anthropology can do so via key concepts developed by V. Turner: “liminality”, “social drama”, “communitas”, “frame”, and “play”. Turner's ritual approach gains further relevance when linked to another series of concepts developed by M. Mauss, G. Tarde, G. Simmel, and G. Bateson, such as “imitation”, “trickster”, “schismogenesis”, and “crowd behavior”. To study revolutions implies not only a focus on political behavior “from below”, but also recognition of moments where “high and low” are relativized or subverted, and where the micro- and macro-levels fuse in critical conjunctions.

<p>The end of the Cold War led to the creation of almost two dozen new states, resulting from groups that advanced claims based on the legitimacy of national self-determination. These claims ranged from modestly increased autonomy to secession and independent statehood. As a result, and because a number of these claims escalated to violence, scholarly research into self-determination and secession has increased tremendously over the past two decades, with scholars examining the fate of these movements and associated violence and wars, from onset to the termination of associated violence and wars. This article assesses the state of the academic literature as it relates to the links between self-determination, secession, and civil wars. It [examines] the conditions and factors identified to explain the emergence of self-determination and secession and why violence and war become potential outcomes.

<p>We examine problems of commoditization and marketization of new technological knowledge and the role of politics in this process. The historical development of patent policy indicates that business and trade interests shaped the patent system. This holds in the first place for the political process of the patent system's internationalization and the efforts to globally harmonize it. As a rule, knowledge was treated as an asset worth protecting but not as a tradable commodity. Primarily the neo-liberal conviction that (only) the market would guarantee the efficient allocation and utilization of resources triggered, though relatively few, political and some entrepreneurial initiatives to promote the trade of patents. At the same time they reveal that market exchange in particular confronts crucial difficulties. [R, abr.] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7146]</p>

<p>This article examines the conditions under which a cyber attack can trigger a state's right to self-defense and argues that the current international law standards for attributing attacks to a state can cover the case of cyber attacks. More specifically, the victim State can use force by way of self-defense against another state if the attack has been committed by the latter's organs or agents or has been committed by non-State actors tolerated by that State. When no state is implicated in the cyber attack, the victim state can take direct self-defense action against the non-state actor. It is however noted that future state practice may amplify further the attribution standards or introduce new standards. [R] [See <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7430]</p>

However, few scholars have developed and tested systematic frameworks to analyze this issue. We address this by building and testing an appropriate framework. The aims have been: (1) to build a three-factor model (policy content, organizational context, and personality characteristics) for explaining willingness to implement policies; and (2) to quantitatively test the model through a survey of Dutch professionals. The results show that policy content is the most important factor in explaining willingness. Nevertheless, organizational context and the personality characteristics of implementers also have a significant effect and should be considered when studying the attitudes of professionals towards policies.

<p>This article examines the cases of three health care states — two of which (Britain and the Netherlands) have undergone major policy reform and one of which (Canada) has experienced only marginal adjustments. The British and Dutch reforms have variously altered the balance of power, the mix of instruments of control, and the organizing principles. As a result, mature systems representing the ideal-typical health care state categories of national health systems and social insurance (Britain and the Netherlands, respectively) were transformed into distinctive national hybrids. These processes have involved a politics of redesign that differs from the politics of earlier phases of establishment and retrenchment. The increased significance of institutional entrepreneurs gives greater urgency to one of the central projects of health policy: the design of accountability frameworks to allow for an assessment of performance against objectives.

<p>Freedom as non-domination has acquired a leading status in political science. Neo-Roman republicanism also has achieved great prominence as the political tradition that delivered it. Yet [although] liberty in the Roman mode was forged not only in direct confrontation with monarchy but against democracy as well, the relationship of republicanism to democracy is absent in the contemporary debate on non-domination. This article illustrates the misrepresentations of democracy in the Roman tradition and shows how these undergirded the theory of liberty as non-domination as a counter to political equality as a claim to taking part in imperium. It brings to the fore the “liberty side” of democratic citizenship as the equal rights of all citizens to exercise their political rights, in direct or indirect form. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>I sketch a Kant-inspired liberal account of human rights: the freedom-centered view. This account conceptualizes human rights as entitlements that any political authority — any state in the first instance — must secure to qualify as a guarantor of its subjects' innate right to freedom. On this picture, when a state (or state-like institution) protects human rights, it reasonably qualifies as a moral agent to be treated with respect. By contrast, when a state (or state-like institution) fails to protect human rights, it loses its moral status and becomes liable to both internal and external interference. I argue that this account not only steers a middle course between so-called natural-law and political approaches to human rights but also satisfies three important theoretical desiderata: explanatory power, functional specificity, and critical capacity.

<p>State death — the formal loss of control over foreign policy — is a neglected issue in the IR literature. The consequences of state death can be wide-ranging, from forced migration movements, regional instability, to general famine. Despite these severe consequences, political scientists have yet to adequately study the causes of state death. Our expansion of current research adds the concept of territorial disputes to the state death literature. We suggest that states are at greater risk of death when they become involved in territorial disputes that raise the stakes of conflict. The resulting research demonstrates that a reliable predictor of state death is engagement in a territorial dispute, the most prevalent issue that leads to war and a leading cause of state death.

<p><italic>Redress Trust</italic> — a young and vibrant organization — developed into a widely appreciated actor in the quest for reparative justice. <italic>Redress</italic> applies a variety of effective means and methods, including high-quality and thorough studies, intercessions to hold perpetrators accountable and securing remedies to victims and obtaining reparations for survivors of torture. There is still a striking gap between proclaimed standards of justice and harsh realities leaving large categories of victims unnoticed, unacknowledged and unattended. While the UN Reparation Principles provide a good deal of latitude in affording various forms of monetary and non-monetary reparations, any margins or latitudes in shaping reparative policies and programs may never ignore the principles of nondiscrimination and non-exclusion.

<p>Drawing on a neo-Gramscian perspective, I argue that considerable policy convergence at both the level of international organization and the state has made a significant contribution towards generating the required global sentiment within which emerging powers' redistributive demands are more likely to receive a sympathetic hearing. These dynamics are illustrated with reference to the global poverty debate. The recent “rediscovery” of global poverty [suggests] a basis for a coalition between the privileged and the emerging powers as a response to the need for a more socially responsible world order. After considering the policy-convergence process in South Africa and Brazil, this paper highlights some of the initiatives state elites in Pretoria and Brasilia have launched in reaction to the newly emerging policy space within which their esteem as rising states can be demonstrated.

<p>Much criticism of the liberal peace is in fact criticism of interventionist, top-down approaches. The manner in which the liberal peace is disseminated is criticized, but not, usually, the basic ideas on which it is based. This is problematic because some of the basic neoliberal assumptions that play a role in contemporary peace-building approaches, including the lack of attention for (collective) identity, the promotion of the free market, and the emphasis on national-level, formal institutions, do not sit well with the realities in many post-conflict countries. Still, despite all the criticisms of the liberal peace, there is a dearth of alternative visions. Following Foucault, we call for a world with many “heterotopias” that show the “friction” between the liberal peace and alternative realities, producing not one but multiple visions and interpretations.

<p>The understanding and clarification of important social events as themes must be derived from the hermeneutic code of the epoch. The millennial threshold was marked by processes of integration and particularization, which were observed, as constitutive principle or principle of legitimate refutation, also in the bringing down of socialist orders and the establishment of supranational associations. Thus a discussion of the (empirical) position and (normative) status of ethnic minorities must as well be positioned in a universal European context, in which the predominant role is played by liberal theory and liberal practice. In societies going through transformation from ideological to legal state, answers to multi-ethnic needs must be sought in the patterns of liberal philosophy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>In an era of public distrust and cynicism, a daunting task for public administration and public policy is how to rediscover a more substantive role in public affairs. The focus on managerial approaches, technical competency, and adherence to procedural rules will most likely never sustain the normative credibility needed to reconnect the broader citizenry. Something more is needed. In this article a renewed emphasis on democratic citizenship and public ethics is called for in order to reconnect the citizenry so as to confront the normative interdependency of political and economic issues.

<p>The continuing budget deficits and accumulating public debt that commonly plagues western democracies reflects a clash between two rationalities regarding human governance: one of private property and its conventions and one of common property and its procedural framework. Democratic budgeting creates a form of fiscal commons whose governance is subject to the tragic outcomes depicted by G. Hardin. To be sure, tragedy can be avoided as E. Ostrom (1990) explains, but only to the extent that the fiscal commons is governed in a manner consonant with A. De Viti de Marco's (1936) model of the cooperative state. While the tragedy of the commons that results from this tectonic clash is an inherent feature of democratic political economy, that tragedy can nonetheless be limited through reasserting the conventions and institutions of a constitution of liberty.

<p>How can we understand the application of state power through child pornography prosecutions of legally classified children? In <italic>On the Genealogy of Morals</italic>, F. Nietzsche argued that, among its many uses, punishment was essentially a means to sharpening the memory so that the various laws and obligations of an individual owed to society could be fulfilled. However, at issue in the prosecutions of child-autopornography is not any lasciviousness or sexuality itself. I argue that prosecutions of child-autopornography represent an inversion of Nietzsche's “mnemotechnics”, the brutal science of inflicting memory. Instead, in these cases, where state power forces the production of a victimizer where none previously existed, punishment is used in the interest of creating “amnemotechnics”, the brutal science of inflicting amnesia.

<p>Economists have made a strong case for the relative efficiency of market-based mechanisms for environmental regulation such as cap-and-trade and “green taxes”, yet the spread of these forms has been limited, and traditional “command and control” regulation still predominates. The authors explain geographical and temporal variation in green tax burdens by considering their domestic and international determinants, modeling international influences using spatial lags. Hypotheses are tested using panel data on OECD member states from 1995 to 2004. At the domestic level, the authors show that green tax burdens are influenced by the left-right and environmental positions of legislative medians and the power of the energy-producing sector, among other factors. Ideas about policy diffuse through international networks generated by trade and environmental intergovernmental organizations, but we do not find compelling evidence for international tax competition.

<p>This article provides results from an investigation into the impact of dependent citizen journalism on the publicity of terror. In the past, many academics have identified the importance of publicity to an act of terror drawing on the concept of “propaganda by deed”. This article presents results of a study into the impact of a distinct form of journalism in the digital era, dependent citizen journalism, on the publicity of terror. The argument is put forth that dependent citizen journalism generates distinctive, additional publicity to a terrorist attack. The article shows how this publicity differs and what negative consequences there are to the involvement of dependent citizen journalists in the reporting process. [R]</p>

<p>There are two discourses that are used in connection with the provision of good healthcare: a rights discourse and a beneficial design discourse. Although the logical force of these two discourses overlaps, they have distinct and incompatible implications for practical reasoning about health policy. The language of rights can be interpreted as the ground of a well-designed healthcare system stressing the values of equality and inclusion, but it has less application when dealing with questions of cost-effectiveness. This difference reflects the distinction between the deontological status of rights claims and a teleological approach presupposed in the language of beneficial design.

<p>An influential model of deliberative democracy advances reciprocity as a norm of democratic debate on morally controversial issues. This norm is at odds with behavior observed in political campaigning and policy-making where advocates of competing positions talk past one another. Does this inconsistency stem from a contrast between the normative and empirical or from not considering empirically plausible practices of democratic debate in which reciprocity might be respected? One such practice is free votes on conscience issues in the UK parliament. This article examines six second-reading debates in the UK House of Commons on abortion legislation to assess whether, in favorable circumstances, political debate is consistent with reciprocity. It finds no gross departure from the norm of reciprocity, suitably operationalized, but neither does it find complete conformity to the norm of reciprocity. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As strategies for campaign political advertising become more complex, there remains much to learn about how ad characteristics shape voter reactions to political messages. Drawing from existing literature on source credibility, we expect ad sponsorship will have meaningful effects on voter reactions to political advertisements. We test this by using an original experiment, where we expose a sample of student and non-student participants to equivalent ads and vary only the paid sponsor disclaimer at the end of the message. The only thing that differs across stimuli is whether a political candidate, a known interest group, or an unknown interest group sponsors the advertisement. Following exposure to one of these ads, participants complete a post-test battery of questions measuring the persuasiveness of the message, source credibility, and message legitimacy. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Surprisingly, waves of political regime contention in Europe have slowed down through history but have achieved more success in triggering advances toward democracy, as a comparison of the revolutions of 1848 and 1917–1919 shows. Major organizational developments account for these inverse trends. Before political mass organizations arose, ordinary people decided whether to emulate foreign challenges to established autocrats. Short on information, citizens relied heavily on inferential shortcuts and acted rashly, with little success. After the rise of mass organizations, common people took cues from their representative leaders, who had more information and greater processing capacity. Before emulating an external precedent and challenging their ruler, leaders waited for propitious circumstances. Therefore, 20th-c. regime-contention diffused more slowly yet with greater success.

<p>Political scientists rarely take full advantage of the substantive inferences that they can draw from time-series cross-section data. We show that by simulating the quantities of interest over longer periods of time and across theoretically interesting scenarios, we can draw much richer inferences. We present a technique that produces graphs of dynamic simulations of relationships over time. Graphical simulations are useful because they represent long-term relationships between key variables and allow for examination of the impact of exogenous and/or endogenous shocks. We demonstrate the technique's utility by graphically representing key relationships from two different works. We also present a preliminary version of the dynsim command, which we have designed to extend the Clarify commands in order to produce dynamic simulations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>Leadership turnover may produce significant foreign policy changes when leaders differ from their predecessors in their preferences over the resort to war and when they cannot commit to implement inherited policies. How, then, does the expected behavior of an incumbent leader's successor affect crisis bargaining in the present? I analyze a leader-centric model of crisis-bargaining in which (1) the distributive outcomes of crises affect political survival, (2) leadership turnover implies the accession of a new leader with potentially different preferences, and (3) successors can renegotiate inherited settlements. In equilibrium, the sensitivity of an incumbent's political survival to making concessions interacts with the resolve of the successor to affect both the terms of settlement and the occurrence of war.

<p>The international criminal regime, as currently conceived, relies almost exclusively on the power of backward-looking criminal sanctions to deter future international crimes. This model reflects the dominant mid-century approach to crime control, which was essentially reactive. Since then, domestic criminal scholars and practioners have developed and implemented new theories of crime-control — theories notable for their promise of crime prevention through <italic>ex ante</italic> attention to community and environmental factors. Community policing, crime-prevention through environmental design, and related “situational” approaches to crime-control have had a significant impact on the administration of domestic criminal law.

<p>This article contributes to the debate on emergency rule, a practice that democratic theory has struggled to conceptualize. Accordingly, it differs from existing approaches, which mainly focus on the constitutional design of regimes of exception and tend to identify the institution of the Roman dictator as their source. In contrast, we offer a comprehensive approach, considering other historical sources of emergency rule, going beyond the dichotomy of constitutional and <italic>de facto</italic> emergency, and focusing specifically on the types of emergency powers involved: executive, legislative and judicial. We propose a different way of conceptualizing emergency rule, following a political rather than a constitutional logic, and we illustrate this different conceptualization by offering evidence from Bolivia, Chile and Guatemala to demonstrate how this comprehensive approach works in practice.

<p>This article extends the research on institutional sources of corruption by investigating whether legislative institutions play a significant role in driving corruption in developing country democracies. When legislative rules (1) give parties control over agenda setting and (2) allow parties to strip legislators who vote against the party line of their legislative mandates, parties can exercise valuable influence over the legislative policy process, which allows them to engage in practices leading to higher corruption. I derive two testable hypotheses linking higher party influence over agenda setting and voting in the legislature to higher corruption and test them by using a new data set on legislative rules for 64 developing country democracies from 1984 to 2004. The empirical results corroborate the hypotheses and remain robust when controlling for alternative explanations. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>As global society has observed the rise of women's rights and their development in a context of globalization, much research has focused on the conditions under which women's rights are acquired. Most studies, however, focus merely on one dimension of women's rights or explore one case in depth. Few studies compare cases of women's rights cross-nationally or longitudinally. This limitation can create much confusion in determining the factors that are influential or negligible for women's rights. By replicating and extending a recently published article focusing on women's social rights (E. Yoo, “International human rights regime, neoliberalism, and women's social rights, 1984–2004”, <italic>International Journal of Comparative Sociology</italic> 52(6), 2011: 503–528], I distinguish the factors that are more and less influential in explaining women's political, economic, and social rights globally.

<p>This article proposes that there is congruence in Western and Muslim political thought on issues of soft foundationalism, negative theology, provisional truth claims and religious democracy to offset hegemonic tendencies. In political science, the neutralization of ideology is also supported in response to concern about ideological encroachments into the discipline. In addition, the article discusses the residual issue of positivism and knowledge as social construction, i.e., the social sciences themselves as ideological with regard to the agnostic position of their methodology. This has implications for the study of religion, in this case Islam, and the field's problematic nomenclature, such as Islamism and post-Islamism. This is explored through a discussion of the Arab Spring and Malaysian politics. [R, abr.]</p>

Section (3) concentrates on the issue of border as a political category, while Section (4) focuses on the most relevant theoretical approaches to borders.

I conclude by pointing out the most relevant aspects needed to build the foundations for a Political Theory of Borders. [R, abr.]</p>

<p>The inappropriability of the earth as a fundamental principle of cosmopolitical rights, from which other rights and duties of humanity should be deduced, has the capacity to renew the content of the idea of world-citizen, based on a more fundamental right than that of state citizenship. This in no way means a need to question the positive right of states, but simply that above that right lies that of the citizen of the world (i.e. of humanity), which prevails. For Kant the only content of the cosmopolitical rights of the world-citizen was the hospitality owed to whoever arrives and goes on his way. From the concept of the earth's inappropriability, this right extends considerably in scope: it includes not only the duty of hospitality, but also human rights and, further, the right to benefit from the fruits of the earth with a view to a decent existence. The whole defines cosmopolitical responsibility for humanity. [R] [First of two articles on “Rethinking cosmopolitanism”, introduced by the author. See also <italic>Abstr</italic>. 62.7950]</p>

This research note first assesses the added value that the concept of empire brings to the study of international relations. The second aim is to establish how best to study contemporary empires. Which actors can be classified as empires? Should one focus on imperial structure, mission or behavior? The third objective is to identify patterns of cooperation and competition among empires.

Some premature theses regarding the “end of geography” or the states' loss of power in the contemporary world have promptly been countered by well-founded criticism in the scientific community. The work inquires into the character of deterritorialization, and analyzes the traps inherent to contemporary research of territory and the geopolitical characteristics thereof. [R]</p>
