<p><italic>Drawn to Freedom: Christian Faith Today in Conversation with the Heidelberg Catechism</italic></p>
<p>Eberhard Busch</p>
<p>Translated by William H. Rader</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 376 pp. $32.00</p>
<p>As the subtitle suggests, <italic>Drawn to Freedom</italic> is a “conversation” between Christian faith today, as Eberhard Busch understands it, and the Heidelberg Catechism of 1563. It is not simply a commentary on Heidelberg, although he pays close attention to the Catechism’s 129 questions and answers (or Articles). Busch does not restrict himself to what Zachary Ursinus (1534–83), the Catechism’s primary author, meant. Nor does he confine himself to the Catechism’s immediate historical context. Theology is a living, dynamic conversation with the Bible, significant witnesses in Christian history, and contemporary faith. What Busch finds in the Catechism is a marvelous description of Christian freedom.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with Busch will not be surprised that his interpretation of Heidelberg reflects many of the major themes in Karl Barth’s theology. Busch, Professor Emeritus of Reformed Theology at the University of Göttingen in Germany, has written the standard biography of Barth (<italic>Karl Barth: His Life from Letters and Autobiographical Texts</italic>, Fortress, 1976), an introduction to Barth’s theology (<italic>The Great Passion</italic>, Eerdmans, 2004), and a commentary on the Theological Declaration of Barmen of 1934 of which Barth was the primary author (<italic>The Barmen Theses Then and Now</italic>, Eerdmans, 2010). <italic>Drawn to Freedom</italic> was first published in German in 1999 and has now been ably and clearly translated into English by William H. Rader. Although Barth’s influence is large here, it would be a mistake to read this book as simply a Barthian interpretation of the Heidelberg Catechism. Before he became a theology professor, Busch was for many years the pastor of a Reformed congregation in Switzerland, and his experience as a pastor and his understanding of contemporary Christian life deeply inform his interpretation of the Catechism.</p>
<p>Busch argues that the Catechism’s first question and answer—“What is your only comfort, in life and in death?”—is not so much an anthropological starting point for faith as it is a summary of the rest of the Catechism. Everything that follows in the next 128 Articles “just develops and expounds what is already said in Article 1” (20). The theme of the whole Catechism is that “God’s grace redeems us miserable folk, and does this so thoroughly that it <italic>frees us</italic> ‘to live for him from now on’ by grace” (22; italics mine). As Busch reads it from beginning to end, the Catechism is about the free God and the free human being.</p>
<p>After the first two articles, the Catechism is divided into three parts: human misery (Articles 3–11), humanity’s redemption and freedom (Articles 12–85), and thankfulness (Articles 86–129). In light of the theme of freedom that Busch finds in the first Article, he boldly restructures the Catechism into a different three-part structure. Busch’s Part 1 covers the first 22 Articles of the Catechism and is about “God’s Deliverance of the Captive.” The good news is that in Jesus Christ, God has freely chosen to belong to us—to be for us and with us in Jesus Christ, to be our neighbor, but not our possession—and because God belongs to us we belong to God. Part 2, “The Free God,” covers Articles 23–55 and 65–85. The material here includes what Busch argues is “the center of the confession of faith”—Articles 29–52 on Christology. Part 3, “The Free Human Being,” interprets Christian freedom in terms of the new, engaged, and mature human being. The final section on the mature human being (319–50) is Busch’s interpretation of prayer and the six petitions of The Lord’s Prayer. With good reason some Christians today dismiss “academic” theology as a sterile enterprise unrelated to the life of the church. If you harbor those suspicions, I encourage you to read what Busch has to say about prayer. This is theology at its best.</p>
<p>Some readers will wonder whether Busch’s discussion of Christian freedom uncovers a theme implicit in the theology of the Heidelberg Catechism or whether he has forced the Catechism to sing not only a different tune, but a different song. I favor the former assessment, but not everyone will agree.</p>
