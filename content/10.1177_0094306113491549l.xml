<p>Ever since Durkheim’s seminal work, the sociology of suicide has tended to focus on the analysis of suicide rates. Some may even argue that a concern with rates is the defining feature of the sociological approach. But like any other behavior, each suicide occurs in a particular time and place and responds to concrete social conditions, such as the loss of a job or a conflict between spouses. The great advantage of <italic>Understanding Suicide</italic> is that it goes beyond mere rates to discuss the immediate social context in which suicide occurs.</p>
<p>The authors, Ben Fincham, Susanne Langer, Jonathan Scourfield, and Michael Shiner, accomplish this through the analysis of 100 cases of suicide in a mid-sized city in the United Kingdom. Their information comes from the investigative files of the county coroner, which include suicide notes, eyewitness statements, interviews with relatives and friends of the deceased, and the testimony of psychiatrists. These sources allow the authors to conduct what they call a “sociological autopsy”—a post-mortem analysis of the social conditions surrounding individual cases of suicide.</p>
<p>The first three chapters of the book review previous studies of suicide and address broad metatheoretical and methodological questions, culminating in the authors’ claim that they seek a middle ground between scientific (the term they use is “objectivist”) and interpretive approaches. While these chapters may be educational for newcomers, those already familiar with the suicide literature should probably skip ahead to the meat of the study.</p>
<p>Turning to their data, the authors begin by examining their source of information as a subject in its own right, showing how the informants cited in the coroner’s files all have distinctive ways of talking about the suicidal individual and the suicidal act. Medical pathologists, for instance, speak only of the physiological causes of death (such as blood loss), while relatives of the deceased discuss the stressful life events that motivated suicide. Furthermore, informants often appear concerned with minimizing any perceived responsibility for the death. For example, a girlfriend might neglect to mention that she ended her relationship with the deceased shortly before he killed himself, though other informants describe him as extremely depressed over the break-up. Even the accounts of the suicide victims—as recorded in notes—downplay their own responsibility for the act, speaking of suicide as the only available option. The authors go on to analyze suicide notes in detail, focusing on the ways in which self-killers use them to maintain and alter relationships with the living. For example, notes often attempt to influence the emotional state of those left behind, in both positive and negative ways. Thus some absolve loved ones of any responsibility for the suicide, while others express hostility and blame.</p>
<p>Following their discussion of suicide notes, the authors examine the clusters of circumstances, experiences, and values that lead people to kill themselves. While many treat suicide as an individual pathology—to be understood and treated according to a medical model of mental illness—this analysis demonstrates that suicide often has its roots in interpersonal relationships. In case after case, informants and victims reference broken relationships and interpersonal conflicts as reasons for self-destruction, showing that suicide can be profoundly social in both its causes and consequences.</p>
<p>Next, the authors turn to variation in the reasons for suicide, showing that these vary across the life course. For example, relationship breakdowns and financial crises are more likely to be implicated in the suicides of the middle-aged than either the very young or the very old—a pattern explained by the greater involvement of middle-aged people in family roles like spouse and provider, leading to correspondingly greater devastation when these roles are disrupted.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors conclude by noting the relevance of such case-level data to suicide prevention. For example, prevention efforts could take account of the varying reasons for suicide across the life-course, with different sorts of intervention aimed at young, middle-aged, and older persons and tailored to the kind of stresses most likely to spark suicide in each group.</p>
<p>The book’s main shortcoming is that it lacks a clear theoretical mission. While each empirical chapter stands well on its own, together they resemble a disparate collection of studies whose only connection is a shared source of data. Thus the chapter examining informants’ accounts of suicide might be more at home in a volume on the sociology of knowledge than next to chapters that examine suicide as such. Furthermore, each study could stand as contributions to an established branch of social science without wasting space in the introductory chapters discussing whether suicide is <italic>really</italic> a “fact” or a “construction”—or dredging up the hoary debate about the relative merits of quantitative and qualitative methods. Such self-conscious agonizing is by no means unique to this book, but does seem to be another symptom of theoretical uncertainty. Rather than a strong central argument or major contribution to a clearly defined program, readers should expect to encounter a smorgasbord of findings, themes, and ideas.</p>
<p>Still, this smorgasbord includes valuable material on suicide and suicide investigation, and the authors deserve credit for their foray into the micro-sociology of suicide. Moving beyond the simple rates and demographic categories that dominate the suicide literature, Fincham et alia address the actual social circumstances that cause self-destruction. Relationships form and break, status is gained and lost, and like any other human behavior suicide emerges from the daily flux of social life.</p>
