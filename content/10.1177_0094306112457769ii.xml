<p>John Richardson and Justin Powell have written an ambitious and wide-ranging comparative institutional history of special education. Although special education has not received sustained attention in comparative education or educational sociology, its legitimation and ongoing expansion, they argue, is “among the most significant worldwide processes in education” (p. 17) of the past century. While many educational practices tend to converge globally, the diffusion of special education has resulted in a vast range of national differences—in conceptions of disability, participation rates, and organizational forms—even across developed democracies. Moreover, although the global shift from <italic>special</italic> education (segregated schools and separate classrooms) to <italic>inclusive</italic> education (regular school and classroom integration) is “one of the most significant intellectual reversals in the contemporary era” (p. 17), it is more euphemistic than substantive because special education’s historical institutions and organizational forms persist despite changing ideas and ideals. In terms of variability, the authors ask how and why national special education systems developed, and whose interests their expansion and persistence serve. On the question of persistence, their challenge is to explain institutional inertia “in the face of tremendous advocacy and social movement mobilization for change” (p. 11).</p>
<p>Richardson and Powell address these questions with an historical and cross-national comparative analysis of the institutional development and consequences of special education as a central aspect of schooling. Conceptually, their comparison is “macrosociological and intercultural” (p. 3), emphasizing normative and cultural-cognitive bases of institutionalization and attending to the impact of macrostructural carriers such as international organizations, the state, and professional groups. The analysis is supported by an effective integration of historical and neo-institutional sociology and an array of comparative and historical research strategies, including examination of large datasets as well as case-based regional and national comparisons of England and France and the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>The authors’ first objective is to identify the variation in patterns and conditions that constitute special education internationally. Their second, theoretical objective is to interpret the patterns found across countries, for which they use a two-stage conceptual typology. In the first stage, they categorize patterns in reference to the interaction of two central dimensions that have affected how special education varies: “with patterned regularity” (p. 14), across time and space—a “segregation/inclusion” (p. 15) dimension of institutionalized organizational forms, ranging from segregated settings to inclusive classrooms; and a “centralization/decentralization” (p. 15) dimension of education governance structures, reflecting national political structure. In the second stage, the authors interpret the categorized patterns in their typology by examining nation- and region-specific institutional logics that influence the rise and evolution of historically-specific organizational structures. Thus, “there is not just one institution or institutionalization of special education” (p. 171), there are many nation- and region-determined forms and trajectories, as the authors demonstrate and insightfully explain.</p>
<p>The body of <italic>Comparing Special Education</italic> is organized in three interrelated parts. The first traces the convergence of two sets of influences on the construction and global diffusion of special education—late eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought, whose debates and concepts are the ideational origins of special education, and nineteenth-century economic changes, state-making activities, and extensions of citizenship rights that established by century’s end the social conditions for compulsory education legislation. That legislation in turn created the need for special education in the schools and diffused it globally along with the idea of mass schooling which, coupled with economic development, increasingly came to signify a nation’s strength and stature. The second part includes three well-argued chapters that, respectively, analyze cross-national variation in special education classification and participation rates using United Nations special education participation survey data, compare Western and non-Western special education structures and cultures using Weberian ideal types, and explain the divergence of originally similar special education systems in the United States and Germany using neo-institutional theory. The final part focuses on contemporary special education paradoxes that become evident in comparing special education across time and place. All of the paradoxes result from particular institutionalization processes and special education’s relationship to its neighboring institutions, and all reflect the challenges that contemporary special education faces and has faced since its ideational genesis in Enlightenment thought.</p>
<p>For Richardson and Powell, the greatest challenge faced by contemporary special education in all nations is achieving inclusive education, a challenge best illustrated by the cases of the United States and Germany. Both are pioneers in universal education and special education, in reducing the exclusion of disabled children from schooling by building special education systems. Although their respective systems are radically different, the former premised on separate classrooms in regular schools and the latter on segregated special education schools, in both cases the principal barrier to achieving inclusive education is the entrenched institutional persistence of their existing special education systems. The bureaucratic side of the Western “democracy-bureaucracy” (p. 136) model of special education renders it “a semiclosed reproductive structure” (p. 140), a paced sequence of linked classification and placement decisions that reproduces outcomes in a predetermined manner. As an institutionalized myth that contradicts the logic of dual special/regular education systems, the democratic ideal of inclusion is subverted by “the decoupling of policies designed to facilitate it from processes that compose the formal structure of schools” (p. 145). As such, the system is rife with dilemmas, conflicts, and politics that are predetermined as well, as these are “expressions of the ceremonial and ritualistic activities that are ‘logical’ responses to institutionalized myths” (p. 145).</p>
<p>Thus, the authors’ recommendation for non-Western nations is to skip the special education development process and move directly to inclusive education. They recognize, however, that Western nations like Germany and the United States and most other countries with developed education systems face a different problem. Because inclusive education calls the institutional logic of these educational systems into question, achieving meaningful inclusive education requires deinstitutionalizing them. Moreover, Richardson and Powell’s analysis illustrates and reminds us that meaningful changes in special education require equally meaningful changes in the other institutions with which it is interconnected. As they demonstrate, the practices and the outcomes of special education “vary by their long-ago institutionalized ties to other fields, such as social welfare, health care, juvenile justice, and labor markets” (p. 270). Ultimately then, achieving inclusive education in national education systems requires deinstitutionalizing welfare state regimes. <italic>Comparing Special Education</italic> gives us a comprehensive historical and institutional understanding of special education and, through this, an in-depth appreciation of the formidable barriers to inclusion that democracies need to remove if they are to maximize the capabilities and participation of their citizens.</p>
<p>My only criticism of this impressive and significant work is that the authors’ explanation of the historical sequence and institutional link among eighteenth- and twentieth-century special education and nineteenth-century compulsory (regular) education, and thus their related point that special education antedates regular education, would have been benefited from an earlier and more explicit characterization of the substantially different types of conditions and needs addressed by special education in its early and late forms—in the former, individuals with largely significant, objective biological impairments; in the latter, individuals with these impairments and, in far greater proportion, those with a range of other largely mild, often subjective, school-related learning and behavioral difficulties.</p>
