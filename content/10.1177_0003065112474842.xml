<abstract>
<p>The psychoanalytic process takes on a special ambience when the analyst is clearly elderly. The effects of this ambience on the the aging analyst’s patients are discussed, and the sparse literature on the subject is reviewed. Clinical vignettes illustrate a number of these effects on the analytic process. Dealing with these special problems requires not only the analyst’s awareness of their existence but a continual monitoring of the transference-countertransference in order to avoid a silent collusion of patient and analyst to pretend these problems do not exist. The dangerous consequences of being unaware of the situation, for both patient and analyst, are discussed. If the influence of the patient’s perception of the analyst’s aging is ignored, it may lead to destruction of the treatment either through massive acting out or by a hopeless stalemate with or without the development of an endless psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>A variety of problems may have to be faced by the elderly and increasingly aging psychoanalyst in conducting psychoanalytic therapy. I will focus here on the reactions of patients, conscious or unconscious, subtle or obvious, to the ambience created by the manifest aging of their analyst. The analyst I have in mind is one who has no apparent serious health problems, the symptoms of which would force him or her into retirement, and who has no obviously developing serious infirmities. There are no formal studies of special problems for patients introduced into the analytic process by their perceiving their analyst’s aging. I define “aging” here as becoming manifest in analysts in their seventies and being definitive by the age of eighty, Freud’s age near the end of his practice. Aging of the analyst in the sense employed here becomes apparent usually at about sixty-five, what used to be the standard retirement age, but it is often possible for patients to ignore that the analyst is getting old for a few years longer, depending on the health, personality, and vigor of the individual analyst. An increasing number of analysts today are remaining in practice well into their later years, and it is surprising that so little has been published on the effect of this aging on the analyst-patient dyad.</p>
<p>The older psychoanalyst, like all analysts, is continuously looking for clues in each patient’s free associations, dreams, and even minor enactments as to how the patient’s view of the analyst is shifting. It is then up to the analyst to decide whether these shifts are defensive in nature, transference in nature, realistic observations that are communicated as a warning, or all of the above. There is an important ethical aspect to this that has not been much discussed in the literature. The problems posed for the patient by changes in the analyst’s capacity to function due to the aging process, and even by changes in the ambience of the analyst’s office or appearance, can have a profound effect on the treatment. It is the ethical responsibility of the aging analyst, who may tend to deny the changes in appearance and functioning that old age brings, to watch for clues the patient may be presenting that express an awareness and concern about these changes. This constitutes a measure of the analyst’s dedication to what is best for his or her patients and of his or her willingness to continue relentless self-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065112474842">Chessick 1990</xref>) to the end of one’s career. Patients are sometimes very loyal and protective toward their analyst, and so are loath to speak openly about their concerns, but their associations offer many clues. Ultimately it is up to the analyst to be alert to the arrival of the day when it will be in everyone’s best interest to consider retirement. If an analyst over seventy decides to begin a standard long-term psychoanalysis with a new patient, he or she may especially wish to consider the issues presented here.</p>
<p>Refusing to face the awareness and concern that patients may be trying to communicate can lead to situations in which disastrous disease, manifest dementia, or some flagrant boundary crossing eventually makes it apparent to everyone that the analyst is seriously impaired. It is obviously destructive and shocking to patients to have their analyst die or be suddenly unable to practice in the middle of their treatment. This shocking disruption leaves serious difficulties for their subsequent treatment. Patients who suddenly lose their analyst through death or disability pose special problems in the resumption of their analysis, especially if it is again with an older analyst. Sometimes they can never quite get over the trauma of the sudden loss and are resolved to protect against its happening again. It remains always in the background of their associative material and dreams. To be sensitive and empathic with patients’ concerns over such matters, the elderly analyst is clearly called upon to be realistic about his or her condition and future, avoiding narcissistic denial and defensive imaginings about oneself.</p>
<p>A fear similar to that of one’s aging analyst dying is the fear that the analyst will become sick, suddenly or gradually, and be forced to abruptly retire. Of course these fears can be read as projections of transference hostility, or as fueled by childhood experiences of loss, but as the analyst obviously and significantly ages, there is an unavoidable reality factor behind them. To be clear, however, this paper is <italic>not</italic> about the sick or aging analyst’s problems. It is about how the analyst’s <italic>patients</italic> deal with the not entirely unrealistic concern that their analyst is manifestly aging and so might be insidiously ill or suddenly become sick or die. The patients of the obviously aging analyst are constantly on the lookout for this, consciously or unconsciously, and, in my clinical experience, are alert to the development of senility, arteriosclerotic dementia, Alzheimer’s, or Parkinson’s disease in their analyst. When a patient says, “I want to tell you about my foolish rigid old—excuse me—boyfriend,” the aging analyst will recognize the implication. We are all trained to examine closely how our patients perceive us, but the situation with respect to our aging is much more complex than it might seem. In addition to the usual transference implications one must be alert to, it involves a recognition that, though the analyst may feel relatively young and vigorous, the person the patient sees and may be responding to is the old person the analyst sees in the mirror if he or she is willing to look clearly. And at some level the patient may be frighteningly aware that behind that old person the shadow of disability or death is always present.</p>
<p>In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003065112474842">Philip Roth (2006)</xref>, “Old age is a battle, dear, if not with this, then with that. It’s an unrelenting battle, and just when you’re at your weakest and least able to call up your old fight” (p. 143). Patients of the aging analyst will be aware, consciously or unconsciously, that their analyst is involved in this battle in all its forms. For example, the religious or other existential choices used by the aging analyst to defend against possible bitterness, solitude, loneliness, or despair in the aging process, some choices pathological and some not, have an impact on his or her patients, as have all other aspects of the analyst’s personality and convictions. In all analyses the patient consciously or unconsciously scans the emotional and cognitive functioning of the analyst continuously, and often can sense when and where the analyst is preoccupied and conflicted. For Freud as he aged, existential and biblical issues became more salient; similarly, they may become a concern for today’s aging analyst. Even any hesitation and wavering in aging analysts among these choices, or any changing of choices as they age, will be sensed at least subliminally by their patients. They may react to their analyst’s concern with these matters in a manner consistent with their transferences, fantasies, and predominant character defenses.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature, With Commentary</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112474842">Eissler (1975)</xref> produced the most often cited publication on the elderly analyst, though he wrote only of the aging male analyst. His paper begins with the reminder that the image of the aging man generates an atmosphere in the treatment office very different from that produced by a younger therapist. This aura may significantly affect the psychoanalytic process. Eissler maintains that with aging comes an increase in narcissism. But sometimes the opposite is true: old age can allow analysts to look back more realistically at their career and judge whether it has matched their ambitions, an assessment possible only with some reduction of narcissism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003065112474842">Leavy (2011)</xref> writes that “retirement from the competitive arena in which most of us live, from the marketplace in which success and attractiveness and apparent righteousness prevail, means that the deceptions and self-deceptions abounding in ordinary social existence are less useful. I no longer need to be admired, to be Top Dog” (p. 712). This reduction in narcissism, if it occurs, may result in personal psychic gain and an improvement in the analyst’s capacity for empathy and functioning with patients, much to their benefit.</p>
<p>However, Eissler claims that from this postulated increase in narcissism arise the dangers of rigidity, compulsiveness, intolerance, and involutional depression. These increase as the aging analyst works with his patients, and are accompanied by the analyst’s increasing expectation, almost a demand, based on narcissistic entitlement, that the patient will unconditionally surrender to the psychoanalytic technique and develop a passive attitude. This carries the danger of expecting admiration, awe, and respect from the patient. The analyst may begin to cross boundaries with the fantasy that he is testing technical innovations. Eissler explains this as a reduction in superego function in the aging analyst that produces a feeling of omnipotence and entitlement to special privileges.</p>
<p>But Eissler considers it a positive consequence of increasing narcissism that it leads to “a sense of secureness and comparative invulnerability.” This, he says, will enable “the aging person to relinquish illusions which he had harbored about himself in the past. He finally recognizes and accepts how far he will go in life and acknowledges inevitable limitations; ambitious goals of earlier life periods will be replaced by goals which harmonize with reality and his own potentialities” (p. 321). Curiously, Eissler does not seem to recognize that this favorable development could also be the consequence of a reduction in narcissism. He maintains that the increase in narcissism in turn reduces the analyst’s anxiety about failure and reduces therapeutic zeal. He says it can increase the analyst’s tolerance of the patient, whose illness no longer represents an “enemy” (p. 321) to be conquered. So from his point of view, aging has a mixture of good and bad consequences for the analyst’s practice. In Eissler’s opinion, “the vicissitude of narcissistic accretion brought about by aging determines whether the therapist’s aging affects the psychoanalytic technique in a favorable or undesirable way” (p. 320).</p>
<p>Eissler warns that when the elderly analyst’s contemporaries begin dying around him, it creates an impoverishment that may lead to a greater cathexis of professional life. As a result, patients become more important to the analyst than they were previously. This can cause problems because, as patients sense they have become important love objects, or in rare cases the analyst’s only love objects, the situation is so gratifying that they wish to continue in treatment forever. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003065112474842">Glucksman (2011)</xref> puts it, “Therapists who have suffered from early losses, or who have been narcissistically injured developmentally, through illness, aging, and unsatisfactory love relationships, are vulnerable to countertransference love. Consequently, they too find it difficult to terminate with their patients” (p. 191). And of course a situation can develop from this where patients feel too guilty to terminate their treatment and leave the aging analyst alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003065112474842">Erreich 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The weakening of memory is an important downside of the analyst’s aging, as Eissler points out. Similarly, the generation gap between the aging analyst and the young patient becomes a problem. “In our times,” Eissler notes, “moral values have changed so extensively that some analysts may no longer be able to integrate them” (p. 329). Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003065112474842">1975</xref>, when Eissler’s paper appeared, this gap has increased exponentially, and it certainly poses a problem for the elderly analyst. Because of this gap, younger patients may experience the analyst as coming from another culture and entirely unable to understand or empathize with them, or use this gap as a defense against emotional involvement.</p>
<p>Eissler suggests that when the process of senescence begins, the analyst should retire, but this is a kind of circular reasoning. He correctly notes that “analysts are not led by their aging to prefer retirement to professional activity” (p. 329), but at the same time he ominously adds that for the patient of the elderly analyst, “The objective probability of seeing his analyst in good health after his last analytic session shrinks with the progress of time” (p. 330). Patients are very aware of this danger and express it in many ways, direct or indirect. Eissler suggests that at the right moment it may be necessary to tell patients whom to turn to for advice and treatment should the analyst die, but finding that right moment is “up to the analyst’s tact . . . since the subject may precipitate severe resistances and stir up a host of unfavorable reactions” (p. 330). He fails to discuss in any detail the pitfalls involved in making such nonanalytic announcements and the countertransference issues that may generate them.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0003065112474842">Weiner (1990)</xref> interviewed fifteen psychiatrists—seven general psychiatrists, six psychoanalysts, and two child psychiatrists—all of whom were over sixty-five. To judge from the interviews, they seemed to be a very healthy group: “Most reported that transference and countertransference feelings were less intense than when they were younger. Erotized transferences no longer occurred. Angry, erotic, and omnipotent countertransferences were less frequent, as was the frequency of patient visits” (p. 47). But was all this due to aging or to the diminished frequency of visits? Or could it have been the result of depleted therapists desiring that diminished frequency? No explanation of the reduction in frequency is given, only that it was “at times the psychiatrist’s preference, at times patients’ preference, and at times resulted from the practice of the psychoanalytic institute to which the psychiatrist was attached. When analysts reached a certain age, certain institutes would no longer refer cases for analysis but would refer psychotherapy cases” (p. 47). We are not told at what age, or why, nor is any of this explained. Psychotherapy patients too may react disastrously to the sudden death of their therapist! Finally, one wonders if the psychoanalysts were being truthful when they reported that angry, erotic, and omnipotent countertransferences were less frequent; it is even conceivable that denial of such troubling countertransferences led to the analysts’ encouraging their patients to come less frequently.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003065112474842">Tallmer (1992)</xref> performed a rather superficial study of analysts she considered aging, some as young as fifty, and personally interviewed some “famous” older analysts. She reports that “many of these aging psychoanalysts were engaged in difficult, active struggles to combat feelings of depression” (p. 399). This she bases on “impressions gleaned from the interviews and scrutiny of the returned questionnaires” (p. 399). Overall she concluded that “within our small sample, urgent existential concerns are resolved idiosyncratically, depending on constitution, life events, cultural milieu and personality” (p. 403). Clearly it is not possible to offer simple generalizations about the effect of the analyst’s personal idiosyncrasies on the patient’s perception of the analyst’s aging; each case must be investigated individually. Tallmer does mention reports about young patients who started analysis with a sixty-nine-year-old male and wondered if the analyst would be around to finish the analysis. She also mentions one or two patients that a seventy-seven–year-old female therapist lost because they thought her too old-looking or too old to identify with them.</p>
<p>A study of older analysts by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003065112474842">Kaplan (1993)</xref> begins with his quoting a very nice definition of aging offered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112474842">Birren (1988)</xref>: “The transformation of the human organism after the age of maturity—that is, optimum age of reproduction—so that the possibility of survival constantly decreases and there are regular transformations in appearance, behavior, experience and social roles” (p. 159). Kaplan notes that “visual, auditory, and motor difficulties and cardiac problems are frequently present changes that need to be accepted and accommodated to by the therapist as well as by the patient” (p. 52); he also refers to Eissler’s comment about how the aura of the elderly analyst significantly affects the analytic process.</p>
<p>Kaplan’s remarks are based on informal discussions with colleagues and his own experience; he reports that these colleagues were sixty-five or older, still in active practice, and without serious physical problems. He maintains that the therapeutic process changes as the therapist ages “because the transference reactions that patients develop are not those to a parent figure but to a grandparent figure” (p. 53). But this could depend on whether the therapist has a need to act or appear, to use Kaplan’s term, “grandfatherly” (p. 53), which in each individual instance would be a function of either the analyst’s characterological features or a countertransference issue, or both. A lot also depends of course on the psychodynamics and experience of the patient, so it is always a complex interaction.</p>
<p>Kaplan argues that the apparent aging of the analyst makes it more difficult for some patients to express sexual feelings or fantasies because it feels disgusting to them to mention such desires to a grandparent figure. But other patients, he remarks, might find it safer to express sexual and aggressive feelings to just such a figure. Again, no generalization can be made. More incisively, he adds that in the “therapeutic” situation, if therapists are using their patients to support or protect themselves, it becomes difficult for patients to terminate treatment because they feel the need to support or protect the aging therapist. He also points out that “if therapists need their patients to protect themselves from their own sense of diminished self-worth, fear of death, and increased dependency, the patients would also have great difficulty in expressing aggressive feelings for fear that someone would die” (p. 54).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065112474842">Imber (2010)</xref> brings up the transference that some patients who are raising children develop toward older female analysts, imagining the analyst as a good grandparent: “The patient seeks a good supportive grandparent for his or her child and may subtly enlist the analyst in this endeavor” (p. 490). Development of these transferences is often dependent on both the personality characteristics and countertransference of the analyst and the experiences patients have had with grandparents, as well as their multiply determined desire for a good grandparent.</p>
<p>Imber points out that “some grandparents are bad. Little Red Riding Hood found a dangerous wolf when she expected a loving grandmother” (p. 493). So, for example, if the patient experiences the analyst as a dangerous wolf, he or she may employ passive aggression, simply stalling the analysis and waiting for the elderly analyst to get sick or die, enabling the patient to get safely away.</p>
<p>There are many other such combinations that are unique to the individual analyst’s conscious and unconscious style of patient care that are also reflected in the ambience of the elderly analyst. In instances of a younger patient with an aging analyst, an intense grandparent transference sometimes develops, while at other times it seems absent. This depends on the patient’s personal history and on the analyst’s particular need to deal with the aging process by playing the role of grandparent with his or her patients. The transference-countertransference patient-grandparent dyad can develop out of the loneliness or depletion of the aging analyst and the regressive needs of the patient. Sometimes this constellation is absent simply because other transferences predominate; at other times it is carefully hidden by both parties to the analysis. Like all unexplored, undiscovered, and unanalyzed transferences and countertransferences, it can produce a stalemate, unfortunate enactments, and a general failure of the analytic process. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003065112474842">Imber (2010)</xref> puts it, “some analysts are still uncomfortable with acknowledging that many aspects of our behavior (both verbal and nonverbal) have a profound impact on our patients that never reaches the light of day. We are always involved with our patients in ways we can never understand completely and that will not become fully conscious” (p. 501). Imber warns that the defensive use of collaboration between patient and therapist in the parent-grandparent transference-countertransference coupling can hide a variety of unacceptable, more archaic transferences, including those of envy, hostility, and fear of annihilation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065112474842">Colarusso (2000)</xref> offers an excellent survey of what each of us must undergo in the “fifth individuation,” as he calls late adulthood. It clearly expresses what sooner or later the aging analyst will have to endure and implies how the ambience of the treatment will invariably change. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003065112474842">Isaacs (2008)</xref> mentions the increasing amount of time and effort the elderly need for daily health maintenance and “to beat the path to a horde of health professionals for prevention and cure” (p. 106). He suggests that in cases where many cancellations are needed because of the analyst’s health, a reduction in session frequency may be forced to occur. More commonly, the analyst does not cancel sessions but appears harassed and overbusy, attempting to cram sessions with doctors, dentists, and physical therapists into his or her patient schedule, thereby changing the ambience of the treatment, at times dramatically. Patients will respond to this overbusy schedule with a variety of fantasies and reactions, and build transferences on their intuitive sense that something is going on that is preoccupying, annoying, frightening, and worrying the analyst.</p>

<title>Clinical Material</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003065112474842">Hoffman (1979)</xref> writes that “it is only in the psychoanalytic situation that idiosyncratic meanings of death, including connections with earlier danger situations, can be thoroughly explored” (p. 265). Each of the clinical examples that follow represents the final common pathway of a series of psychic interactions dependent on the personality and significant internal conflicts of the analyst, as well as of the patient. Nevertheless, certain typical themes do seem to arise among analysts in their seventies and eighties, ages at which it is no longer possible for either analyst or patient to ignore the aging process. The effect of the treatment’s changing ambience is the combined result of a series of transference-countertransference configurations, the controversial so-called real relationship, the patient’s early experience with parents and grandparents, the role of death and sudden infirmities in the patient’s young life, and the analyst’s particular way of dealing with the aging process and the ever closer reality of death. The patient’s reaction to all of this comes from a set of archaic fantasies formed by the patient early in life that affect all the object relations formed (or not) with people thereafter, including the psychoanalyst. The goal of psychoanalysis can be thought of as the study of the patient’s interpersonal experiences, enactments, dreams, free associations, and shifting transference phenomena in order to bring these early core fantasies, which have been buried in the unconscious and are shaping the patient’s life, to the attention of the adult patient’s ego in order to facilitate new and more mature solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065112474842">Chessick 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065112474842">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065112474842">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Let us now turn to a number of clinical vignettes illustrating problems in the analytic process that may be encountered as patients become aware of the analyst’s aging. I will use the word “demise” to refer either to the death of the analyst or to the relatively sudden permanent loss of the analyst through incapacitating illness or other circumstances. In reading these clinical vignettes keep in mind that the material is of course overdetermined, as all psychoanalytic material is, and that it would be easy to come up with alternative interpretations. The only criteria for deciding which interpretation is valid are present in our judgments of the patient’s response in behavior, dreams, interpretations, and object relations. In the psychoanalytic process, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003065112474842">Etchegoyen (1999)</xref> writes, “We have to accept perforce the beautiful complexity of the analytic situation and that we can never be sure of anything; we must remain receptive to the material, always attentive to the changes that can occur. The analytic process is very subtle, and we are not going to simplify it with a position taken at the outset” (p. 436). So any of the vignettes presented below are easily subject to alternative interpretations. The purpose of presenting them is to offer an interpretation, among others that might be considered, that concerns the effect on the patient of perceiving the analyst’s aging. Often one cannot be clear about how significantly the ambience provided by the age of the analyst contributes to the situation.</p>
<p>When he was in his eighties, Freud remarked that his female patients did not form expected erotic transferences to him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065112474842">Edmundson 2007</xref>). At one point he complained openly to a patient who was making no progress, saying, “You do not think it is worth your while to love an old man” (p. 209). Obviously, such comments run the risk of placing the patient in an impossible double bind, often resolved by the patient’s developing a false self or a deep sense of guilt and failure. But, as one of my patients spontaneously commented early in her therapy, “How can anyone be excited about an old man analyst?” The obviously aged features of the elderly analyst can pose a complicated problem for the patient who is tempted by erotic transference feelings, for they may not seem at all appropriate, and such feelings may be experienced as humiliating and demeaning. Often erotic transferences to an elderly analyst, when they do arise at all, may not at first carry the excitement in the patient of transferences to a young analyst. When they do occur, they may bring the material dangerously closer to direct awareness and realistic repetition of the unresolved infantile sexual attraction the patient has for her father, uncles, or even grandfathers, usually fired up by preoedipal disappointments. In preoedipally damaged patients, who make up most of the patients we see these days, issues of sudden loss and abandonment are predominant, and these issues may be hidden behind erotic transferences. Given time, transferences to elderly analysts, erotic or hostile or both, can sometimes reach an interpretable level of intensity, but it is a long and unpredictable process. For example, one of my patients could at first express her erotic transference only by admiring my clothing, repeatedly mentioning, as she left the office, how “good” I looked in the suit I had on that day. As she looked at me, in a manner resembling the frequent and significant nonverbal communication between Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth portrayed in Jane Austen’s <italic>Persuasion</italic>, one could sense the perceptual conflict in her mind between the attractive new suit and the elderly man in it, and what trouble that signified for her development of an erotic transference.</p>
<p>Matters can become very complicated and difficult to interpret clearly. For example, Ms. A. is an attorney young enough to be my daughter. As the child of a cold and distant father, she transferred her oedipal feelings to a neighbor and was madly in love with him. He was warm and loving to her for reasons that did not become clear, though I suspect some child abuse was involved. He moved away when she was five years old and she never got over it.</p>
<p>She insisted throughout her treatment that she had no erotic feelings of any kind for me, although she frequently professed a kind of nonerotic love of the sort one would feel for a father or grandfather. Her libidinal capacity was not disturbed, and she easily achieved orgasm. At the time, however, her marriage was stormy and there were no sexual relations since her husband, a drug addict, was not interested. At the same time, during her analysis this married patient became involved with an attorney about her age, but he was married and not interested in the torrid affair she wanted, a fact she complained about incessantly. There was a lot of kissing and groping and indeed she gave him oral sex, but whenever the chance for coitus came up he avoided it. She talked a great deal in her analysis about her yearnings for him, and often reported masturbating to fantasies of intercourse with him.</p>
<p>After years of treatment Ms. A. dreamed that she was in a hall with a number of rooms and was called to see a man who was going to show her his penis. In the dream she felt obligated to examine him. This was followed by a scene in which someone offered her small bits of cake and, though she did not like the taste and did not particularly want to eat it, she took one piece and ate it. At this point something went down into her stomach and she began growing a very ugly, disgusting mass inside her stomach.</p>
<p>This was a breakthrough dream for this woman, who originally presented with a serious eating disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065112474842">Chessick 1984</xref>), because it finally led, through further associations and dreams, to the discovery that as a child she had fantasies of becoming impregnated by sucking on her father’s penis, a notion she found extremely repulsive and unacceptable, both then and now. The question of what happened with the neighbor was also suspiciously in the background. All this was displaced to the process of her giving oral sex to various male lovers, a process that gave her pleasure as long as she did not have to swallow the semen. One possible interpretation of what was going on in the analytic process was that she was able to achieve this dream through a combination of the psychoanalysis and the compromise of allowing her erotic transference feelings to arise for a substitute, her unreachable colleague. Because he was young but unreachable, she avoided the danger of a passionate affair’s again being broken off by a lover’s change of mind, rejection, or moving away. Perhaps my advanced age was a factor in this complex transference situation, though how important a factor is hard to determine. The chance of losing me was realistic and because of Ms. A.’s traumatic childhood experience with her adult male neighbor, a direct erotic transference had to be avoided at all costs to protect her from the risk of yet another painful abandonment.</p>
<p>As part of the compromise formation in the dream, the man was simply reduced to a penis (she said, “Men think with their penis”) with no identifiable personal features. Before marriage Ms. A. chose to have affairs with narcissistic men who clearly did not love her but just used her for sex. Knowing this, she was spared the trauma of suddenly losing men she might otherwise have believed when they proclaimed they loved her and who then tired of her, changed their minds, and found someone else. Her powerful underlying oral-incorporative needs and experiences of her deeply disappointing relationship with her depressed mother were now able to emerge in the therapeutic material, no longer so defended against by her preoccupation with losing a man she loved or displaced to the eating disorder or acted out in stereotyped fellatio. It is possible that Ms. A. had circumvented the danger of an erotic transference to an elderly analyst who obviously had a limited life expectancy, and done so without any particular interpretive help from the analyst. By displacing the erotic transference to a colleague, she became able to furnish a dream that led to some deeper clarification of the past, revealing the underlying devastating relationship with her mother.</p>
<p>Other problems for patients of elderly analysts stem from the cognitive difficulties that sooner or later arise as a result of the analyst’s normal aging. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065112474842">Deleuze and Guatarri (1994)</xref> bluntly put it, “Old age is this very weariness . . . there is either a fall into mental chaos outside of the plane of composition or a falling-back on ready-made opinions, on clichés that reveal that an artist, no longer able to create new sensations, no longer knowing how to preserve, contemplate, and contract, no longer has anything to say” (p. 214). The elderly experience difficulty with recent memory, difficulty with speed of information processing, a reduction of topographic orientation, and above all, some deterioration of what is known as working memory, the ability to hold several thoughts in memory while performing the task of solving a problem. For elderly analysts this is especially apparent regarding the ever changing marketing of psychotropic drugs. New ones are continually being introduced, with new generic and brand names to memorize, though often they fail to be much different from the ones already available. The actual use of these drugs seems to vary greatly, as pharmaceutical companies try to push doctors and even the public to use them for every psychiatric condition and for just about anything else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003065112474842">Friedman 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>It is a confusing mess. For example, Ms. Z., the wife of a physician, was an intelligent mental health professional in analytic treatment with me. There was no indication in the clinical material that she was concerned with my age. Things went well with this middle-aged woman until one day she came in and asked me to refill a prescription for a psychotropic drug she received originally from her husband and that she felt was helping her. I knew that the drug he prescribed was not listed for her particular problem and also that there were no studies of its long-term use. In addition, it was known to be potentially addictive. After we discussed the meaning of her taking a prescription from her husband and asking me to refill it, the patient once more asked me to refill it, apparently having gained no insight from our discussion. I tried to point out that I thought it inappropriate for her condition and that it might pose certain dangers. I also mentioned that the drug was not listed in the latest Physicians Desk Reference. Abruptly she flew into a rage and burst out, “Of course it’s in the PDR! If you couldn’t find it in the PDR you must have some emotional problem with it. Or you’re becoming senile! My husband would think it is ridiculous for you not to prescribe that drug for me, as he has been doing. You’re a physician just like he is; what’s the matter with you? You are clearly too old to be doing psychotherapy or psychoanalysis any more, you are obsolete, you should retire!” I responded to this narcissistic wound with an enactment. I handed her my PDR and asked her to find it for me. After looking carefully, she admitted the drug was not in the PDR. This allowed us to converse more calmly and for her to gain insight into the rivalry she was setting up between her husband and me, as well as her concerns about my possible waning capacities and what all that might mean to the emerging development of her feelings for me.</p>
<p>Many analytic patients these days are given ancillary psychotropic medication. Although elderly analysts may choose to ignore these advances in psychopharmacology, this carries a malpractice danger and may deprive the patient of pharmacological help that could be useful as an adjunct to the analysis. I have met aging analysts who admitted to knowing nothing about the new generation of antipsychotic drugs and not even much about the newer antidepressants. Such lack of knowledge or interest may indirectly pose a problem for their patients, who often have used the internet to educate themselves (or mislead themselves) about the use of such drugs. Some patients may know even more about psychotropic drugs than the analyst and, if they become aware of it, may choose as a defensive maneuver or out of aggression and narcissism to entrap the analyst in arguments about what drugs they should be taking. If taken to an extreme, these defensive maneuvers and the analyst’s response to them can seriously disrupt the analytic process. For example, either the analyst, uncertain about his or her knowledge of psychopharmacology, may passively yield to the patient’s demand for a certain drug, or the analyst may force the patient to grudgingly comply with the analyst’s prescription or get nothing at all. One patient of mine, insisting I knew nothing about psychopharmacology, went to several psychopharmacologists for consultations. She was shocked to discover that the responses she received were all quite unempathic and that the pharmacological advice she got from each one was different and conflicting.</p>
<p>Cognitive difficulties may begin to show in other, more embarrassing ways. Patients are acutely aware of when the analyst forgets information they have provided and are constantly watching for signs of analyst “senility” or “dementia,” as they love to call it. Certainly there are other quite significant reasons for analysts to forget important names and material, but patients of the elderly analyst immediately tend to assume that the analyst is approaching senility, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease. One narcissistic patient, whenever I forgot even the smallest detail, would gleefully insist that I was developing one of these debilitating conditions. Patients sometimes use this situation to try to get into an argument about whether the analyst forgot the material or whether the patient just mistakenly thought he or she had told the analyst about it. This of course is an impossible argument to resolve and can be used by patients in defensive and aggressive ways. The analyst who stubbornly insists that the patient never before said anything about the material the patient claims was forgotten runs the risk of being experienced as rigid, authoritarian, and unempathic. This may escalate the argument to a serious rupture in the therapeutic alliance. Analysts who due to aging and increased narcissism cannot tolerate being accused of senility are especially vulnerable to this kind of challenging attack by patients. It may lead to mutual insults, anger, and endless unresolved debate instead of attempts to understand the patient’s concern with their aging. The distraction of focusing on the possible senility of the old analyst affords the patient defensive opportunities, or hides the patient’s insecurity about his or her own mental functioning and intelligence, or is a manifestation of negative transference, or is a psychic maneuver to avoid being caught by shocked surprise at the analyst’s sudden demise. But it could also represent a patient’s realistic perception that the analyst is actually slipping!</p>
<p>Another difficulty faced by patients of elderly analysts involves the issue of sleep. As is now well known, the aging process brings a dearth of stage four sleep, which is often made up for by dozing during the day and accounts for the stereotyped picture of grandpa sleeping in his rocking chair by the fire. That would not be so bad if grandpa, the psychoanalyst, would not also fall asleep during sessions. There are of course situations in which analysts, some of them not so old, fall asleep during sessions, even when the patient is sitting up and facing them. The countertransference aspects of boredom or falling asleep during a session can be explored by self-analysis or consultation, but for the aging analyst falling asleep poses a special problem because the tendency to doze off is even greater, especially when the patient is silent for long periods or clearly producing a lot of resisting and superficial material. Because of the aging process and perhaps due to the increased narcissism that Eissler postulates, the aged analyst is less tolerant when the patient is producing defensive and resistive material or long silences and may in fact retaliate by sleeping.</p>
<p>When the analyst falls asleep during a session, it is always countertransference-driven, but the elderly analyst is more susceptible to it. Nevertheless, it is always at some level countertransference floundering, and not simply due to the aging process. There is no good solution to this problem, though when it occurs elderly analysts may want to review the medications they are taking to identify any that have sleepiness or sedation as a side effect. If there are certain patients who routinely induce sleep in the analyst, it is not a problem of aging but an internal resistance and the expression of a chronic countertransference structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0003065112474842">Tower 1956</xref>). Sometimes falling asleep is due to a particular patient’s challenge to the aging analyst’s increased narcissistic and autocratic demands. The effect on the patient from the elderly analyst’s falling asleep is extremely variable. Sleeping can be a defensive regressive maneuver for either analyst or patient, or it can be an act of passive aggression; usually it is both. Some patients just politely and quietly leave the sleeping analyst when or even before their session is over, and subsequently the therapeutic alliance may be profoundly damaged. Still others fly into a narcissistic rage, and so on.</p>
<p>There are times the patient wants the analyst to fall asleep and welcomes it, and so rambles on and on even knowing that the analyst is sleeping! For example, Mr. X. was in analysis for two years with an older analyst who scheduled the patient’s sessions just after lunchtime. It was not long before Mr. X. noticed that the analyst was sleeping during sessions. He made no mention of it and simply rambled on with “free associations” until the time was up. Nothing was ever said about it, and finally Mr. X. decided to change analysts due to lack of progress. Here the patient’s apparent “tolerance” of the analyst’s after-lunch nap disguised a major defensive maneuver.</p>
<p>Another problem in the psychoanalytic process arises with patients who are focused on and waiting for the elderly analyst’s anticipated demise. There are several types of patients who, as their analysis proceeds, seem to become more and more intensely aware of the analyst’s age. Some talk about it and some do not, so sometimes it must be inferred from the material. For example, as the years passed, Ms. B. remained aloof throughout her sessions because she clearly and overtly was increasingly concerned with my possible demise. She reported that she did not want to be so emotionally involved with me that she would suffer greatly when it happened. This was a patient whose beloved father had unexpectedly died in late middle age of an ominous, disfiguring, and rapidly developing cancer. His death caused such a shock for her that it threw her into an almost suicidal disorder from which she was barely rescued by a long psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Her transference put me in the position of a father figure, but she was unable to get sufficiently involved to develop the emotional aspects of the transference because she was so frightened of what would happen if I suddenly got sick from cancer or some other disease and died. She expressed the transference indirectly by considering me in a sense part of her family and experiencing me as someone without whom she could not function, but the emotions she expressed toward me were akin to those one would feel for a good computer or a reliable automobile. She was constantly trying to ignore her deep attachment, yet she claimed I was the only person to whom she could turn with her problems, all of which were defensively practical ones because this patient suffered from alexithymia. This led to a plateau in the analytic process, with neither progress nor deterioration, but the patient was able to function well as long as matters of the heart did not come up. The suicidal fantasies disappeared spontaneously and did not reappear as her apparently affectless relationship with me developed into a kind of friendly partnership or twinship transference. But that was as far as she could go, at least with me.</p>
<p>This problem can become very complex and dramatic. Another patient, Ms. C., came in one day and talked about trivial day-to-day events for most of her session. I was largely silent because I intuitively felt she was trying to avoid some strong feelings. Finally she said, “I remember the fragment of a dream. In it I had an injured foot, and doctors were giving me morphine for the pain, and I was afraid of becoming addicted to it.” She then spontaneously burst out crying and sobbing dramatically, worrying about what would happen to her if I got sick or died or retired. Of course all this is overdetermined, must be carefully explored, and can be understood in a variety of ways, but one might wish to consider the element of truth in it and the realistic aspect of the patient’s concern.</p>
<p>A common way of dealing with the possible demise of elderly analysts is manifested by passive-aggressive patients who wait passively throughout years of treatment producing superficial and repetitive material because they are incapable of facing frightening emotions. These patients want to believe they have been “analyzed” but take a passive defensive stance by overtly agreeing with everything and challenging nothing. For example, Mr. D. was obviously waiting me out rather than leaving treatment. He was too passive to quit, but it was quite clear he was gambling on what he considered to be my imminent demise to bring an end to his treatment. Mr. D. overtly admitted and expressed by his behavior that, though he agreed with some of my interpretations and “enjoyed” the analytic sessions, the minute he left my office he immediately reverted to his passivity and inability to express anger. Previously Mr. D. had avoided conflict with his strict and autocratic aging parents by being good and waiting for them to die. Currently, he was successfully repeating that pattern on his job, waiting through the promotion, firing, retirement, or death of his elderly superiors to rise to higher positions. This character armor had been so successful for him that it seemed impervious to interpretations; indeed, it took years of analytic work to reveal the profound fear of annihilation that it concealed.</p>
<p>Both Ms. C. and Mr. D. repeatedly insisted they did not want to begin treatment with another analyst, though we discussed this more than once as an option to their concerns about my age. They claimed I was indispensable to them. In both cases there was a clear danger of stalemate in the treatment as they reenacted their characteristic patterns of interpersonal relations. The psychoanalytic process itself became a source of support that they could not find elsewhere and could not function without. Only my demise could end the treatment. Repeated interpretations regarding evading analysis by focusing on the dependency gratifications and the pleasure in having someone who is interested in them were accepted, but no change occurred because the transference need for an anaclitic relationship was so overwhelming (or for other transference-countertransference reasons).</p>
<p>Such patients are found more frequently than most analysts are willing to admit. Often they have no one else to turn to and lack the interpersonal strategies to find someone else. Offers to refer the patient to another analyst are usually rejected. The worst transference-countertransference enactment in this kind of situation is when an aging analyst keeps such a patient coming five times a week indefinitely for “analysis.” This can continue over a great many years and with the patient’s full compliance. Reports of such treatments abound, and numerous “jokes” about them have damaged the reputation of psychoanalysis. The implication is that the patient is willingly being enveloped in the narcissistic problems described by Eissler, or even in the financial or other problems of the aging analyst.</p>
<p>There is yet another way that patients may deal with their concern about the demise of their elderly analyst. Such patients manage to quit treatment before the analyst dies and leaves them. For example, Ms. E. had been in analysis for a long time. We were both growing old, though she had a great need to deny her own aging process with its inevitable infirmities and bodily changes. She was proud of what she considered to be her youthful energy, which she proudly contrasted to the slower pace of her friends. It was a rare session when she did not make some pejorative comment about how old and possibly senile I was getting. Ms. E. was frequently concerned with her eventual death and mine, and also the incipient development of dementia in either of us. All this concern oddly helped maintain her denial of her own aging process: it implied that nothing had happened yet, at least to her. One day she suddenly and unexpectedly announced that she would rather attend an interesting non-credit university course that was scheduled at the same time as her analytic hours. This would require a six-week break from the analysis. From studying the patient’s associations and the ambience in which this came up, it was clear to me that she was unconsciously cutting off the relationship with me before it would be ended by my demise.</p>
<p>Certain patients are too embarrassed to discuss their concern with the analyst’s aging and potential for death. Instead they will either make jokes about it or actually search for any evidence that the analyst is developing senile dementia, which, of course, they always claim “light-heartedly” to find, often followed by a “polite” apology (“just kidding”). Ms. E. dealt with the problem by proposing an enactment in which she would see what it was like to be separated from me for a substantial period, during which she could maintain her denial of her own aging. This had become harder and harder for her to do as together we grew older and older, for she could not avoid seeing the aging process manifesting itself in me.</p>
<p>Some patients simply block out the obvious fact that the analyst is elderly. Ms. F. insisted throughout her treatment, during which both her mother and her father passed away, that she had no particular feelings for me at all. For her, the analysis was more or less an intellectual exercise. Then I had to suddenly interrupt my practice to undergo cardiac surgery. During a month or so while I was absent, the shocked Ms. F. broke down emotionally, experiencing an enormous sense of depression and loss. After I recovered and returned to the office, all this settled down, and in a year or so she was back to insisting that she had no feelings for me; nor did she show any interest in my age or health. According to her, I was merely a technician, a “mental health provider.”</p>
<p>Another form of blocking out the implications of the analyst’s aging occurred with Ms. G., who simply treated me as if I were one of her contemporaries. She was about the age of one of my daughters but imagined herself involved in a romance with me in the erotic transference, as if I were thirty years younger. Paradoxically, this patient developed an intense erotic transference, unlike patients of the elderly analysts described in the literature. Ms. G. was a hypochondriac who was constantly anticipating medical catastrophes happening to her, but she never referred to any catastrophe possibly happening to me. She produced declarations of love and erotic fantasies involving me as if I were much closer to her age. Part of this was a response to the fact that I was the only person in the world who really was interested in her, though I was not aware of any erotic countertransference. Her husband was an obsessive-compulsive professional who was totally immersed in his work. Her children were away at college. Basically, this lonely woman was able to proceed in treatment by simply ignoring my obviously elderly appearance. She was intelligent, developed an intense classical transference, and was insightful, cooperative, and motivated to succeed with her psychoanalysis. But underneath all that she gave many hints in her dreams and associations that pointed to her having the potential for really collapsing were I to suddenly disappear. It became clear that the classical transference in this “good patient” was a defense against profound abandonment fears. The child of a harsh father and an absent preoccupied mother, she recalled in therapy their strict fundamentalist religious preoccupation with death and damnation.</p>
<p>Not all patients who develop an erotic transference to an elderly analyst are so disturbed. In the case of Ms. G., I had to ask myself whether this intense erotic transference occurred because the patient, for some psychodynamic reason, had a need to make love with a much older man, perhaps like her father. Here would be the oedipus complex right on the surface at the very beginning of the treatment. But where were the defenses? What was the state of the ego? I believe such “good patients” often have serious pathology hidden deep in their psyche. The oedipus complex may have been a factor, but the general transference was like that of a middle-aged woman dying to have a passionate romance with a man her age. All this may or may not have been a defense against genuine unbearable preoedipal longings and fear of abandonment involving me in the transference. But the bizarreness of the contrast with the real situation was perhaps an important reason why she did not stir up any erotic countertransference, as well might have happened with an analyst thirty years younger. It could be thought of as an ominous sign of the patient’s primitive or borderline ego functioning.</p>
<p>Patients who have already endured the death of a previous analyst pose a serious problem. For example, Ms. H. went for many years to an analyst who died unexpectedly in the midst of her analysis. A handsome, tall, physically fit middle-aged man, he had always claimed to be in perfect health, and then, suddenly, he died of acute liver failure. At times during her analysis she claimed she smelled alcohol on his breath, which he always denied and tried to analyze as her problem. Ms. H., a very sensitive and perceptive narcissistic patient, entered her second analysis in an extremely untrusting state and watched me intently for any sign of deterioration, whether in my dress, my speech, my memory, or anything else. She was preoccupied with my age and health and became quite upset when she discovered that I needed a hearing aid. This of course was in the nature of a hostile defensive attack covered over with politeness and humor, but she had an uncanny ability to make me self-conscious, so exquisitely alert was she to my slightest peccadilloes. When I wore a dark suit, she was sure I was going to a funeral. Although Ms. H. complained a great deal about her life and hard times and the loss of her analyst, the truth was that she was not capable of forming a really intense or intimate relationship with anybody on a conscious level. She went through a series of men in her love life but seemed more at home with women her age who were either widows or had husbands in nursing homes.</p>
<p>As she eventually became quite dependent on the relationship with me, her erotic transference was expressed in ways that were evasively joking; for example, she once asked, “Can you still get it up? Oh, I don’t want to know, don’t tell me.” My attempts to analyze the meaning of these expressions were met with a hasty change of subject and denial. She had had many years of an apparently intense “analysis” with the first analyst, which I felt she used for her dependency needs; it seemed to have been a pseudo-analysis from which she emerged with little insight. The first analyst made many attempts to interpret her underlying rage and fear of abandonment. Finally he gave up and told her she would have to be “in analysis for life,” which Ms. H. was happy to hear. I chose instead to focus on her ability to become independent and to try to analyze what was interfering with that ability. I believed she was not so sick as to need a lifetime of so-called analysis, as some of her friends were experiencing and as she was consciously embarked on with the first analyst, but she was very attracted to the idea of a lifetime of support in that manner. Ms. H. was eventually able to get what she needed from outside sources, but always continued to carefully scrutinize me physically and psychologically every session for any signs of my impending demise. This gave her an excuse to keep a certain distance and avoid consciously feeling intense emotional intimacy with me. In this case intense intimacy was present but not permitted to emerge. I did not by interpretation encourage it to do so, as I felt it would overwhelm her and attach her to me for life, which is what I thought the first analyst had done. Instead I concentrated on uncovering the unconscious hostility that her characteristic interpersonal approach expressed in many ways, because I felt this was central to her difficulty in forming relationships. If I tried deeper interpretations she would simply get bogged down in intellectualizations or quickly change the subject. Eventually she found a steady relationship with an elderly widower that, despite its having many problems and producing many complaints, became her first stable relationship with a man.</p>
<p>Many problems interfere with the work of the aging psychoanalyst and indirectly affect the patient. These can immensely complicate the psychoanalytic process. One of the most serious complications occurs when certain patients, in response to the aging analyst’s subtly or not so subtly communicated needs, combine their transference wishes and compulsion to repeat by engaging in various mutual enactments. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065112474842">Cath (1966)</xref> uses the term “depletion” to cover a state beyond depression, one of exhaustion or emptiness, to “convey the depths of the feeling and the dynamics of the alterations” (p. 335) in the aging person’s total world. There follows, he says, the breakdown of ego defenses and the defusion of instincts. Superego activity is diminished, and outbursts of aggression are clinically observable, as well as “inappropriate exhibitionist activity with a disappearance of appropriate shyness or self-consciousness that might be expected of the elderly” (p. 337), and a general disintegration and regression of ego functioning. As we have all seen with certain eminent elderly analysts, the depletion of aging in the presence of massive narcissistic denial has led them to engage in self-destructive acting out and to enter into pathological and mutually damaging relationships with patients. In this situation, as in less dramatic but more frequent situations, the analyst is taking advantage of transferences and unrealistic expectations stirred up in the patient by the analyst’s behavior and indirect and sometimes direct communications to the patient about the analyst’s need to repair depletion.</p>
<p>Communications and behavior like this from the analyst, more commonly in a less flagrant form, stem from the aging process itself and from what Cath called “depletion anxiety,” the growing awareness in the elderly analyst that psychosocial reserves are diminishing. As the aging analyst is drained out from a variety of unavoidable late-life situations, the temptation to boundary crossings may arise, and inevitably this is signaled to patients in a number of ways, either subtle or obvious.</p>
<p>This has a profound effect on the clinical material even if, in ordinary circumstances with a psychologically healthy analyst, nothing happens, and also may result in increased offers and even in importunate pressure from patients for boundary crossings. Many patients for a variety of psychodynamic reasons are all too willing to participate in one way or another, especially as they sense the growing vulnerability of the analyst.</p>
<p>Here is perhaps the pièce de résistance of this clinical problem. Probably the most difficult countertransference issues arise when an elderly patient who has been in analysis for some years with an elderly analyst develops a serious malignancy. For months and months the patient undergoes all kinds of protocols and procedures in an effort to at least stem the tide of death, but these produce only disappointment after disappointment. The patient begins to lose hope, despite the fact that the psychoanalytic therapy must now of necessity take on a more supportive character; one does not play chess on the deck of the sinking <italic>Titanic</italic>.</p>
<p>What goes through the mind of the elderly analyst who is reminded session after session with this dying patient that he or she also faces inevitable death in the not too distant future? Most analysts do not sit and think about this and are not depressed at the prospect on a daily basis, but the impact is so frequent and strong from this three- or four-times-weekly exposure to the patient’s tragic situation and deep struggle to remain alive, or even his or her eventual pathetic acceptance of death, that a painful and disruptive countertransference may develop, consciously or unconsciously. Manifestations of this countertransference can work to the serious detriment of the patient, the patient’s family, the analyst, or even the analyst’s family, all of whom may be drawn into the situation in one way or another.</p>
<p>For example, the analyst who gets depressed or becomes hysterical trying to rescue the patient is presenting gross empathic failure and makes everything worse. Boundary crossing and all sorts of inappropriate behavior by the analyst may take place, including dramatically drawing the patient directly into the analyst’s family. The emotionally healthier patient may decide to stop coming under these circumstances, even though he or she is much in need of mature supportive help. Weird attempts to rescue the patient may be enacted by, for example, interfering with the oncologist and trying to second-guess chemotherapy protocol procedures, even though the analyst is not board certified in oncology. Or the analyst may invite the patient to join in denial and attempt to make light of the problem and assure the patient that he or she will be all right, a common defense used by the patient’s friends and relatives. This will produce either great rage in the patient at the analyst’s empathic failure or compliance to join the analyst in a quasi-psychotic enactment that is bound to collapse sooner or later.</p>
<p>Because the role of the analyst is to catalyze the patient’s ego functioning, not to dominate it in a countertransference-based heroic rescue attempt, dealing with the dying patient is the most rigorous test of the elderly analyst’s self-analysis and maturity. And this test occurs unfortunately at a time when analysts themselves are physically and psychologically weaker due to the aging process and may apprehend or need to deny a closeness to their own demise. Such heroics completely destroy the analysis and, if the patient eventually recovers health, makes it impossible to continue as before; at the same time, the patient may be left feeling so guilty about the heroic efforts the analyst has made that leaving the analysis is also impossible.</p>
<p>To conclude, let us focus on an unresolved ethical issue in this area that will require further discussion and a resolution of some sort. Surely when analysts are diagnosed with a disease from which they are unlikely to recover, they have a responsibility to prepare their patients the best they can. But what information should relatively healthy but elderly analysts give to their patients to provide for the analyst’s possible incapacity or death? Returning to Eissler’s concern about the demise of the elderly analyst, and his controversial suggestion that the patient be given a list of therapists to contact in that event, consider the following example of what may happen. In a way this case constitutes an actualization of the deepest fears experienced by patients of elderly analysts. Mr. I.’s analyst, after several years of an apparently successful analytic process with Mr. I., left on his usual vacation and simply never returned. No explanation was offered; no message of any kind was given to his patients. Finally, the analyst’s wife told Mr. I., in response to repeated anxious phone calls, that her seventy-four-year-old husband had been suffering in recent years from a chronic cancer and that he was well aware that his demise was not far off. On the vacation he suffered a severe exacerbation of his cancer, which caused him to be bedridden. He went rapidly downhill afterward and died. His abrupt disappearance had been neither rudeness nor lack of consideration; he had suddenly become acutely sick and lay dying in the hospital.</p>
<p>But he was a physician and was aware that underneath it all he was seriously ill and in danger of a sudden demise. Yet he had made no attempt to notify the patients in his very busy full-time psychoanalytic practice about what he knew was going to happen in the foreseeable future. During the analysis Mr. I sensed that something was wrong but could not ascertain what was going on; when he attempted to discuss it, the analyst attributed it to transference. Mr. I. never got over his shock and surprise, which he experienced, perhaps in the transference, perhaps not, as a deception for the purpose of accumulating as much money as possible up to the end. Trust in further analysis became a central issue with the next analyst. Surprises of this kind are more and more likely to occur as the psychoanalyst ages, and patients know this and fear it, consciously or unconsciously, which affects their verbal and nonverbal communications.</p>
<p>In summary, what is suggested here is that the ambience presented by aging analysts may offer a possible explanation for certain patient transferences, thoughts, expectations, and behavior in the psychoanalytic process. How much of an explanation it is may at times be hard to assess from patient to patient. The reality of the elderly analyst’s ambience, created by the analyst’s appearance and general behavior, as well as the ambience of the analyst’s office and the details of the analyst’s professional practice, always forms a background to the psychoanalytic process and creates a situation that unavoidably is quite different from that with younger analysts.</p>
