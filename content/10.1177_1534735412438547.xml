<p>Integrative oncology received public notice by the highest levels of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) during the recent Eighth International Conference of the Society of Integrative Oncology. Dr Francis Collins, Director of the NIH, was a keynote speaker for the conference, which was held in Cleveland, Ohio in mid-November. I had the pleasure of acting as the Chair of the Scientific Program Committee for the Conference and am pleased to report that integrative oncology received not only attention from the NIH but also significant media and Internet coverage, including several articles in Medscape Medical Oncology News, as well as the ASCO Post.</p>
<p>Collins spoke on the topic of “Seeking Out the Most Effective Interventions for Cancer Prevention and Treatment,” and highlighted the varied activities of the NIH in supporting research related to integrative oncology. Among the topics he discussed were the discovery of new anticancer drugs from plants and animals, the latter including Halaven, a new breast cancer drug derived from a marine sponge; and the Human Microbiome Project, which seeks to explore the intriguing world of our intestinal bacterial flora. The Cancer Genome Atlas, which is cataloguing the genetic abnormalities associated with each major cancer type, was also highlighted in his talk. Large projects of this sort are, of course, a specialty of Dr Collins, who was head of the Human Genome Project before he moved to the Director’s post at NIH. Collins emphasized in particular the potential for comparative effectiveness research in the area of integrative oncology, which aligns with the interests of the new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. We hope that NIH funding continues to support efforts in integrative oncology research in spite of its recent budget cuts, and that this funding grows as the value to patients and the financial savings that integrative treatment provides becomes more well known.</p>
<p>The first article of this issue, and of our new Volume 11, is an innovative analysis of the concept of the complexity of cancer and patient biology. Brian Lawenda and colleagues propose a systems model of integrative oncology, with the goal of eventually predicting outcomes of intervention. Although the model is still a long way from practical use, readers should examine it for the insights about the multitude of processes in the body and mind that affect cancer outcomes. It is my opinion and belief that this comprehensive modeling of malignant disease and integrative treatment provides a more authentic foundation to the biology of cancer and will in time lead to considerable improvement in patient care.</p>
<p>Antiemetics are of major importance in treating the nausea and vomiting associated with many chemotherapy drugs. Many readers are likely aware of the recent developments in using ginger as an antiemetic, but Manjeshwar Baliga and colleagues point out that there are several other plant antiemetics still in preclinical development in their review of the literature in this area.</p>
<p>Shuenn-Tsong Young and colleagues at National Ming-Yang University in Taiwan share the results of a pilot study on music therapy for chemotherapy patients. The most intriguing aspect of this study is its use of heart rate variability, an index of autonomic nervous system function, as the main outcome variable.</p>
<p><italic>Agaricus blazei</italic> is a Brazilian mushroom that is widely used as a dietary supplement for a variety of conditions. Like many mushrooms, it has been ascribed immunostimulant activity, which has been documented in a randomized trial of gynecological cancer patients. Professor Jing-Gung Chung and colleagues document immunomodulatory activity in leukemia, in their study of a mouse leukemia model that begins the laboratory studies section of this issue.</p>
<p>Jian-Hua Lin and colleagues examined the effects of a Chinese herbal formula, Qingyihuaji Formula, on human pancreatic cancers implanted in nude mice. They report that the formula decreased formation of liver metastases; they also explore the effects of the formula on a variety of molecular markers in their article.</p>
<p>Nomilin is a phytochemical in citrus fruits. Girija Kuttan and colleagues at Amala Cancer Research Institute report its effects on a highly metastatic melanoma cell line implanted in mice. This natural product affects a surprisingly large number of anti-apoptotic and anti-invasive pathways, and should certainly be considered for further research.</p>
<p>Quercetin is another multifaceted anticancer phytochemical. It plays a role in the article by Xiaobo Cui on the inhibition of heat shock proteins in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Nasopharyngeal cancer is treated in part with hyperthermia, used as a radiosensitizer. A problem in hyperthermia is the upregulation of heat shock proteins on exposure to high temperatures. These proteins protect cancer cells from the effects of hyperthermia. Quercetin inhibits one of the major heat shock proteins while geldanamycin inhibits another, and in this article, the co-inhibition of both proteins is investigated.</p>
<p>The majestic walnut tree is the source of yet another phytochemical, juglone. Juglone is responsible for the allelopathic effects of walnut, in which the growth of plants underneath the canopy of walnut trees is inhibited. Juglone also inhibits the growth of cancer cells, and Satish Rao and colleagues from Manipal Life Sciences Centre examine in their article whether it may also act as a radiosensitizer.</p>
<p>As we begin a new year of publication for <italic>Integrative Cancer Therapies</italic>, we wish all of you a productive and gratifying period in your research and clinical work!</p>
