<p>His Excellency, the Honourable Peter Underwood, Governor of Tasmania, President of the College, Fellows and Members, Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I became a psychiatrist 50 years ago this month, that is, I received the Diploma of Psychological Medicine from the University of Melbourne. It has been a very interesting 50 years.</p>
<p>I chose psychiatry because I was fascinated by patients’ stories and because I thought that the biochemistry of schizophrenia was about to be discovered, given that there was an article describing the onset of hallucinations and delusions from using denatured adrenalin for asthma that seemed to point to the biology of the disorder.</p>
<p>In the next 15 minutes, I will cover four topics: the importance of leadership, the scope of psychiatry, our work with the neuroses, and the importance of the clinician’s illusion.</p>
<sec id="section1-1039856212475330">
<title>The importance of leadership</title>
<p>I began as a first year trainee in Ballarat in 1959. It was an excellent service, part of Cunningham Dax’s reform of Victorian services. It had a mental hospital that was being downsized. There were group homes in the community, a reception house in the town, a hospital for neurosis by the lake, and outpatient clinics in the local country towns. It was there that I learned that good leadership was critical. The late Dr Nick Roberts met with all registrars at noon each day and reviewed all new and problematic patients. The late Dr John Lindsay, who ran the neurosis service along therapeutic community lines, taught us to think about what patients were really telling us, their back story as it were.</p>
<p>Royal Park with Dr John Cade was my next posting. Leadership there was never in doubt: I learnt that good doctoring is courteous and professional patient care, and application of research knowledge. I then moved to the UK to do an MD with Professor Martin Roth. I came back to an academic post at the University of New South Wales with Professor Leslie Kiloh, another great leader. I have remained with UNSW, and the School of Psychiatry, now under the leadership of Professor Phillip Mitchell, is the leading School of Psychiatry in the Southern Hemisphere. I think that good leaders enable those under them to flourish; poor leaders do not.</p>

<title>The scope of psychiatry</title>
<p>In 1980 I had a seminal year at Stanford on study leave. I went to write a scale to measure coping based on ego defences, and failed, but I did learn about meta-analysis. When I came back, we used meta-analysis, the views of a sample of College members and expert opinions to conduct the College Quality Assurance Project and write treatment outlines for 20 mental disorders. This was the first attempt by any medical profession anywhere in the world to lay down the evidence for professional practice – the College should be very proud of itself for initiating and sustaining this project.</p>
<p>In 1991 the World Health Organization drew on the work of the College’s Quality Assurance Project and recruited me to assist with a project on an Evaluation of Methods for the Treatment of Mental Disorders, their first foray into setting criteria for treatments. This led to me chairing the Composite International Diagnostic Interview committee that produced a structured diagnostic interview that has been the basis of psychiatric epidemiology ever since, and used in the 1997 and 2007 National Mental Health Surveys.</p>
<p>I don’t think that people should still use the term ‘mental disorders’ (and certainly not mental health disorders) to describe our field. Psychiatry is a big field and perhaps, like the physicians, it is time for us to be identified by our speciality. I think that it is useful to think of a five cluster structure for psychiatry: neurocognitive, neurodevelopmental, psychotic, internalising and externalising disorders. These are clusters in which the aetiology/neuropathology, the patterns of comorbidity, treatments and even the practitioners and services who deal with each cluster are different. As a contribution to DSM-5 and ICD-11, we produced seven invited reviews of this five cluster meta-structure for <italic>Psychological Medicine</italic>. I think it helps clinicians, carers, patients and the media to use this meta-structure to understand the scope of psychiatry.</p>

<title>The neuroses</title>
<p>Since my time with John Lindsay in Ballarat, my interest has been in the neuroses, an old name for the internalising disorder cluster. For 40 years we have run a public hospital clinic in Sydney for the anxiety and depressive disorders, firstly using group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and now mostly treating people over the internet with internet CBT. We have completed randomised controlled trials of the internet courses for people with major depression, mixed anxiety and depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. People like the internet treatment and they do well. The results in the research trials continue to take us by surprise: number needed to treat (NNT)=2 at six months, adherence is 60–80%, and satisfaction is &gt; 80%. In the Anxiety Disorders Clinic at St Vincent’s we treat 1000 people a year and 19 out of 20 prefer to use the internet rather than coming to the clinic for face-to-face treatment. We have made it available for psychiatrists and primary care clinicians to use at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thiswayup.org.au/clinic">www.thiswayup.org.au/clinic</ext-link>, and some 2000 are prescribing the internet system to their patients. Results are very similar to those of the research trials: NNT=2, adherence is 55–60%, suicide ideation is cut in half, and workforce participation is doubled, all by learning from a computer how to control one’s emotions, thoughts and behaviours. The 5000<sup>th</sup> patient has registered to use the system. It is an important aid to specialist practice: a busy country psychiatrist said gratefully, ‘It’s like having an intern in the practice to do the straightforward stuff’. It is not what any of us were trained to believe was possible, but I think that this is the future – internet treatment of uncomplicated cases that frees up skilled clinician time to take care of the ‘difficult to get better’ patients. I encourage you to register at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thiswayup.org.au/clinic">www.thiswayup.org.au/clinic</ext-link>, and use it with your patients.</p>

<title>The clinician’s illusion</title>
<p>As I get older, patients see and hear me in the media and write and say thank you for their treatment years ago. And this is probably the take-home message from my talk. Psychiatrists often feel they are not effective. There have recently been papers to say that the benefits from psychotropic medications are comparable to benefits from medications for physical conditions, yet we often feel they are not. We have, in addition, a range of psychotherapies to enable us to cure our patients – CBT, dialectical behaviour therapy and dynamic psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Yet, we often look into the waiting room and, seeing only the ‘difficult to get better’ patients, wrongly assume that we are not very effective and worry that we have not done enough. This is the clinician’s illusion – it is due to the ‘easy to get better’ people recovering and not being in the waiting room. Every time I have done an outcome assessment on a cohort of patients, I am surprised at how well patients are doing. And now that sufficient time has elapsed for them to be certain, patients are spontaneously saying ‘thank you’. We should think differently about the value of our work. In order to value ourselves, we need to know how useful we are. To know how useful we are, we need to measure outcome as a routine. Outcome assessment is what chairing the College Quality Assurance Project long ago taught me was important. Perhaps internet therapy looks so good simply because outcome is routinely measured.</p>
<p>Thank you my College, the deservedly Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, for inviting me to make this address. I am honoured.</p>
