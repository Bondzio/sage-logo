<abstract>
<p>In Someone Has to Fail, Labaree (2010) offers an admirably concise overview of the history and promise of education reform in the United States, combining insights from the history of education, policy studies, and a refreshingly accurate and nuanced account of what it is like to actually manage a classroom environment. While in this essay we shall raise some substantive questions about some of Labaree’s analysis, it is to his credit that we wish to take his work so seriously. Someone Has to Fail offers a reinterpretation of the complexities of education reform, one that is full of useful counterpoints to many of the most common claims made by today’s business-minded reformers. Thus, the work is well worth reading. However, we still wish that Labaree had more deeply explored the contexts within which his education “consumers” were making their system-shaping decisions. Such an effort would have offered a more compellingly critical assessment of the importance of curriculum and the struggles over knowledge and culture. It would have brought the experiences and movements of the marginalized closer to the center of its account. And in the process, it might have engendered a somewhat less gloomy perspective regarding the roles that schools might still play in efforts to create a more just society.</p>

<title>Failing Reforms</title>
<p>In 2014, when the education reforms mandated by No Child Left Behind have finally had their chance to work and all children are proficient in reading and math, a whole host of social problems will have been solved. Poverty? Check. Unemployment? Check. Crime? Check. And, by embracing charter schools, restricting or abolishing teacher tenure, improving value-added assessments, expanding school choice options, privatizing supplemental educational services, and hiring no-nonsense administrators with experience in the real world of business, school systems will have the tools necessary to sustain their students’ newly attained high levels of achievement. At last, the ideal of equal educational opportunity will be a reality, and global economic competitiveness will be restored as human capital production in schools is brought into precise alignment with the needs of business and industry.</p>
<p>Enough common sense is embedded in the story above to make it seem reasonable, even attractive to some people. All students deserve good teachers. No student should be burdened by poor educational opportunities. Schools should not waste money. Schools should continually seek more effective ways to educate students. Graduates should expect to have acquired useful knowledge and skills in school. Underachieving schools should be encouraged to improve. We agree with all of these sentiments. However, like David Labaree, we have our doubts that modern education reformers will be able to accomplish either their educational or their larger social aims. In fact, for reasons we will touch on below, education reforms like those listed above have made it <italic>less</italic> likely that schools will accomplish their designated social aims (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811425909">Apple, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904811425909">Lipman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0895904811425909">Ravitch, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Someone Has to Fail</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904811425909">Labaree (2010)</xref> offers an admirably concise overview of the history and promise of education reform in the United States, combining insights from the history of education, policy studies, and a refreshingly accurate and nuanced account of what it is like to actually manage a classroom environment. While in this essay we shall raise some substantive questions about some of Labaree’s analysis, it is to his credit that we wish to take his work so seriously.</p>
<p>Of Labaree’s arguments, two emerge as the most central. The first is that the dominant force shaping the form and character of educational systems and their policies and practices has been the self-motivated individual, that is, the education “consumer,” who uses schooling as a means to acquire credentials in a competition to maintain or advance her or his socioeconomic status. This undercurrent of self-interest, combined with teachers’ need to maintain irreducibly complex classroom ecologies, Labaree argues, has rendered the core of schooling—what actually happens in the classroom—largely impervious to reform efforts. Unsuccessful reform attempts, then, are not necessarily the result of some insidious public school monopoly or overly burdensome red tape, but of the built-in protections of a system designed for and by its participants.</p>
<p>The second, related thesis is that the society’s core aims for schooling—democratic equality, social efficiency, and social mobility—are contradictory, preventing systems from accomplishing fully any of their social goals. While “consumers” have pushed school systems to create credentialing systems that effectively undermine democratic equality, the rhetorical and perhaps moral weight of democratic equality keeps it at the center of education debates. In other words, although we cherish the rhetoric, we as a society are willing to shrug away a bit of democratic equality as long as our schools are functioning effectively as credentialing institutions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0895904811425909">
<title>Repoliticizing Reforms</title>
<p>In foregrounding the inertia of the public school system, Labaree justifiably emphasizes the credentialing process he explores in this and earlier work (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0895904811425909">Labaree, 1997</xref>). In doing so, he offers readers a useful rebuttal to those who would make direct links between schooling, social mobility, and economic productivity. Moreover, in highlighting the unusual successes of the common school movement, Labaree rightly emphasizes the important role that schools have played in offering the citizenry shared, socializing experiences. However, as he ties his arguments together throughout the book, Labaree often has a tendency to depoliticize the contexts within which his “consumers” make their “choices,” coming close at times to portraying today’s education system as a natural, almost determined unfolding of an initial decision nearly 200 years ago to commit to schools and equal opportunity rather than a European-style welfare system aimed at social equality. As a result, the storyline offers few suggestions or insights as to how to actually achieve social aims via education, short of “backing away from our commitment to liberal democracy, individualism, utilitarianism, and social optimism” (p. 244).</p>
<p>This is not to say that Labaree avoids politics. For example, in perhaps the books’s most powerful passage, Labaree states the following about the ways that society (ineffectively) uses schools to meet social aims:
<disp-quote><p>Educationalizing society integrates social life around a set of common experiences, processes, and curricular languages. It gives stability and legitimacy to a social structure of inequality that otherwise might lead to open conflict. It gives stability and legitimacy to government by providing an institution that can be assigned hard problems and that can be blamed when it fails to solve them. It provides orderly and credible processes by which people can live their lives, giving employers grounds for selecting a workforce, workers a way to pursue jobs, and families a way to pass on privilege and seek social opportunity, even if the rationales for these processes (human capital, individual merit) are not very credible. Most of all, it gives us a way to express serious concern about social problems without actually doing anything effective to solve these problems. In this sense, the ability of schools to formalize substance—to turn anything important into a school subject or school program or school credential—is at the heart of their success in educationalizing society. (p. 247)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From this passage, one can get a sense of the impressive scope and clarity of Labaree’s work. Unfortunately, despite stating that society’s faith in schools stabilizes a “social structure of inequality,” Labaree chooses not to employ a nuanced-enough theoretical frame capable of explaining how this has happened. After reading the story, we understand that education “consumers” have driven educational institutions to become credential factories. But what deeper processes are at work shaping people’s common sense in ways that conform to the logics of inequality-sustaining credentialing systems? Such an understanding, we believe, is crucial, if we are to move beyond well-reasoned pessimism and work to weaken dominant groups’ hegemonic power over schooling. This requires a greater focus on issues of curriculum, and on the power of social movements among marginalized groups, than Labaree offers.</p>
<p>For example, Labaree argues that the common schools grew out of the need to keep society from splintering along class lines as the result of the expansion of markets, the division of labor, the concentration of workers in certain sections of cities, and the increasing dependency of workers on wages. The common experience of schooling was designed to keep the citizenry united emotionally as the machinations of capitalism deepened economic and social divides. The form of the curriculum in these schools, Labaree argues, mattered little to early school reformers, as long as it was common among all students. However, we can be certain that what was <italic>not</italic> meant to be part of the curriculum were criticisms of capitalism and of large-scale stratification of wealth. Nor was the intensity of the racist and racializing structures of that society deemed worthy of interrogation in the knowledge selected to be “official.”</p>
<p>What is left understated in Labaree’s analysis is that curricula are always expressions of certain points of view, largely of those who have the power of selection. Hardly neutral, almost always the results of compromises and struggles, curricula can act as forms of control, creating the conditions for particular kinds of sense making among those who engage with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904811425909">Apple, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904811425909">2004</xref>). The fact that the common schools played a distinct role in making it more difficult for laboring masses to more fully understand their increasingly subordinate status is testament to the power of schooling. Indeed, this is one of the reasons that labor often turned to its own devices to counter what schools taught (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0895904811425909">Teitelbaum, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>This is not to say that dominant groups somehow tricked paid and unpaid workers into believing that schools were worth their investment. Enough good sense can be found in the desire to pursue an education and to engage in a common pursuit that participation and investment in the common schools is understandable. However, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0895904811425909">Gramsci (1971)</xref>, this good sense at the individual level was folded into a much broader educational scheme that contradicted the rhetorical artifice that was often used to justify schooling. As Labaree notes, unlike future education reforms, this earliest of school systems succeeded in some of its most important ideological aims, preventing outright rebellion and laying the foundation for much of what we would recognize as our modern school system. From the start, then, schools implemented a particular form of curriculum—one chosen by conflicts and compromises within and among elite groups and artificially assigned a sense of appropriateness—to quell what many school reformers felt might be an otherwise inevitable urge to rebel.</p>
<p>Following the large-scale expansion of high schools in the early 20th century, Labaree explains, nearly all of the components of the administrative structure of modern schools were in place. This included the use of standardized ability tests to assign students to particular curriculum tracks. No longer was the mission to preserve the republic. That had partly been accomplished by the common schools. Now, the purpose of schools was to efficiently sort the burgeoning masses into their appropriate positions in the social order. Predictably, of course, test outcomes most often reflected students’ social class. Regardless, although emerging from different tracks that offered much different rewards, because social mobility was becoming increasingly difficult especially without educational credentials, engaging in even the lowest track made much better sense for the working classes than refusing to participate. One <italic>had</italic> to have access to schools to have any hope to advance socially or economically. Unfortunately, the good sense in schooling reinforced hegemonic economic dynamics and relations, further dividing the masses of people and undermining democratic equality. It was less a choice that education “consumers” were making, then, than a necessity. The needs of capital were among the most powerful shapers of the system, not the genuine desires of “consumers.”</p>
<p>Over time, the practice of using standardized screening tests to assign students to different curriculum tracks helped to make ever-expanding bodies of technical knowledge largely inaccessible to the working class, concentrating power in the hands of economic and social elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904811425909">Apple, 1995</xref>). Lacking experience and comfort with abstractions associated with technical knowledge or having their ability to make their own abstractions either go unrecognized or appropriated by dominant groups (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0895904811425909">Noble, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0895904811425909">1984</xref>), members of lower classes schooled in vocational tracks were increasingly either unwilling or unable to participate in alienating and distant political dialogue divorced from the gritty materialities of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0895904811425909">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Thus, although the common school reformers approached curricula differently, both they and administrative progressives managed to assuage potentially volatile class relations by distracting attention from injustices inherent in the increasingly hierarchical social order. Via nonneutral selection of curricular content, powerful interests made it much more likely that the ways in which different groups thought about their options for socioeconomic advancement as well as their likelihood to engage fruitfully in politics were less powerful than they might otherwise have been.</p>
<p>Yes, education “consumers” have opted to participate in schools and seek credentials, but their decisions to do so have been constrained by an exceedingly narrow range of viable options. Thus, Labaree’s suggestion that schools shifted their emphasis from public to private aims because of “educational consumerism,” that is, the <italic>net</italic> effect of self-motivated individuals using schooling and its associated credentials to achieve social and economic gain, neglects to consider adequately the possibility that both overt and hidden relations of power inside and outside of schools were at work shaping the contexts within which people made their decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0895904811425909">Apple, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0895904811425909">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0895904811425909">Labaree, 2010</xref>, p. 81). Such an omission allows a better fit with Labaree’s consumer-driven thesis, but it truncates our understanding of the social complexities of decision-making processes and pulls attention away from the ways that powerful interests can create a new common sense that makes the assumptions that underpin the prevailing order seem legitimate. This makes finding ways to interrupt the business-minded, overly individualistic, and competitive thinking underlying many modern education reforms exceedingly difficult.</p>
<p>At one point, in summarizing his understanding of the relationship between community building and curriculum, Labaree states the following:
<disp-quote><p>[W]hen schools have been effective at community building, this had little to do with the content of the curriculum or the nature of classroom teaching. What was important was that schools provided a common socialization for all students. What they actually learned from school subjects was irrelevant as long as they were exposed to the same material. The core of learning was cultural rather than academic. The sheer irrelevance of the school curriculum is an important factor that helps explain why this curriculum has changed so little over the last two hundred years, while society was changing so dramatically. Even after fifty years of an all-out assault on the traditional curriculum by both branches of the progressive movement [administrative and child-centered], students were still spending the majority of their time on the core academic subjects of math, science, English, and history. It was the form of schooling more than its content that helped establish and preserve the American republic. (p. 165)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In an otherwise meticulous analysis, this statement is curious. It may be partly true that no entirely new branches of knowledge were created and incorporated into the curriculum in the past 200 years. But Labaree’s strongly worded assertion problematically minimizes the struggles over the form and content of the curriculum (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904811425909">Apple, 2000</xref>). One gets the impression from this part of Labaree’s work that education “consumers” rolled their eyes at well-intentioned progressives while willingly engaging in the same century-old curricula and mindlessly pursuing educational credentials. This is not the case. One need only compare early readers to today’s texts to note significant advances in the treatment of women and minoritized populations. Much work still needs to be done, but declaring curriculum as irrelevant to community building is an unwarranted assertion.</p>
<p>This is especially true as neoconservatives attempt to roll back progressive gains and create standardized curricula based on elitist and marginalizing notions of an imagined common culture. A good deal of recent work (see, for example, Apple, 1996, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0895904811425909">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811425909">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0895904811425909">Buras, 2008</xref>) powerfully explains how dominant groups work to define “common” culture in ways that promote their own interests and attenuate understandings of thicker forms of democracy. Far from irrelevant, inclusive and critical curricula are central to promoting democratic equality. Unless one understands community building as a process of cultural marginalization or assimilation, it is hard to subscribe to Labaree’s arguments here. Had Labaree paid considerably more attention to the history of racial struggles and the importance of the politics of representation and identity in forming these politics—and the role of the school as an arena in this process—he might have had more to say about this (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904811425909">Apple, Au, &amp; Gandin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0895904811425909">Leonardo, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0895904811425909">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to leading him to undervalue curriculum, Labaree’s decision to employ a somewhat undertheorized notion of consumer choice and deemphasize the role of struggles over knowledge in the formation of social movements also limits his evaluation of the most recent standards, accountability, and choice movements. For example, although he notes accurately that these movements are attempts to get schools to become more tightly coupled, allowing reformers to influence to a greater degree what teachers and students actually do in the classroom, Labaree is unable to account fully for ideological movements behind the recent wave of educational reforms. Labaree only explains that, like the common school and progressive movements of earlier periods of reform, modern education reforms can best be understood as responses to crisis, stating, “If necessity is the mother of invention, then crisis is the mother of reform” (p. 58).</p>
<p>Of course, in general, he is correct. There have been and currently are crises that have indeed led to periods of educational reform. However, by choosing to frame more current education reforms as the continuing expression of self-interested consumer will, rather than another example of capital and conservative social movements’ responses to increasing uncertainty, he elides some of the key elements of the crises in which education, like many other parts of society, is immersed.</p>
<p>Globalization and the expansion of markets, increasing wealth disparities, widespread unemployment, a housing crisis, a deep market recession, tax cuts, budget deficits, and so on, have again sent reformers back to their drawing boards to find ways to convince the public to accept particular understandings of the tenuous relationship between individual economic success and schooling. Unfortunately, although the ideas of choice and accountability may make perfectly good sense to well-intentioned reformers and to individual education “consumers,” as has occurred in the past, “choices” are being highly circumscribed by powerful interests. Today’s “common sense” surrounding school reform is making schools’ ability to meet social needs less likely than ever.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0895904811425909">
<title>Interrogating Consumer Choice</title>
<p>Just as importantly, the very concept of “consumer” needs itself to be critically examined. In many ways, it functions socially as part of a depoliticizing strategy. There is a world of difference between thinking of oneself as a consumer rather than as a member of, say, a union or a disenfranchised or oppressed collectivity. It is part of a process in which groups of people are turned into possessive individuals, a process in which people are declassed, deraced, and degendered. Although <italic>Someone Has to Fail</italic> does contain numerous insights into how issues of consumer interest have worked, at the same time it limits its own range of understanding by not going far enough into interrogating what this key concept itself does.</p>
<p>In <italic>Educating the “Right” Way</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811425909">Apple, 2006</xref>), one of us charts how a strategic alliance, what we might technically call a new hegemonic bloc, of neoconservatives, neoliberals, middle-class technocrats, and religious conservatives has created an at times tense but still effective alliance that has largely been successful in creating a new common sense and a set of specific educational policies and reforms. It has grounded its vision in reestablishing the primacy of human capital logics, promoting competition, and appealing to something that has less historical warrant than most people assume, the idea of a common culture. Markets, standards, audit cultures, “tradition,” and often “God” are sutured together in quite creative ways.</p>
<p>These tendencies may sound contradictory, and at times they very much are. But, to make sense of how such supposed reforms fit together, we need to recognize that the neoliberal emphasis on marketization, privatization, and school choice <italic>requires</italic> the uniformativity of common standards and content so beloved by neoconservatives and new managerialism. Such standardization allows for scores on related achievement tests to be used to compare schools. After all, how are “consumers” supposed to make informed choices without an “objective” means of comparison? The push toward shared standards and assessments is, then, at its core, a decision to reach greater uniformity among practice and outcomes. The rhetoric may stress innovations that choice will supposedly produce, but only innovations that reach outcomes prescribed by particular and identifiable groups of people are supported.</p>
<p>The latent effects of these kinds of reforms are becoming all too visible. Increasingly, opportunities for critical inquiry that expose, analyze, and work to counter social and economic injustices are diminishing. Although democratic schools are certainly possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0895904811425909">Apple &amp; Beane, 2007</xref>) and talented teachers can teach and are teaching prescribed curricula in critical ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0895904811425909">Gutstein, 2006</xref>), the trend is clearly toward increasing surveillance, control, and single-minded efforts to raise test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0895904811425909">Lipman, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0895904811425909">2011</xref>). Unlike past reforms that Labaree claims had little impact on classroom practice, this recent and intensifying obsession with tests scores has narrowed curricula and led to forms of “educational triage” that leave the most vulnerable students behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0895904811425909">Gillborn &amp; Youdell, 2000</xref>). It also has led to calls to deprofessionalize the teaching profession and fire teachers who work hard under increasingly difficult and uncertain conditions inside and outside of schools, but still cannot seem to find the magical solution that will guarantee the production of “appropriate” test results and conduct from students whose own lives are often in disarray due to impoverishment, a racializing society, frightening levels of incarceration, and a future that seems to be getting ever more bleak.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, the business of cutting costs and achieving results has opened doors to the privatization of core educational services. This has not only aligned schooling with business interests, but also actually makes schooling directly profitable for the corporate sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0895904811425909">Ball, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0895904811425909">Burch, 2009</xref>). The conflict of interests between profit and the achievement of social goals through education makes the latter unlikely.</p>

<sec id="section4-0895904811425909">
<title>Pessimism and Optimism</title>
<p>So far we have raised a number of critical questions about the limits of David Labaree’s interpretive frame. However, having said this, we need to restate that for the most part we agree with the spirit, if not all of the specifics, of Labaree’s compellingly written and much needed counterpoint to today’s education reform mania. We mostly agree with Labaree when he states:
<disp-quote><p>[S]chooling has had no effect on the relative position of social groups in the social hierarchy . . . Schools have been ineffective in realizing the social goals of reformers, and their impact on educational consumers collectively has been counterproductive, but schools have been remarkably effective at reshaping American society in their own image. By educationalizing social problems, we have educationalized society itself. (p. 241)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, unlike Labaree, who argues that schools are most successful when they offer a relatively narrow and assimilating shared experience, we believe that schools should continue to work to offer students the chance to investigate critically their communities and the larger social order, in a wider effort to expose, understand, and counter injustices. Labaree would caution us:
<disp-quote><p>Schooling can try to expose students to the issues surrounding major social problems and try to teach them behaviors that might help them mitigate these problems, but in combination these efforts do very little to help with issues like improving public health, promoting peace, or preserving the environment. These things—like equality, opportunity, and economy—require not educational action but political action, since only the political sphere is able, even usually willing, to exert a significant impact on these issues. (p. 247)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of course such things require political action. But haven’t schools always been important sites of political as well as educational action? Isn’t the artificial separation between schools and the political sphere part of the problem? This separation actually reproduces the cynicism that dominant groups work so hard to circulate in their attempts to convince us that all of our problems in schools are amenable to technical solutions. This is one of the arguments that both here and elsewhere David Labaree has been so good at dismantling. But occasionally he comes close to sliding into this line of thinking himself.</p>
<p>As we stated at the start, we share Labaree’s skepticism that education reform alone will be able to accomplish social aims. However, because he chooses not to theorize <italic>why</italic>, outside of the power of self-interest and its impact on the cumulative decisions of “education consumers,” Labaree takes his skepticism a bit too far. Antonio Gramsci, the great theorist of the role of culture and common sense in political life, constantly reminded us that there is good sense and bad sense in the decisions that we make, and that the contexts within which we must ascertain our interests are highly constrained by the interests of the powerful. The actions of self-interested “education consumers” over the past two centuries do not reflect a natural process or the operations of a neutral market full of choices. Instead, the actions of “consumers” and of the education systems that they supposedly created are nested within a context in which the interests of dominant political, cultural, and economic groups have considerable power. Social movements and even individual consumers have little choice but to work within a context in which they may have little control and, hence, must constantly engage in strategic reappropriations of the basic tenets of that context. Thus, even when people seem to basically accept their position as “consumers,” much more creative and complex social and cultural work is being done. This needs to be interrogated critically, not accepted as somehow the natural order of things (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0895904811425909">Apple, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0895904811425909">Apple &amp; Pedroni, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, we tend to be somewhat more optimistic than the arguments offered in <italic>Someone Has to Fail</italic>, in large part because of the history of the role of educational institutions as arenas for social struggles, many of which have been successful. As we mentioned earlier, we wonder how Labaree’s analysis would have changed if he had focused more directly on the role of the school in the experiences of oppressed and marginalized groups. In these experiences, schools became centers for self-formative actions, for community mobilizations, for the defense of very different understandings of what counts as legitimate knowledge. Had a modern Carter Woodson written parts of this book, with all of the critical educational and cultural labor in which he and so many other people of color successfully engaged included, the perspectives and conclusions might have been altered and other possibilities might have been recognized (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811425909">Lewis 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904811425909">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0895904811425909">Woodson 1933</xref>).</p>
<p>Our position is perhaps closer to that of Jean <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0895904811425909">Anyon (2005)</xref>. For her, schools can work in concert with, and be one of the more important sites for the formation of, social movements as they struggle to reshape common sense along more thickly democratic lines and create workable alternatives to existing and deeply unequal relations of power. In doing so, schools can still offer shared and unifying experiences (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0895904811425909">Apple et al., 2009</xref>). But in a nation characterized by diasporic populations and an ever changing sense of what counts as “the common” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0895904811425909">Apple, 2010</xref>), what counts as that shared and unifying set of experiences isn’t just there. It has to be <italic>built</italic>. What is common is the question of what counts as the common (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0895904811425909">Williams 1961</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0895904811425909">1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Rather than focusing only on preparing students for their seemingly inevitable roles in an existing and all too unequal social order and then legitimizing the order’s continuing recreation, a shared and unifying experience can be one that creates citizens able to investigate and change their communities’ political, cultural, and economic assumptions. This was Woodson’s goal, as it was the aim of Du Bois and so many other organic intellectuals who gave voice to those whose voices always spoke but were usually ignored (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0895904811425909">Lewis, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0895904811425909">2000</xref>). Helping students develop these skills hardly means abandoning the curriculum “basics.” Rather, it requires students to develop and apply an array of literacies in ways that are unique and relevant to each community’s needs. This kind of education is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0895904811425909">Watson 2011</xref>), and despite the difficulties Labaree so clearly and thoughtfully outlines, we must continue to work to realize it.</p>
<p>Where does this leave us in our interpretation of <italic>Someone Has to Fail</italic>? As we said, it is to the credit of the arguments put forward in the book that we have been called on to try to make fuller sense of them and to see where we agree and disagree. Labaree’s work offers a thoughtful analysis of the history and possibilities of education reform in the United States. The scope and clarity of Labaree’s arguments are impressive, as is his characteristic ability to infuse his story with humor and wit. Indeed, if many more critical analysts of the history and current status of educational reforms were able to write as well as Labaree does in this book, the field would be all the better for it.</p>
<p><italic>Someone Has to Fail</italic> offers a reinterpretation of the complexities of education reform, one that is full of useful counterpoints to many of the most common claims made by today’s business-minded reformers. Thus, the work is well worth reading. However, we still wish that Labaree had more deeply explored the contexts within which his education “consumers” were making their system-shaping decisions. Such an effort would have offered a more compellingly critical assessment of the importance of curriculum and the struggles over knowledge and culture. It would have brought the experiences and movements of the marginalized closer to the center of its account. And in the process, it might have engendered a somewhat less gloomy perspective regarding the roles that schools might still play in efforts to create a more just society.</p>
