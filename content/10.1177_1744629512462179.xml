<abstract>
<p>Patients with learning disabilities are not always involved in decision-making about their medications. This may mean that some patients are unfairly denied of their autonomy. We carried out an audit of current practice concerning consent to treatment in patients with learning disabilities against best practice guidelines. Data were collected via a questionnaire given to a sample of 70 patients with learning disabilities within the Salford catchment area. This questionnaire assessed whether patients were involved in decision-making regarding their medications and whether they were being given enough information to give informed consent. A total of 45 patients completed questionnaires. Overall, the patients’ knowledge of their medications was poor, particularly of the proposed duration, possible disadvantages and name of the treatment. It appears that doctors are engaging these patients during consultations and discussing their medications. However, the delivery of this information needs to be improved, and patients’ understanding and recall need to be checked more thoroughly.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A person is deemed as having the capacity to make a decision for themselves if they are able to understand the information relevant to the decision, retain this information for long enough to make the decision and then communicate this decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512462179">Mental Capacity Act, 2005</xref>). Information relevant to the initiation of new medications includes awareness of the drug name, its purpose, the administration schedule, possible adverse effects and any other special administration instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512462179">Ascione et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512462179">Storm et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unethical to administer medications to patients without their consent if they have the capacity to make healthcare decisions, and doing so breaks the principle of patient autonomy and constitutes assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744629512462179">Wong et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies have shown that patients with mild-to-moderate learning disabilities might have the capacity to make simple decisions about their health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512462179">Arscott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512462179">Goldsmith et al., 2008</xref>). Despite this, many of these patients are not involved in the decisions about their care and appear to lack knowledge about the medication they are taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512462179">Arscott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744629512462179">Heslop et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744629512462179">Goldsmith et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744629512462179">Keywood and Flynn, 2003</xref>)</p>
<p>We carried out an audit to determine whether patients with learning disabilities are receiving the information they require, in a form that they can understand, to make informed decisions about their medication.</p>

<title>Aims of the audit</title>
<p>The objectives of this audit are to evaluate current practice concerning consent to treatment in patients with learning disabilities against best practice guidelines and to ascertain whether patients with learning disabilities are given enough information, in a form that they can understand, to make informed decisions about their medication.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1744629512462179">
<title>Standards</title>
<p>The present audit was designed to test the following standards, which were obtained following a review of several sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744629512462179">Department of Health, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744629512462179">General Medical Council, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744629512462179">Mental Capacity Act, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744629512462179">Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744629512462179">Nursing and Midwifery Council, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744629512462179">The British Psychological Society, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744629512462179">The Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2004</xref>). If the patient is found to have the capacity to consent:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the patient must be involved with decisions about their health,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the patient must be provided information, in a form they can understand, on the following:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the benefits of the proposed treatment,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the risks of the proposed treatment,</p>
</list-item>

<p>what the treatment will involve,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the implications of not having the treatment, and</p>

</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the patient's understanding of the information provided must always be checked,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the decision of the person must be made voluntarily,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>an assessment of capacity should be recorded in the person’s notes or, where appropriate, in a form for adults who are unable to consent.</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section5-1744629512462179">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The audit was conducted in Salford (Greater Manchester, UK). A total of 215 adult patients with intellectual disabilities, who were currently living in supported accommodation were identified. Of these patients, 87  lived in supported tenancies, while 128 patients lived in private care homes. We selected every third patient living in each type of accommodation until we had achieved a sample of 35 patients living in supported tenancies and 35 patients living in privately funded homes, making a total of 70 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1744629512462179">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Data were collected via a questionnaire designed for patients with learning disabilities to complete. Patients were sent a covering letter and questionnaire to their home address by post. Both the covering letter and the questionnaire were written in an easy-read format and included Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) to allow the questionnaire to be accessible for patients with intellectual disabilities. The PCS were created in conjunction with the Total Communications Lead from the Salford City Council Learning Difficulties Partnership Board. The covering letter explained the purpose of the audit, why it was important and stressed that all information gathered would remain confidential. Those who agreed to take part were asked to complete and return the questionnaire with the help of their support worker. The questions assessed the patients’ knowledge regarding the following eight items:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>name of the medication,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>purpose of the medication,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>duration of treatment,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>benefits of the medication,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>possible adverse effects,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>consequences of not taking the medication, and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>foods or drinks that are contraindicated.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These items were assessed for each medication the patient was taking. The answers to these questions were examined for accuracy using the 61st edition of the British National Formulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744629512462179">British Medical Association and Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, 2011</xref>). Answers that were incorrect or recorded as ‘don’t know’ were given a score of zero. All correct information was given a score of one. Next, the patients’ knowledge regarding their medications for each question was calculated as a ratio of the number of points scored to the number of medications they were currently taking. This allowed comparisons of knowledge between patients, despite varying numbers of medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512462179">Barat et al., 2001</xref>). Based on previous publications, a cut off of 50% was decided upon as a good level of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512462179">Arscott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512462179">Barat et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The following items were also assessed to ascertain whether the patient was involved in decision-making regarding their medication:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>whether the patient had agreed to take the medication;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>who administers their medication;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>whether the medication had ever been changed without the patient’s permission;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>whether anyone else helped the patient to make decisions about their medication.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the questionnaire included some questions for the support workers themselves. We asked support workers whether the patient had the capacity to consent for medical treatment and whether there was a record of a formal assessment of capacity preceding the use of current medication present in the home. Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS for Windows 16.0; SPSS Inc.; Chicago, Illinois, USA).</p>
<p>The audit was registered with the Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust Audit Department. We deemed this to be an audit because the question we were asking was: are health professionals complying with accepted standards of care concerning helping patients with intellectual disabilities to consent to medical treatment? The audit department gave us permission to proceed. Since patients with intellectual disabilities are a vulnerable population, we took a number of steps to safeguard the participants. First, we made clear in the covering letter that the patient was not required to take part in the audit, and if the patient or support worker had any queries then they could contact us by telephone for further information. If the patient did take part, then information was given to them in simple language that they could understand. Second, appropriate measures were taken to ensure confidentiality of patient data; all results from the questionnaire were recorded anonymously in an SPSS database and were password protected. Paper copies of questionnaires were stored in locked filing cabinets in secure offices at Greater Manchester West Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. Third, it was made clear that the patients or their carers could withdraw their consent at any time.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 51  patients (72.9% of the sample) completed the questionnaires.  Of these patients, six were not taking regular medications. The following results apply to the remaining 45 patients.</p>
<p>A total of 20 male and 25 female patients took part in the audit. The mean age of these patients was 51.5 years. Of these patients, 22 (48.9%) lived in supported tenancies, while 23 (51.1%) lived in privately funded care homes. On average, these patients were taking approximately five medications each.</p>
<sec id="section8-1744629512462179">
<title>Medication knowledge</title>
<p>Overall, medication knowledge was poor, with patients scoring less than 50% in all but one of the areas assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744629512462179">Figure 1</xref>). In particular, these patients showed a lack of knowledge about the proposed duration of their treatment, possible disadvantages and names of their medications, knowing these items in less than 15% of medications, on average.</p>

<p>A total of eight patients (17.8%) were identified by staff as possessing mental capacity. On average, these patients showed good knowledge of the purpose of their medication, dose schedule, advantages of the treatment, consequences of not taking the medication and contraindicated foods and drinks. However, these patients showed poor knowledge of the proposed duration of their treatment and the possible disadvantages and names of their medications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744629512462179">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Overall, 37 patients (82.2%) were identified by staff as lacking the capacity to make decisions about their healthcare. These patients had less knowledge of their medications than the patients with capacity to make decisions, with an average of less than 50% scored in all assessed areas. As with the patients with capacity to make decisions, knowledge about the names of medications, the duration of treatment and possible disadvantages of the medication were particularly poor with an average of less than 10% scored in these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744629512462179">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Of the 37 patients without capacity to make decisions, 19 patients were either not involved with discussions about their medications or were unsure as to who helped them to make decisions about their medications and healthcare. Nine patients identified their doctor as the person who helped them to make decisions about their medications, while another nine patients identified their care staff or relatives as the people who helped them.</p>
<p>A record of a formal assessment of capacity, preceding the use of current medication, was present in only four of the patients’ homes. However, since we do not have access to each patient’s clinical notes, it is unclear whether such a capacity assessment was recorded elsewhere.</p>

<title>Medication knowledge</title>
<p>Overall, intellectually disabled patients’ knowledge of their medications is poor. However, this finding may not be a representative of intellectually disabled patients as a whole, due to the number of profoundly disabled patients present in this audit, who lacked the capacity to make healthcare decisions. Knowledge among patients with capacity to make decisions may be better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744629512462179">Arscott et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, knowledge about possible adverse effects, the duration of treatment and the names of medications was very poor in all the patients. Interestingly, knowledge of possible adverse effects is also poor in the mainstream population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744629512462179">Ascione et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744629512462179">Barat et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744629512462179">Jaye et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512462179">Kerzman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744629512462179">Modig et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that all health professionals caring for all patients need to give more information about possible adverse effects.</p>
<p>Previous publications have shown that doctors do not always give patients information about the mechanism of action or possible adverse effects of medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744629512462179">Storm et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744629512462179">Wynne and Long, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744629512462179">Ziegler et al., 2001</xref>). Although comparable studies do not appear to have been carried out in the intellectually disabled population, it is possible that the information provided by doctors to these patients follows a similar pattern. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512462179">Strydom et al. (2002</xref>) found that patients with intellectual disabilities wanted to know more information specifically about the indications for their medication, possible side effects and contraindications. This suggests that health professionals are giving both mainstream patients and patients with learning disabilities similar information about their medications.</p>
<p>Despite this, a large number of patients identified their doctors as a source of information about medications, which suggests that health professionals are attempting to provide information to these patients. Therefore, to improve patient knowledge of their medications, it is important to ascertain exactly what information health professionals are attempting to give patients. If health professionals are attempting to convey all the information that is required by current best practice guidelines, then the delivery of this information needs to be improved.</p>
<p>There are many methods of communication that health professionals could be trained in to improve patient understanding of their medications. These include breaking information down into ‘chunks’ and using visual aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744629512462179">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). Health professionals should also be aware of the methods they can use to overcome communication barriers, such as nonverbal demonstrations of medical procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744629512462179">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, leaflets about medications designed specifically for comprehension by intellectually disabled patients could be very useful. These may help understanding by allowing patients to learn about their medications in their own time, as well as reinforcing information that has been given during a consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744629512462179">Strydom et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744629512462179">Kerzman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Capacity</title>
<p>Many patients in this audit were found to lack the capacity to make decisions about their health. However, a record of a capacity assessment preceding the use of current medications was present in only four patients’ homes. Although this is not currently considered best practice, perhaps it would be beneficial to include these notes in the patient’s care plan at their home. This might help care staff to better understand the limits of the patient’s capacity, helping to prevent inappropriate deprivation of the liberty of the patient through the incorrect assumption that a patient is unable to take part in discussions about their medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744629512462179">Age Concern, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1744629512462179">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Medication knowledge among patients with intellectual disabilities is poor. Knowledge of possible adverse effects, the duration of treatment and the names of medications is particularly inadequate. To improve knowledge, all patients with intellectual disabilities should be given the chance to discuss their medications with their doctor or other health professional. In addition, health professionals should be trained in communication skills that aid intellectually disabled patients' understanding of their medications.</p>
