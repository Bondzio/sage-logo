<title>Case Presentation</title>
<p>A previously healthy 5-year-old girl sustained a nonhuman primate bite to her right fourth finger from an unprovoked macaque monkey. Per owner of the monkey, the animal’s immunizations were up-to-date without documentation because the monkey was illegally obtained. The patient was seen at an urgent care center, and the bite was found to be superficial. No surrounding erythema or oozing was noted. She was started on amoxicillin/clavulinic acid and instructed to follow up with her pediatrician the following day. On follow-up, the wound did not appear infected, but because of the unusual source of animal bite, pediatric infectious diseases was consulted regarding the need for prophylactic antiviral therapy.</p>
<p>Physical examination was unremarkable, with normal vital signs. The only significant finding was the superficial bite marks on the girl’s finger.</p>
<p>Per consultant recommendations, she was started on acyclovir prophylaxis to prevent against herpes B virus and azidothymidine (AZT) until the monkey’s SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) status was evaluated. A tuberculin skin test was placed because of risk of tuberculosis (TB) exposure from the monkey. The animal was initially captured to watch for signs and symptoms of rabies. The patient had completed her hepatitis B vaccine series and was up-to-date with the tetanus vaccine.</p>
<p>The monkey was euthanized, and the brain biopsy was negative for rabies. Serum serologies were sent for hepatitis A to C, measles, herpes B virus, and SIV. The patient remained on acyclovir and AZT until serologies were reported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Macaque monkeys are the most widely distributed genus of nonhuman primates. They are native to Asia and North Africa, but thousands of macaques are housed in research facilities, zoos, and wild-life parks and are kept as pets in private homes throughout the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812437033">1</xref></sup> Since 1975, the Federal Quarantine Regulations (42 CFR 71.53) have restricted the importation of nonhuman primates as pets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812437033">2</xref></sup> The most common exposure to macaques in the United States is at research facilities, but children can be exposed to the infectious diseases risk that macaques pose. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the exposure risks associated with these animals.</p>
<p>Some exposure risks are not unique to macaque monkeys. Bacterial infections and the need for antibiotics should always be considered in animal bites. Tetanus immunity should be updated. Rabies should be considered when a person suffers a bite by wild mammalian carnivores, bats, or domestic animals that are suspected to be rabid. Postexposure prophylaxis, which includes local administration of human rabies immunoglobulin at the site of the injury as well as administration of rabies vaccine, should be given. Domestic animals that bite a patient can be captured and observed for signs/symptoms of rabies. If there is any suspicion of rabies, the animal should be euthanized, and the brain should be biopsied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812437033">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Researchers who usually handle macaque monkeys are also considered at risk for acquiring hepatitis A and B, measles, and TB. Because of routine immunizations, the likelihood of acquiring these diseases from an isolated exposure to a macaque monkey is rare but should, nonetheless, be considered. Exposure to the feces of these animals is a risk factor for hepatitis A. Macaque monkeys are susceptible to TB, and therefore, it is recommended that people who handle macaque monkeys have a skin test every 6 to 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812437033">1</xref></sup> HIV exposure should be considered because the HIV-1 group M viruses, which are responsible for the majority of HIV infections worldwide, appear to have arisen from a cross-species transmission event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812437033">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is important to consider infection with herpes B virus in individuals bitten by a macaque because the mortality rate is nearly 80% if acquired by humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812437033">5</xref></sup> Herpes virus B (<italic>Cercopithecine herpesvirus</italic> 1) is endemic to macaques of South and Southeast Asia and, in monkeys, causes mild symptoms like herpes simplex virus (HSV) does in humans. Monkeys usually have oral or genital lesions. The virus remains dormant in the sensory ganglia. It can be shed periodically through herpetic lesions.</p>
<p>Fortunately, symptomatic human infections with herpes B virus are rare, even in primate handlers who are exposed to bites, scratches, needle-stick injuries, and mucosal splashes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812437033">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, in humans, herpes B virus can present in various ways, including a vesicular rash at the site of exposure with associated tingling, numbness and pain, or local lymphadenopathy. Within 3 weeks, patients may develop parasthesias, which travel proximally along the affected extremity. Other symptoms include myalgias, inability to use the affected limb, fever, abdominal pain, sinusitis, and conjunctivitis. The lungs and liver may also be affected. In patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, the virus may spread from the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and brain. CNS symptoms include meningismus, nausea, vomiting, headaches, confusion, cranial nerve palsies, ataxia, seizures, hemiplegia, hemiparesis, respiratory failure, and coma. Eventually, these patients can have diffuse encephalomyelitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437033">7</xref></sup> The incubation period can vary from 2 days to 5 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812437033">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ocular, oral, and genital secretions from monkeys as well as CNS tissue and cerebrospinal fluid are sources of potential exposure. Documented routes of infection include monkey bites, scratches, exposure to tissue culture material, needle-stick injuries, mucosal splashes, and human-to-human transmission (in 1 reported case).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812437033">9</xref></sup> Seroprevalence studies indicate that nearly all adult macaques are seropositive for the virus, but only a quarter of the juveniles were positive, indicating a higher likelihood of exposure to herpes B from adult monkeys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812437033">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Conrol and Prevention published guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis. Mucosa exposed to potentially infected material should be washed with sterile solution or water for at least 15 minutes. Skin should be cleansed with povidone-iodine, chlorohexidine, or detergent soap. Wound should be cultured but not before cleansing so as not to force the virus further into the wound.</p>
<p>Most authorities recommend serum antibody level analysis at the time of exposure and 3 to 6 weeks later. Because of cross-reactivity with HSV antibodies, a positive serological test for herpes B virus should be confirmed with a Western blot or ELISA. Cultures and serological samples should be sent to a reference laboratory. If the animal is captured, cultures should be sent from the buccal mucosa, conjunctiva, or urogential area. Serological studies should also be sent at the time of exposure and, if negative, several weeks later. All macaque monkeys should be considered seropositive for herpes B virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437033">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Postexposure prophylaxis is recommended for 7 exposure types: (1) exposure to high-risk source (macaque that is ill, immunocompromised, known to be shedding virus, or has herpes B oral/genital lesions); (2) inadequately cleansed skin or mucosa; (3) laceration of head, neck, or torso; (4) deep puncture bite; (5) needle-stick injury with tissue or fluid from nervous systems, suspicious lesions, eyelids, or mucosa; (6) puncture or laceration with exposure to objects contaminated with fluid from monkey’s oral/genital lesions or nervous system tissue or tissue known to contain herpes B virus; (7) postcleansing culture positive for herpes B virus. Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered for (1) adequately cleansed mucosal splashes, (2) adequately cleansed lacerations, (3) needle-stick injury involving blood from ill or immunocompromised macaques, and (4) puncture or laceration with exposure to objects contaminated with body fluids (other than from lesions) or potentially infected cell culture. Prophylaxis is not recommended for skin exposure where skin remains intact or for exposure to nonmacaque monkeys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437033">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Postexposure prophylaxis consists of 3 orally available antivirals—acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir— that have not been approved by the FDA for treatment of herpes B virus. Cohen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437033">7</xref></sup> recommend valacylcovir for postexposure prophylaxis in adults and nonpregnant women because it achieves higher serum levels than acyclovir. Acyclovir is the drug of choice in pregnant women. Postexposure prophylaxis should be continued for 2 weeks. If at that time the patient remains asymptomatic, prophylaxis can be terminated. However, the patient should be followed up at least for 4 to 6 weeks and at any time if he or she develops a change in clinical status. For symptomatic patients, treatment should be initiated using IV acyclovir if CNS symptoms are present or IV ganciclovir if they are absent. IV therapy is continued until 2 negative cultures for herpes B are obtained. Cultures should be held up to 2 weeks before final results are reported. The need for duration of suppressive therapy is controversial. Some experts recommend lifelong suppressive therapy, but risk of prolonged antiviral therapy should be balanced against the risk of reactivation of the herpes B virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812437033">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of our patient, all the monkey’s serologies were negative, and the monkey’s brain biopsy was also negative for rabies. AZT and acyclovir were only stopped when serologies were back.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have provided a brief overview of the management of patients exposed to potentially infectious material from macaque monkeys. Because thousands of these animals are in research laboratories throughout the country, and illegally obtained pets remain a potential source of exposure to lay people, it is imperative that physicians are aware of the treatable, potentially fatal, yet rare, risk of herpes B virus encephalitis as well as the other associated infectious diseases exposures.</p>
