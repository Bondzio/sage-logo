<abstract>
<p>In this study, a modular anterior lumbar plate is designed and tested in an iterative fashion. The study starts with a basic design that is built by combining same-sized modules; an approach that allow inventory costs to be decreased. The basic design is iteratively improved guided by the results of biomechanical tests performed on each new design. At the end of three iterations of improvements, the design is complete and the plate is of sufficient quality for it to be used in anterior surgical operations. Using these plates creates the advantage of being able to increase the size and slot count during surgical operations, even when some of the modules are already fixed to vertebrae. The designed modular plate is shown to be as safe for use as a rigid plate in terms of its static and fatigue biomechanical performances.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic axial low back pain is not only a medical problem for patients; it can also create a serious economic problem in terms of lost production. Combining anterior lumbar discectomy with fusion is a common approach to treat chronic axial lower back pain when conservative treatments fail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451825">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Anterior surgery is also performed on spinal fractures of thoracolumbar spine, spinal tumors, scoliosis, and degenerative thoracic and thoracolumbar problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912451825">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411912451825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411912451825">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, anterior fixation is also used as an inter-body fusion process to stabilize traumatic instabilities and is performed following the oncological resection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451825">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Motivated by the advances in anterior spinal fixation, several biomechanical studies involving human cadavers and animal tissue have been reported in the literature in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451825">1</xref></sup> In addition to mechanical studies, follow-up studies have also been performed on anteriolumbar plate implanted patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411912451825">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several anterior, posterior and anterior with posterior fixation techniques including cages, rods or plates that are used in the treatment of such disorders. A number of studies have been completed that have investigated or compared fixation techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451825">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451825">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411912451825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411912451825">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Kotani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411912451825">9</xref></sup> studied the biomechanical results obtained from 12 different anterior stabilization techniques including five plate types and seven rod types. Polyethylene blocks were used in these tests to compare the fixation techniques with respect to stiffness, bending strength and fatigue performance. According to the results of that study, there is no significant difference between rod and plate stabilization systems in terms of rigidity.</p>
<p>Bozkus et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411912451825">10</xref></sup> experimented on calf vertebrae and compared the use of an inter-body fusion cage, a cage with anterolateral plating, a cage with lateral plating and a cage with pedicle screws. They concluded that lateral and anterolateral plating have the potential to be used as an alternative to posterior fixation with pedicle screws in clinical applications. They also highlighted that lateral and anterolateral plating could replace the combined use of anterior and posterior plates to stabilize spinal instability.</p>
<p>In a study carried out on human cadavers by Johnson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912451825">1</xref></sup> anterior plate fixation and posterior pedicle screw-rod fixation following anterolateral inter-body fusion both exhibited the same levels of stability. In addition, the plate system position (anterolateral or anterior) was shown to not significantly influence the stability. That study confirmed the results of several clinical studies in which anterior stabilization following anterolateral inter-body fusion was reported to provide the same level of stability as that created using posterior pedicle screw stabilization. Open or percutaneous posterior operation methods include a greater risk of neural element injury when compared with anterior stabilization. This makes anterior stabilization techniques more preferable.</p>
<p>Most of the in-vitro biomechanical studies reported in the literature have shown that anterior plate stabilization has similar stabilization effects on the motion of the spine to those for posterior pedicle screw/rod stabilization techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411912451825">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411912451825"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411912451825"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411912451825">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, anterior plating is widely used as a spinal stabilization technique for certain diseases. Anterior fixation provides a similar level of biomechanical stability to that for posterior fixation.</p>
<p>In this study, a new type of anterior lumbar plate is designed in an iterative manner. The design is updated based on the results of static and fatigue biomechanical tests performed after an iteration of the design. A main motivation of the new design was to reduce inventory costs. Since, the distance between two vertebral bones and the level of bone (upper or lower lumbar bones) differs from person to person, operation sets currently include several sizes of plates with various numbers of holes or slots in them. Surgeons generally decide the size of the required plate during, and not before, the operation. Urgent operations are also another reason to include all sizes of plates in operation sets. The proposed design offers a highly modular system of plates in which modules can easily be attached to one another. It can be considered to be a telescopic set of instruments, but with all parts of the plate being identical. Each module includes a slot, which makes preparing a plate with the required number of slots extremely easy. Attaching the modules to each other creates the final plate. However, using a multiple-part plate may compromise biomechanical strength. To ensure the reliability of the proposed device, biomechanical static and dynamic tests were performed on the prototypes of the new design which enabled the performance of the modular plate to be improved.</p>
<p>A novel type of modular plate was studied by Pierron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912451825">20</xref></sup> The main difference between the design proposed in this paper and that in Pierron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912451825">20</xref></sup> lies in the way the modules are attached. The design of Pierron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411912451825">20</xref></sup> needs at least two pedicle screws per module, since the plates are attached to each other using I-type pedicle screws. The modules are placed on one another and fixed with the head part of the I-screw pedicle. This design requires the use of a pedicle screw for each hole or each attached module. On the other hand, the design proposed in this paper allows the attachment of modules without using pedicle screws.</p>
<p>The modular nature of the designed anterior lumbar plate means that manufacturers will only have to make one size of plate (module). This will accelerates the mass production of plates and decreases inventory costs.</p>

<title>Design</title>
<p>Modules were designed using the Solidworks CAD software package. The two end parts of a module were designed to be a tongue and a groove so that the modules could be attached to each other. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411912451825">Figure 1</xref> shows the main elements of the basic design: two slotted plates (in other words, it contains two modules) and an engagement screw. A hole is drilled in the tongue of the module and threaded to meet with the engagement screw. The engagement screw’s lower face compresses both modules simultaneously. The friction force between the engagement screw and the modules then engages the two modules.</p>

</fig>
<p>When assembling two modules, the tongue of the first module is placed through the groove of the second module and then the engagement screw is tightened. When assembling three or more modules, the same procedure is repeated for each attached module.</p>
<p>All parts were designed to be manufactured from Ti6Al4V grade 5 titanium biocompatible alloy to ensure usability of the designed plating system in a human being. All prototypes were also manufactured from the same alloy.</p>
<p>After conducting biomechanical static and dynamic tests, the design was improved in an iterative manner as will be discussed in the section ‘Results and discussion’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0954411912451825" sec-type="methods">
<title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Two types of test procedures were applied to the designed plate systems. The first type of tests were static four-point bending tests performed in compliance with the guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912451825">21</xref></sup> set out in ASTM F382 and the second type were fatigue tests that were performed at the same loading conditions as for the static four-point bending tests. All tests were performed on three-module plates with two engagement screws using the testing apparatus shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411912451825">Figure 2</xref>. The loading rate was 2 mm/min for static tests and for the fatigue tests the span for the upper drivers was 35 mm and that for the lower drivers was 70 mm. The loads were measured using a calibrated load cell and subsequently load–displacement curves were plotted. Yield loads and displacements were determined using the 0.02% offset method on the linear part of the load–displacement curve (elastic region). All the tests were repeated five times and the standard deviations were calculated to ensure the significance of the derived load or displacement data across tests under identical conditions. The tested position was at the tongue–grove cross-section since this is expected to have the lowest values of the measured parameters and as such tests were not performed at any other positions.</p>

</fig>
<p>After determining the yield loads for each plate design, fatigue tests were performed using 75% of the yield load of each design. If a plate design reached 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cycles at a load of 75% of the yield load without failure, it was taken to be a success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411912451825">21</xref></sup> Fatigue tests were also repeated five times. If a plate design reached 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cycles at a load of 75% of the yield load in the first three tests, the last two tests were conducted at a level of 85% of the yield load.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The final design of the plate emerged after three iterations of the design procedure. The initial design was tested according to ASTM F382 and the results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451825">Table 1</xref>. This initial design had a mean yield load of 306.4 N with a standard deviation of 15.6 N and its mean ultimate load was 565.6 N with a standard deviation of 21.4 N. This design failed in fatigue tests at the 75% of yield load (230 N) after 865 and 882 cycles. A photograph of a failed specimen is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411912451825">Figure 3</xref>. The engagement ring failed easily under the bending load. To overcome this problem, the groove and tongue coupling was modified into the new form shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411912451825">Figure 4</xref>. The tongue of the module was drilled and threaded. Then, the anterior face of the groove was drilled larger than the tongue’s threaded hole to meet the concentricity with the tongue’s hole. When assembling two modules, the tongue of the first module is placed through the groove of the second module and the engagement screw is tightened to the first module’s tongue by passing through the second module’s anterior face of the groove. This was first iteration of the design. The test procedure was repeated for this design and again the tested design failed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411912451825">Figure 5</xref>. The numerical results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451825">Table 1</xref>. The first design iteration created a higher strength than achieved in the initial design. The mean ultimate and yield loads were 871.6 N (standard deviation of 19.5 N) and 565 N (standard deviation of 21.6 N), respectively. The static strength crated by the first iteration to the initial design was nearly a factor of two higher than for the initial design. Fatigue tests showed that after applying close to 200,000 cycles, the plate tongue failed with the application of 75% of the yield load (424 N). On the other hand, when applying 60% of the yield load (339 N) no failure was created by the fatigue tests. However, this does not meet the criterion laid down in ASTM F382.</p>

<p>It is clear that the threaded hole causes crack initiation resulting in the eventual failure of the tongue and plate. Threading a dynamically loaded element resulted in crack initiation, crack growth and failure. To improve the fatigue resistance, a ring was designed to press fit the hole of the tongue. The reason for using a threaded ring rather than directly drilling the module’s tongue and threading it is to limit the crack initiation or crack growth in the ring’s outer diameter. This was the second iteration of the design process and it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954411912451825">Figure 6</xref>. The test procedures were applied to the third design and the results are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451825">Table 1</xref>. The mean yield strength created by the design improvement in the second iteration was 1.5 and 2.8 times higher than that of the first iteration and the initial design, respectively. Unfortunately, these impressive static values were undermined by the test piece failing in the fatigue tests earlier than for the initial design and the first iteration design. For the 75% yield load (641 N) test, the plate failed within ~800,000 cycles. When applying 60% of the yield load (513 N) the plate reached ~180,000 cycles which is lower than the cycle count for the first iteration design. The failed specimen can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411912451825">Figure 7</xref>. Press fitting the threaded ring was not enough to maintain its position and it in fact became loose and the plate failed in the tests. The third iteration of the design process was performed to stabilize the ring, thereby making it better fixed, by preventing the rotation of the ring against the tongue. To make this improvement, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411912451825">Figure 8</xref>, two rims were added to the ring and two channels were added to the tongue. The test procedure was performed on this fourth design and the results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954411912451825">Table 1</xref>. It can be seen that the final design did not fail in the static tests. The final iteration of the design process created a slightly higher fatigue strength level than for the second iteration design. The clear superiority of the final iteration design was revealed in the fatigue tests. At 75% of the yield load (668 N), the plate did not fail up to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cycles. In addition to this, when applying 85% of the yield load (757 N), it reached ∼600,000 cycles which is very close to passing the test. From the photograph of the failed specimen, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411912451825">Figure 9</xref>, it is clear that the main plate has broken; however, the assembly points remain intact.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this study, a modular plate for anterior spinal fixation applications was iteratively designed and tested using the protocols in ASTM F382. Three iterations to the basic design resulted in a successful modular anterior plate, which passed all of the tests specified in ASTM F382. Both static and fatigue tests were conducted on all of the designed prototypes. The main advantages of the proposed design for the modular plate include:</p>
<list id="list1-0954411912451825" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>the new design reduces inventory costs;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>joining one-size modules together allows the creation of various sizes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the new plate is as safe as a traditional rigid plate;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the size of the plate can be determined as needed during the surgical operation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the new design enables the surgeon to extend the length of the plate during a surgical operation even when some modules are already fixed to vertebrae.</p></list-item>
