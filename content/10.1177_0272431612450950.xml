<abstract>
<p>This study examined the associations between various sources of social support and academic achievement. Participants were 313 ethnically diverse students attending a low-income intermediate school in New Zealand (mean age = 11.96 years). They reported on the presence and nature of a relationship with a very important nonparental adult in their lives (VIP), and on parent, peer, and VIP warmth and acceptance. Indicators of academic achievement (standardized tests) were also gathered from the school. Results showed that 62% of the youth reported the presence of at least one VIP in their lives, and there was a significant, positive correlation between VIP presence and the majority of academic achievement variables. VIP warmth was uniquely associated with all achievement variables, while parent and peer warmth were nonsignificant in the presence of VIP warmth. The results indicate that VIPs are an important resource for youth who are at risk of low achievement.</p>

<p>Evidence of academic underachievement of some student groups has been well documented in many countries. For instance, in the United States, African American and Latino adolescents typically underperform in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431612450950">Aud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431612450950">Steinberg, Dornbusch, &amp; Brown, 1992</xref>). Government statistics in New Zealand (NZ) indicate Māori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and Pasifika (Pacific Island) youth tend to underperform academically compared to New Zealand (NZ) European- and Asian-background peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431612450950">Ministry of Māori Affairs/Te Puni Kokiri, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431612450950">Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, 2003</xref>). Compared to Asian and NZ European students, a lower percentage of Māori and Pasifika youth reach proficiency levels in reading, math, and science at all levels of high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431612450950">Ministry of Education, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, data from 1993 to 2007 showed that a much higher percentage of Māori and Pasifika students, compared to NZ European and Asian students, left formal schooling with little or no formal qualification, and this trend was particularly profound for low socioeconomic status (SES) Māori and Pasifika students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431612450950">Education Counts, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The underachievement of particular student groups has drawn much attention in an attempt to explain and change the apparent patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman’s (1987)</xref> concept of social capital provides the framework for examining this issue. Social capital, as it relates to childrearing, refers to the “norms, the social networks, and the relationships between adults and children that are of value for the child’s growing up. Social capital exists within the family, but also outside the family, in the community” (p. 36). Coleman suggested that children have experienced a loss of social capital due to parents working outside of the home resulting in schools and other institutions becoming more responsible for the socialization of children. Furthermore, Coleman contended that the erosion of social capital has led to a decline in academic achievement. The costs of the change in societal structures and the resulting loss of social capital will be “borne disproportionately by the disadvantaged of the next generation—for the loss of social capital in the community hurts most the children with least human and social capital in their families” (p. 37).</p>
<p>Poverty, as well as other factors such as low parent education and language proficiency, have been noted as possible risk factors for underachievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431612450950">Bempechat &amp; Ginsburg, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431612450950">Muller, Stage, &amp; Kinzie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431612450950">Pallas, Natriello, &amp; McDill, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431612450950">Sirin, 2005</xref>). Indeed, family income appears to moderate other risk factors for lower achievement, such as single parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431612450950">Milne, Myers, Rosenthal, &amp; Ginsberg, 1986</xref>). Interestingly, language proficiency appears to be uniquely associated with achievement as compared with SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431612450950">Santiago, Lukas, Joaristi, Lizasoain, &amp; Moyano, 2008</xref>). In New Zealand, both Māori and Pasifika youth are more likely to be affected by poverty compared to other groups, which is associated with underachievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431612450950">Biddulph, Biddulph, &amp; Biddulph, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431612450950">Gilbert, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that within the New Zealand cultural context, Anglo Saxon dominance combined with experiences of discrimination and prejudice have historically delegitimized many of the values that define Māori and Pasifika culture and identity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431612450950">Sachdev, 1990</xref>). This loss of identity has been attributed to Māori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431612450950">Bishop, Berryman, Cavanagh, &amp; Teddy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431612450950">Durie, 2005</xref>) and Pasifika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431612450950">Mila-Schaaf &amp; Robinson, 2010</xref>) underachievement. Within the United States, it is also suggested that attitudes toward school and academic motivation are shaped by cultural mistrust placing minority groups in a position of academic disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431612450950">Ogbu, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431612450950">1997</xref>). Furthermore, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0272431612450950">Wilson (1996)</xref>, an individual’s “skills, habits and styles are often shaped by the frequency at which they are found in their own community” (p. 72). As many minority youth attend low-income schools and live in the poorest communities, it is likely that access to these tools of success as well as community social capital may be diminished.</p>
<p>In line with Coleman’s notion of social capital, research has long indicated the importance of social relationships on adolescent adjustment and, in particular, achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431612450950">Demaray &amp; Malecki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431612450950">Malecki &amp; Elliott, 1999</xref>). Strong, positive associations have been consistently found between both parental and peer relationships with academic achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431612450950">Boon (2007)</xref> examined 879 Grade 8 to 10 Australian students’ grades in relation to parenting style. Participants’ report of higher levels of authoritative parenting, indicated by higher parental monitoring and warmth, predicted greater academic achievement by way of mastery of goals and self-efficacy. Furthermore, a meta-analysis conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431612450950">Hill and Tyson (2009)</xref> on over 50 studies showed a positive association between parental involvement and early adolescent academic achievement.</p>
<p>Research has also indicated that peer support can have a positive effect on school success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431612450950">Kurdek, Fine, and Sinclair (1995)</xref> found that sixth-grade students’ grade point average (GPA) was positively associated with peer norms supporting academic excellence, although this was only the case when there was higher family acceptance. A study of Mexican American youth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431612450950">Alva (1991)</xref> revealed that participants’ report of friends’ academic support and academic attitudes was a significant discriminator between participants with higher and lower grades. Indeed, relationships with peers have been found to be associated with achievement and school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431612450950">Ream &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431612450950">Troop-Gordon, Visconti, &amp; Kuntz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431612450950">Veronneau &amp; Dishion, 2011</xref>). In one study in New Zealand, using older peer mentors was more effective in supporting the transition to secondary school for Māori and Pasifika youth as compared to the NZ European counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431612450950">Noonan, Bullen, &amp; Farruggia, in press</xref>), highlighting the importance of examining the cultural context of support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman (1987)</xref> also suggested that social capital can occur outside of the family in the community and “exists in the interests, even the intrusiveness, of one adult in the activities of someone else’s child” (p. 36). These interests can take a variety of forms, such as enforcing norms of the parents or community, listening to problems, and working with youth groups. A growing body of research has examined the importance of nonparental adults in the lives of young people. One such group is that of VIPs, or very important nonparental adults (VIPs), who are people who adolescents nominate who are at least 19 years old, are a significant influence, and can be counted on in a time of need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612450950">Greenberger, Chen, &amp; Beam, 1998</xref>). VIPs are distinguished from extended family members (although there is overlap in these two groups) as the teens select their VIPs and do not select their extended family members. Furthermore, it is inherent to the definition that VIPs are available to the young people, but this is not the case for extended family.</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated, generally speaking, that VIPs are equally likely to be family members as not. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612450950">Greenberger and colleagues (1998)</xref> found that 52% of the women and 48% of the men in their study had a kin VIP. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431612450950">DuBois and Silverthorn (2005)</xref> found that only 40% of their sample of natural mentors was family members. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431612450950">Chen, Greenberger, Farruggia, Bush, and Dong (2003)</xref> found that Chinese adolescents were equally likely to select familial VIPs as were U.S. adolescents, whereas, within the United States, European American youth were less likely to select a kin VIP as compared to Latino, Asian, and African American adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431612450950">Chang, Greenberger, Chen, Heckhausen, &amp; Farruggia, 2010</xref>). As the nature of the adolescent-VIP relationship is relatively unexamined, including ethnic variations in those relationships, further investigation is warranted.</p>
<p>Of late, research has pointed to an association between the presence and characteristics of VIPs and academic performance among older adolescents in their final year of high school and in the transition to college/work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431612450950">Chang et al., 2010</xref>). Chang and colleagues found that youth with a VIP reported higher grades than those without a VIP, although both groups had similar educational expectations. Furthermore, they also found a positive association between VIP educational background and youths’ self-reported grades. Using a nationally representative sample, Erickson and colleagues found that having a natural mentor was associated with both greater academic achievement as indicated by school-reported GPA and increased educational attainment, particularly when the mentor was a teacher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431612450950">Erickson, McDonald, &amp; Elder, 2009</xref>). Among a high-risk sample, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431612450950">Farruggia’s (2006)</xref> study of older adolescents in foster care as they transitioned to adulthood found that good relationships with VIPs during the postemancipation period were associated with self-reported postemancipation educational success.</p>
<p>Research on adolescent development clearly demonstrates having VIPs in the youths’ lives is normative and contributes to well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam, Chen, &amp; Greenberger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431612450950">Blyth, Hill, &amp; Thiel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431612450950">Werner &amp; Smith, 1982</xref>). Furthermore, unlike formal mentoring relationships, these relationships did not typically develop as the result of difficulties in the youths’ lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>). Blyth and colleagues found that the majority of adolescents reported having at least one important nonrelated adult and one important adult extended family member. Others have indicted natural mentor presence can make a positive difference in the lives of adolescents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431612450950">DuBois &amp; Silverthorn, 2005</xref>). In Werner and Smith’s longitudinal study of children at high risk, participants who became well-adjusted adults, despite experiencing early family instability and poverty, had an important adult in their lives. Nonparental adults have further been shown to have a positive influence in assisting adolescents to focus on a brighter future and overcome adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431612450950">Garmezy, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431612450950">Rhodes, Spencer, Keller, &amp; Liang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431612450950">Werner &amp; Smith, 1982</xref>). The presence of a nonparental important adult has also been linked with reduced anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431612450950">Rhodes, Contreras, &amp; Mangelsdorf, 1994</xref>) and with better anger regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431612450950">Spencer, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, young people with fewer social resources appear to benefit the most with having a natural mentor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431612450950">Erickson et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Research indicates not only is the presence of the VIP important but also the quality of the adolescent-VIP relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612450950">Greenberger et al., 1998</xref>). Greenberger and colleagues demonstrated that the perceived mood and positive behavior of the VIP were predictive of adolescent depressive symptomatology. VIP warmth was marginally associated with depressive symptomatology for girls, but not for boys. VIPs’ perceived sanctions of and lack of involvement in health-compromising behaviors have also been reported to protect adolescents against problem behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431612450950">Farruggia &amp; Sorkin, 2009</xref>). VIPs have been identified as being of great importance to youth, particularly VIPs with whom the adolescent has frequent contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>), although associations between levels of contact with the VIP and the level of importance of the VIP and adolescent adjustment have largely been unexamined but is established in the formal mentoring literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431612450950">DuBois &amp; Neville, 1997</xref>). This high-quality VIP-adolescent relationship may be particularly important in the light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman’s (1987)</xref> work on social capital. The disadvantage resulting from the erosion of social capital in the home, which can have negative effects on school retention and success, may be protected against through the support of a VIP. Indeed, research has found that natural mentors are often role models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431612450950">Klaw, Rhodes, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2003</xref>) and provide guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431612450950">Zimmerman, Bingenheimer, &amp; Behrendt, 2005</xref>), and their relationships often gradually develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the positive associations between VIP presence and qualities and adolescent well-being, examining the relationship between VIPs and academic achievements remains an important area of study. Importantly, VIPs have previously been reported by adolescents as being more warm and accepting than parents and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431612450950">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431612450950">Farruggia, Greenberger, Chen, &amp; Heckhausen, 2006</xref>). The current study tests Coleman’s suggestion that nonparental adults can provide the needed support to be successful in school. It builds upon prior research by examining the unique contribution of VIP presence, including frequency of contact, importance, and warmth, to academic achievement among young New Zealand adolescents. Furthermore, it expands the research in this area by examining the influence of VIPs on unique cultural groups. New Zealand culture differs from that of the United States, where much of the research on VIPs and natural mentors has been conducted. For instance, Māori culture has a greater societal prominence as compared to indigenous peoples in the United States (e.g., New Zealand is considered a bicultural country with aspects of Māori culture integrated in daily life). For another example, other New Zealand ethnic minority groups typically have Pacific Island and Asian backgrounds as opposed to Latino or African backgrounds that are more common in the United States. New Zealand in general, and Māori and Pasifika peoples in particular, have a more collectivist orientation as compared to the United States. Therefore, this study aims to test the following hypotheses:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 313 young adolescents (50% female) enrolled at an intermediate school (similar to junior high school) in a low-income area in Auckland, New Zealand. As determined by the Ministry of Education, the school had a decile 3 ranking. (Decile ratings range from 1 to 10 with lower numbers reflecting lower SES of the students enrolled in the school; decile 1 to 3 schools are considered “low” decile.) The youth were 11- to 13-year-olds (<inline-formula id="inline-formula1-0272431612450950">

The ethnic makeup of the sample, reflecting the diversity of the area, was 30% Māori (indigenous people of New Zealand), 30% New Zealand European, 23% Pasifika (12% Samoan, 5% Cook Islander, 3% Tongan, 4% other Pacific Islander), 7% East/Southeast Asian, 7% Indian (including Fijian Indian), and 3% Other (dual ethnicity). Half of the students (50%) reported living with both parents and the remaining lived in a variety of household compositions: parents and other relations (13%), mother only (10%), mother and stepfather/partner (8%), mother and other relative (7%), or other (12%). Most students reported that at least one parent had completed high school (57%), with approximately one third having completed some tertiary education. The majority of parents, 70% of mothers and 87% of fathers, worked outside the home.</p>
<p>Of the 429 students enrolled in the school, 391 were present in their classrooms during the time of administration. Of those, 317 students (81%) had parental consent and participated in the study, which reflected 74% of the youth enrolled in the school. Four surveys were not included in the final sample due to inconsistent responses.</p>

<title>VIP</title>
<p>Participants were also asked to indicate whether they had an important adult in their lives who was not their parent, who has had a significant influence on them, and whom they felt they could count on in times of need, and if yes, how many. They then answered a series of questions about their most important VIP, including age, gender, ethnicity, level of education (1 = <italic>did not complete high school</italic>, 2 = <italic>completed high school</italic>, 3 = <italic>completed tertiary school</italic>), overall importance of VIP (1 = <italic>important</italic>, 2 = <italic>very important</italic>, 3 = <italic>truly key</italic>), frequency of contact (seeing or talking) with VIP (1 = <italic>a few times a year</italic>, 2 = <italic>once of twice a month</italic>, 3 = <italic>once or twice a week</italic>, 4 = <italic>nearly everyday</italic>), and relationship to them (e.g., grandparent, coach).</p>

<sec id="section7-0272431612450950">
<title>Warmth of relationships</title>
<p>Participants also reported on warmth and understanding of parents, peers, and VIPs. Warmth and understanding was measured using adaptations of the Parental, Peer and VIP Warmth and Acceptance Scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612450950">Greenberger et al., 1998</xref>), which assess the emotional quality of a relationship. The original scales had 11 items that made up one factor with the same structure across a variety of ethic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431612450950">Chen, Farruggia, Greenberger, &amp; Powers, 2002</xref>). The modified scales (reduced by three items each) have been found to be reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431612450950">Farruggia et al., 2006</xref>). Each scale used a 4-point Likert-type response option ranging from 1 = <italic>disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>agree</italic>. A sample item included, “I know that they will ‘be there’ for me if I need them.” The scales had acceptable reliability for all groups of people (parents α = .75, peers α = .78, VIP α = .74).</p>

<sec id="section8-0272431612450950">
<title>Academic achievement</title>
<p>Achievement in numeracy and literacy was assessed using three national standardized tests, including the following:</p>
<p>asTTle (Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning) is an assessment tool that was developed specifically for the New Zealand Ministry of Education to assess achievement in literacy and numeracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431612450950">Assessment Tools for Teaching and Learning, 2003</xref>). Numeracy scores in this study included algebra addition and subtraction, algebra multiplication and division, geometry, statistics, and overall numeracy. Scores for subscales are reported on a scale from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating relatively greater achievement. The overall score is generated using item response theory, again with higher scores indicating relatively greater achievement.</p>
<p>PAT (Progressive Achievement Tests) is a test primarily designed to help classroom teachers determine achievement levels of their students in reading comprehension and reading vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431612450950">Darr, McDowall, Ferral, Twist, &amp; Watson, 2008</xref>). This study used reading comprehension and vocabulary subtests. Scores are percentiles with higher numbers indicating relatively higher achievement.</p>
<p>STAR (Supplementary Test of Achievement in Reading) was used to provide a supplementary assessment in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431612450950">Elley, 2001</xref>). The current study used the word recognition, sentence comprehension, paragraph comprehension, vocabulary, language, and writing subtests. Total scores are converted to stanines ranging from 1 to 9 (9 reflecting over 96% correct and 1 reflecting less than 4% correct) and indicate how well each pupil achieved on the test in relation to others of their age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431612450950">Elley, 2001</xref>). In addition, a total overall score was used, which was the sum of all of the subscales.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Data were screened for outliers, skewness, and patterns of missing data. Significant results of these preliminary analyses are reported in the descriptions of the variables. For VIP variables, an outlier was detected for number of VIPs as a participant reported having 40 VIPs. As this was well beyond 3 standard deviations (3.25) above the mean (1.89), the value was changed to the next largest value of 13, which was within one of the cutoff. Most participants reported having at least one VIP (62%), with 1.80 VIPs (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.47) on average. The highest level of VIP education was 11% did not complete high school, 45% completed high school, and 44% completed tertiary study. Most VIPs were family members (79%) and were the same ethnicity (76%) as the youth. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431612450950">Table 1</xref> for a complete list of VIP characteristics.</p>

<p>As expected for recruiting from the entire school, there was a wide range of achievement as indicated by scores on the various standardized tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431612450950">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, PAT vocabulary had a positive skew, whereas many of the STAR scores, including word recognition, paragraph comprehension, vocabulary, language, writing, and the overall score had a negative skew. None of the asTTle scores were skewed.</p>

Although gender and ethnicity are categorical, they were included in these analyses so that they could be included in later regression analyses. Ethnicity was consistently associated with indicators of achievement, whereas gender and parental education were rarely associated with the indicators of achievement. In all instances, identification as Māori or Pasifika was associated with lower achievement scores compared to other students. Having a VIP significantly correlated with 11 of the 13 academic achievement variables, while number of VIPs, VIP education, overall importance of VIP, and frequency of contact with VIP showed few or no significant relationships. VIP warmth was significantly associated with all achievement variables, while parent and peer warmth each were associated with six (out of 13) variables and associations were quite small (all <italic>r’</italic>s &lt; .20).</p>

<p>Due to the large number of indicators of achievement and the similarity among them in their associations to the youths’ demographic variables, parental warmth, peer warmth, and VIP variables, data reduction was deemed appropriate. Using principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation (if required), each cluster of achievement scores (PAT, STAR, or asTTle) were individually assessed. For each group, one component was derived and all items were well above the minimum cutoff of .40. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0272431612450950">Table 4</xref> for a summary. Based on these results, overall scores for asTTle and STAR and a mean score for PAT were used in all further analyses.</p>

<p>Next, hierarchical regression analyses were run to determine whether VIP warmth made a unique contribution to the overall indicators of achievement; VIP importance and frequency of contact with VIPs were not included in these analyses as they proved to be nonsignificant at the correlational level. It should be noted that only youth who reported having a VIP (62% of the sample) were included in these analyses, as youth without a VIP did not complete the VIP warmth scale. Due to consistently significant associations at the correlational level, ethnicity was included. Hierarchical regression analyses were run on all achievement variables using the following steps: Step 1: ethnicity, Step 2: parental and peer warmth, and Step 3: VIP warmth (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0272431612450950">Table 5</xref>). VIP warmth was a significant predictor of all academic achievement indicators even when accounting for peer and parental warmth and ethnicity. Neither peer warmth nor parental warmth were significant at Step 3; ethnicity remained significant for all three sets of analyses.</p>

<p>In addition, the regression analyses were rerun substituting presence of VIP (yes or no) in Step 3 for VIP warmth so that all participants, not just those who have a VIP, could be included in the analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0272431612450950">Table 6</xref>). The results were somewhat similar. Parental and peers warmth were not significant at either Step 2 or Step 3 for any of the analyses and ethnicity remained significant in all three analyses. VIP presence was significant in all three analyses, although the Beta’s were smaller than they were for VIP warmth.</p>

<p>Finally, hierarchical regression analyses were run to see whether the VIP warmth regression effects varied as a function of ethnicity or kin status of the VIP. In addition, overall importance of VIP and frequency of contact with VIP were also tested to ensure that nonsignificant bivariate associations were not resulting from ethnicity and kin-status variables serving as suppressors. To conduct these analyses, interaction terms (VIP warmth, VIP importance, and VIP contact with ethnicity or kin status) were created and added to the regression equation as the final step. For VIP warmth, VIP importance, and VIP contact, none of the interactions with ethnicity or the interactions with kin status were significant for any of the three major indicators of achievement, all <italic>p’s</italic> &gt; .05 and all <italic>ΔR</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>’s</italic> &lt; .02. These nonsignificant findings indicated that the association between VIP warmth and achievement was not moderated by ethnicity or kin status and that VIP importance and frequency of contact with VIP remained nonsignificant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the association between VIP-adolescent relationships and adolescent academic achievement among low-income, ethnically diverse early adolescents in Auckland, New Zealand. One of the strengths of this study is that academic achievement is measured by standardized tests across a variety of numeracy and literacy domains that were reported by the students’ school. Most studies typically use self-report grades or school-report GPAs, which are subject to potential bias due to differential grading by teachers and inaccuracies of student self-report grades.</p>
<p>The results suggest that VIPs are important resources for youth at risk of low academic achievement. As found with other studies of older adolescents in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>), VIP relationships are normative for younger adolescents as most adolescents in this study (62%) report having at least one VIP. In addition, the quality of the adolescent-VIP relationship was better, on average, as compared to parents or peers, similar to findings from other studies of typical youth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431612450950">Beam et al., 2002</xref>) and at-risk youth (e.g., youth in foster care; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431612450950">Farruggia et al., 2006</xref>). While it is noteworthy that adolescents report greater warmth from VIPs as compared to parents or peers (another group that adolescents “select”), to some degree it is not unexpected given the commonalities between definitions of VIPs and warmth. That said, there was variability in the reported level of warmth as seen by the almost 0.5 point standard deviation on the 4-point scale.</p>
<p>A related issue was the relatively small correlation among the three sources of warmth, despite using the same measures and changing only the response target. By using the same measure, the association was likely due, in part, to common method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431612450950">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &amp; Podsakoff, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the parent-VIP correlation was particularly small, even though both represented the quality of relationships with adults in the adolescents’ lives. These small associations may indicate that all youth, even those who report lower-quality parental relationships, are able to develop a positive relationship with VIPs. As it is difficult to tell why the association is small, it warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Unlike other studies in which VIPs were typically kin half of the time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431612450950">Greenberger et al., 1998</xref>), VIPs for the adolescents in this study were most often family members (75%). Two noncompeting explanations for this difference are offered. First, the age of the participants for this study was lower as compared to other studies. Consequently, the youth in this study were likely to have a more limited social network from which to select their VIP, as they are unlikely to have the same level of autonomy experienced by older adolescents. Second, a large proportion of the participants were Māori and Pasifika, and most previous research was conducted in the United States, which is a different cultural context. Extended family affiliations are culturally important within both the Māori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431612450950">Metge, 1995</xref>) and Pasifika (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431612450950">Fa’alau, McCreaner, &amp; Watson, 2005</xref>) cultural contexts. In addition, family groupings within the Māori context and Pasifika context are often multigenerational and extend beyond the typical European nuclear family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431612450950">Ka’ai, Moorfield, Reilly, &amp; Mosley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431612450950">Pryor, 2006</xref>), suggesting regular access to a greater breadth of kin.</p>
<p>In all instances, VIP warmth was a better predictor of academic achievement as compared to peers or parents. This was found at both the correlational level and in the regression analyses that controlled for significant demographic variables and identified the unique contribution of the sources of support. This finding is particularly interesting as previous research has highlighted the importance of positive parent-child relationships for academic achievement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431612450950">Sirin &amp; Rogers-Sirin, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman (1987)</xref> noted that social capital within the community may counter the erosion in the home and that this provides the opportunity to talk about problems that young people may not be able to discuss with parents. It could be the case that the VIPs are filling an emotional gap, thus giving the youth the “room” to focus on education. In addition, it is important to note that youth select their VIPs but do not select their parents. It seems plausible that youth select VIPs who can support them in areas that their parents may not be able to (e.g., in the academic arena) but will only select those they enjoy being with. These results indicate that VIPs are an important resource, particularly for youth who are at risk of low achievement.</p>
<p>The stronger association with achievement of VIP warmth as compared to peer warmth was also interesting. Previous research on the influence of peers on achievement has clearly found an association (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431612450950">Veronneau &amp; Dishion, 2011</xref>). While influence can be both positive and negative, it has been suggested that the negative influence is often stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431612450950">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>). In their review of the literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431612450950">Brown and Larson (2009)</xref> suggest that the association between friendship quality and adjustment (academic and psychological) can be complex and, therefore, inconsistent. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431612450950">Burk and Laursen (2005)</xref> found that middle and early adolescents’ positive features of friendships were less clearly associated with adjustment when compared with negative perceptions, which were associated with lower GPA and poor psychological adjustment. It may be the case that aspects of a high-quality relationship, therefore, may be less influential.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the associations between frequency of contact with the VIP and level of importance with achievement were largely nonsignificant, despite them both being additional indicators of the quality of the relationship. In terms of the frequency of contact, it may be the case that more contact was needed during the establishment of the relationship, as seen with formal mentoring relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431612450950">Sipe, 1998</xref>), but not once the relationship was established, as is the case with VIPs. For level of importance, it may be the case that there was not enough variability in the level of importance, as all VIPs were important. Future research should explore these further.</p>
<p>Another surprising nonsignificant association was between VIP level of education and achievement. In a recent study by Chang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431612450950">Chang et al., 2010</xref>), VIP level of education was associated with educational expectations and grades. In the Chang study, the participants were transitioning out of high school, whereas in this study the participants were in intermediate school and, thus, several years younger. It is possible that the level of education of the VIP becomes more important when the adolescent becomes closer to making decisions about higher education.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the influence of interaction between VIP warmth and ethnicity on achievement was not significant. One explanation for this finding relates to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman’s (1987)</xref> suggestion that children living in poverty are least likely to have social and human capital in their families and communities. All of the youth in this sample, by virtue of attending a low decile school, were likely in “need” of the social capital that VIPs can provide. As poverty is a demonstrated mechanism for putting M<italic>ā</italic>ori and Pasifika at risk generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431612450950">Biddulph et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431612450950">Gilbert, 2005</xref>), this risk may be more uniform across all students within the context of a low-income school.</p>
<p>Despite that VIP level of education, frequency of contact with VIP, and importance of the VIP were not associated with achievement, these results do suggest, however, that all VIPs are not the same. While VIP presence was associated with higher achievement compared to not having a VIP, VIP warmth was both significant and had larger beta weights and more total variance explained. This suggests that the quality of the relationship with the VIP may be even more important than the mere presence of a VIP. It is this warmth that may serve as one of the mechanisms of how the relationship helps to promote achievement. Indeed, the resilience literature has identified the caregiver-child relationship as a key system that underlies adaptive processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431612450950">Masten, 2001</xref>). It may be the case that VIPs fit into that caregiver-child space. Relatedly, research on formal mentoring relationships highlights the importance of trust, closeness, and establishing a bond in the mentee-mentor relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431612450950">Herrera, Sipe, &amp; McClanahan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431612450950">Rhodes, Reddy, Roffman, &amp; Grossman, 2005</xref>), and mutuality, trust, and empathy as mechanisms through which development occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431612450950">Rhodes et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431612450950">Coleman (1987)</xref> suggested that relationships reflecting social capital can take the form of listening to problems, enforcing norms, and participating in activities. All of these characteristics reflect high-quality relationships that reflect “interest, even intrusiveness, of one adult in the activities of someone else’s child” (p. 36).</p>
<p>This study has three main limitations. The first is that the data are cross-sectional and, therefore, causal conclusions cannot be drawn. It is possible that more capable students are able to draw out positive qualities from those around them. However, given the low associations among the three type of warmth, this seems less likely. Future research should, however, look at the nature of the relationship over time to determine the direction of the association between VIP-adolescent relationship quality and adolescent academic achievement. Second, some important characteristics of VIPs and parents, such as level of education, are self-reported. Some participants were unaware of this information, causing them to be treated as missing data in the analyses. Third, although a large percentage of the students in the school participated in the study, it is likely that the sample may be positively biased as the most at-risk youth are less likely to be in school on a given day and are also less likely to have secured parental consent.</p>
<p>In conclusion, VIPs have been found to be an important resource for an at-risk sample of early adolescents. The quality of the VIP-adolescent relationship makes a unique contribution to academic achievement, beyond that of ethnicity and other significant demographic variables. Young people need to be encouraged to develop and maintain these informal relationships, as the benefits are potentially large. In addition, schools should recognize the importance of nonparental adults, not just parents, when making decisions about how to keep young people engaged and achieving.</p>
