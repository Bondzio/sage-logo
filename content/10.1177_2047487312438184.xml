<sec id="sec1-2047487312438184" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Physical activity is thought to confer benefits on mental health in older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2047487312438184">3</xref></sup> It has been shown that older adults who engage in regular physical activities are less likely to have depressive symptoms and are more optimistic than their less physically active peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312438184">4</xref></sup> Conversely, the combination of physical inactivity with depressive symptoms and low optimism increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with a history of myocardial infarction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2047487312438184">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2047487312438184">9</xref></sup> Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between physical activity and mental health is of particular importance in older patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2047487312438184">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several cross-sectional, population-based studies have shown an inverse association between physical activity and depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2047487312438184">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2047487312438184">15</xref></sup> However, the longitudinal relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms has been less extensively investigated and the results have been inconsistent. While some previous prospective studies found evidence of a predictive effect of physical inactivity on depressive symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312438184">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312438184">17</xref></sup> others did not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312438184">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2047487312438184">20</xref></sup> These inconsistencies may be explained by other factors, such as the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline being a stronger determinant for future depressive symptoms than physical inactivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2047487312438184">2</xref></sup> Only two studies have described an inverse longitudinal relationship between baseline physical activity and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling adults free of depressive symptoms at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312438184">16</xref></sup> However, both studies measured physical activity with a single self-reported global question, instead of a validated tool that incorporated a broad range of activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2047487312438184">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2047487312438184">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association between physical activity and depressive symptoms has been less well investigated in patients with cardiovascular disease. In a study of 189 patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction (MI), coronary bypass surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention, an inverse association was found between participation in exercise training and prevalence of depressive symptoms (a reduction of 40% of depressive symptoms in the intervention group). Furthermore, both exercise and depressive symptoms were longitudinally associated with survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2047487312438184">23</xref></sup> Similarly, in a recent study of 5888 ambulatory patients with CHD (defined as angina, previous MI or coronary revascularisation), an odds ratio of 3.4 was reported for the lowest physical activity group concerning their risk for depressive symptoms. Both studies found that physical inactivity and depressive symptoms were partly independent predictors of cardiovascular mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2047487312438184">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2047487312438184">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Physical activity has not only been related to the state-like depressive symptoms, but also to positive psychological traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2047487312438184">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2047487312438184"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2047487312438184">29</xref></sup> Dispositional optimism refers to one’s generalised positive expectations of the future.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2047487312438184">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2047487312438184">31</xref></sup> People with high dispositional optimism tend to expect good things rather than bad things to happen in the future. On the contrary, people with depressive symptoms incline to anticipate negative outcomes of life challenges and have the perception that these situations are unchangeable and uncontrollable. These perceptions of lack of control on a stressor are linked to learned helplessness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2047487312438184">32</xref></sup> The differences in the way that we see our future are thought to greatly influence our behaviour and our health. Dispositional optimism may protect against the development of depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2047487312438184">33</xref></sup> Furthermore, dispositional optimism reduces cardiovascular risk in community-dwelling elderly subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2047487312438184">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2047487312438184">34</xref></sup> It has been hypothesised that dispositional optimism reduces cardiovascular risk by influencing lifestyle, including physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312438184">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2047487312438184">35</xref></sup> In a study of 773 community-dwelling older men, higher optimism was strongly associated with higher levels of physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312438184">4</xref></sup> The longitudinal relationship between physical activity and optimism remains largely unexplored. Nevertheless, an observational study with a follow-up of only one week found a positive association between physical activity and positive affect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2047487312438184">36</xref></sup> an affective state that is related to optimism in the same way that depression is related to neuroticism.</p>
<p>In the present study, data from the Alpha Omega Trial (AOT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2047487312438184">37</xref></sup> were used to examine, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the potential associations of physical activity with depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism. We aimed to assess (a) whether physical activity was associated with depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism; (b) whether changes in physical activity were associated with changes in depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism (synchrony of change); and (c) to investigate the prospective association of baseline low physical activity with depressive symptoms and low optimism over time.</p>

<sec id="sec3-2047487312438184"><title>Study sample</title>
<p>Participants were recruited as part of the Alpha Omega Trial, a randomised, double-blind controlled trial that investigated the effects of n-3 fatty acids on relapse of cardiovascular disease in a sample of elderly subjects with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Post-MI patients were recruited by cardiologists from 32 hospitals between 2002 and 2006, and the date of final follow-up was 23 December 2009. Subjects were considered eligible for the trial if they were aged between 60 and 80 years, if they had a verified diagnosed MI up to 10 years before randomisation, were not cognitively impaired (MMSE score ≥22 points), and were willing to provide written informed consent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2047487312438184">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2047487312438184">38</xref></sup> These selection criteria resulted in a sample of 4837 eligible subjects who were subsequently randomised into the following four groups of administered n-3 fatty acids: a combination of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); alpha-linolenic acid (ALA); a combination of EPA, DHA and ALA; or placebo. Of the 4837 participants included in the initial sample, 765 completed baseline questionnaires on physical activity, depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism. During follow-up, 53 participants died, 14 participants refused further participation in the study and 31 participants had missing values on the covariates included in the present analysis. This resulted in a sample of 667 participants at the end of the follow-up. Of these participants, 67 had missing values on the covariates at the end of the follow-up. Thus, the final sample used for the present analysis comprised 600 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2047487312438184">Figure 1</xref>). The trial was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of South-West Holland and by the ethics committees of all participating hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

</sec>
<sec id="sec4-2047487312438184"><title>Physical activity</title>
<p>Physical activity was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), a validated brief self-reported questionnaire designed to measure the level of self-reported physical activity in individuals aged 65 years or older.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2047487312438184">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2047487312438184">40</xref></sup> This scale comprises 12 items regarding occupational, household and leisure activities during the week prior to the assessment. The total PASE score is calculated by multiplying duration of activity (hours per week) or participation in an activity (yes/no) by empirically derived weight, daily energy expenditures (metabolic equivalents of task – MET) and self-reported physical activity, and then summing the product for all 12 items. In our analyses, we also used the continuous measure of physical activity – MET hours per week. One MET is the equivalent to the rate of energy consumption of a person at rest (e.g. sitting quietly for 1 hour).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2047487312438184"><title>Psychometric assessment</title>
<p>Depressive symptoms at baseline and during follow-up were assessed with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The GDS-15 is a validated self-report instrument designed to assess depressive symptoms in older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2047487312438184">41</xref></sup> It is especially useful to measure depressive symptoms in older patients with cardiovascular disease, as it excludes somatic symptoms that might be related to physical illnesses rather than to depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2047487312438184">42</xref></sup> The total score ranges from 0 to 15 points, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. For the computation of the GDS-15 score, two missing items were allowed, being subsequently imput with the mean of the remaining items. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.77.</p>
<p>Dispositional optimism was assessed using the Life Orientation Test Revised (LOT–R). The LOT–R is a 10-item self-reported questionnaire with six items that yield an optimism score and four filler items.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2047487312438184">43</xref></sup> The scale includes three negatively stated items that require reversed coding before total score computation. Subjects were asked to express the extent of their agreement with each of the items, coding their responses on a 5-point Likert type scale. The LOT-R score ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating higher optimism levels. For the computation of the optimism scores, one missing item per subject was allowed, being subsequently imput with the mean of the remaining items. The Cronbach’s alpha was 0.57.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-2047487312438184"><title>Covariates</title>
<p>At baseline, data were collected on demographic factors, lifestyle, medical history, current health status and medication use. Information about the highest attained level of education was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status, with more than 11 years of education as the upper category. Marital status was divided into being married (or cohabiting) or not (unmarried, divorced, widowed). Smoking habits were categorised into never smoked, smoked in the past and current smoking. Alcohol use was categorised into no alcohol use, use of 1–13 alcohol units per week and use of more than 14 alcohol units per week. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the measured weight and height. Reported self-rated health was divided into excellent to good self-rated health and moderate to poor self-rated health. Treatment group represents the randomised groups that received one of the following interventions: administration of a combination of the n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA; administration of ALA; administration of a combination of ALA, EPA and DHA; or administration of placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2047487312438184">37</xref></sup> Cognitive function was measured with the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and was included in the multivariable analyses as a continuous variable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-2047487312438184"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Sociodemographic and baseline characteristics were summarised using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables were presented as proportions. Continuous data were presented as mean (standard deviation) or as median (interquartile ranges), when appropriate. If the criteria of normality were not met (i.e. depressive symptoms and physical activity), log-transformed values were used to improve their distributions.</p>
<p>Because the two observations (i.e. baseline and at 40 months) were not independent, multilevel regression analyses (linear mixed models) with an unstructured covariance matrix were used to investigate the cross-sectional associations of physical activity with depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism. Associations were first assessed in a crude model. Subsequently, we repeated the linear regression analyses adjusting first for age and gender (Model 1) and then additionally adjusting for education, marital status, smoking habits, alcohol use, body mass index, MMSE score, treatment group, diabetes mellitus, stroke at baseline and time since last MI (Model 2). Data are presented as standardised beta coefficients.</p>
<p>Linear regression analyses were used to analyse the temporal associations of absolute changes (i.e. delta) in physical activity with absolute changes in depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism scores in univariate and multivariable models, as described in the previous paragraph. Data are presented as standardised beta coefficients.</p>
<p>Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictive effect of physical activity and depressive symptoms in both in univariate and multivariable models. For this purpose, we separated the variables ‘physical activity’, ‘depressive symptoms’ and ‘low optimism’. Moderate and/or vigorous physical activity was defined as ‘physical activity lasting more than 30 minutes, during at least 5 days per week, with energy expenditure higher than 3 METs’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2047487312438184">44</xref></sup> Presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a score higher or equal to 4 points on the GDS-15. This cut-off has shown to have a specificity of 76% in a previous study of older persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2047487312438184">41</xref></sup> Low optimism was defined as a score lower than 12 points on the LOT-R. This cut-off has been less well investigated, but earlier studies of our group using the same sample showed that this cut-off represented 20% of the subjects with the lowest scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2047487312438184">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, we excluded from the analyses the subjects with depressive symptoms at baseline, as defined by a GDS score ≥4 points (<italic>n</italic> = 155, 25.8%) and low optimism at baseline, as defined by a LOT-R score &lt;12 points (<italic>n</italic> = 107, 17.8%).</p>
<p>All tests were two-tailed with p &lt; 0.05 denoting statistically significance. The software used was SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill, USA).</p>

The mean BMI was 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and more than one-fifth of the participants fulfilled the criterion of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The mean time since the previous MI was 3.9 years. After 40 months follow-up, there was a decrease in the number of married participants and a decrease in the number of subjects who reported drinking more than 14 alcohol units per week. There were 10 participants who initiated antidepressants during follow-up, whereas six participants stopped using antidepressants. No further changes were observed in sociodemographic or health characteristics after 40 months follow-up.

<p>Results from the analyses of the association between absolute changes in physical activity, on the one hand, with absolute changes in depressive symptoms and absolute changes in optimism scores, on the other hand, showed that physical activity changed in synchrony with depressive symptoms (adjusted beta = −0.155; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2047487312438184">Table 3</xref>). Thus, increases in physical activity were strongly associated with decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and vice versa. By contrast, no reciprocal relationship was found with dispositional optimism, particularly not after adjustment for relevant confounders in Model 2. These results are graphically presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2047487312438184">Figure 2C</xref>.</p>
<p>Results from the logistic regression analyses for both depressive symptoms and dispositional optimism are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2047487312438184">Table 4</xref>. Among the participants without depressive symptoms at baseline, participants who reported moderate and/or vigorous activity were not at a statistically significant lower risk of having depressive symptoms after 40 months follow-up compared to participants who reported no baseline physical activity. Similarly, in those participants without low optimism at baseline, no protective effect of baseline physical activity against low dispositional optimism at 40 months was found.

<sec id="sec11-2047487312438184" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study of older subjects with a history of MI showed that physical inactivity was cross-sectionally associated with depressive symptoms, but not with dispositional optimism. We found a reciprocal relationship between physical activity anddepressive symptoms, but not with dispositional optimism. Low physical activity at baseline did not, however, predict future depressive symptoms or low dispositional optimism.</p>
<p>A major strength of this study was its prospective longitudinal design and the use of a validated physical activity questionnaire (PASE) that allowed retrieval of detailed information on common leisure or household activities, which are very relevant in older subjects. Nevertheless, some limitations should be considered. Since physical activity was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire, it is possible that the information provided resulted in an overestimation and measurement error of actual physical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2047487312438184">46</xref></sup> Another limitation is that depressive symptoms were assessed using the GDS-15 instead of a structured interview. The GDS-15 is, however, a reliable instrument that specifically assesses depressive symptoms in older subjects with limited items considering somatic symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2047487312438184">41</xref></sup> which is particularly relevant in patients with somatic conditions because the symptoms could derive from these rather than depression.</p>
<p>Our finding of synchrony of change between physical activity and depressive symptoms is in line with the results of a recent study of older European community-dwelling subjects that found a reciprocal relationship between physical activity and depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2047487312438184">47</xref></sup> Both studies suggest a dynamic interplay between physical activity and depressive symptoms across time. In our study, however, less physical activity at baseline was not predictive of depressive symptoms at 40 months. The lack of a predictive effect of physical activity on depressive symptoms is in line with several population-based studies among older subjects, which found a cross-sectional, but no longitudinal, association between physical activity and depressive symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2047487312438184">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2047487312438184">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2047487312438184">48</xref></sup> However, our findings do not agree with some other prospective studies that found physical activity to predict depressive symptoms in subjects free of depressive symptoms at baseline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2047487312438184">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312438184">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2047487312438184">17</xref></sup> These inconsistencies could be due to the different questionnaires used to assess physical activity, differences in age, differences in prevalence rates of depressive symptoms or the inclusion of patients with a history of MI in our study while previous prospective studies were done in the general population.</p>
<p>Our finding of an inverse association between physical activity and depressive symptoms coincides with the results of other cross-sectional studies among patients with cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2047487312438184">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2047487312438184">24</xref></sup> A variety of biological and psychological mechanisms may explain the strong association between these phenomena. Physical activity may positively affect mood by increasing brain levels of monoamines and endorphins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2047487312438184">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2047487312438184">50</xref></sup> or by increasing cerebral blood flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2047487312438184">51</xref></sup> Physical activity may also influence depressive symptoms by improving self-esteem and providing a greater sense of self-mastery and autonomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2047487312438184">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2047487312438184">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, the social interaction derived from physical activity through sport participation and joining sports clubs may provide social support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2047487312438184">54</xref></sup> Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there is a direct causal relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms, a likely explanation is that physical activity and depressive symptoms affect each other in the short term only.</p>
<p>Our study showed a non-significant cross-sectional association between physical activity and dispositional optimism after adjustment for confounders, while an earlier cross-sectional study found that physical activity was associated with dispositional optimism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2047487312438184">4</xref></sup> This discrepancy may be explained by the adjustment for extra covariates (e.g. MMSE score) and the composition of the used sample (i.e. male vs mixed sample or general population vs patients with a history of MI). To our knowledge, no previous studies have analysed the longitudinal associations between physical activity and dispositional optimism. However, a longitudinal study on the relationship between physical activity and hopelessness (defined as negative expectancies of the future) did not find that physical activity had a protective effect on hopelessness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2047487312438184">55</xref></sup> Similarly, results from our longitudinal analyses showed no protective effect of baseline physical activity against low optimism at 40 months follow-up, suggesting that dispositional optimism is a stable personality trait that is not affected by changes in physical activity.</p>
<p>Our findings are of clinical relevance to patients with cardiovascular disease, since both low physical activity and poor mental wellbeing are important risk factors for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2047487312438184">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2047487312438184">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2047487312438184">56</xref></sup> Rehabilitation programmes in patients with cardiovascular disease and depressive symptoms have only yielded modest improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2047487312438184">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2047487312438184"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2047487312438184">59</xref></sup> Therefore, cardiovascular patients with concomitant depressive symptoms may benefit from combined efforts to stimulate physical activity and reduce depressive symptoms (using pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy). Such interventions could be incorporated in collaborative care programmes for cardiovascular patients with depression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2047487312438184">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, this prospective study in patients with a history of MI showed that physical inactivity and depressive symptoms were strongly interrelated over time. Physical activity may therefore be an integral part of the syndrome of depression in cardiovascular patients. The question that needs to be explored is whether combined interventions aimed to increase physical activity and improve mental wellbeing are of clinical benefit not only to improve quality of life but also to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.</p>
