<abstract>
<p>Throughout the twentieth century, French intellectuals of the Right have been locked in a cycle of resentment and reaction against the intellectual Left whom they blame for repeatedly ostracizing them from the role of ‘intellectuel’. This resentment of a perceived exclusion has resulted in a recurring trope of left-wing cultural hegemony and right-wing marginalization that has come to define the individual and collective identities of the intellectual Right today. This process of perceived hegemony, resentment, and identity reconstruction is readily apparent in the work of right-wing intellectuals Ferdinand Brunetière, Ramon Fernandez, Drieu la Rochelle, Maurice Bardèche, and Alain de Benoist. When faced with perceived left-wing hegemony, these intellectuals reacted with resentment, revaluation of their designation as the excluded ‘other’, and retreat to self-segregated cultural communities. Over time, this process has both distinctly defined the intellectual Right and effectively radicalized and alienated it from mainstream intellectual life and the French public.</p>

<title/>
<p>Alain de Benoist wrote in 2003 that when the Nouvelle Droite first appeared in France in 1968, ‘no one claimed openly to be part of the Right’ since there was ‘a Left hegemony, quite evident within university circles and, generally speaking among intellectuals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0265691413478543">1</xref></sup> Today, he continued, this blatant hegemony of the Left has been replaced by a ‘quiet hegemony of former leftist intellectuals now more or less tied to the dominant political system … who extended their influence beyond universities to journals, publishing houses, and the media in general’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0265691413478543">2</xref></sup> There is, in this statement, an overwhelming note of bitter resentment against what Benoist saw as a metapolitical hegemony of the Left over the cultural and intellectual world. Although Benoist is not necessarily representative of the entire modern extreme Right, his struggle to define himself as an intellectual against what he perceived as a hegemonic Left is not an anomaly. Rather, it is emblematic of a century-long cycle of resentment, reaction, revaluation, and retreat into self-imposed isolation by a segment of the French intellectual milieu that believes its political opponents have effectively excluded it from the empowering status of the ‘intellectuel’.</p>
<p>Benoist’s resentment, therefore, is simply the latest incarnation of both a recurring trope of hegemony and exclusion and a revalued concept of identity and role, which extends back to the first division of the intellectual community during the Dreyfus Affair. In 1899, Jules Lemaître summarized the growing paranoia of his fellow anti-Dreyfusard intellectuals with language foreshadowing Benoist’s. ‘We are oppressed by a minority and by an evil-doing minority’, he declared.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0265691413478543">3</xref></sup> These republican thinkers, he continued, ‘who make us feel the yoke’, claimed to be ‘free-thinkers’.<disp-quote>
<p>What error! Hatred of men because they themselves … explain differently than we do the mystery of the universe … They have the mania of evoking the State … against those who do not think as they do … they are marvellously organized for domination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0265691413478543">4</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>These complaints by Benoist and Lemaître, divided by a century, reveal an enduring resentment of what the intellectual of the Right believed was his own cultural marginalization and ostracism at the hands of a hegemonic intellectual Left.</p>
<p>It is this previously unexplored resentment of a perceived ostracism, and the recurring cycle of reaction, revaluation, and retreat it inspired among right-wing intellectuals, that is the central focus of this article. Although varying in intensity and expression over time, the cycle of resentment to retreat followed certain stages during each period of intellectual engagement in French public affairs. First, the Right’s resentment of a perceived ostracism by the Left led to a reactionary effort to condemn the intellectual Left, reappropriate their identity as pariahs, and revalue their designation as ‘other’ as being more responsible or more French. Then, they would retreat into self-imposed isolation by segregating their socio-professional organizations and networks and differentiating their worldview from that of the mainstream. The process bears some resemblance to Nietzsche’s concept of <italic>ressentiment</italic> and slave morality, although essential components of a recognized inferiority and inability to create do not apply here.</p>
<p>This cycle of resentment, reaction, revaluation, and retreat can be traced over the century in the work of right-wing engagés Ferdinand Brunetière, Ramon Fernandez, Drieu la Rochelle, and Maurice Bardèche. As the century passed, the expression of resentment was progressively radicalized and the trope of hegemony and isolation was compounded as the Right propagated its own historical narrative of its ostracism. The cycle and trope would become so essential to the intellectual Right that it would help define their own sense of self, even when, as during the Occupation, they actually dominated the cultural field. Today, this resentment and perception of ostracism continues to inform the Right’s language, professional trajectories, and self-segregated communities, and can provide historians with new insight into the behaviour of the intellectual of the contemporary extreme Right.</p>
<p>In 1898, when Zola and Clemenceau first outlined the fundamental concept of the intellectual in the wake of the Dreyfus Affair, the men of letters on the anti-Dreyfusard Right intentionally excluded themselves from it. Throughout 1898, the Left gained increasing public influence by claiming that their education and understanding of universal truths qualified them to ‘engage’ and direct public opinion in all matters cultural, moral, and socio-political. By 1899, when the Right decided to engage, the Left had effectively dominated public perception of intellectual values, responsibilities, and identity. Its intellectuals reinforced their monopoly by instructing the public, as Jean Jaurès would, that ‘intellectuals of the Right have no right to the title of <italic>intellectuel</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0265691413478543">5</xref></sup> From this point on, the Right perceived itself decidedly, and no longer happily, as excluded from the public conceptualisation of the intellectual. This frustration with their exclusion indicates that, in reality, anti-Dreyfusard intellectuals actually shared with the Dreyfusard engagés an understanding of the responsibility of the intellectual to abandon the ivory tower, engage their cultural capital, and direct public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0265691413478543">6</xref></sup> Ironically, this unifying understanding of engagement, which continued to unite Left and Right engagés throughout the century, only served to exacerbate the perception of ostracism and exclusion, and radicalize the language of a Manichean divide, when the title and cultural outlets of ‘the intellectual’ were closed to the Right. So, it is during the aftermath of the Dreyfus Affair that the Right would begin its trope of hegemony and begin to identify as the excluded, ostracized, minority whose role was opposition to the mainstream intellectual and political world.</p>
<p>Resentment of this perceived exclusion from the intellectual field by a hegemonic Left would become one of the main themes in the work of the anti-Dreyfusard intellectuals. When, in January 1899, the Anti-Dreyfusard intellectuals created the Ligue de la Patrie, it was a reaction to, and a contestation of, this Dreyfusard dominance over the intellectual field. ‘The important thing’, founding member Maurice Barrès wrote of the Ligue, ‘is that one is no longer able to say that intelligence, and the intellectuals … are only on one side. … There is no longer anyone who is able to believe that all the intellectuals are partisans of Dreyfus or Picquart’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0265691413478543">7</xref></sup> With the creation of a Ligue, he continued, the intellectual Right would ‘no longer be a troop of sheep who bow to a squad of shepherds’ on the Left.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0265691413478543">8</xref></sup> The Ligue was a vehicle for presenting themselves to the public as an equally legitimate, equally authoritative intellectual alternative. ‘I was enthused’, one Ligue de la Patrie member wrote, ‘by the response which had opposed the new Ligue to the exorbitant pretensions of the pseudo-intellectuals who imposed on their fellow citizens their convictions of the innocence of Dreyfus and their hatred of the military institution’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0265691413478543">9</xref></sup> Charles Maurras even praised the progress of the Ligue, saying, ‘Do not forget that the Anti-Dreyfusard people have been governed for three years by more or less avowed Dreyfusards’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0265691413478543">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it was Ferdinand Brunetière and his protégée René Doumic who most plaintively condemned what they perceived as the Left’s hegemony over intellectual life. Brunetière was a respected Academician, literary critic, professor at the École Normale Supérieure (ENS), director of the prestigious <italic>Revue des Deux Mondes</italic>, defender of Catholicism and the military, and author of <italic>Après le Procès</italic>, one of the most recognized denunciations of Dreyfusard engagement. After being accused in the pro-Dreyfusard <italic>Le Siècle</italic> of having a ‘moral defect’, of ‘working for the great power of darkness’, and of penning an essay that was ‘truly dishonoring for a man of thought’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0265691413478543">11</xref></sup> Brunetière’s work took on a distinctly resentful tone, and the unwarranted hegemony of the intellectual Left became his central theme. In his letters to <italic>Siècle</italic>, he wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>We differ in opinion on an essential point and instead of responding to my reasons with your reasons … you try to persuade the readers of <italic>Siècle</italic> that if I do not share your opinion it is because I have secret motives. One is not able to be of good faith if one does not think as you do! One is not able then to desire truth or justice but only politics! By what right do you say this? What is this method of erecting yourself, you and yours, as the sole representatives of Truth, Justice, Probity?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0265691413478543">12</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In particular, Brunetière fumed against the Dreyfusard attempt to claim that all those who rejected the French Revolution and its principles were anti-intellectual and therefore could not represent France or intelligence. In these letters, Brunetière unleashed his most virulent statement of resentment against this Dreyfusard hegemony. ‘By what right do you confound the ‘religion of the Revolution’ with France?’, he wrote, and went on to say:<disp-quote>
<p>Ah yes, I know it well! You alone are France and you alone represent it! Whoever is not with <italic>Le Siècle</italic> or the Republic of which you compose the ministry is not French, would not know how to be French … for you treat him like an ‘émigré à l’interieur’ … Suffer, Monsieur, that we feel and think in a different way! We are French like you and we have been so for a long time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0265691413478543">13</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>He continued with a claim to equal intellectual legitimacy despite his anti-Republicanism and opposition to 1789:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]e are able to judge the Revolution and if several of its consequences appear harmful to us, we believe we are doing the work of good Frenchmen in combating it or correcting it or in ameliorating it. We do not imagine it to hold the monopoly on Truth and Justice but we do not prevent you from believing it … We have the right, we maintain it, to think that which we want, we have the right to say it, and we will use it. And you, you have the right to contradict us, but not to distort us, to travesty or demean our intentions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0265691413478543">14</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Brunetière was outraged that by claiming the title of intellectuals, the Dreyfusards dominated the role of socio-political guide for society. ‘That which the free thinkers do not pardon the Church for having done in the past’, he wrote in his prestigious <italic>Revue des Deux Mondes</italic>, ‘is precisely what they have done. They have made all government action serve the propaganda of a philosophical doctrine. Whoever does not think as they do is excommunicated; they chase him from the Republic, they denounce him as loathsome to all “republicans”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0265691413478543">15</xref></sup> The Dreyfusards, by proclaiming themselves the only intellectuals, had convinced the public that they alone spoke for French intelligence and Brunetière resented this. As a founding member of the Ligue de la Patrie, Brunetière would claim intellectual identity for the anti-Dreyfusards. In an interview about the formation of the Ligue, Brunetière explained, ‘Several of my friends and I have been wearied and irritated by hearing it said that all the men of study and thought, the intellectuals, were on the same side. This was not true and we prove it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0265691413478543">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, Brunetière resented what he saw as the ostracism of the intellectual Right from the French education establishment. Again, ironically, it was the shared understanding of the intellectual’s role as educator that made both Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards eager to secure it for their side, resulting in the exclusion of the Right and the perceived hegemony of the Left. ‘Today we hear’, Brunetière wrote of this exclusion, ‘that we are not permitted the liberty of thinking as we please, but that this right to have ideas contrary to theirs can only be exercised behind closed doors’. Teaching, as the most effective way to propagate intellectual values, was expressly forbidden to the Anti-Dreyfusards. In truth, Brunetière wrote, they were not prevented from teaching, ‘we are only forbidden to have students’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0265691413478543">17</xref></sup> Had Brunetière not already been convinced that the Dreyfusards exercised hegemony over French education, his own exclusion from the teaching field would convince him of it. After having been invited to present himself for the chair of French language and literature at the College de France as the nominee of the Academy, a campaign was launched against him in the Dreyfusard press. <italic>L’Aurore</italic> claimed that those who wanted to block the candidacy of Brunetière, who they disparaged as the ‘eminent anti-intellectual’, would form an alliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0265691413478543">18</xref></sup> The campaign proved effective and Brunetière was forced to withdraw his candidacy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0265691413478543">19</xref></sup> Also, during the reorganization of the Sorbonne, Brunetière would be the only professor not incorporated into the Sorbonne from the ENS. Even the protégés of Brunetière were prevented from holding professorships. When René Doumic applied to the ENS, he was told,<disp-quote>
<p>[S]ince it is a chair at the ENS, yes, your political opinions will put you aside. Rightly or wrongly, you have been classified and you are not classified as a republican … never would the current ministers welcome a candidate to the École presented by Brunetière.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0265691413478543">20</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Doumic admitted that as a prominent anti-Dreyfusard he had foreseen this ostracism, but continued, ‘I do not see without regret all the doors to higher education close before me’.</p>
<p>While reacting against the Dreyfusard Left and denouncing anti-Dreyfusard exclusion from the University, Brunetière was also working to reappropriate the designation as ‘other’ and revalue it as more representative of French intelligence. ‘Our adversaries will accuse us of backward political thinking and reactionary intentions’, he wrote.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0265691413478543">21</xref></sup> But, in instances like this one, he argued, ‘reaction ought to be considered synonymous with progress and liberty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0265691413478543">22</xref></sup> In his polemical exchange with Alphonse Darlu, who had accused Brunetière of being anti-intellectual for ‘considering the practical consequences rather than the truth of opinions’, Brunetière again reappropriated the intended condemnation and revalued practical realism as the more responsible ideal for ‘true’ intellectuals. He explained that he continued to believe that ‘the practical consequences of ideas are of some importance’ and that, in fact, ‘the defect of intellectuals in general is precisely that of not regarding the practical consequences of the truths or the so-called truths which they announce’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0265691413478543">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Brunetière and the anti-Dreyfusards began to reappropriate their exclusion and revalue as more representative of true, responsible French intellectuals, those qualities ‘othered’ as anti-intellectual by the Left, they began to also construct a new, intentionally segregated intellectual world around these revalued concepts. Denied positions in the University, the anti-Dreyfusards tended toward a heavier reliance on the professional trajectory of journalism and literature. In particular, they sought out journal teams of like-minded, Anti-Dreyfusard peers and mentors such as those at <italic>Gaulois</italic>, <italic>La Presse</italic>, <italic>Gil Blas</italic>, <italic>Libre Parole</italic>, <italic>L’Intransigeant</italic>, <italic>La Patrie</italic>, <italic>L’Écho de Paris</italic>, <italic>Le Journal</italic>, <italic>Figaro</italic>, <italic>Petit Journal</italic>, <italic>L’Éclair</italic>, and Brunetière’s <italic>Revue des Deux Mondes</italic>. They also crafted new networks of mentorship and socio-professional support outside the confines of the university, like those of the fledgling Action Française and the mentorships created by the Ligue. Lecture tours sponsored by the Ligue replaced the instruction of youth through the university, and speeches were published by the Ligue press in the Ligue bulletin, <italic>Annales</italic>, for those who could not attend. Lectures by Coppée and Lemaître reinforced the new trope of an ‘oppression by an evil minority’ who claimed a ‘monopoly’ on engagement. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0265691413478543">24</xref></sup> In the Ligue’s fifth conference entitled ‘Où Sont Les Intellectuels?’, for example, Doumic continued Brunetière’s complaint that the Dreyfusards had titled themselves ‘les intellectuels’ and excluded from this role all who disagreed with them. ‘These men had been friends and peers of ours’, he continued, but,<disp-quote>
<p>suddenly they appeared to us transformed. … We held them for men of open and tolerant minds, but they now consider that all those who were not of their opinion were men without heart, that they alone had the monopoly on humanity, piety, and generally all of the beautiful sentiments, while we were, we others, the partisans of injustice and barbarism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0265691413478543">25</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Other politically segregated communities were developed in reaction to the perceived exclusion, including Ligue-sponsored banquets, the Dames de la Patrie Française, cafés like Copée and Voltaire ‘where one does not admit Dreyfusards’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0265691413478543">26</xref></sup> and salons like those of Mme Aubernon where ‘the Dreyfusard artists no longer showed themselves’ after the Affair.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0265691413478543">27</xref></sup> Such ideologically isolated communities were essential in reinforcing the perception of alienation and the trope of hegemony among new generations of right-wing intellectuals. Barrès romanticized this self-segregation of the intellectual world as one of innate affinity saying, ‘It is not a matter of intelligence: whatever their [Dreyfusard intellectuals] rapidity of mind, whatever their alertness, they are not able to sense things as we do. A shared instinct, a shared physiology has grouped us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0265691413478543">28</xref></sup> And, he was clearly suggesting, this psychology and sense of things that had brought the anti-Dreyfusard intellectuals together in this community had also isolated them, at the most fundamental nature of their intellectual identity, from the Dreyfusards.</p>
<p>By the 1930s, the advent of European fascist movements and the rise of left-wing coalitions, like the Popular Front, had created yet another rift in the intellectual community and another call for engagement. On the Right, intellectuals were uneasy about the increasing attraction of the PCF for intellectuals and the infusion of communism into French affairs under the guise of anti-fascism, especially after 1932, when the Comintern decided to woo the intellectual milieu. On the Left, intellectuals feared that the new right-wing generation, who had distanced themselves from the passivity of the Action Française, would see fascism, particularly a native variant that they themselves constructed, as a viable alternative. The Right’s perception of its repression and alienation from intellectual life had radicalized to include not only their role in the universities, but also the entire field of cultural and political expression which they saw as controlled by the Popular Front and communist sympathizing intellectual organizations like the Association des Écrivains et Artistes révolutionnaires (AEAR). In the 1930s, the intellectual Right sought to combat the hegemony of these left-wing organizations by congregating in literary circles like the Cercle Fustel de Coulanges, coteries like the Jeune Droite, and fascist-leaning parties like the Parti Populaire Français (PPF) of Jacques Doriot. One of these PPF intellectuals, Ramon Fernandez, made reaction against the perceived hegemony of the Popular Front intellectuals his own journalistic crusade.</p>
<p>Fernandez had initially been a leftist journalist and professor, he was not only an AEAR supporter but also a member of the Socialist Party (SFIO). Yet by the 1930s, he would disavow communism, become fascinated with foreign and native variants of ‘socialisme fasciste’, and disassociate himself from the Left in favour of identification as an intellectual of the Right and a PPF spokesman. In the PPF, Fernandez found a haven and a platform for his resentment of the Left’s monopoly over the title and role of the intellectual. His articles in the PPF organ <italic>Emancipation Nationale</italic> were laced with denunciations of left-wing hegemony and efforts to claim the role of the intellectual for the Right. In one of his clearest attempts to explain this hegemony, Fernandez wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>The complaisance of the men of the Left does not cease to astonish me. They do not claim only to have an opinion, which is their right, but they claim to have THE opinion, that which is not their right. They not only claim to have intelligence, which is possible after all, they claim to have THE intelligence, the only, the unique intelligence.</p></disp-quote>In short, he concluded ‘these adversaries of monopolies have the monopoly on genius. These enemies of trusts make a trust of all the human qualities. Such, at least, is their pretension. But they are far from accurate’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0265691413478543">29</xref></sup> In a line reminiscent of Brunetière’s 1899 declaration, Fernandez wrote, ‘that which is more serious still is that many foreigners currently imagine that French intelligence is entirely on the side of the Popular Front’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0265691413478543">30</xref></sup> This international perception of the intellectual was a coup for the Left that Fernandez angrily attributed to ‘the unpardonable act of brainwashing’ by the Popular Front thinkers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0265691413478543">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>As he adamantly reacted to the Left’s hegemony over intelligence, Fernandez simultaneously attempted to revalue, as more indicative of true intellectual responsibility, the fascist label that was used to discredit the Right. ‘These gentlemen have invented a prefascism’ which they accuse all their opposition on the Right of displaying’, he explained. In truth, Fernandez believed that the label of fascist and prefascist helped those on the Left justify their refusal to enter into a debate of ideas that they might lose. ‘Behind the proposal of ‘anti-fascism, one senses a great fear of thinking, of creating’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0265691413478543">32</xref></sup> in short, a refusal to fulfil the responsibilities of an intellectual, he explained. Instead of engaging the intellectuals of the Right and debating their ideas, the intellectuals of the communist Left chose to reject and ostracize them. ‘M. Langevin is a great savant, M. Maurras a great mind, M. Montherlant a stylist of great value, here are the facts’, Fernandez wrote as an example. ‘Here now is what the communist tactic draws from the facts: Langevin is with us therefore he is a genius. Maurras is against us therefore he is an idiot and naturally a fascist.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0265691413478543">33</xref></sup> Returning once again to the recurring trope of the Right, he wrote of the monopoly on thought and alienation, ‘These intellectuals do not attempt at all to <italic>be</italic> right, they simply give ‘right’ to themselves’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0265691413478543">34</xref></sup> This, he concluded, was the epitome of an abusive intellectual hegemony and an abdication of intellectuals’ responsibility to debate ideas.</p>
<p>To counter this hegemony, Fernandez would spearhead the PPF’s creation of the Cercles Populaires Français (CPF), whose purpose was to provide the intellectual Right with an alternative intellectual community: socio-professional networks, mentoring opportunities for the youth and a space for intellectual expression where they could retreat when their traditional spaces were refused to them. In an article on the Second Congress of the PPF, Fernandez spoke of this new network and defiantly touted the elite calibre of those intellectuals who would join its ranks. ‘I pronounce myself here as an intellectual’, he began, explaining that Doriot had given him the task of ‘representing the intellectuals’ for the PPF and of organizing its intellectual community.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0265691413478543">35</xref></sup> ‘I have observed’, he continued, ‘the quality, the cultural value of the intellectuals who have come to us’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0265691413478543">36</xref></sup> Later, he would write, ‘very few weeks pass where I do not find in the register some eminent name’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0265691413478543">37</xref></sup> This claim to elite membership and Academicians, like that made by anti-Dreyfusards about the Ligue de la Patrie’s Academicians, was yet another attempt to revalue the alienated intellectuals of the CPF as the most appropriate and respected authorities for French culture.</p>
<p>Although the CPF cannot be seen as a right-wing AEAR, Fernandez wanted the intellectuals of the Right to have an outlet for the dissemination of their ideas and values like the Left’s Maisons de Culture. This outlet would necessarily be self-segregated from the Left’s and radically opposed to them in its ideas and engagements. ‘In short’, he continued in explaining the CPF’s purpose, ‘we want, as in the communist maisons de culture, to inculcate in them [members] our faith and our dynamism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0265691413478543">38</xref></sup> He summarized the CPF’s purpose, saying, ‘it is to put a stop to the conquest of the intellectuals by the communist party that we have created the Cercles populaires. We want to inculcate in the intellectuals the true sense of French politics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0265691413478543">39</xref></sup> The CPF, therefore, provided not only an alternative socio-professional space, but also a platform for the trope of hegemonic ‘conquest’ and a revaluation of the Right as representing ‘the true sense’ of France. One PPF intellectual wrote of the need for the CPF to revalue the public’s concept of the Right, ‘In the AEAR organ <italic>Commune</italic>, it is explained that the nationalist Right is not interested in questions of education, laboratories, artists and writers’. The CPF would serve as an arm to end this ‘intellectual propaganda’ and reveal that, although they had been marginalized and excluded from the public audience, the intellectual Right retained its cultural priorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0265691413478543">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>In keeping with their perception, compounded since the Affair, that the Right was marginalized in the universities, the CPF provided an alternative for right-wing mentorship and public education. In its meetings and lectures, PPF intellectuals spoke to fellow writers, students, members of the liberal professions and the working-class members who attended.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0265691413478543">41</xref></sup> Topics varied from discussions of poetry and cinema, to the more politically engaged issues of the new Germany, African colonialism, Salazar’s Portugal, and National Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0265691413478543">42</xref></sup> Fernandez also sought to extend opportunities for the intellectual Right in the literary world, which had become the primary professional trajectory for those who perceived themselves as ostracized by the university. He and others like Henri Massis, Pierre Gaxotte, and Jean Prévost constructed networks of literary mentors and patrons for the ‘right-wing students who, by not taking provincial teaching positions like those of the Left, worked their way through these networks’ until they had gained prominence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0265691413478543">43</xref></sup> Statistically, the intellectuals of the Right tended to enter the literary and journalistic world earlier and in greater numbers than their Leftist and Centrist peers and it became their primary way of life and engagement, while journalism served as a supplementary form of political engagement for many on the Left.</p>
<p>Fernandez would clearly attempt to reassign the moral value, and more importantly the identity of the intellectual, previously attributed to the <italic>universitaire</italic>, to the <italic>littérateur</italic> in his article ‘qu’est-ce qu’un intellectuel’. He gave the example of Popular Front <italic>universitaire</italic> Victor Basch who, he wrote, ‘would be totally unknown except to a few students’ had he not joined in the Front’s efforts. ‘On the Left’, Fernandez explained, ‘one becomes an intellectual not by the good works that one puts on the literary market but by the oral protestations that confer an unmerited dignity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0265691413478543">44</xref></sup> In contrast, he continued, the intellectual of the Right earned his authority and legitimacy by producing intelligent pieces of journalism and literary works of high calibre. It was the support of the Popular Front, according to Fernandez, that gave the <italic>universitaires</italic> of the Left their unmerited public exposure. Exclusion from the university, in Fernandez’s revaluation, rather than denoting a lack of intellectual ability, actually signified the true intellectuals.</p>
<p>Therefore, he continued, it was essential to maintain publishing houses dedicated only to promoting the writers of the Right. ‘The bolshevik publishing houses’, he argued, ‘gradually institute a veritable dictatorship over thought’. And the intellectuals of the Republic, if they did not welcome it, were unable to see its infiltration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0265691413478543">45</xref></sup> It was the responsibility of the established intellectuals on the Right to isolate and insulate their own cultural outlets, whether literary circle, mentorship, publishing house, revue team, or a large organisation like the CPF from such infiltration. Fernandez, therefore, called upon his fellow intellectuals of the Right to segregate themselves and their cultural outlets from the ‘intellectual agents of Moscow’, who were ‘penetrating the French salons’ by constructing a veritable ‘maginot line before its infiltration’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0265691413478543">46</xref></sup> Even these few lines on journalism and publishing reveal once again the interconnected cycle of paranoia of hegemony and alienation, reaction against the Left, revaluation of right-wing qualities, and self-segregation of intellectual communities.</p>
<p>By 1940, the German occupation of Northern France and the institution of Vichy in the South had catapulted fascist sympathizing intellectuals on the Right to positions of cultural power in the universities and unrivalled dominance in journalism and publishing, while reducing the Left to clandestine engagement. Yet, identifying with the oppressed minority had become such a self-defining experience for the intellectuals of the Right that, although collaborators revelled in their new-found political dominance, they found it hard to discard the decades-old discourse and behaviour developed in response to perceived exclusion. Author and journalist Pierre Drieu la Rochelle was a former PPF member, proponent of fascist ideology and Franco-German rapprochement, and a right-wing eccentric, who, while hardly representative of the entire extreme Right, expressed quite well the feeling shared by many collaborationists that, despite their new positions of power, they still held no legitimacy with the public. He believed the French had been predisposed over the century to favour left-wing values and to view the extreme Right as anti-intellectual. For Drieu, the hegemony of republican ideals, communist influence, and the left-wing intellectual milieu had been so complete before 1940 that nothing short of a complete revolution in thought, not just personnel, could unseat it. He romanticized his personal experience of this hegemony, saying:<disp-quote>
<p>Ever since I returned from the other war, I had suffered censure. At times I didn’t even write the articles, I knew so well that they wouldn’t be published. Between 1920 and 1930 I was a sleepwalking journalist – I could not write during the day so I wrote in my sleep.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0265691413478543">47</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>He had had to use ‘intrigue’, he said, simply to break into the ‘enthroned’ journals like <italic>Nouvelle Revue Française</italic>. Once he had ‘broken in’, however, he felt excluded and unwanted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0265691413478543">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>He believed this dominance was not one of individual censors but of a broad public mindset that was now so engrained that it resulted in a type of public autocensure. ‘The France which had read Sorel, Barrès, Maurras, Péguy, Bernanos, Céline, Giono … was not strong enough to impose itself on the France which had read Anatole France, Duhamel, Giradoux, Mauriac, and Maurois’, Drieu complained. ‘What can one do with a people made morons by two centuries of rationalist and individualist teaching?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0265691413478543">49</xref></sup> Several times he noted that France ‘is entirely what its educators have made it’ and lamented the fact that these educators were the ‘pacifist and the antimilitarist, the atheist, and the petty socialist’ who had instilled their ‘sclerotic, rationalist values’ in the people from their youth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0265691413478543">50</xref></sup> The Left, he wrote, was ‘a little milieu full of arrogance and of self-importance which thinks it holds the monopoly on intelligence, on art, on everything’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0265691413478543">51</xref></sup> Against this monopoly, Drieu wrote, ‘I am on the alert, on the defensive against the dominant prejudice which is the prejudice of the Left, a prejudice accumulated in my nation for more than two centuries’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0265691413478543">52</xref></sup> And although ‘the majority of the French have made it a habit to always think and to feel in this direction’, Drieu believed that it was his duty, as an intellectual opposed to this dominant mindset, to reorient their thought towards fascism and collaboration. In this endeavour, he believed, he was in the intellectual minority, despite the opportunities for dominance that the Occupation provided.</p>
<p>By continuing to embrace the trope of the Right-wing scholar as a representative of the oppressed, vilified, and even martyr-like minority, despite the power that the Occupation provided for his views, Drieu continued to identify with the discourse of exclusion and isolation and see himself as the misunderstood prophet. In particular, he sought to reappropriate the identity of the oppositional intellectual and revalue the concept of a cultural minority. ‘I am always found in the opposition’, he wrote, ‘This is the proper place for the intellectual … there is always a majority among the intellectuals, I am content to always be against this majority’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0265691413478543">53</xref></sup> Drieu wrote that, far from seeing the Occupation as an opportunity to be part of the dominant majority, he felt he remained in this morally and intellectually superior minority by accepting collaborationism. ‘When I returned to Paris at the end of August 1940’, he explained, ‘I said to myself that I would never write in the Parisian press – they would detest me too much in my quarter. A month later I took an article to Châteaubriant – his solitude had attracted me. Never will men pardon us for this trait of non-conformism.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0265691413478543">54</xref></sup> He continued, ‘I came to Paris in 1940 fully determined to break with the vast majority of French opinion for a long time to come … despite my fears and my hesitations I forced myself to do what I thought was my duty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0265691413478543">55</xref></sup> By placing intellectual responsibility on the side of the collaborationists and claiming that it was they, rather than the resistance, who were pariahs during the Occupation years, Drieu was attempting to revalue the identity of the collaborationist as the morally superior prophetic martyr. The invisible hand of the intellectual Left, in his revalued perception of the Occupation, remained the hegemonic, culturally destructive, and anti-French power.</p>
<p>After the Liberation, although Gaullist intellectuals like Aron, Malraux, and Mauriac provided a counterpoint to the cultural and political dominance of the PCF intellectuals and Sartre’s <italic>Les Temps Modernes</italic>, the defeated collaborationist extreme Right was discredited as intellectuals. Maurice Bardèche, brother-in-law of Robert Brasillach, leading neo-fascist and negationist, partisan of French Algeria, and editor of <italic>Défense de l’Occident</italic>, would be one of the most vocal opponents of what he perceived to be an unwarranted exclusion from intellectual expression. His resentment of this ostracism, not only by the communist sympathizing Left, but also by the liberal Centre he believed was allied with it, was essential to his engagement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0265691413478543">56</xref></sup> In this post-war environment, right-wing intellectuals perceived another radicalization of their ostracism. Post-war exclusion was not merely embedded in the universities or in Popular Front political affairs, but subconsciously engrained in the entire public. It is Bardèche who most clearly foreshadows Benoist’s conceptualization of a Leftist metapolitical hegemony.</p>
<p>Throughout his post-war writings, Bardèche provided an intimate analysis of his own perception of exclusion in the intellectual world. Each line is tinged with his resentment of the Left for creating ‘a world of intellectual terrorism which excluded all discussion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0265691413478543">57</xref></sup> In his <italic>Souvenirs</italic>, Bardèche wrote of the years after the purge, ‘I do not know if I discovered immediately my isolation, my situation of foreigner within the nation of which I carried the name’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0265691413478543">58</xref></sup> His perspective on the Occupation, he continued ‘had installed me on a deserted island. In truth I was not alone there; I had companions. But I was alone with my companions against an apparent unanimity’ among the rest of the intellectual field.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0265691413478543">59</xref></sup> His resentment of his exclusion and isolation in this intellectual environment would taint all of his perceptions of French cultural life and instil in him a paranoia of intellectual persecution. ‘The purge’, he wrote later, ‘was the beginning of an enterprise of dispossession which … is still pursued at the moment when I write these lines’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0265691413478543">60</xref></sup> The intellectuals of the Right, he fumed, had been dispossessed of their positions in academia and journalism, of their authority in society, but most importantly, of their very identity as intellectuals by the hegemonic Left. ‘They condemn our truth’, Bardèche wrote resentfully, ‘they declare it radically false. They condemn our sentiment, our roots even, our most profound manner of seeing and feeling. They explain to us that our mind is not made as it should be; that we have the mind of a barbarian’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0265691413478543">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Bardèche would not base this sense of exclusion and condemnation on perception alone. He complained that when he failed to conform to the dominant worldview, the Left had literally excluded him from the title of ‘writer’ and intellectual, publicly labelling him instead, ‘écrivain sic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0265691413478543">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bardèche wrote that the purge was not simply a judicial punishment that allowed the accused to retain their own views, but rather a process for domination, control over important concepts like that of the intellectual, and re-education along left-wing lines. The purge not only eliminated opposition on the Right, it sought to substitute ‘one consciousness for another’, and impose an ‘obligatory vision of the past’ in order for the Left to legitimize its new position. In short, he wrote, it was a calculated attempt at ‘brainwashing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0265691413478543">63</xref></sup> This brainwashing of both the intellectual milieu and the general public followed the postulate that ‘whoever has not been a resistor has been a bad Frenchman’. And no one, Bardèche argued, was ‘free to think or deduce outside of this postulate’ if they wanted to be considered a legitimate thinker.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0265691413478543">64</xref></sup> From this postulate, Bardèche continued, in the eyes of the French public, all the intellectuals of the Right were made ‘exiles’ outside true French sensibilities and were therefore, by definition, incapable of being French intellectuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0265691413478543">65</xref></sup> ‘Nothing is expressly forbidden’, he explained, ‘but we are forewarned that a certain orientation is not good’. The required intellectual values were infused into the indoctrination of the youth, Bardèche wrote, as ‘one taught us to conjugate verbs “M. Mandel is a great patriot … M. Jean-Richard Bloch is a great writer. M. Benda is a thinker’ and inversely ‘I will never be a racist, I curse eternally the SS, Charles Maurras, and <italic>Je Suis Partout</italic>”’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0265691413478543">66</xref></sup> And what, he asked, of those who refuse these sympathies, whose minds ‘think through other categories?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0265691413478543">67</xref></sup> They are labelled intellectual heretics and unpatriotic Frenchmen and are forthwith excluded from authority or legitimacy. And the result, Bardèche assured his readers, was that the Left had ‘created a minority which, not seeing history through your glasses and not being able to see it thus, is condemned to permanent loss of citizenship … this vilified minority … has neither the means to express itself loyally by its journals nor the means to honestly designate representatives’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0265691413478543">68</xref></sup> In short, he raged, the intellectuals of the Left had made of the intellectual Right a class of ‘untouchables and children of untouchables … and created in the interior of the nation a heresy and its heretics’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0265691413478543">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was this ‘intellectual ostracism’, Bardèche argued, which made the hegemony of the Left such a frightening force in France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0265691413478543">70</xref></sup> The intellectual Left, he insisted in language reminiscent of Brunetière’s complaint, was carrying out a modern-day war of religion. This war of religion was not simply about tearing down the visible structures of the intellectual Right’s power during the Occupation, it was about ‘the installation of a certain optic which colours all things, not only politics but morals, habits, judgements which one makes, in a word, all of life … a certain manner of being’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0265691413478543">71</xref></sup> The Left was uprooting any of the images of man, society, and the moral universe that the Right valued. They had realized that it was not effective to carry out purge trials which made national martyrs of the victims. ‘Those who refuse to “be in line”’, Bardèche wrote, were not sent to Siberia, but they became ‘citizens of the second zone’.<disp-quote>
<p>One does not prevent them from speaking but one arranges it so that no one hears their voice. One does not prevent them from living, but one arranges that their lives be useless. … One does not persecute them but one ignores them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0265691413478543">72</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In this way, he assured readers, the intellectual Left did not need violence or physical exile to accomplish its religious cleansing. It simply proclaimed certain thinkers and values heretical and outside the boundaries of intellectual legitimacy and it eliminated the Right through silent extinction.</p>
<p>For this reason, he believed, the hegemony was particularly heinous in the press.<disp-quote>
<p>The resistors declared that since all the French newspapers had committed treason during the Occupation, they were now the masters of all the newspapers. So they took charge of all of them – and the presses too. Consequently absolutely all opinion, not only the mass media but the whole press was in their hands … there was sort of an intellectual <italic>coup d’état</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0265691413478543">73</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>During these post-war decades, Bardèche explained, the intellectual Right was not even able to protest the hegemony. ‘I did not have a journal through which to respond when it was affirmed in 200,000 copies that I had applauded the concentration camps’, he wrote angrily. ‘And I was not able to appeal to the judgement of the reader since he was prevented from reading my book himself’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0265691413478543">74</xref></sup> The press, because it excluded the Right, was just as much a reflection of the common front ‘System’ as the intellectuals themselves, Bardèche believed. ‘For ten years’, he complained, ‘no new daily was able to be founded to break the organized blockade around public opinion made by the new press … in the essential things, it is the same journal at the foundation of all we read’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0265691413478543">75</xref></sup> Because of this ‘unanimity’ in the intellectual world, Bardèche warned the public, ‘we live in the time of the brainwashed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0265691413478543">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>This overwhelming dominance of the Left made it essential, Bardèche and others believed, to construct a segregated right-wing community to protect and support its writers. These groups would remain small in size until the late 1960s, appearing less as a party or <italic>cercle</italic>, as one admirer wrote, than as a ‘resplendent family’ of right-wing intellectuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0265691413478543">77</xref></sup> Here, he continued, a young right-wing writer, excluded and marginalized in other intellectual communities, ‘walked into a group of young men seated around tables laughing’ and felt that he had been immediately made ‘a member of the family’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0265691413478543">78</xref></sup> A few journals such as <italic>La Table Ronde</italic>, <italic>Opera</italic>, <italic>Carrefour</italic>, and <italic>La Parisienne</italic> welcomed right-wing writers, but contributions had to remain strictly cultural, rather than socio-political, in tone. Other journals that addressed political themes, like <italic>Défense de l’Occident</italic>, <italic>Rivarol</italic>, and <italic>Écrits de Paris</italic> risked condemnation and confiscation of materials. Yet, these journals provided a haven, a literal retreat, for right-wing writers and became a space for mentoring relationships. <italic>Défense de l’Occident</italic> promoted the ideas of neo-fascism, neo-racism, and negationism, republished the works of collaborationists, opposed Sartre, communism, and the Gaullist Republic, and advocated French Algeria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0265691413478543">79</xref></sup> It would be a ‘training ground’ for the young intellectuals who would form the next generation of the extreme-Right like Jacques Benoist-Méchin, Paul Sérant, and Jean-Marie Le Pen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0265691413478543">80</xref></sup> Bardèche would also react against his alienation within France by emphasizing a transnational, ideological community of similarly ostracized intellectuals throughout Europe, and would use contributions to and circulation of <italic>Défense de l’Occident</italic> to forge these ties.</p>
<p>Even after the 1960s, these groups would remain radically alienated from mainstream socio-political ideals and would intentionally self-segregate their intellectuals, while still revaluing them as equal, if not superior, public authorities because of this very separation from the ‘brainwashed’ mainstream. ‘We have our intellectuals’, <italic>Défense de l’Occident</italic> boldly proclaimed in a statement strikingly reminiscent of Barrès’ original claim to the term.<disp-quote>
<p>The term used does not signify that we have writers, journalists, men of letters on our side; this is already evidenced. We want to say that the well known phenomenon exists equally in our ranks. We have our men who in writing doctrinal studies and political memoirs, can claim to give weight to them because they are <italic>intellectuals</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0265691413478543">81</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>More importantly, these neo-fascist intellectuals provided France with a ‘third force … a third vision of man and society which is proper to its own history’ and was more reflective of European culture and history than either American liberalism or Soviet communism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0265691413478543">82</xref></sup> Once again, the Right had reappropriated the status of the excluded outsider and revalued their ostracism as the morally superior, and more truly French, stance.</p>
<p>In 1968, Alain de Benoist and 39 other intellectuals, eventually described as part of the Nouvelle Droite (ND), separated from the ‘old Right’ positions of fascism and reactionary conservatism and created a new intellectual community, Groupement de recherche et d’études pour la civilisation européene (GRECE), to more effectively combat the hegemony of the Left over public opinion. Although Benoist has claimed to provide a third way and has adopted the language of the New Left including a ‘right to difference’ and anti-capitalism, his identification, he explains, is ‘of the Right … because the Left has a conception of the world that I do not share, of which I reject the essential postulates’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0265691413478543">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>Benoist has refined the century-long language of resentment that had culminated in Bardèche’s fears of a left-wing ‘optic’ to a more polished and philosophical concept of a metapolitical hegemony and public autocensure. Although Benoist incorporates much of the language and imagery of his predecessors, his conceptualization of the hegemony of the Left is of a process of control and exclusion that is more pervasive, more insidious, and less easily detected than previous right-wing thinkers had conceived. Benoist’s resentment was not a product of his exclusion from the university, from politics, or even from the cultural outlets for free expression. For Benoist, the control of the Left extended deeper than these symptoms in the structure, it had effectively saturated the superstructure.</p>
<p>‘For at least thirty years in France’, Benoist begins, ‘that which one calls by convention the Left and the extreme Left have never attained political power. By contrast, they have enjoyed a quasi-monopoly in the cultural domain. This is not contested by anybody’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0265691413478543">84</xref></sup> This hegemony of the Left over the cultural domain has allowed it to exclude any competing influences and to eliminate alternatives in intellectual values, political programmes, and even moral judgement. ‘This intelligentsia has had the actual direction of the general ideas and implicit values, and above all of the social myths of which the spirit of the time was nourished’, he writes, ‘it incarnated culture, knowledge, and the moral conscience’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0265691413478543">85</xref></sup> In short, Benoist writes, the intellectual Left has succeeded in making of its members the organic intellectuals envisioned by Gramsci. The metapolitical dominance of these intellectuals in the cultural field allowed them to steer leftward, unperceived by the public, the very fundamental values and belief structures of France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0265691413478543">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>This nationwide, pervasive encroachment on the public worldview, Benoist explained, was the subversive purpose of the Left’s cultural monopoly. The political progress of the Left was owed to ‘the general climate it had foreseen to create metapolitically and by relation to which its political discourse sounds more and more true’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0265691413478543">87</xref></sup> If a student did not have very strong reasons to reject this dominant ideological undertow, Benoist continued, it would be nearly impossible for him not to be ‘mentally affiliated’ with the liberal and Marxist worldview. This was because, he warned, the ideology of the Left ‘no longer forms a doctrine among others, it forms the very framework on which all constituted thought is inscribed’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0265691413478543">88</xref></sup> So engrained was the mentality of the Left, according to Benoist, that it required an act of conscious will on the part of the intellectual to even think outside the prescribed thought of the Left. ‘One speaks of repression’, he explained,<disp-quote>
<p>but it is not a gross political censure. Rather it is in the psychoanalytical sense; the perfect murder. The idea that one rejects spontaneously, which is unthought because it is effectively unthinkable in relation to the dominant ideology of the Left, the idea that one rejects without even having the sense of rejecting it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0265691413478543">89</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>This was the new totalitarianism of thought for Benoist: an autocensure so engrained and automatic that it was not even recognized.</p>
<p>And for those who, like Benoist, had broken out of the mental moulds created by the Left and recognized the hegemony, the struggle was not yet over. The metapolitical hegemony of the Left depended not only on saturation of the superstructure but also on its ability to prevent any oppositional thought from reaching the public. But, this was not the earlier, crude repression that made martyrs of the Right. Today, Benoist wrote, the objective of the Left is to eliminate the intellectual Right by denying its existence. The goal, he explained, is<disp-quote>
<p>above all not to give ‘them’ any publicity, to do things in a way that one does not know that ‘they’ exist. To travesty cultural discourse as political ambitions, to maintain at any price the image of a group of thinkers who have no thought, who are not able to have it, who ought not have it … exclusions, anathema, the final aim is to prevent debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0265691413478543">90</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>As his predecessors did before him, Benoist has embraced, and revalued as culturally superior, the designation as an outsider, a pariah, a non-intellectual. By refusing to debate the intellectuals of the Right as equals or even consider their ideas, Benoist explained, in language reminiscent of Fernandez, the left-wing intellectual was indicating that he feared the superiority of right-wing ideas and the popularity they would have if allowed public access. In Benoist’s revaluation of the Right’s ostracism, it is because of the recognized moral superiority and cultural authority of the Right that the Left has designated it ‘anti-intellectual’. ‘Today’, he concluded, ‘it is decreed that there are ideas which have no value as ideas, opinions which are not opinions but crimes – in the eyes of the dominant ideology. As always, it admits all opinions … except those which are not opinions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0265691413478543">91</xref></sup> To deny the status of thought or intellectual identity to the intellectuals of the Right, Benoist argued, was the ultimate form of ‘intellectual terrorism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0265691413478543">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>As it had done for the intellectual of the Right over the previous century, resentment of the hegemonic Left and perception of exclusion resulted in the revaluation and self-isolation of the ND and its intellectual community, GRECE. Like the right-wing communities that preceded it, GRECE was designed to foster its right-wing intellectual members in isolation and to educate the public in its alternative worldview. It is Benoist’s belief that ‘there are different ways of seeing the world and of being in the world, ways of the Right and ways of the Left, which encompass the pure knowledge, intuitive beliefs, emotions, implicit values, daily choices, artistic sentiments, etc.’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0265691413478543">93</xref></sup> The intellectuals of GRECE were quite certain that their ‘specific worldview’ elevated their cultural and intellectual pursuits above those of the intellectuals of the Left and therefore demanded separate cultural communities and outlets. Jean Varenne wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he cultural power … in France belonged to the Marxists and their following … It was necessary therefore to create a society of thought, that is to say an organism permitting the assembly of those who had the same vision of things in order to permit them to act more effectively. Thus was born GRECE … which gave itself the task of ideological formation of its members and the diffusion of a certain view of the world in the intellectual milieux.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0265691413478543">94</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>In GRECE, therefore, the ND has intended to create not only a ‘laboratory of ideas’, but also a community that can provide a place of sociability, a professional network, a mentoring process, an educational organ, and a platform for engagement in the ‘battle of ideas’. They provide ND with sympathetic journals, like <italic>Elements</italic> and <italic>Nouvelle École</italic>, publishing firms like Copernic and Labyrinthe that publish books ‘which do not situate themselves in the line of the dominant ideology’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0265691413478543">95</xref></sup> and a range of colloquia for students, lectures for the general public, organized vacations, a cinema club, and a summer Université Européene du GRECE for right-wing students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0265691413478543">96</xref></sup> One of GRECE’s founders, Jean-Claude Valla, would write, ‘GRECE was not to be a simple addition of individuals which would have in common only the signature of a membership pass but aspired rather to transform itself … into a true community’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0265691413478543">97</xref></sup> It is perhaps the closest that the intellectual Right has come to repeating the success of the Action Française phenomenon of the 1920s. Benoist and the ND are, therefore, the latest incarnation of a century-long right-wing trope of hegemony and exclusion by the Left and a reaction against this perceived exclusion that includes a revaluation of exclusion and retreat into the protective isolation of a self-segregated community.</p>
<p>From the Dreyfus Affair to the post-modern era, the intellectuals of the Right have perceived themselves to be ostracized from the political and intellectual life and leadership of France. Ever since the Dreyfusards claimed their opponents had no right to recognition as intellectuals, the Right has perceived itself to have been progressively excluded and alienated from the cultural world and from the role, essential to their sense of self, as ‘intellectuels’. This perceived exclusion has spawned resentment on the Right that has affected every aspect of their lives, including their very purpose for engaging. Unlike the Left, the Right believed it had a double mission: not only to sway opinion on a public issue, but also to counter the perception by the public that the Left spoke for the entire body of educated elites. It is not surprising that Brunetière’s 1899 claim that ‘not all the intellectuals were on one side’, was echoed by his successors as late as the 1963 reproach by Bardèche: ‘We have our intellectuals too’. Even the language and imagery used to express this perceived exclusion has a striking continuity throughout the century, whether it is the phrases ‘intellectual terrorism’ and ‘brainwashing’, or the image of the Left engaging in a religious war against heretics, or the idea of being a foreigner in one’s own country.</p>
<p>The intellectual Right’s reaction to this perceived exclusion has been one of resentment against the dominant Left, reappropriation and revaluation of their alienated identity, and a retreat to communities self-segregated, both ideologically and physically, from the mainstream. In a process somewhat akin to Nietzsche’s concept of <italic>ressentiment</italic> and the intentional revaluation of moral attributes, the Right internalized and reappropriated the Left’s language of exclusion, making it an admirable component of their self-identification as intellectuals. Bardèche painted himself as ‘a foreigner’ within the intellectual world, a member of the class of ‘untouchables’ and an intellectual ‘heretic’, yet believed his was the more righteous and ‘French’ stance in the post-war world. Fernandez disdained the intellectual merit of the <italic>universitaire</italic> in favour of the more predominantly right-wing role of <italic>littérateur</italic>. And Drieu identified with the hometown prophet speaking truth to a resistant crowd, but claimed that it was by earning the ‘detestation’ of the crowd, that he knew he was doing his duty. Unlike the intellectuals of the Left who often enjoyed a profitable relationship with the government, the university, and official thought, the intellectual of the Right believed himself excluded, as early as the Dreyfus Affair, from these relationships, and therefore began to take pride in identifying intellectual responsibility with resistance to and enlightenment of the recalcitrant, misled mainstream.</p>
<p>This reappropriation and revaluation was evidenced in the physical spaces and socio-professional networks of the intellectual Right as well. When they felt unwelcome in the cultural spaces they had once shared with the Left, they constructed new, alternative spaces, communities, and networks that they claimed to be more expressive of the true French intellectual. This has created a vicious cycle in which they sensed themselves excluded, reacted by differentiating and isolating themselves, and found themselves increasingly ostracized and alienated, thus compounding their resentment. Benoist has seen this cycle as strengthening the intellectual Right and providing a strong community from which to reassert its own worldview. He has proclaimed that ‘the historical significance of the New Right consists in having established a right-wing intellectual hegemony after a long tradition of left-wing liberal hegemony in France’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0265691413478543">98</xref></sup> It seems, however, that constructing individual and collective identities around this cycle of resentment, reaction and revaluation has adversely affected both the intellectual Right’s ability to communicate effectively with the mainstream public and to gain the intellectual legitimacy they so resent being denied. This cycle is by no means peculiar to the French and as more work is done on the transnational nature of right-wing movements like the Nouvelle Droite, this perception of hegemony, resentment, revaluation, and subsequent retreat into the ideological isolation of a shared worldview may prove an interesting link between French and other European movements who today create like-minded, pan-European intellectual communities that have similar incongruence with the mainstream.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0265691413478543">99</xref></sup></p>
