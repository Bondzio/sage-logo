<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Behçet’s disease (BD) is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem vasculitis of unknown etiology that may involve nearly any organ system. It differs from other types of immune-mediated systemic vasculitides in its propensity to affect small, medium, or large arteries and veins. BD was originally described by Hippocrates in the fifth century BCE, but it was brought to the attention of the medical world by a Turkish physician, Hulusi Behçet, in 1937.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811436339">1</xref></sup> It is a rare condition more commonly seen along the ancient Silk Road extending from Eastern Asia to the Mediterranean (especially prominent in Turkey, and Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and Far Eastern countries).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811436339">2</xref></sup> It is most common in Turkey (80 to 370 cases per 100 000) whereas the prevalence ranges from 13.5 to 20 per 100 000 in Japan, Korea, China, Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811436339">3</xref></sup> By comparison, the prevalence is from 0.2 to 6.7 per 100 000 in North American (Olmsted County, Minnesota) and Northern European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811436339">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811436339">5</xref></sup> In the United States, BD affects more men than women, typically in the third decade, but it may occur at any age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811436339">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initial manifestations in most patients are aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, and ocular inflammation. Aphthous ulcers, one of the most common presenting symptoms, are painful sores in the mouth, usually located on the inside of the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa. They can be single or in clusters and heal in 10 to 14 days but are recurrent. Ocular involvement may be in the form of anterior or posterior uveitis, leading to pain, erythema, hypopyon, decreased visual acuity, and floaters. This can develop early in the course of disease and is responsible for permanent vision loss in approximately 20% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811436339">6</xref></sup> Painful genital ulceration occurs in approximately 75% of patients. Similar in appearance to the oral ulcerations, they develop around the anus, vulva, and scrotum and generally lead to scar formation.</p>
<p>Other skin manifestations are commonly observed, varied, and can present as acneiform lesions, papulo-vesiculo-pustular eruptions, pseudofolliculitis, nodules, erythema nodosum (septal panniculitis), superficial thrombophlebitis, pyoderma gangrenosum-type lesions, erythema multiforme-like lesions, and palpable purpura.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811436339">7</xref></sup> Erythema nodosum in BD usually ulcerates, unlike other vasculitis, in which it heals without scar formation. Pustular skin lesions are often not sterile and may contain <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811436339">8</xref></sup> Skin lesions typically present on the legs or the upper torso.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811436339">6</xref></sup> They can also develop when the skin is scratched or pricked, which forms the basis for the pathergy test.</p>
<p>In addition to orogenital, ocular, and skin lesions, less common but potentially more severe manifestations of BD include involvement of the pulmonary, cardiac, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. Musculoskeletal involvement, leading to nonerosive arthritis, can occur in up to 50% of patients, leading to pain, effusion, and stiffness, usually affecting the large joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811436339">6</xref></sup> It ameliorates in a few weeks and does not cause any permanent damage. Symptomatic cardiac disease is uncommon in BD but may include pericarditis, myocarditis, coronary arteritis, atrial septal aneurysm, conduction system disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, endocarditis, endomyocardial fibrosis, mitral valve prolapse, and valvular insufficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811436339">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811436339">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811436339">10</xref></sup> Patients with BD may also suffer from constitutional symptoms, including fever, malaise, and weight loss.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A previously healthy 5-year-old boy was referred to us with a 10-day history of crampy abdominal pain and fever followed by bloody diarrhea and tenesmus. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen was negative. He denied any nausea, vomiting, chills, night sweats, nasal congestion, or cough. There was no history of ill contacts or earlier episodes of abdominal pain or bloody stools. He had a recent history of developing a vesicular rash, which was diagnosed as varicella zoster infection, despite having had 2 doses of varicella immunization. About the same time he had also developed redness in the eyes and was treated for conjunctivitis. He was diagnosed with colitis, admitted to an outside hospital, and symptomatic treatment was administered. He was subsequently discharged once his symptoms improved with a gastroenterological follow up. After he went home, however, his fever, abdominal pain, and bloody stools returned, and he was unable to tolerate oral feedings. His urine output also diminished. He was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation and treatment. His maximum daily temperature ranged between 100.8°F and 103.1°F. In the hospital he was started on empiric, parenteral antibiotics. Colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxin assays were performed and negative multiple times during the course of his illness. Multiple stool cultures, evaluations for ova and parasites, and studies for <italic>Strongyloides, Entamoeba</italic>, and rotavirus were negative.</p>
<p>Physical examination when evaluated by Infectious Diseases revealed a lethargic but arousable child. Vital signs were within normal limits although he had lost approximately 5 pounds during the course of his illness. A 2 cm, nodular, slightly hyperpigmented lesion was noted on the right medial lower leg. A similar nodular lesion with central necrosis and ulceration was present on the right upper extremity, just distal to the elbow (a punch biopsy was performed and was non-diagnostic). The conjunctivae were diffusely injected on the bulbar surface and he had photophobia. An ulcerated sore was noted on the left lower lip. Upper and lower gingival hypertrophy and copious oral secretions were present. Bilateral cervical and inguinal adenopathy was noted.</p>
<p>Laboratory studies included the following values: white blood cell count 27 600/mm<sup>3</sup> (82% neutrophils, 12% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, 0% eosinophils); hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL; platelets 684 000/mm<sup>3</sup>; sodium 134 mmol/L; potassium 4.1 mmol/L; chloride 99 mmol/L; bicarbonate 31 mmol/L; calcium 8 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen 5 mg/dL; creatinine 0.21 mg/dL; albumin 2.1 g/dL; C-reactive protein 213 mg/dL (reference range &lt;10 mg/dL); prothrombin time and international normalized ratio were elevated at 13.2 and 1.22, respectively; and serum hepatic transaminases were normal. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 2 white blood cells, 5 to 10 red blood cells, protein 17 mg/dL and glucose 71 g/dL. CSF culture was negative. Antistreptolysin O titer was positive; HIV antibody was nonreactive; Epstein–Barr virus serology was suggestive of past infection; and evaluation for influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus, and human metapneumovirus was negative.</p>
<p>A bone marrow biopsy was performed to exclude potential hematologic malignancy and was nondiagnostic. Computed tomographic scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and thorax were performed and demonstrated small bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis at the lung bases. There was rectal and colonic wall thickening involving the cecum, ascending, and descending colon which was progressive compared to the previous study. There was also an increased amount of pelvic free fluid.</p>
<p>He became less responsive and developed right-sided weakness of his arm, leg, and face. Neurologic exam indicated absence of speech. He answered questions by nodding yes or no. He denied having any headache or stomach ache. He was able to pick his name, age, colors, and name of the hospital from multiple choices. He could indicate pain by refusing to be pinched when asked. Cranial nerves II through XII where within normal limits. Extraocular movements were full without nystagmus. There was mild facial asymmetry and a decreased right labial fold. Sensory examination was intact, except position sense, as he had difficulty to identify if the toe was up or down. Motor examination revealed a right hemiparesis with virtually no movement of right arm or leg. Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the left upper extremity, 1+ in right upper extremity, and 1+ in the legs bilaterally with up-going right toe and down-going left toe. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed hemorrhagic lesions in the caudate bilaterally, a large hemorrhage in the left periventricular white matter and a pontine hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811436339">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811436339">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In BD, the 2 most frequently affected gastrointestinal sites are the ileocecal region and the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811436339">3</xref></sup> This can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hematochezia, making BD indistinguishable from pseudomembranous colitis due to <italic>C difficile</italic> intoxication, other infectious causes of dysentery or colitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811436339">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811436339"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811436339">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neurological manifestations occur in 23% of patients with BD in the United States. Typically, it takes approximately 4 to 5 years for central nervous system (CNS) symptoms to appear. Nevertheless, they may appear simultaneously with or even precede the nonneurological symptoms. Approximately 20% of patients with CNS Behçet’s can also be asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811436339">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811436339">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811436339">14</xref></sup> Neurological Behçet’s has been categorized as follows:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811436339">14</xref></sup> (<italic>a</italic>) Brainstem disturbances associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and skin eruptions; brainstem signs develop subacutely with evolving cranial neuropathies, ocular motor dysfunction, nystagmus, and gaze palsies, dysarthria, ataxia, and, occasionally, bulbar muscle weakness. Headache with meningismus was commonly noted; in these cases CSF pleocytosis and high protein content was observed. (<italic>b</italic>) Meningomyelitis, comprising meningitis with varying neurological signs, including spinal cord and hemisphere signs. (<italic>c</italic>) A confusional syndrome, in which there is meningoencephalitis without focal neurological signs, which can be in some instances chronic and progressive, resulting ultimately in the development of dementia, Parkinsonism, pseudobulbar palsy, and quadriparesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811436339">15</xref></sup> The clinical symptoms in CNS Behçet’s often follow a nonspecific and relapsing course.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811436339">15</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging is optimal to detect these CNS lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811436339">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811436339">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Histologic examination of a lesion reveals necrotizing leukocytoclastic obliterative perivasculitis and venous thrombosis with lymphocytic infiltration of capillaries, veins, and arteries of all sizes. In neurological Behçet’s, pathology reveals local perivenular lymphocytic cuffing, inflammatory cell infiltration, gliosis, necrosis, and neuronal loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811436339">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811436339">18</xref></sup> Mucocutaneous lesions demonstrate lymphocytic infiltration, immunoglobulin and complement deposition, with liquefaction–degeneration at the dermal–epidermal junction in association with necrosis and ulcer formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811436339">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The etiopathogenesis of BD is unknown, but it primarily depends on autoimmune vasculitis. There is an increase in the circulating T cells along with neutrophil hyperfunction and an increase in the CD8+/CD4+ ratio. HLA-B51 positivity is associated with increased risk and tissue location of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811436339">19</xref></sup> Other markers, such as HLA-B12, -DR7, and -DR2, are also associated. Though most cases are sporadic, familial occurrences with multiple affected members (familial clustering) have been reported, particularly in HLA-B51-positive cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811436339">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811436339">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811436339">20</xref></sup> The autoimmune activity may be triggered by either genetic or environmental factors (viral or bacterial infection, chemicals, or heavy metals). Proposed disease mechanisms in BD include the following<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811436339">21</xref></sup>:</p>

</list>
<p>Because of the rarity of BD and the considerable overlap of symptoms with other syndromes, diagnosis is very difficult. There are no laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. Thus, the diagnosis is largely based on thorough history and presence of typical clinical features. Several diagnostic criteria have been proposed to provide more objectivity. The first clinically relevant diagnostic test was the pathergy test, described in 1937. Older, widely used O’Duffy criteria required oral aphthae, plus at least 2 of the following: genital aphthae, synovitis, posterior uveitis, pathergy, or meningoencephalitis, and the absence of inflammatory bowel disease or other collagen vascular diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811436339">22</xref></sup> In 1990, guidelines were introduced by the International Study Group for Behçet’s Disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811436339">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>BD typically has a waxing and waning course, characterized by exacerbations and remissions. The disease appears to be more severe in young adults, males, and those of Middle Eastern or Far Eastern origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811436339">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811436339">23</xref></sup> Morbidity and mortality rates increase with CNS involvement. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are essential to reduce or prevent progression of neurological and ocular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811436339">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811436339">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current treatment focuses on symptomatic therapy, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. For disease confined to mucocutaneous regions (oral, genital, and ocular) corticosteroids are generally preferred. However, for severe or chronic mucosal involvement, high-dose corticosteroids in combination with immunosuppressive agents such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide are administered. Anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy has been found to be useful in uveitis (infliximab) and skin and mucosal symptoms (etanercept). As an alternative treatment, Interferon-α 2a has shown promise in genital and oral ulcer treatment. When used in combination with azathioprine, Interferon-α 2b and colchicine have been found beneficial in arthritis, genital ulcers, and erythema nodosum. Thalidomide has also shown potential in treatment of mucocutaneous lesions. Cyclosporine therapy may have value for treatment of severe ocular involvement in BD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811436339">21</xref></sup> but severe side effects may preclude its more widespread use. A recent study found that chlorambucil in combination with corticosteroids was efficacious in patients with meningoencephalitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811436339">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811436339">4</xref></sup></p>
