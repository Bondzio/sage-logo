<abstract>
<p>Engagement of older men with dementia in traditional activities in healthcare settings can be challenging. During the World Cup 2010, we used a football quiz to engage memory clinic attendees and gauge enthusiasm for a regular football reminiscence project. Based on reports from carers, all of the men who had previously been interested in football were stimulated by the activity and half of the male participants wished to continue a football-themed project beyond the trial period.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211429177" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is growing evidence of a discrepancy in help-seeking behaviours between the sexes and this is particularly true of mental illness: men are less likely to report or accept treatment for depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211429177">Addis and Mahalik, 2003</xref>). Among other things, this phenomenon has been attributed to stereotypical gender roles, in other words ‘traditional masculinity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211429177">Addis and Mahalik, 2003</xref>). A study by Cohen-Mansfield and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211429177">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010a</xref>) examined the use of different stimuli for engaging those with dementia. It found that women showed more attention and longer duration of engagement than men; they also showed more positive attitudes to the various stimuli presented. It has been suggested that people with dementia engage better with a stimulus that has some personal meaning to them, be that through previous employment, personal identity or gender-specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211429177">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010b</xref>). At present, however, very few stimuli are provided that specifically target men with dementia.</p>
<p>As a consequence, men with dementia present particular challenges for those who support them, both in terms of their willingness to seek help and their ability to engage with help when it becomes available. This is important because studies have shown that lack of stimulation in dementia patients has been linked to a decline in their physical health, functioning and it impacts their behaviour: verbal and physical agitation have been directly correlated with under-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211429177">Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2010a</xref>). Mental activity is also thought to play a protective role against cognitive decline. A recent study which aimed to engage and stimulate men with dementia has had promising results. The ‘football reminiscences project’ used football memorabilia as the subject of one-to-one or group discussions over a 12-month period. Participants were engaged and their memories stimulated and carers corroborated the success of the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211429177">Glasgow Caledonian University, 2010</xref>)</p>
<p>We ran a World Cup survey for patients and their carers in a memory clinic to gauge levels of interest and engage patients. The project ran for the duration of the World Cup Tournament 2010 in order to harness the excitement created by the media.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211429177"><title>Aims</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to establish whether our patients could be engaged by a football-based activity and whether they and their carers felt we should extend this project beyond the World Cup and set up a regular group with a football focus. We predicted that, as with the football reminiscences study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211429177">Glasgow Caledonian University, 2010</xref>), this activity would help to engage men using the service and stimulate their memories.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211429177" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>We created a questionnaire that comprised the following:
<list id="list1-1471301211429177" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a quiz with World Cup questions relevant to the era of our focus group;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a number of questions related to general interest in the World Cup and demand for an ongoing football-focus group;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a section for carers to give their opinions.</p></list-item>
</list>The questionnaire was distributed to all service users attending the Beechcroft Memory Clinic in Newbury for the 1-month duration of the World Cup Tournament 2010. Service users completed the questionnaire prior to their appointment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211429177" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>We received a total of 29 responses and from these we were able to determine some demographic information regarding our service users: 3/4 of our respondents were female (21) and the largest proportion of respondents were over 80 years old, as would be expected from a survey of people attending dementia clinics.</p>
<p>Twenty participants reported having watched matches and, of these, 70% found the World Cup exciting and enjoyed it. Eleven respondents remembered a match clearly and 10 remembered England’s World Cup win in 1966 most vividly.</p>
<p>We asked our respondents whether they would wish to continue a football-themed project beyond the World Cup. The results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211429177">Table 1</xref> and are divided into results for both sexes combined and then results for the sexes individually.

<p>We asked carers whether they felt that the World Cup Tournament had brought interest into the lives of the people they care for and whether those they care for had been interested in football in the past (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211429177">Table 2</xref>). Of those who had been interested in football in the past 87% were reportedly stimulated by the 2010 World Cup. The 13% who had been interested but were not stimulated by the current Tournament were all women. All of the men who had been interested in football in the past were objectively stimulated by the 2010 World Cup Tournament.

<sec id="sec5-1471301211429177"><title>Answers to open-ended questions</title>
<p>We asked participants to suggest ways that we could continue a football project beyond the World Cup; suggestions included an informal football discussion group, watching matches communally and forming a ‘Memory Clinic football team’.</p>
<p>Examples of memories from respondents included:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… watching the 1966 final with my brother … I was 11 and he was 16 …’</p>
<p>Man, 55 years old</p>
<p>‘England winning the World Cup in 1966 … watching a 12 inch black and white TV whilst on holiday in Folkestone’.</p>
<p>Woman, 76 years old</p>
<p>‘Ghana v USA 2010 … Ghana won! It was exciting to see a small African country beat the mighty USA!’</p>
<p>Woman, 88 years old</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211429177" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Approximately half of the men who took part in our survey felt that they would like to continue a football-based group beyond the World Cup: this finding confirms past research that elderly males are reticent to engage with groups. However, based on carer report, all of the men participating in the survey who had once been interested in football were stimulated and engaged by the 2010 World Cup Tournament. This highlights an obvious discrepancy between self and carer report.</p>
<p>This ‘quick and dirty’ survey has a number of confounders including small sample size, but broadly confirmed our hypothesis. The results would be more illuminating were we to replicate it with a larger sample of our focus group. It would also be interesting to include Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores in the data to see whether answers could be related to cognitive function and also to explore the relationship between cognitive function and the degree of engagement and stimulation of participants. It also lays the foundation for starting a local football reminiscence programme.</p>
