<p>A fiercely competitive spirit lives in our DNA. Since humans first walked upright, we competed for survival—fighting for food, shelter, and fire. Many of these life-or-death contests evolved into games with intense rivalries among individuals, villages, and eventually nations. The Greeks invented the Olympics nearly a millennium before the common era, and like today, politics and militarism reared their ugly heads. With a brazen military maneuver in foreign territory in 420 B.C.E., Sparta violated the Olympic Truce, which protected Greeks traveling to the Games, and was banned from participating. Sports and games are universal, and through these competitions, we realize on a smaller, simpler scale every aspect of the human condition. Civilization has long been about outthinking, outgaming one’s opponents. With their constant variety, the thrills of victory, and the agonies of defeat, sports and games help define the world.</p>
<p>This summer of the XXX Olympiad, <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> is exploring how sports and games transform society, assure our security, and tax our resources in every corner of our planet. So we begin with the Big Question, where international experts discuss how different sports have changed the places where they live. Peter Berlin, who’s reported on the past four Olympiads, and as sports editor of the <italic>International Herald Tribune,</italic> thought deeply about their meaning from his base in Paris, sets the scene with a tour d’horizon of Olympian dimensions. Our Map Room examines the geographic evolution of the ancient games of parcheesi and backgammon. From Gaza, a member of Surfing 4 Peace gives us an inside look at how surfboards are bringing Israelis and Palestinians together. Our Anatomy of a War Game turns to the RAND Corporation’s top war games designer, Bruce Bennett, to create a scenario involving nuclear weapons and the volatile Korean Peninsula. For our Conversation, <italic>World Policy Journal</italic> talks with Garry Kasparov, perhaps the greatest chess player ever and a once and possibly future Russian presidential candidate, about his game and the new political landscape of his native Russia. Finally, Rachel Will examines the Trojan horse the Chinese are bringing to developing nations who seem prepared to swap their natural patrimony for sports stadiums that too often decay when the cheering stops. </p>
<p>For our Portfolio, we turn to the extraordinary Chinese cartoonist and filmmaker, Wang Bo, known by the nom de plume Pi San—a creative genius who takes on the Chinese establishment, treading as close as possible to the line that separates freedom from prison. His newest effort “Little Rabbit Be Good” is an edgy, brilliant, and at times violent look at the melamine milk poisoning scandal and the repressive Chinese leadership. Highlighting Pi San’s contributions to speech, expression, and satire is Beijing-based journalist Brook Larmer. Istanbul-based Jenna Krajeski then takes us on a journey along the fraught Turkish-Syrian frontier into refugee camps and the secret caserns of Syria’s revolutionaries. Rebecca Stewart, meanwhile, explores the horrors inflicted on Afghanistan’s internal migrants—the forgotten people of this endless war. Cambodia, leader of the ASEAN block this year, is going through its own transition in its relations with its neighbors—literally giving itself away in the form of land grants, often to Vietnam and China, as Laura Murray investigates. Meanwhile, water is becoming an ever more reliable, and profitable, commodity in Cambodia, as Tom Brennan points out. Elmira Baysrali examines the rise of a new breed of entrepreneurs in some of the world’s most disadvantaged regions. And Ananya Vajpeyi traces the evolution of Hindi from its ancient roots to the Hinglish of today. Finally, in his Coda, <italic>World Policy Journal </italic>Editor David A. Andelman explores which countries are helping the 99 percent and which are only lining the pockets of the super wealthy. </p>
<p>Throughout this, the 50th anniversary year of our parent World Policy Institute, we will be exploring the institute’s five core themes—media and conflict, water scarcity, world financial risk, migration, and new security priorities in these pages, on our blog (www.worldpolicy.org), and through research, policy papers, network building, programs, and events—not the least being our main anniversary celebration, World Policy Around the Table, that took place to enormous acclaim on May 3, 2012. We invite readers to join us in rising to the challenges that these issues present to the world. </p>
