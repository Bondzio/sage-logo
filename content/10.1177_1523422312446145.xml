<title>The Problem.</title>
<p>Human resource development (HRD) in developing countries has scopes and applications beyond economic interests; it often involves addressing social issues. Furthermore, the continuing trend of population growth in the developing world, coupled with limited or unavailable resources and infrastructure, has created additional challenges. As a result, HRD practitioners in the developing world must become more innovative change agents.</p>

<sec id="section2-1523422312446145">
<title>The Solution.</title>
<p>This article introduces the concept of “social entrepreneurship” into HRD and urges HRD practitioners to partner with social entrepreneurs in their mission of promoting community and national development. Specifically, I draw details from four well-known case examples in two emerging economics—India and China—to demonstrate how social entrepreneurs have used HRD and organization development strategies to address societal problems in these two countries.</p>

<body>
<p>Developing countries encounter challenges in societal development, which developed countries often have not experienced. Not surprisingly, human resource development (HRD) in these countries has broader scopes and applications that extend beyond economic interests. It often involves addressing social issues such as poverty, illiteracy, health care, and unemployment. Furthermore, the continuing population growth in the developing world has created the additional challenge of providing lifelong opportunities for these economically disadvantaged groups. In developing countries, resources and infrastructure are usually limited or unavailable. Therefore, HRD strategies are likely oriented economically to the individual, community, and national levels. Two implications can be drawn here. First, HRD interventions that have proved successful in the developed countries may not be appropriate to the emerging world. As a result, developing countries have to seek innovative approaches to address their societal issues. Second, as HRD continues to expand its boundary and focus on community and national development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422312446145">Cho &amp; McLean, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422312446145">McLean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446145">McLean &amp; McLean, 2001</xref>), HRD practitioners should start to reposition themselves as change agents, seek external support, and form partnerships, which will empower them in their effort to promote social and national progress.</p>
<p>In developing countries, many initiatives have been launched for community and national development. HRD in nonprofit, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), whose mission is oriented for the public good, has become more important than ever. Methods originated in HRD, especially organization development (OD), have been increasingly applied to address community, country, or societal issues. This article aims to identify the applications of HRD in societal development by examining practices of “social entrepreneurship.” In other words, this article explores how social entrepreneurs address societal issues by using HRD, particularly OD principles and approaches. This research is based on two assertions. First, social entrepreneurship combines “the passion of a social mission with an image of businesslike discipline, innovation, and determination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446145">Dee, 1998</xref>) and, therefore, is well suited to the contemporary times when the global economic recession has created more social problems than ever. Second, social entrepreneurship shares the same mission and can be a potential partner of HRD in creating social and economic values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422312446145">Mair &amp; Marti, 2006</xref>) and fostering social progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446145">Townsend &amp; Hart, 2008</xref>). Findings of this research will benefit HRD practitioners and scholars, social entrepreneurs, business organizations, and local communities and policy makers as they continue their effort in addressing challenging societal issues and promoting social progress.</p>
<sec id="section4-1523422312446145" sec-type="methods">
<title>Research Method</title>
<p>To accomplish the goal of this research, I conducted a conceptual analysis, supplemented by case studies for the purpose of illustration. To allow an in-depth analysis and better understanding of social entrepreneurship in relation to HRD, I drew on four case examples in two emerging economies—India and the People’s Republic of China (China)—using three criteria. First, they are social enterprises where HRD/OD principles and techniques were applied for societal development and, therefore, have high relevance to HRD. Second, they are social enterprises focusing on addressing critical societal issues typically existing in the developing world (e.g., health care, poverty, and social injustice). Third, they are exemplary cases of successful social enterprises in India and China. A handful of cases fit into the above three criteria. To further narrow the number of cases for in-depth analysis, I consulted with two renowned social entrepreneurship researchers who are also active social entrepreneurs in India and China, Drs. Saras Sarasvathy and Warner Woodworth (personal communication, August 13, 2011). Based on their knowledge and personal experiences with social ventures in these two countries, we decided the four cases included in this article are, indeed, representative and provide deep insights into the application of HRD in social ventures. Information on each case was collected from the organizations’ websites and other public resources online.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the focus on India and China by no means suggests a generalization across all developing nations. However, such focus is purposeful and meaningful for three reasons. First, both countries, and particularly China, have been widely recognized as notable examples of economic growth. As these two nations are quickly emerging into super powers in the global economy, increasing attention has been given to understanding each country’s unique context (e.g., political, cultural, economic, business, and educational). Second, with an estimated combined population of 2.4 billion people, India and China represent the world’s largest consumer and producer markets and offer the world exciting business and investment opportunities. However, it is also the large population that has created the daunting task of developing human resources as these two economies grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422312446145">Alagaraja &amp; Wang, in press</xref>). In addition, given the historical and current transitioning national context, both India and China are facing numerous social problems, which can be barriers to their national development. It is critical for HRD practitioners to identify context-sensitive HRD/OD interventions that will facilitate societal progress.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is structured into three parts. The first part provides an overview of the concept of social entrepreneurship. The second part describes the four cases of social enterprises selected for this research. The third part discusses practical implications by offering lessons learned and identifying HRD/OD-based strategies used by the four social enterprises in their effort to address societal problems. The article concludes with implications for future HRD research.</p>

<title>Social Entrepreneurship: An Overview</title>
<p>Since it was first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446145">Waddock and Post (1991)</xref>, “social entrepreneurship” has become popular as a means to meet social and economic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422312446145">Townsend &amp; Hart, 2008</xref>). Social entrepreneurship has consistently attracted attention in areas ranging from business strategy, entrepreneurship, and public sector management, to community development and not-for-profit (NFP) sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446145">Weerawardena &amp; Sullivan, 2006</xref>). The increased interest in this discipline has been driven by such pressures as tighter funding and growing competition for donors and grants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446145">Weerawardena &amp; Sullivan, 2006</xref>). In response, NGOs are becoming more aggressive in their operations and more proactive in pursuing innovative ways of delivering quality and value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446145">Weerawardena &amp; Sullivan, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>As a focus of academic inquiry, social entrepreneurship has a relatively brief history. Over the years, it has remained a highly controversial and ill-defined concept. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422312446145">Leadbeater (1997)</xref>, this is in part due to the wide array of activities (e.g., economic, educational, research, welfare, social, and spiritual activities) engaged in by organizations in diverse contexts (e.g., the public sector, community organizations, social action organizations, and charities). As a result, multiple conceptualizations of social entrepreneurship coexist. For example, it has been associated with NFP organizations becoming for-profit or earned-income ventures, or anyone who starts a NFP organization, or business owners who integrate social responsibility into their operations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446145">Thompson (2002)</xref> clarified this notion by identifying social entrepreneurship as possibly occurring in three contexts: (a) profit-seeking businesses that demonstrated some commitment to doing good, (b) social enterprises established for a social purpose but operating as businesses, and (c) the voluntary or NFP sector. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422312446145">Thompson (2002)</xref> concluded that the main world of the social entrepreneur is the voluntary/NFP sector.</p>
<p>Because of the wide variations in defining “social entrepreneurship,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422312446145">Dee (1998)</xref> proposed to understand the notion by looking at the roles played by social entrepreneurs. According to Dee, social entrepreneurs act as change agents in the social sector by assuming five major responsibilities: (a) adopting a mission to create and sustain social (not just private) value; (b) recognizing and relentlessly pursuing new opportunities to serve that mission; (c) engaging in a process of continuous innovation, adaptation, and learning; (d) acting boldly without being confined by available resources; and (e) exhibiting a heightened sense of accountability to the constituencies served and for the outcomes created. By Dee’s definition, it is clear that social entrepreneurship consists of three key components: (a) a vision, (b) someone with leadership skills who can implement the vision, and (c) a will to build something that will grow and sustain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422312446145">Thompson, Alvy, &amp; Lees, 2000</xref>). In the same line of thinking, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446145">Martin and Osberg (2007)</xref> defined a social entrepreneur as someone
<disp-quote><p>who targets an unfortunate but stable equilibrium that causes the neglect, marginalization, or suffering of a segment of humanity; who brings to bear on this situation his or her inspiration, direct action, creativity, courage, and fortitude; and who aims for and ultimately affects the establishment of a new stable equilibrium that secures permanent benefit for the targeted group and society at large. (p. 39)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition to the different conceptualizations by scholars, social entrepreneurship has also been perceived differently in different domains. In the public domain, social entrepreneurship has mainly been conceptualized in terms of leadership qualities, including significant personal credibility, integrity, and ability to generate followers’ commitments to the creation of social (rather than merely economic) values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422312446145">Borins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446145">Waddock &amp; Post, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422312446145">Weerawardena and Sullivan (2006)</xref> argued that for social entrepreneurs to achieve social value creation, they must be innovative, proactive, and risk oriented. In the private domain, social entrepreneurship has been conceptualized in different contexts. For instance, in the community organization context, social entrepreneurship has been identified as playing a role in uplifting living conditions of the poor and underprivileged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422312446145">Cornwall, 1998</xref>) and facilitating community development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422312446145">Wallace, 1999</xref>). In a social action context, social entrepreneurship has been defined in terms of the catalytic leadership provided in areas of social concern and related public policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422312446145">Hibbert, Hogg, &amp; Quinn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422312446145">Waddock &amp; Post, 1991</xref>). Hands Across America, The Big Issue, and Partnership for a Drug-Free America are notable examples of this type of social enterprises.</p>
<p>In sum, despite the disagreements in conceptualizations of social entrepreneurship, the following two points are generally accepted. First, social entrepreneurs provide innovative or exceptional leadership in social enterprises. Second, social entrepreneurship succeeds when an organization achieves a sustainable competitive advantage and its social mission.</p>
<p>Social entrepreneurship and HRD share much in common in terms of core values and missions. Social entrepreneurs aim for value creation in the form of large-scale, transformational benefit that accrues either to a significant segment of society or to society at large. The value propositions that social entrepreneurs target are the underrepresented, neglected, or disadvantaged populations, which lack the financial means or political influence to achieve the transformative benefit on their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422312446145">Martin &amp; Osberg, 2007</xref>). These goals and value propositions are largely aligned with those of HRD as evidenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1523422312446145">McLean and McLean’s (2001)</xref> definition:
<disp-quote><p>HRD is “any process or activity that, either initially or over the longer-term, develops adults and their work based knowledge, expertise, productivity, and satisfaction. Such development can be for personal or group/team gain, or for the benefit at the level of an organization, community, nation, or, ultimately the whole humanity.” (p. 4)</p></disp-quote>

<title>Social Entrepreneurship in India and China: Case Examples</title>
<p>This section describes four exemplary cases of social entrepreneurship in India and China. These examples illustrate how social ventures have successfully addressed some prominent social problems identified in each country.</p>
<sec id="section7-1523422312446145">
<title>Case Example 1: Aravind Eye Hospital in India</title>
<p>Given the magnitude of blindness (12 million or one fourth of the world’s blind) and the multiple challenges faced in India (e.g., large population, low quality of health care, inadequate schooling, poor labor rights, and other social services issues in rural communities), the government alone cannot meet the health needs of all people. Realizing this predicament, Dr. Venkataswamy (known as Dr. V), the head of the Department of Ophthalmology at the Government Medical College in Madurai, India wanted to establish an alternate health care model that would supplement the efforts of the government and also be self-sufficient. Upon his retirement in 1976, Dr. V established the GOVEL Trust to initiate eye care work. Under this trust, the Aravind Eye Hospitals were founded with the mission of eliminating needless blindness in India. Since its inception, Aravind has provided free eye care and surgery to millions of needy patients apart from regular patients. For example, from April 2009 to March 2010, Aravind treated more than 2.5 million outpatients and performed more than 300,000 surgeries for poor Indians.</p>
<p>To fulfill its mission of eradicating blindness in India, Aravind adopted a unique business model. That is, the hospital runs two different kinds of hospitals: The main hospital and the free hospital. The main hospital functioned like a regular ophthalmology hospital where all admitted patients paid for the hospital’s services except a few complicated cases, which were brought over from the free hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The main hospital provided different classes of rooms (A, B, and C), offering different levels of privacy and facilities and, consequently, different prices. Treatments performed in the main hospital varied from simple treatments to extremely complex surgeries. The free hospital provided free eye treatment to economically disadvantaged Indians who accounted for nearly 70% of the total patients at Aravind. To be able to provide free surgeries to the poor while still earning profits, Aravind adopted two strategies: (a) keep its surgical equipment in operation 24 hr a day, which reduces the cost per surgery and (b) have doctors focus only on performing surgery, with nurses handling pre-op and post-op care; this increased doctors’ productivity.</p>
<p>Today, Aravind is the largest and most productive eye care facility in the world. It is a social organization committed to the goal of elimination of needless blindness through inexpensive and comprehensive eye care services. It is also an international institute for research and training for health-related and managerial personnel in the development and implementation of efficient and sustainable eye care programs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1523422312446145">
<title>Case Example 2: Lijjat Papad (Lijjat) in India</title>
<p>Lijjat is a unique cooperative organization and a women’s entrepreneurial success story in India. Started by seven illiterate and poor women on the terrace of a building in Girgaum in Mumbai in 1959, with a modest loan of Rs 80 (US$1.75), the cooperative grew its 1st-year revenues of Rs 6,196 (US$135) to Rs 3.1 billion (US$68.8 million) in the next four decades. More than 40,000 women became involved during its revolutionary growth. Today, Lijjat is a household name as producer of “papad” (India’s most popular crispy bread). What is more stunning than its stupendous success is its striking simplicity. After a woman (above 18 years of age) has signed the pledge form, which serves as her formal entry to Lijjat, she is considered as a sister-member. Every morning a group of women go to the Lijjat branch to knead dough, which is then collected by other women who “roll” it into papads. When these women come in to collect the dough, they also give in the previous day’s production, which is tested for quality. Another team packs the tested papads. Every member gets her share of the “rolling” charge every day for the work she does. Every job at Lijjat is given equal importance and the member sisters are free to choose the work they like.</p>
<p>Every branch is headed by a <italic>sanchalika</italic> (branch head), who is chosen from among the sister-members by consensus. Similarly, allotment of different tasks like dough making, distribution of dough, weighing and collection of papad, and packaging are also decided by the sister-members by consensus. The wage pattern is such that the same amount of work earns almost the same wages. If there is any loss, sister-members as the owners of Lijjat enterprise absorb this by taking less <italic>vanai</italic> charges. Similarly, profits are distributed among the sister-members as extra <italic>vanai</italic> charges at the discretion of the branch concerned. In any case, it is the collective responsibility of the sister-members to manage all branch activities efficiently and profitably. Besides production, the branch is also responsible for marketing its products in allotted areas. To maintain the high quality and standard of Lijjat products and uniformity in taste for the same product from different branches, the central office supplies the raw material—mung and urad flour—to all its branches. This is the only area in which the central office is involved in the entire production and marketing processes of the branch office.</p>
<p>Over the years, Lijjat has won several awards. The organization was recognized for its outstanding contribution to the uplift and welfare of socially, economically, and physically handicapped women. In 2002, The <italic>Economic Times</italic> Award for Women Entrepreneur of the year was awarded to President of Lijjat, Jyoti Naik.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422312446145">
<title>Case Example 3: Heifer China</title>
<p>The history of Heifer China can be traced to 1946 when Heifer Project International sent its first shipment of dairy cattle to China through the United Nations Relief Service. In 1989, Heifer International built its China Office in Chengdu, the capital city of Sichuan Province. With the mission of helping rural and poor communities alleviate hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation and be able to achieve a sustainable livelihood, the Heifer China Program focuses on creating viable communities, strengthening families, increasing dignity, promoting diversified and integrated farming systems, building local institutions, promoting and using the skills and resources of local people, and reducing urban migration. By 2010, Heifer China had launched 126 projects throughout the country and implemented rehabilitation projects for numerous natural disasters (e.g., Wenchuan Earthquake, snow disasters and landslides on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, rainstorm disaster in Sichuan Basin, and flood disaster along the Yangtze River). Over the years, Heifer China has been organizing technical forces to package the key technologies (e.g., domesticating introduced livestock, establishing a breeding system, feeding and management, artificial grass planting, use of crop stalk, and artificial insemination and disease control) to form a technical program being popularized in the remote, poor mountainous, plateau, and ethnic minority areas.</p>
<p>Heifer China values team spirit and adopts the “values-based holistic community development” approach. That is, prior to Heifer’s involvement in the community, the community members had to take the initiative to organize themselves into groups (called Self-Help Groups) with one representative from each participating family. The group usually consisted of 20 people to ensure each member of the group could fully participate in decision making and to ensure efficient delivery of services to the group. Then, together with the community (project partner), Heifer developed the holistic community development project with animal husbandry as an entry point. During the implementation of the project, the Self-Help Group held a participatory self-review and planning (RSPR) meeting, summarized the past 3 months’ activities, and formulated a plan for the next 3 months. This cycle led to a clearer vision and enhanced group capability. Furthermore, by strengthening and improving holistic development planning, the community members could seek various resources to satisfy other needs (e.g., education, sanitation, environment conservation, transportation, energy development, culture, gender equity, animal welfare, and community small corporation development).</p>
<p>Heifer China has brought hope, opportunity, and an improved quality of life to many needy families in the project areas. The affect of their projects is manifest on three levels. First, they have helped improve household incomes, nutrition, and environments. In addition, they have led to changes in values, attitudes, behavior, and social norms. Farmers can now face the difficulties and challenges in their lives positively, thanks to an effective self-help system. Finally, they have contributed to societal change as the government and other NGOs embrace the relevance of Heifer’s values and adopt Heifer’s model in their own projects and policy-making processes to help more poor communities realize self-reliance and sustainable development. It is Heifer China’s vision that by 2014, an additional 30,000 farm families from disadvantaged rural communities will be empowered through the activities and achievements of Self-Help Groups and values-based cooperatives.</p>

<sec id="section10-1523422312446145">
<title>Case Example 4: Plan China</title>
<p>Thirty-four million children in China live in poverty, mainly in rural Western China. Their health is at risk because they do not have sufficient access to quality community health services and because their parents lack sufficient awareness of hygiene, sanitation, and health care practices. Children are unable to obtain quality education that teaches them basic life skills. This is partially because of the widespread lack of teachers trained to focus on the needs of children. Poor children, especially the most vulnerable—including girls living in rural areas, orphans, children abandoned when their parents migrate, and disabled children—do not receive adequate care and protection. Plan China is an organization dedicated to achieving lasting improvements in the lives of deprived children by helping them realize their rights and lift them out of poverty. Plan China’s work revolves around five main program areas: (a) maternal and infant survival (improving the health of all children); (b) advocating for child rights (supporting and protecting children); (c) education for all children; (d) water and environmental sanitation; and (e) sustainable livelihood (generating opportunities for rural women and their families to earn adequate income to meet children’s needs).</p>
<p>Plan China is moving toward Child-Centered Community Development programming and focuses on children’s needs and rights and uses evidence-based advocacy to engage government policy and practice. Their School Improvement Program has effectively promoted child participation in school development planning at the provincial level and has linked this effort to replicable improvements in teacher training. A national partnership between Plan China and the State Council Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation has introduced a successful water and sanitation pilot scheme, which has enhanced hygiene awareness.</p>

<title>Lessons and Implications for HRD Practice</title>
<p>Each case above is a powerful example of how social ventures have contributed to solving societal problems in India and China. Discussed below are lessons drawn from their successes. Each lesson is also evidence of HRD/OD principles applied in social entrepreneurship and, therefore, has practical implications for NHRD.</p>
<list id="list1-1523422312446145" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Lesson 1—Start with a clear vision</italic>: Each organization included in this article was established with a clear vision: to eliminate needless blindness in India (Aravind); to provide self-employment opportunity to women (Lijjat); to help rural and poor communities alleviate hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation (Heifer); and to improve the life of deprived children (Plan China). It is these clear visions that have driven each organization to seek effective and innovative means to become successful. Dr. Venkataswamy has a clear vision of spreading Aravind’s 80/20 model to other parts of the developing world. Lijjat was devoted to help women avoid joblessness by founding an exclusive women’s organization, which produced a quality product in a non-competition-driven environment. Each organization had targeted prominent societal issues (poverty, health) and economically disadvantaged populations (the poor, women, children). Such noble missions are aligned with the broader social charge of HRD—to promote national development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lesson 2—Seek innovation, not just a solution</italic>: To address the large societal issues (e.g., poverty, health care) as the above four cases targeted requires not just solutions but innovative solutions. Aravind’s model of selectively charging fees based on ability to pay is reflective of an innovative business practice. The innovation employed by Lijjat is the self-employment opportunity provided to women. These women may work from their homes where help from other family members not only adds up to additional income but also makes work more enjoyable. At the workplace they are self-respecting, hardworking, and sisterly to one another. Furthermore, Lijjat is an experiment in the restoration of the essence of womanhood. It offers an alternative workplace where competition and stress associated with a male-dominated environment are significantly reduced. These innovative practices offer valuable lessons for HRD practitioners in their attempt to address workplace-related issues such as stress management, diversity, and social justice in the workplace.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lesson 3—Promote participatory management</italic>: All four organizations above, particularly Lijjat, Heifer and Plan China, are exemplary cases of teamwork and shared governance. Lijjat’s experiment in the realm of corporate governance stands out as one of a kind. In Lijjat, all the centers are autonomous; profits remain with the respective branches and are normally used to augment the business after a due share is distributed as an extra <italic>vanai</italic> charge to sister-members. Employees, including the chairperson herself, are in no way superior to sister-members. In Heifer, the use of the Self-Help Group allows farmers to remain the principle decision-making body. As a group, they help community members gain a greater sense of ownership—this is their project, not Heifer’s. Furthermore, the methods of participatory project planning, Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and Appreciate Inquiry (AI), enable Heifer to collaborate with the local project partner to determine the problems and needs of the community. Similarly, Plan China promotes a participatory approach to problem solving. For example, they involve villagers in managing water and sanitation programs and partner with local government service providers in tackling problems of poor community water supplies, sanitation, and environmental degradation. The various strategies implemented by these social ventures are empirical evidence of OD principles in practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lesson 4—Let values drive practice</italic>: In each of the four cases, corporate values play a critical role in their success. A representative example is Lijjat. The simple business process in Lijjat was made possible because the organization has been adhering to a set of core values for the past 40 years. These values include distributing profits evenly among all members, decentralization, a sense of self-dignity and respect, shared destiny, and an appreciation for people. With such strong beliefs, Lijjat has insured that every process runs smoothly, members earn a comfortable profit, agents get their due share, consumers get the assurance of quality at a good price, and society benefits from its donations to various causes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Lesson 5—Strive for long-term sustainability</italic>: The fact that each of the four organizations has endured the test of time may, in part, be explained by their strong emphasis on sustainability. The common strategies used by them to insure each initiative generates positive and broad social affect include providing education and training programs, sharing best practices, and forming partnerships with local communities and the government. For example, in Heifer China, the sustainability is addressed in three ways. The first way is passing on the gift; in other words, the original Self-Help Group helps organize a new one and offers them training on necessary skill and knowledge before they pass the new group animals and money as gifts. The second way is building the capacity of the Self-Help Group. This goal is accomplished by allowing the group to be the major decision maker in the process of project planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The third way is to provide farmers with training on environmental conservation, to help them understand the importance of the stability of the ecosystem. In this sense, the organization (e.g., Heifer) is playing an OD consultant role, that is, helping the client (farmers and local communities) develop learning capacities so that they can identify and deal with future problems on their own.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In sum, in addition to identifying and formulating innovative OD strategies, the success of these four organizations has another major practical implication, which is the importance of collaboration with multiple stakeholders. Social problems are often far more complicated than organizational issues with which HRD practitioners deal traditionally, and they often require the involvement of parties at multiple levels. To be effective in accomplishing the social mission, HRD practitioners must embrace the systems’ perspective and tackle social problems holistically. One of the strategies, as demonstrated by the four cases, is to let the stakeholders own the problem and involve them in every aspect of the change process. These stakeholders include central and local government agencies, policy makers, local communities, local business organizations, and the individuals directly affected by the change. HRD practitioners should remember their role as change drivers and process facilitators, rather than decision makers and problem solvers.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications for HRD Research</title>
<p>While the value of HRD/OD for societal development is still to be established, there is already ample evidence that HRD/OD concepts have been applied in developing countries for positively addressing societal issues. By taking a close look at the four selected cases in India and China, this article identified a number of HRD/OD-based approaches in the practice of social entrepreneurship. Such intersection not only reminds us of the multidisciplinary nature of HRD but also, more importantly, extends the value and utility of HRD beyond the organizational context. Therefore, it is hoped that HRD/OD practitioners will learn some important lessons, seek interdisciplinary partnerships (e.g., with social entrepreneurs), and become more empowered as innovative change agents in their endeavor of promoting social progress.</p>
<p>For HRD scholars, this article intends to stimulate interests and open a door to an emerging area of research. With this spirit, I propose the following questions for future studies:</p>
<list id="list2-1523422312446145" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What additional examples of social enterprises can we identify, which incorporate HRD/OD practices in their attempt to address societal problems in the developed/developing world? What lessons can we learn from their experiences?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How have HRD/OD concepts and approaches been applied by social enterprises in the developed/developing countries? And for what purposes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can HRD practitioners and social entrepreneurs partner to address social problems facing the developed/developing countries?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Answers to the above questions may prompt HRD practitioners to think more “outside of the box.” In the process, it is hoped that they will become more knowledgeable of social entrepreneurship practices and identify areas for collaboration on their journey to creating social and economic value to society.</p>
