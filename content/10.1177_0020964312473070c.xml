<p>A <sc>fitting motto for this</sc> rich commentary would be “no psalm is an island.” A similar motto could apply to authors Frank-Lothar Hossfeld and Erich Zenger: no commentator is an island. This third volume marks another fruitful collaboration of two internationally renowned German scholars (sadly, Zenger passed away unexpectedly two years ago). This “third” volume of the Hermeneia Psalms commentary, a translation of the 2008 German original, is actually the second volume in publication order. The “first” volume (Psalms 1–50) is yet to be completed. <italic>Psalms 3</italic> follows the 2005 volume, which covers Psalms 51–100. Like its predecessor, this commentary’s strength lies in its close attention to linguistic detail, iconography, and, perhaps most groundbreaking, the wider literary and theological contexts of each psalm. Simply put, the commentary follows a twofold methodology: “psalms exegesis” and “psalter exegesis” (p. xiii). The former treats each psalm individually, as a complete unit in itself. The latter treats each psalm as a component of a group of psalms, a part of a collection of psalms (“psalter”), or a part of the Psalter as a whole. In addition, there is special attention to the Septuagint Psalter in comparison to the Masoretic. The commentary also features several extensive excurses that address, among other things, the compositional history of particular psalm groups and their functions within the Psalter as a whole—in short, the “macrostructural” issues of Psalms exegesis. The commentary concludes with coverage of Psalm 151 as featured in the Septuagint and in 11QPs<sup>a</sup> (Zenger regards Psalm 151 as an “afterword” to the Septuagint Psalter).</p>
<p>This commentary is predominantly a commentary on each psalm. Nothing much is said by way of introduction to the Psalms, which will no doubt be featured in the upcoming “first” volume. Following translation and textual notes, the order of analysis for each psalm includes: 1) form and genre, which employs traditional form-critical categories; 2) structure, a sometimes lengthy discussion of the divisions within the psalm; 3) structural plan or outline, a new feature in this volume; 4) exposition, which includes a verse-by-verse or section-by-section explication of each psalm, occasionally accompanied by line-drawing depictions of ancient iconography; and 5) context, reception, and significance. This last section explores the relationships of the individual psalm to neighboring and even not-so neighboring psalms. In addition, the commentary frequently provides a separate section on redaction criticism. Moreover, the commentary discusses the Septuagint textual tradition of each psalm and explores connections to New Testament literature. Each analysis concludes with a discussion of the psalm’s “significance,” which comprises reflections on the psalm’s broader existential, sociological, and theological features—or, in effect, whatever strikes the authors as important.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this analytical grid is not slavishly followed. Frequently, the exegesis will open with a discussion of various scholarly positions on a particular psalm that leads to an articulation of the authors’ own position prior to the exposition. Occasionally, a discrete section on genre is left out. Sometimes issues of dating and historical context are addressed. The amount of scholarly dispute a given psalm has gained over the last few decades largely determines what might seem to be uneven treatment among the psalms. Rich in exegetical detail and scholarly discussion, the analysis may appear painstakingly tedious for the general reader, but for the scholar, it is a treasure trove of issues and insights.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest strength of the commentary is the larger picture of compositional development and structure that it affords. Hossfeld and Zenger take pains to ensure that the forest is discernible from the trees. They find that treating the last 50 psalms of the Psalter in one commentary is no arbitrary division, even though such coverage seems to ignore the division between Psalms 106 and 107, that is, between Books IV and V. They argue for an independent Psalter existing at the beginning of the 5th century that began with Psalm 2 and concluded with Psalm 100, the “YHWH is king Psalter.” Thus it is appropriate, they claim, to begin a commentary with Psalm 101, even if the next several psalms belong to (and close off) Book IV (Psalms 90–106).</p>
<p>Much of the commentary’s focus is on the various groupings of psalms, even “psalters” within the Psalter. For example, Psalm 107, with its opening <italic>ho da </italic> -formula celebrating YHWH’s “steadfast love,” forms a “compositional arc” that ends with Psalm 136, one of the great Hallel psalms. Under this arc lie various groupings that form the “great thanksgiving liturgy for Israel’s rescue, restoration, and renewal,” beginning with a second exodus (Psalms 113–118) and continuing in the pilgrimage to Zion (Psalms 120–134). A minor group, the “David trilogy” (Psalms 108–110), presents David as the “prototypical” figure of hope in the postexilic period. Compared to the royal coloring of earlier collections, David is given a more modest profile in this grouping: he is bereft of royal titles and is found pleading for help from YHWH.</p>
<p>Psalm 119 deserves special attention from a psalter-exegetical approach. A “Torah Psalter” in its own right given its extensive length and acrostic complexity, Psalm 119 seems to sever the connection between the Pesach Hallel (Psalms 113–118) and the “Pilgrim Psalter” (Psalms 120–134). Hossfeld and Zenger find the function of this psalm, on the one hand, to conjoin Temple theology (as found in Psalm 118) and Torah theology and, on the other, to reframe the Hallel Psalms around the concept of Torah wisdom, given Psalm 119’s connection with Psalms 111 and 112. This psalm of Torah mysticism, moreover, prepares for the arduous pilgrimage to Jerusalem; “it is the medium of survival in a hostile world” (p. 4).</p>
<p>As for the “Pilgrim Psalter” (Psalms 120–134), Hossfeld and Zenger build on past scholarship, which recognizes the independent integrity of this grouping, given the common superscription. They envision some of these psalms as having been composed in Jerusalem and sold to pilgrims as “souvenirs” on parchment or on little silver scrolls, similar to the amulets from Keteph Hinnom, so that Zion could be remembered and celebrated throughout the land. Eventually, these psalms were compiled for use as a prayer book and songbook for organized pilgrimages to the annual feasts and also for singing at worship services far from Jerusalem as well as for private devotion.</p>
<p>Psalms 138–145 constitute the “fifth Davidic Psalter.” Hossfeld and Zenger find two threads running throughout this collection: “God’s option for the poor” and the “way” of God’s justice. This final Davidic collection was redacted to serve as a “continuation” of the “Zion Psalter” that spans Psalms 2–136. With this addition, the “Davidic Torah” is now complete, with its five-part division mirroring the structure of the “Torah of Moses” or the Pentateuch. With the placement of Psalm 1 as a “prologue,” the righteous individual matches the ideal figure profiled in Psalm 2, the king, and together they match the king reflected in Deut 17:18–19.</p>
<p>As the grand finale of the Psalter, the Hallelujah Psalms of 146–150 distinguish themselves from Psalm 145 in content and style, the authors contend. These five psalms conclude the Psalter on a cosmic note, not so much with an emphasis on God’s establishment of the world as with an emphasis “on the active and effective presence of the Creator God in his world (<italic>creatio continuata</italic>)” (p. 7). No longer David but now Israel is designated the “soloist and cantor of the cosmic song of praise.” With these concluding psalms reflecting the final redaction of the Psalter, the Book of Psalms is transformed into the “Book of Praises” (<italic>Sefer Tehillim</italic>).</p>
<p>In sum, this commentary breaks new ground in Psalms scholarship by shifting the emphasis from the traditional <italic>Sitz im Leben</italic> study of the psalms, specifically the form-critical study that has ruled Psalms research for so long, to <italic>Sitz im Buch</italic>, whose possibilities are just beginning to be explored. Hossfeld and Zenger boldly lead the way as they explore layer upon layer of meaning among the psalms, as they discern shifting frames of literary context and probe the theological texture of the Psalter as a whole. For serious students of the Psalms, this commentary is an indispensable resource. For scholars, this volume, along with its companions, is a game changer.</p>
