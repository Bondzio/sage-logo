<p>Georgina Gregory’s study of tribute bands is an unabashed celebration of the form, fervently arguing that they are worth studying. She introduces her subjects to us by rehearsing the standard complaint that her topic has been unjustly excluded from the discipline of popular music studies. She then makes sure to note that her beloved subjects are a positive force, pushing against the widespread cynicism in the entertainment industry, while taking the requisite and now-reflexive shots at the ‘purists’ and ‘pessimists’ whose ‘puritanical’ (pp. 5, 29) values preclude even a grudging acceptance of a phenomenon she insists has deep and lasting value. While this book is engaging in parts, it does a very poor job of representing the content of many relevant debates in popular music studies and the analytical study of music more generally.</p>
<p>The book is reasonably clear and straightforward in its structure. It begins with a chapter outlining the purpose and broad themes of the book, followed by a somewhat disorganized survey of antecedents of the contemporary tribute band. This is then followed by an informative but jumbled typology of tribute bands. Gregory then provides one of the more interesting parts of the book, a kind of guide to working and succeeding as a tribute act. Despite her continued complaints about the apparently numerous unflattering stereotypes of her subjects, Gregory manages to provide some measure of insight into the experience of working in a tribute band. Through interviews with band members, we get a sense of the work that goes into what they do, some sense of the career paths these musicians have taken, as well as some understanding of the complex acts of mimicry such tributes entail. The final two chapters continue Gregory’s tangled attempts to salvage not only the reputation of tribute bands but the practices of imitation more broadly. She concludes the book with a few anecdotes that reflect on the relationship between fans and the tribute bands they love.</p>
<p>There are several problems with the way in which this book represents relevant debates. First, despite her enthusiastic championing of tribute bands, Gregory’s book presents a very narrow rendering of a complex form that rests enticingly between a range of different musical and theatrical traditions. For example, Gregory’s brief survey of historical antecedents of the tribute band does not explore what would seem to be obvious connections between these bands and the history of comic musical theatre. The long history of varied forms of humour, irony and even mockery so crucial to an understanding of vaudeville, minstrelsy, musical theatre and comedic novelty acts would seem to provide fertile ground for exploring the origins of tribute bands. Yet these are largely omitted. The surprising omission of drag shows in particular would seem to be a significant oversight. It would seem that Gregory’s understandable desire to reclaim the tribute band tradition from the margins prevents her from presenting a more robust account of their potential relationships to novelty acts, as if linking tribute acts to The Axis of Awesome or Tenacious D too directly might damage the reputation she is trying to restore.</p>
<p>Second, this book is very limited in its representation of relevant debates within the analytical and performative study of music. Gregory’s earnest defence of tribute acts consists mostly of a series of easily knocked over strawmen. She constructs nearly all criticism of tribute acts with the same limited range of materials, claiming that critics offer little more than ‘blunt dismissals’ of the phenomenon and all struggle to find anything of value in them at all (p. 127). A key example of the conceptual constraints of this book appears towards the end of the second to last chapter and serves as an insight into the larger problems that appear throughout. Claiming that the live show is the central institution of the tribute band, she then notes that:<disp-quote>
<p>Critics should focus their attention less on the reiterations of a static text and more on the meanings generated by the performance. This dynamic approach places greater emphasis on music as an inherently social phenomenon and within this context the travesty of simulation is replaced by an appreciation of the power of individual performances and their ability to generate unique meanings. (p. 128)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While it would seem that the relationship between an original text and its performative imitation and reinvention would be an unusually rich area of analytical exploration here, Gregory instead provides a flat caricature of musical analysis as being somehow trapped in ‘static texts’ tragically unable to respond to the reality of living, breathing music. Yet this book provides very little musical analysis that might address this presumed deficit. Gregory’s simplistic and inaccurate rendering of the wide range of contemporary work that explores the complex relationship between musical texts and musical performance significantly mars this book.</p>
