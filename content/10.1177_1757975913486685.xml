<title>Introduction:</title>
<p>Reorienting work practices to include health promotion and prevention is complex and requires specific strategies and interventions. This paper presents original research that used ‘real-world’ practice to demonstrate that knowledge gathered from practice is relevant for the development of practice-based evidence. The paper shows how practitioners can inform and influence improvements in health promotion practice. Practitioner-informed evidence necessarily incorporates qualitative research to capture the richness of their reflective experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757975913486685">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Using a participatory action research (PAR) approach, the research question asked ‘what are the core dimensions of building health promotion capacity in a primary health care workforce in a real-world setting?’ PAR is a method in which the researcher operates in full collaboration with members of the organisation being studied for the purposes of achieving some kind of change, in this case to increase the amount of health promotion and prevention practice within this community health setting. The PAR process involved six reflection and action cycles over two years. Data collection processes included: survey; in-depth interviews; a training intervention; observations of practice; workplace diaries; and two nominal groups. The listen/reflect/act process enabled lessons from practice to inform future capacity-building processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1757975913486685">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>This research strengthened and supported the development of health promotion to inform ‘better health’ practices through respectful change processes based on research, practitioner-informed evidence, and capacity-building strategies. A conceptual model for building health promotion capacity in the primary health care workforce was informed by the PAR processes and recognised the importance of the determinants approach.</p>

<sec id="section4-1757975913486685">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Practitioner-informed evidence is the missing link in the evidence debate and provides the links between evidence and its translation to practice. New models of health promotion service delivery can be developed in community settings recognising the importance of involving practitioners themselves in these processes.

<sec id="section5-1757975913486685" sec-type="intro">
<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is more than 25 years since the Ottawa Charter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486685">1</xref>) described health promotion as the ‘process of enabling people to increase control over and to improve their health’. The Charter offers a five-fold focus: building healthy policy; creating supportive environments; strengthening community action; developing personal skills; and reorienting health services. Reorienting health services is a complex process that requires health services to move beyond their responsibility for providing just clinical and curative services to become health-promoting organisations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913486685">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757975913486685">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Changing health care work practices to reorient health services is complex and dynamic, particularly in contemporary environments of fiscal responsibility, efficiency and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757975913486685">4</xref>). The development of health promotion theories, models and practices has shown that change happens through multiple layers of strategies including capacity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757975913486685">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913486685"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757975913486685">7</xref>); organisational development; theories of learning and organisational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913486685">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757975913486685">9</xref>); and systems thinking in health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757975913486685">10</xref>). No single strategy can achieve the reorientation of health services without understanding how to translate those theories into methods for action. This is why Participatory Action Research (PAR) is such a useful strategy for driving organisational change through the actions of the practitioners themselves. The conceptual model for practice change to underpin reorienting of health services is informed by the learning from these theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975913486685">11</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the field of social determinants of health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757975913486685">12</xref>), and concepts of health inequalities and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757975913486685">13</xref>) underpinned the research and the model as they offer approaches to shift thinking from individuals to population approaches.</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual model for building capacity in health promotion. The model emerged from participatory action research (PAR) that sought to identify the elements of health promotion capacity building in an urban primary health care organisation which was a ‘natural’ or ‘real-world setting’ in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia. This paper reflects on the PAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757975913486685">14</xref>) process which showed that the reorientation of health services must be driven by bottom-up practitioner change through their active participation. The paper highlights the impact of practitioner-informed evidence and the role it plays in improving health promotion practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757975913486685">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The Community Health Setting (CHS) comprised a multi-disciplinary workforce of 66 employees including 54 community health nurses, one and a half equivalent full-time (EFT) social workers, one Aboriginal Health Worker, six administrative staff and a management team of four which included the centre manager. A large proportion of this workforce participated in various aspects of this research process. The practitioners employed in this setting were not specialist health promotion staff.</p>
<p>This CHS serves a population of 60,000 people. This population includes clients from Aboriginal (16–18%) and multicultural (10–15%) backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757975913486685">15</xref>). Despite this diverse client population these groups were under-represented in the service access data. Staff were concerned about this issue and committed to making the service more accessible.</p>
<p>A request was made to a specialist health promotion practitioner/researcher (JJ) with whom the service had a long-term relationship, to assist the service to improve their health promotion and prevention practice. There had been no previous attempt to describe the services of the CHS in detail. In addition, there was no literature describing the processes needed to shift services to intentional incorporation of prevention and health promotion interventions into clinical work and day-to-day practice.</p>
<p>The knowledge gathered from practice is relevant for the development of practice-based evidence to show how practitioners can inform and influence the ways that health promotion practice can be improved. Practitioner-informed evidence incorpor-ates qualitative research. Collecting and appraising evidence, converting it to advice and guidance, and supporting change within complex systems, are each complicated processes in themselves, and are based on different methods and philosophies. In other words, evidence does not only come from systematic reviews and randomised control trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975913486685">16</xref>). Literature about how to change practice suggests that emphasis should be placed on capacity building and learning from practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975913486685">16</xref>). Determining whether an intervention will work, even one well founded in evidence, requires an understanding of the local contexts and circumstances of local professionals’ knowledge bases, commitment and engagement, and a detailed assessment of the particular population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757975913486685">16</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1757975913486685" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Qualitative designs are best suited for naturalistic research in that they take place in real-world settings where the researcher does not attempt to manipulate the phenomenon of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486685">17</xref>). Working in a natural setting requires responsiveness, flexibility and action and allows a process for yielding simultaneous participation, action and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486685">17</xref>). The research question asked ‘what are the core dimensions of building health promotion capacity in a primary health care workforce in a real-world setting?’</p>
<p>PAR is a method in which the researcher operates in full collaboration with members of the organisation being studied for the purposes of achieving some kind of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975913486685">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757975913486685"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1757975913486685"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1757975913486685"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913486685">22</xref>), in this case to increase the amount of health promotion and prevention practice within this setting. Green <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757975913486685">19</xref>) suggest that social change theory offers evidence that involvement of people in decision-making and planning processes is more likely to produce meaningful change. The relevance of PAR to health promotion research and practice is linked with the strong participatory significance in the definition of health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486685">1</xref>). The changes that are produced through an educational process are consistent with the enabling and empowering goals of health promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1757975913486685">19</xref>). Elements of the PAR process included engendered trust, respect and credibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913486685">22</xref>). The core philosophy of PAR is inclusivity, participation and involvement of the participants and the researcher in the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1757975913486685">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1757975913486685"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1757975913486685">24</xref>).</p>
<p>The PAR process occurred through the systematic collection of comprehensive and in-depth information about the community health setting and included detailed descriptions of the service, and documentation of professional practices, problems or situations. The health promotion practitioner/researcher was able to offer skills in research methods, while the ‘community members’ (CHS practitioners) were able to teach the researcher about the context of the health promotion work they were doing. Consideration was given to who would be observed/interviewed; what work areas would be included (in or about which settings data was collected); when (at which times), and what (which events, activities or processes). The PAR process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757975913486685">Figure 1</xref>) involved six reflection and action cycles developed over a two-year period. Each cycle included: looking; asking reflec-tive questions; collecting information; analysis; discussion; clarification of findings to gain under-standing; and planning of fieldwork to review current and past actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757975913486685">11</xref>). Each cycle in the research process led to the next when decisions were made by the participants about next steps in the process.</p>

</fig>
<p>Coincidentally, over this same time period, the CHS also began a process of quality improvement accreditation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975913486685">25</xref>) which added value to the research as it enabled better documentation and encouraged reflective practice by the practitioners.</p>
<p>Samples for each component of the research were purposive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486685">26</xref>) with inclusion criteria being centred on participants’ willingness and availability, as all potential participants were working in a busy primary health care centre. The majority of the sample were community health nurses (54 participants); social workers (one and a half FTE); administrative workers (six participants), management team (four participants) and one Aboriginal Health Worker. There were two male participants in the service, with 60% of staff over the age of 41 years.</p>
<p>Primary data were derived from:</p>
<list id="list1-1757975913486685" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a survey with both qualitative and quantitative elements; included six areas of interest: demographic information; health promotion in a community health setting; health promotion and public health policies; resource needs; client issues; quality and other comments.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a training intervention (designed from areas of need identified in the survey and prioritised by the participants). The training intervention (20 hours) had three parts: What is health promotion?; Sharing health information; and Providing brief intervention. A pre- and post-test survey (30 participants completed) comprised an eight-item survey tool with a variety of knowledge and skills-based elements that included scenarios, and how the Ottawa Charter applied to their practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>in-depth semi-structured interviews (20 participants across the service) incorporated respondents describing their health promotion work; its impact on their day-to-day practice; their training in health promotion; brief intervention and motivational interviewing; problems and barriers and how they addressed these; quality improvement standards; the role that the community health professional can play in health promotion; and the impact of departmental policies on their health promotion practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>workplace observations (eight participants) in the three main areas of practice: group processes with social workers; in the Primary Health Care room (where clients received primary health care treatment and follow-up); and the Maternal and Child Health areas (where parents and young children received services and follow-up). The observational notes included clinical, education and prevention, and psychosocial issues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>workplace diaries (nine participants across these same areas requiring staff to document their work practice across areas of: health promotion and prevention; early detection/intervention; health care and programme management; and administration. This process occurred in two one-week blocks (time-lapsed by five months); and,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>two nominal group processes (six participants each) which explored the question ‘What are the factors that influence health promotion practice within this setting?’.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Secondary data included an appraisal of relevant literature (academic and grey), and a policy summary and analysis.</p>
<p>As Patton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486685">17</xref>) suggests, the qualitative findings were context and case-dependent but the model has wide applicability to other settings. Four sampling limitations typically arise in this kind of research: limitations to settings selected for observation; time restrictions; the risk of selectivity in people sampled; and also selectivity in document sampling. Care needs to be taken to ensure these limitations are overcome to make sure that the purposive sampling is as unbiased as possible and enables the study of information-rich settings in-depth, in order to understand how the ‘real-world setting’ is trying to reorient its practices.</p>

<sec id="section8-1757975913486685">
<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Joint Institutional Ethics Committee (Department of Health and Community Services and the Menzies School of Health and Research NT-No: 99/49); and the Deakin University Ethics Committee Victoria (DUEC Proj EC 207-99). Participation was voluntary, and data was de-identified and stored according to National Health and Medical Research Council protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1757975913486685">27</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1757975913486685">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data collected in each PAR cycle was inductively analysed and synthesised into key themes and categories. Context sensitivity was important, therefore the qualitative analyses took into account the need to balance understanding of the context of the study, whilst being self-analytical, politically aware and reflexive in consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486685">17</xref>). The analysis occurred in a sequential manner (check <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757975913486685">Figure 1</xref>): the survey was analysed through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for quantitative questions and thematically for qualitative questions. At the completion of each cycle, results were presented and discussed with the practitioners at a joint staff meeting where the next intervention or process was negotiated. Informed problem solving, that is, finding solutions to issues and barriers within practice was the key to solution building.</p>
<p>The data was triangulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1757975913486685">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1757975913486685">26</xref>); that is, data were authenticated through the cross-verification of what people said in the interviews and survey; what people did in the observation of work practice and work diary; the policy and strategic documents; and methodological issues. Staff experiences, under-standing and application of health promotion concepts and the interventions used in their daily work practice were documented and described for analysis. The Health Promotion Framework for Action’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975913486685">28</xref>) five action areas guided the organisation of the data and analysis: disease prevention (primary, secondary and tertiary); communication strategies (health information, behaviour change campaigns); health education and empowerment (knowledge, understanding and skill development); community development and health development (engagement, community action and advocacy); and infrastructure and systems change (policy, legislation and organisational change). This Framework was used as a systematic way to map work practice across the continuum of interventions and to see where the emphasis and gaps were in terms of downstream and upstream processes in their work practice. Additionally, a policy analysis was incorporated, as were the pertinent responses from the survey and interviews. The final cycle was a nominal group process which prioritised the barriers to implementing prevention and health promotion activities into practitioners’ work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1757975913486685" sec-type="results">
<title>Results and findings</title>
<p>After the first cycle of data collection from the survey, results were shared with the participants. Participants prioritised a training intervention to increase their skills and knowledge of health promotion practice. A pre- and post-test occurred to check knowledge before and after the training process.</p>
<p>A targeted workforce development and training strategy (20 hours) was designed and implemented after a skills deficit was identified in the survey. This was a key intervention to influence practitioners to initiate more health promotion and prevention work into their practice, in particular, the use of brief interventions and the sharing of health information when working with clients.</p>
<p>Changes in the structure of the workplace were made to address the issue identified within the centre of increasing health promotion staff. This strategy emerged from the survey and in-depth interviews: a designated team was identified from within existing staff at the centre.</p>
<p>In addition, an existing Aboriginal Liaison Officer position was redesigned as an Aboriginal Health Promotion Officer position. The redesigned role placed emphasis on formal training in health promotion, capacity building, mentoring and support. These changes demonstrated the commitment of the management team to improving access for Aboriginal clients. This strategy emerged from the survey and interview data.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a Quality Improvement process requiring specific health promotion standards of practice was being implemented in order to meet accreditation requirements. During the accreditation process, the external review team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1757975913486685">25</xref>) highly commended these newly introduced health promotion standards. The Quality Improvement framework added value to this research by ensuring appropriate documentation and evaluation of health promotion activities and projects as this had not been occurring systematically prior to this process.</p>
<p>As a result of this research and the quality improve-ment processes, practitioners were encouraged to become reflective in their practice. This process included regular review and evaluation of activities and projects, through a formal process of business planning, facilitated by the health promotion specialist/researcher.</p>
<p>The management team recognised that daily clinical practice adversely impacted on health practitioners’ ability to incorporate targeted health promotion projects into their role and that these projects required additional time and focus. This problem was addressed by enabling staff to be relieved from frontline clinical duties to undertake specific projects, whilst other staff covered their clinical workload during this time. This process was introduced to address some of the structural and clinical barriers to doing prevention and health promotion projects.</p>
<p>The results of the workplace diary enabled practitioners to estimate time spent on various health promotion activities within their work practice. This strategy provided a mechanism for arguing for more appropriate use of resources.</p>

<p>This denotes the components of the adapted NSW Capacity Building framework (NSW, 2000).</p>
</fn>
<fn id="table-fn2-1757975913486685">
<label>**</label>
<p>These elements are the four levels of leadership that have been identified within the research and include appropriate actions across the capacity-building framework.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>The enhanced capacity-building framework unpacks the various levels of change and support required across the five action areas: leadership, workforce development, organisational development, resource allocation and partnerships and alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913486685">6</xref>) to ensure that health promotion capacity was built within the service and the broader health department.</p>
<p>Organisational development requires action in leadership, policymaking and infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757975913486685">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1757975913486685">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975913486685">31</xref>). Four different levels of leadership were identified from the data: organisational leadership through infrastructure and policymaking at the service and departmental level; leadership in management at the local setting level; health promotion leadership (including leadership in the process of developing partnerships, collaborations and linkages within the community); and the local team leadership who became drivers for change. This required a process of developing vision, mission and political will to implement and sustain health promotion initiatives.</p>
<p>Organisational leadership provided the infrastructure and processes for developing a supportive system within the health sector. Leadership at this level also assisted in building the skills, knowledge, and resources for health promotion, and supported the connectedness between individuals and agencies. At the time of this study, the government health department had a strong and explicit emphasis on health promotion and public health within all programme and strategic plans. Progress was reported in annual reports and other mechanisms, such as business plans. However, the links between organisational policy and how practitioners related to and implemented policy were weak. Although practitioners recognised the importance of policy, they felt removed from the policymaking processes and, in particular, how these policies related to their work practice, as this practitioner noted:<disp-quote>
<p>[There is a] big gap between policymakers and nurses who put policies into practice, policies are there but resources are scarce. [int-id016-9]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The PAR element of policy development and implementation helped to improve these links between policies and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975913486685">31</xref>).</p>
<p>The leadership, vision and support of the management team directly impacted on service provision through their commitment to improved health promotion processes and practice. Another staff member noted that:<disp-quote>
<p>The work environment has recognised the importance of health promotion and then instigated a health promotion team, higher profile, and more importance of health promotion. [int-id015-6]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The leadership by the specialist health promotion practitioner/researcher was often seen as ‘invisible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913486685">32</xref>) in these processes. This leadership involved translating and enabling good theoretical and conceptual frameworks to be applied in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757975913486685">2</xref>). Leadership in health promotion is about understanding health and its determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1757975913486685">33</xref>), the emerging evidence around approaches, and the timely implementation of evidence-based policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1757975913486685">31</xref>), practice and social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1757975913486685">18</xref>). Leadership requires a shared vision for improving health for all and acts to build the capacity of communities, the health workforce, and partnerships with other sectors.</p>
<p>Practitioner leadership provided the motivation and continuity of drivers at the service provider level. These practitioners offered insight and modelled best practice in health promotion processes and valued the health-promoting way of working ‘upstream’. Practitioners began to think laterally and to use innovative and creative approaches in their work. Another example of what a practitioner felt:<disp-quote>
<p>Absolutely changed the way health promotion is done – increased the amount. Provided infrastructure – you have to do it (documentation and evaluation) now. [int-011-7]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The clinical barriers to shifting practice were challenging; however, by problem-solving these together through the PAR process, solutions became possible. Primary health care practitioners felt very positive about health promotion because they wished to stop ‘putting on band aids’ and to contribute more to the prevention of many of the daily issues that they face. This was a common theme in the surveys, interviews and nominal group. An example of this theme is quoted here:<disp-quote>
<p>Reiteration of need of increased opportunity to deliver these (HP) services, so that current practices are not dominated by band aid practice. [s-id049-32]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Drawing on these findings, a new integrated model for strengthening health promotion practice was developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1757975913486685">Figure 2</xref>). The development of this model occurred over the period of this research. The process was based on a clear commitment to involving the practitioners and the health promotion researcher in all parts of the process with the intention to build or continue to add value to health promotion capacity that was already occurring within this workforce. The theoretical frameworks for this process as described came from capacity-building frameworks, health promotion theories and practice, and the commitment to work together to improve health promotion practice in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1757975913486685">34</xref>). The introduction of the Framework for Health Promotion Action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1757975913486685">28</xref>) helped practitioners to translate the importance of shifting practice upstream to more of a social determinants approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1757975913486685">35</xref>). With the addition of the PAR cycle, this process enabled ownership and participation at the service provider level and helped to build the social capital, partnerships, and team learning principles that enhanced better practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757975913486685">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1757975913486685">36</xref>). Inclusion of the quality improvement framework added value to the process because it was based on the action reflection cycle and involved practitioners in all aspects of changes to service delivery; inevitable in a changing environment. The quality improvement process assisted in involving the clients and their community in planning and evaluation cycles to improve service delivery for these groups.</p>

<p>The model highlights that using a combination of interventions is helpful in complex change processes particularly when characterised by activities like capacity building in changing long-established practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1757975913486685">32</xref>). The range of strategies implemented strengthened both health promotion and social practice, and gave practitioners opportunities to learn from the consequences of these changes. Essential components in building this health promotion model included how capacity was developed, the effects of the policy environment and the importance of training, support and professional development for practitioners. Using PAR gave practitioners an opportunity to strengthen practitioner-informed evidence and to enhance capacity building as to how and what interventions work best in a real-world context.</p>
<p>Processes encouraging advocacy, engagement and empowerment are effective health promotion tools and strengthen the capacity of individuals, communities and the workforce by responding to factors that influence health in their local contexts. Practitioners also recognised the importance of cultural competence and better methods of engaging these groups in service delivery. The recognition of the importance of more Aboriginal health workers in this environment and better ways to engage the culturally and linguistically diverse groups was evident.</p>
<p>The CHS also recognised that innovative and creative ways were needed to overcome the structural and ‘clinical cultural’ barriers within primary health care practice, to move it from individualist approaches, to broader community engagement and advocacy approaches.</p>
<p>The PAR cycle is congruent with the continuous improvement cycle where people are involved in looking, asking questions, collecting information, analysing and discussing, understanding, planning and acting. It is the participation in all aspects of this change cycle that enabled the capacity-building processes to occur in this setting.</p>
<p>The factors that cannot be measured but are implicit in any change process are the relationships, professional credibility, and skills of the health promotion specialist/researcher. There were a number of challenges to the sustainability of increasing health promotion capacity in this particular workforce: the transience of the workforce, keeping a critical mass of workers who practise health promotion, and the impact of regular departmental restructures. Sustainability in this environment requires action on all areas of the capacity-building framework, particularly organisational development. This is an essential upstream capacity-building strategy and a critical element to improving and creating supportive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757975913486685">1</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This innovative research demonstrated that although evidence is important, it needs to be broadened to encompass practitioner-informed evidence as to how things happen in the real world. Importantly, practitioner-informed evidence makes the links between evidence and its translation to practice and is the missing link in the evidence debate.</p>
<p>New models of health promotion service delivery can be developed in community settings using a participatory action research process. The nature of health promotion and its concentration on participation, partnerships and relationships were key contributors to the success of this research and capacity-building process. Working with the participants in an inclusive and equal partnership formed the foundation of the work. Indeed, these principles and processes are congruent with good health promotion practice.</p>
<p>This learning from practice helped, when reorienting the workforce, to introduce more health promotion and prevention into practice. The elements of this framework have been applied in a number of settings where health promotion capacity has been enhanced.</p>
<p>This research strengthened and supported the development of health promotion to inform ‘better health’ practices through respectful change processes based on research, practitioner-informed evidence, and capacity-building strategies.</p>
<p>This conceptual model for building health promotion capacity in the workforce recognised the importance of the determinants approach through the development of strategic responses to identified health problems. Practitioners accepted that engaging Aboriginal and multicultural populations and groups needed to be based on an understanding of the underlying social, economic, environmental and political determinants of health as they impact on individuals, communities and populations. A determinants approach also needs to be articulated through policy frameworks that encourage collaborative partnerships within and outside the health sector, so that services are more integrated and delivered to better fit the needs of individuals and communities.</p>
