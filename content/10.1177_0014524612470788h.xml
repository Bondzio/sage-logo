<p><italic>The Universe Bends Toward Justice</italic> typifies Obery M. Hendricks’ cumulative address on behalf of Christianity’s silenced progressive voices through practical Biblical hermeneutics. Concisely, the book laments the use Christian rhetoric and piety posturing as a means to accomplish a contrary political objective, especially when its aims further fuels the flames of economic disparity, destruction, and premature death.</p>
<p>In the book’s opening pages, Hendricks boldly critiques gospel music as unintentionally divergent from the fight for liberation and justice contained in the spirituals. The author’s main claim about gospel music lies in its apolitical message, disconnect with the community in need of liberation and justice, and its profit driven state. Hendricks devotes the remaining sections of the book to a reassessment of conventional Christian praxis as neglecting Jesus’ mandates with respect to the poor, marginalized, and oppressed. Chapters 3 and 4 expose ‘supply-side’ economics as favoring the rich at the expense of the masses. As a whole, the book’s contents provide a series of concrete examples in which social institutions including the church promote and support policies that exclude and disenfranchise large sectors of the public.</p>
<p>The author uses a mildly abrasive but necessary direct tone throughout the text in order to passionately express his dissent with Christianity’s overall abandonment of Jesus’ teachings, the prophetic witness, and social transformative obligation for justice. Hendricks raises the broad church cultural message of truncating the historical revolutionary Jesus to a mythological personality cult. In an attempt to invite reluctant readers to the highly politically charged book, Hendricks makes frequent uses of coded language to minimize direct partisan references. However, throughout the book’s latter chapters, the author makes repeated direct references to public figures in order to address in concrete terms the conflict of using Christian rhetoric as a means to justify greed and laissez-faire politics in terms of accountability.</p>
<p>The book’s chapter five is devoted to Martin Luther King Jr.’s preaching and faith journey which functions as what Hendricks argues is one of the most outstanding examples of the true meaning of following Jesus. Hendricks stresses that King’s preaching and faith journey embraced Jesus’ inaugural sermon from Luke 4. King was ‘concerned with integrating the economic order so all could eat of the fullest fruits of the tree of life’ (p. 201).</p>
<p>The reader’s ideological assumptions about the mandates of the Christian life will either become increasingly affirmed or further challenged. However, the book must be read in its entirety in order to avoid passages taken out of context.</p>
