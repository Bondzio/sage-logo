<p>In the introduction to <italic>Covert Racism</italic>, editor Rodney D. Coates compares the contemporary racial dynamics in the United States to those in the movie <italic>The Matrix</italic>, in which the “real” is in fact an illusion created by powerful machines that manipulate human beings into passive complacency. Coates suggests that we live in “a racial matrix that serves to create and preserve an illusion of reality [in which] differences in outcomes associated with racial hierarchies are defined as the natural or normal functioning of a democratic system based upon meritocracy” (p. 1).</p>
<p>I was particularly drawn to his use of the illusive world of the <italic>The Matrix</italic> as a metaphor for the mechanics of racism because it was one which several of my peers and I had used in graduate school to describe our process of learning the sociology of race and racism. In <italic>The Matrix</italic>, the lead character is offered a choice between the “red pill,” which will reveal the true structural dynamics of the world in which the characters live, or, the “blue pill,” which will cause him to return to a fabricated world that obscures reality by an imaginary created by those (machines) in power. As graduate students who had come to sociology to learn about race and racism with some experiential understanding of racial inequality, we often joked that had we really understood how deeply embedded, broadly instituted and relatively permanent white racial domination was before we began reading the scholarship on race and racism we may have elected not to take the “red pill.” <italic>Covert Racism</italic> is like a red pill—an exposure of the multifaceted details and mechanisms of racism and racial reproduction that are “subtle in application…hidden by norms of association, affiliation, group membership and/or identity” (p. 2).</p>
<p>This elaborate volume which pulls together the work of leading scholars examining racial inequality explicates the insidious depth and breadth of racism in contemporary U.S. (and global) social structure. As I read each of the contributions to the volume, I thought about the usefulness of this book for my own scholarship and teaching. The different levels of analysis (structural, institutional, interactional, and individual) as well as the varied methodologies (quantitative and qualitative, from demography to auto-ethnography) would appeal to young students. Additionally, the book’s breadth of substantive information about race and racism, from broad conceptual and methodological analyses of covert racism (see for example the chapters by Coates and Tukufu Zuberi), to the structural and demographic elements of racial segregation (see William Julius Wilson; Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and David Dietrich), to racism in hiring and employment (see John Dovidio and Samuel Gaertner; Sharon Collins and Georgiann Davis; Monique Morris and Sirithon Thanasombat; Elijah Anderson; Corey Dolgon), to racism in education (see Sarah Chivers and Jolene Smyth; William Smith, Tara Yosso, and Daniel Solórzano), to racism in the legal arena (see Ian Haney-Lopez; Patricia Williams), to racism in everyday life and popular culture (see Angie Beeman and Anjana Narayan; Claudia Fox Tree; Leslie Picca, Joe Feagin, and Tracy Johns), provides a wealth of important resources for scholars of race at all levels from student to professor.</p>
<p>Yet as I read what I considered to be an impressive explication of mechanisms of covert racism in contemporary society, I experienced a familiar reaction—frustration. As if in a repetitive loop that began in those days in graduate school when I reflected on the choice to take the “red pill,” I found myself thinking as I read study after study in <italic>Covert Racism</italic>: will <italic>this</italic> book, with <italic>all of these</italic> studies, finally be enough to convince the world of mainstream sociology that our society is racially structured, organized by white domination and the systematic oppression of people of color? I have spent my scholarly career carefully documenting, and reading the work of others who carefully document the dynamics of white racial domination, while again and again having to begin from the “objective” perspective that racism might not be real or present, to prove the relevance of race and racism in a discipline that seems inclined to see social dynamics attributed to “anything but racism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491548">Bonilla-Silva and Baiocchi 2008</xref>). I describe this process as akin to attempting to examine the experience of a person walking to the store (to illuminate the nuanced dynamics of the journey), but being stalled by my scholarly community which needs me to “prove” that gravity exists in order to show the validity of this so-called walk to the store. And so, I (and others who wish to explicate the journey) provide account after account documenting gravity and in doing so our time is consumed such that we rarely get to the details of the experience of the journey. The time has come for a sociology that explicitly recognizes its own role in the racial matrix, in its replication of an inherent white logic and method (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306113491548">Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva 2008</xref>), a sociology that recognizes that all knowledge is political and that sociologists should engage more in “challenging the racial common sense and racial structures in the post-civil rights era” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113491548">Bonilla-Silva and Baiocchi 2008</xref>: 150).</p>
<p><italic>Covert Racism</italic> contains the analytical and methodological tools for this type of critical sociological project. The multiple sites of study in this volume indicate that race, racism, and racial hierarchy exist simultaneously at multiple levels of analysis. For example, race and racism are experienced as an identity which connects us to a community and a social structure and influences how we experience community and structure. David Brunsma’s chapter discusses how white domination complicates the process of attempting to create affirmatively an anti-racist white identity because of the way in which “white lives are situated and converted into privilege” (p. 323). Additionally, race and racism operate at the level of culture and practice. Systemic white domination and racism influence the ways that we interact with one another and the racial meanings we attach to those interactions; for example, Picca, Feagin, and Johns discuss the emotional and psychic strain that is a part of the lived experience of African Americans resulting from their day-to-day encounters with racism. Moreover, race is experienced through the cultural practices in which we participate, and their connection to or alienation from the (white) dominant culture: Fox Tree discusses the painful process of having to negotiate the racism of whites directed at her children when they participated in elements of their Native American culture. Furthermore, race is embedded in the patterns and practices of social institutions like education and employment, as Collins and Davis illustrate when they detail the mechanisms by which whites protect their power in corporate hierarchies, even when supposedly “diversifying.” And finally, race and racism organize the social structure such that white domination is systemic: the contributions by Wilson, Bonilla Silva and Dietrich, and Coates all discuss the institutionally inter-connected and structurally embedded processes and demographies of racism and racial hierarchy in the United States</p>
<p>These works guide us to a reflexive sociology of race and racism that interrogates the prevalence of white domination and its multifaceted and recursive mechanisms that continue to reproduce racialized identity and discourse, culture and practice, institutions and structure. This raises a related methodological issue requiring an interrogation of sociology within and beyond the substantive area of race and racism. As Zuberi notes, “the incorrect use of race in statistical analysis is widely practiced [in sociology] and reflects the degree of racial reasoning among social scientists” (p. 79). The dominant technique for studying race-related issues in sociology has been through statistical procedures that deploy the logic of a “race effect,” that is, the explicit or implicit assertion that race <italic>causes</italic> social phenomenon such as birth and death rates, unemployment and poverty, rates of education. This is not merely a conflation of correlation with causation. The deployment of the “race effect” obscures the reality of white domination and racism. The mainstream sociological apparatus, the statistical method, does the work of the “blue pill,” facilitating a clouded, reductionist impression of the racial matrix.</p>
<p>Rather than calling for the abandonment of statistical methods of analysis in the sociological study of race, I suggest that sociology, as a discipline engaged in producing knowledge about the social world, would shed its statistical bias in favor of a broader approach to social science methods that facilitates clarity and nuance in our examinations of the social reality of racism and racial hierarchy. As Zuberi’s contribution to <italic>Covert Racism</italic> documents, the most prestigious publication outlets in sociology overwhelmingly favor the techniques and measures of quantitative, positivistic sociology that reduce race to a variable, and often reduces <italic>racism</italic> to an illusion. To counter this methodological bias which, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094306113491548">Zuberi and Bonilla-Silva (2008)</xref> point out, has lead to a dominant white logic in sociology, we must start from a position that acknowledges the historical and contemporary influence of white domination in the discipline of sociology and work toward a project of pursuing a more democratic social science scholarship of race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306113491548">Stienberg 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113491548">Harding 1993</xref>). With this understanding, we must begin to center the histories and experiences of people of color, because the knowledge <italic>of</italic> people of color (as opposed to <italic>about</italic> people of color) has traditionally been excluded from and/or devalued in the sociological cannon (Ladner 1973, Ferguson 2004). Moreover, people of color have a standpoint both inside and outside racial oppression, in that they must both participate in racist institutions and relationships and simultaneously reject racist oppression, which uniquely situates them to identify, problematize and deconstruct the mechanisms of white domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094306113491548">Williams 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306113491548">Roediger 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094306113491548">Collins 2000</xref>). Such a project necessitates interrogating the nuances and processes involved in the (re)production of racial identities and racial meanings, racial practices and racist institutions and social structure; thus, requiring socially engaging and reflexive methodological approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113491548">Burrawoy 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094306113491548">Emirbayer and Desmond 2012</xref>). At a minimum, this will require mainstream sociology to recognize the value of research methods like narrative interviews, case studies, critical ethnographies, and life histories, in a meaningful (peer-review published) way. Beyond that, I believe the discipline of sociology should begin to value creative and innovative processes of knowledge production and transmission about race and racism. For example, the Smith, Yosso, and Solórzano piece in <italic>Covert Racism</italic> engages a methodological process “counterstorytelling,” in the tradition of critical race theorists like Derrick Bell and Richard Delgado. Drawing upon and departing from social scientific analytic frames and empirical research, counterstorytelling provides scholars with an opportunity to create counter-narratives to white domination, a creative and innovative methodological process that facilitates possibilities for rupture in dominant white discourses (Ferguson 2004).</p>
<p>As Rodney Coates so aptly demonstrates in <italic>Covert Racism</italic>, the real problem with taking the “red pill,” the process of learning about and coming to understand the often tacit and deeply normative mechanisms of white domination, the process that my friends and I lamented in graduate school, is the fact that others continue to live in the racial matrix, willingly believing in and participating in a fiction that obscures the real forces of racial oppression that affect the lives of so many. It is time for the discipline of sociology to participate in a project of exposure, and <italic>Covert Racism</italic> can facilitate this project.</p>
