<sec id="section1-0363546512457654">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The neurovascular structures of the proximal arm may be at risk for iatrogenic injury during open subpectoral biceps tenodesis (OSPBT).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512457654">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To define the anatomic relationships and at-risk structures during OSPBT and to quantify the effect of arm rotation on the position of the musculocutaneous nerve.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512457654">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Descriptive laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512457654">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The OSPBT approach was performed in 17 unembalmed cadaveric upper extremities. The tenodesis site was inferior to the bicipital groove and positioned so the musculotendinous portion of the long head of the biceps rested at the inferior border of the pectoralis major. A meticulous dissection identified the brachial artery, deep brachial artery, cephalic vein, brachial vein, medial brachial cutaneous nerve, medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, intercostal brachial cutaneous nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, axillary nerve, median nerve, and radial nerve. Superficial structures were measured from the superior and inferior aspects of the incision, and deep structures were measured from the tenodesis site and nearest retractor. The musculocutaneous nerve was measured with the arm in neutral, internal, and external rotation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512457654">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The musculocutaneous nerve was 10.1 mm (range, 6-18 mm) medial to the tenodesis location and 2.9 mm (range, 1-6 mm) medial to the medially placed retractor in neutral arm position. The radial nerve and deep brachial artery were 7.4 mm (range, 2-12 mm) and 5.7 mm (range, 1-10 mm) deep to the medially placed retractor, respectively. With the arm internally rotated to 45°, the musculocutaneous nerve was 8.1 mm from the tenodesis site, compared with 19.4 mm with the arm 45° externally rotated (<italic>P</italic> = .009). The median nerve, brachial artery, and brachial vein were &gt;2.5 cm from the tenodesis site and nearest retractor during deep dissection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512457654">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The musculocutaneous nerve, radial nerve, and deep brachial artery are within 1 cm of the standard medial retractor. External rotation of the arm moves the musculocutaneous nerve 11.3 mm further away from the tenodesis site compared with the internally rotated position.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546512457654">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The musculocutaneous nerve, radial nerve, and deep brachial artery course in close proximity to the operative field and are therefore at risk during OSPBT. Limiting the use of medial retraction and placement of the arm in an externally rotated position will minimize neurovascular injury.</p>

<p>Lesions afflicting the proximal portion of the long head of the biceps have long been recognized as a common source of shoulder pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457654">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457654">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457654">11</xref></sup> Numerous biceps tenodesis procedures have been described that secure the biceps tendon within<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457654">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512457654">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457654">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457654">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457654">11</xref></sup> or inferior to the bicipital groove.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512457654">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457654">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512457654">19</xref></sup> In 2005 Mazzocca et al described an OSPBT technique that secures the tendon below the intertubercular groove using an interference screw.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457654">15</xref></sup> The benefits of this technique include improved surgical efficiency, maintenance of the biceps length-tension relationship, removal of the tendon from the bicipital groove, and secure fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457654">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457654">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457654">18</xref></sup> Limited series have demonstrated favorable outcomes using the OSPBT technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457654">14</xref></sup>; failure of fixation and persistent bicipital pain are the most commonly reported complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The OSPBT with interference screw fixation has been increasingly performed for the treatment of multiple conditions of the proximal biceps tendon and associated shoulder lesions. There are numerous neurovascular structures in the proximal arm that are potentially at risk during open subpectoral biceps tenodesis. Recently several studies have reported complications associated with the open subpectoral biceps tenodesis technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457654">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457654">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup> Despite the potential for a catastrophic neurovascular injury during this procedure, we are aware of no studies in the English language that characterize the anatomic structures that are at risk in this relatively new surgical procedure. Additionally, the effect of arm rotation on the position of the neurovascular structures in the proximal arm has not been described.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to define the anatomic relationships and at-risk structures during OSPBT and to quantify the effect of arm rotation on the position of the neurovascular structures of the proximal arm.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512457654" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>After Institutional Review Board approval, 17 whole, intact, fresh-frozen cadaveric upper extremities from 9 donors (6 male and 3 female) were studied. Nine right- and 8 left-sided extremities were used, with 8 paired specimens. The mean age at time of death was 77 years (range, 56-96 years). All specimens were thawed to room temperature before experimentation. No limbs had visual evidence of prior shoulder surgery or trauma. All shoulders maintained at least 160° of passive abduction and 160° of passive forward flexion.</p>
<p>Specimens were positioned supine on the operating table with an arm board. The open subpectoral biceps approach, as described by Mazzocca et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457654">15</xref></sup> was performed by 2 investigators. With the arm abducted and internally rotated, the pectoralis major tendon was identified. A 4-cm incision was made in the medial third of the arm. The incision began 1 cm superior to the inferior border of the pectoralis tendon and ended 3 cm below the inferior border.</p>
<p>A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was used to expose the fascia of the pectoralis major, coracobrachialis, and the long head of the biceps (LHB). Palpation was used to identify the inferior border of the pectoralis major and the fusiform LHB coursing underneath. As originally described, a pointed Hohman retractor was placed directly against the lateral aspect of the humerus to proximally and laterally retract the pectoralis major tendon. A blunt Chandler retractor was placed medially to retract the coracobrachialis and short head of the biceps. The retractors were positioned on the medial and lateral borders of the humerus and centered at the point where the LHB intersected the inferior border of the pectoralis major.</p>
<p>A right-angle clamp was used to deliver the LHB out of the bicipital groove, and the proximal tendon was sharply transected, which left 15 mm of tendon proximal to the musculotendinous junction. A Krackow stitch was placed in the remaining tendon using a nonabsorbable No. 2 multifilament polyester suture (Arthrex, Naples, Florida). One centimeter proximal to the inferior border of the pectoralis major and centered at the inferior aspect of the bicipital groove, a guidewire was placed to identify and represent the proposed tenodesis site. The correct tenodesis position was confirmed in all specimens when the musculotendinous portion of the long head of the biceps rested at the inferior border of the pectoralis major tendon. To facilitate subsequent identification of neurovascular structures, a tenodesis screw was not placed.</p>
<p>A careful dissection was then performed, and structures were measured in a straight line from the at-risk structure to the preassigned reference points (described below) using standard digital calipers. Subcutaneous dissection was performed to identify the cephalic vein, medial brachial cutaneous nerve, medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve, and the intercostal brachial cutaneous nerve. Superficial structures were measured from the superior and inferior aspect of the 4-cm incision. Deep dissection was performed to identify the brachial artery, deep brachial artery, brachial vein, musculocutaneous nerve, median nerve, axillary nerve, and radial nerve. With the arm in the recommended position of 30° of abduction and neutral rotation, the deep structures were measured from the tenodesis site and the nearest retractor. Additionally, the musculocutaneous nerve was measured with the arm in 45° of internal rotation and 45° of external rotation to determine the effect of rotation on the musculocutaneous nerve. Care was taken to minimize dissection and measure each structure in its native anatomic location.</p>
<sec id="section9-0363546512457654">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>The paired Student <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the mean distance of the musculocutaneous nerve in internal, neutral, and external rotation. The distance between the deep structures and the medially placed retractor was compared using the paired Student <italic>t</italic> test.</p>

<p>Limited series have evaluated the outcomes following OSPBT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512457654">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457654">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup> The incidence of complications after open subpectoral tenodesis have been reported to be between 2% and 7%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457654">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup> however, the incidence of musculocutaneous neurapraxia following OSPBT is not reported. Nho et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup> in the largest clinical series of OSPBT, reviewed the complications in 353 patients and found a 2.0% complication rate. Persistent bicipital pain and failure of fixation with a Popeye deformity were the most common complications (0.57% each). One patient (0.28%) developed a musculocutaneous nerve neuropathy, which presented 10 days postoperatively with forearm numbness and weakness in elbow flexion and forearm supination 6 weeks postoperatively. Musculocutaneous nerve exploration 6 weeks after the index surgery demonstrated the nerve was in continuity, and at 6 months postoperatively, the patient had complete resolution of the neurologic deficits.</p>
<p>Ma et al reported another case of musculocutaneous nerve injury after OSPBT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457654">12</xref></sup> Five months after OSPBT, the patient underwent musculocutaneous nerve exploration, which demonstrated that the long head of the biceps tendon was transferred deep to the nerve, providing continued traction on the nerve. The nerve was found to be in continuity, and after revision of the tenodesis, with placement of the long head of the biceps superficial to the nerve, the patient regained full neurological function.</p>
<p>The proximity of the musculocutaneous nerve to the tenodesis site makes it the most at-risk structure during OSPBT. Additionally, the use of a deep, levering medial retractor places the nerve at increased risk of iatrogenic injury. The mean distance from the medial retractor to the musculocutaneous nerve with the arm in internal rotation was 2.9 ± 1.4 mm, and in 18% of specimens, the nerve was in direct contact with the retractor. Therefore, if the surgeon’s preference is for medial retraction of the conjoined tendon and medial soft tissues, then a nonlevering retractor with gentle retraction during the critical portions of the procedure is recommended to minimize iatrogenic injury to the musculocutaneous nerve.</p>
<p>External rotation of the arm significantly increased the distance from the tenodesis site by 11.3 mm. Open subpectoral biceps tenodesis is frequently performed after shoulder arthroscopy in either the lateral decubitus or beach-chair position. Mounted arm positioners may also be used to minimize the need for a surgical assistant and improve arthroscopic visualization. However, these techniques limit the ability to safely position the extremity for OSPBT. We recommend positioning the arm in an externally rotated position to maximize the distance of the musculocutaneous nerve from the operative field.</p>
<p>Although no reported deep brachial artery or radial nerve injuries have been reported with OSPBT, the location of these structures as they course lateral and posterior into the spiral groove immediately posterior to the tenodesis is demonstrated and may represent a potential site of injury. Cox et al reported that the radial nerve traversed the midpoint of the spiral groove 14.7 ± 2.2 cm distal to the greater tuberosity of the humerus at a point approximately 48% from the most proximal point of the humerus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457654">5</xref></sup> Guse and Ostrum found that the radial nerve passed posterior to the medial cortex of the humerus at a point 41% of the humeral length (12.4 ± 1.2 cm from the acromion) and exited the spiral groove lateral to the lateral cortex of the humerus at a point 58% of the humeral length (17.6 ± 1.7 cm from the tip of the acromion).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457654">9</xref></sup> A medially placed retractor that penetrates the fascia of the short head of the biceps may come into direct contact with the radial nerve and deep brachial artery as they course into the spiral groove. Additionally, inadvertent bicortical drill penetration during tenodesis preparation may compromise the structures within the spiral groove. In all specimens, the structures of the spiral groove were within 1.5 cm and at the level of the proposed tenodesis site. Drilling techniques to avoid bicortical penetration of the proximal humerus should be employed. Knowledge of the proximity and location of these structures may prevent iatrogenic injury.</p>
<p>There have been no cases of axillary nerve or artery damage after OSPBT. Although unlikely, a retractor placed on the lateral humerus under the pectoral major muscle may jeopardize the axillary nerve if vigorously retracted. In this series, the axillary nerve was a mean 11.5 ± 4.3 mm from the retractor. Care should be taken to limit deep placement and excessive force during lateral retraction.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. The study did not evaluate the anatomic relationships and at-risk structures associated with an axillary incision. We recognize that OSPBT is often performed after shoulder arthroscopy and infiltration of the shoulder joint and surrounding structures may alter normal anatomy. This variable was not controlled for in this cadaveric study. Second, we acknowledge that the type of retractor used and placement of retractors will vary based on surgeon preference and experience. The type and placement of retractors used in this study were selected based on the previously described surgical technique for OSPBT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457654">15</xref></sup> Previously reported complications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457654">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457654">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457654">17</xref></sup> as well as this anatomic series, suggest that the musculocutaneous nerve is particularly vulnerable throughout this procedure, especially with the arm in an internally rotated position. External rotation of the arm significantly increases the distance of the musculocutaneous nerve from the operative field. Additionally, the proximity of the radial nerve and deep brachial artery to the tenodesis site makes this an important consideration when preparing the tenodesis site. With increased acceptance and expanded use of the OSPBT technique, increased complication rates are plausible. However, these complications can be reduced by careful technique and improved understanding of the applied anatomy.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>When performing OSPBT, the musculocutaneous nerve, radial nerve, and deep brachial artery are within 1 cm of the standard levering medial retractor. Gentle retraction and nonlevering retractors should be used to avoid iatrogenic injury to these deep structures. External rotation of the arm significantly increases the distance of the musculocutaneous nerve from the tenodesis site compared with the internally rotated position. External rotation of the arm is recommended to minimize the risk of iatrogenic musculocutaneous nerve injury during OSPBT.</p>
