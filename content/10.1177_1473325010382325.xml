<abstract>
<p>As women on parole and probation transition from correctional facilities to the community, they face many threats to reintegration. Reintegration counsellors offer support to individuals on parole and probation who are re-entering the community. Working closely with a marginalized population places counsellors at risk for burnout and hopelessness. Research indicates that hope can serve as a sustaining and motivating factor when facing difficult working contexts. Further, a large body of research consistently confirms the importance of hope in the human change process, both for clients and clinicians. The current study investigated how reintegration counsellors fostered and maintained hope in their work, including their personal descriptions of hope. Employing Merriam’s (2002) basic interpretive inquiry, five reintegration counsellors participated in semi-structured interviews about their work experiences. Thematic analysis indicated that hope played an important role in these counsellors’ experiences of work and their belief in their clients. The overarching theme of the findings, Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation, elucidates the complexity of maintaining a hope-seeking orientation in the challenging context of reintegration counselling. Specifically, participants in this study were understood to hold a hope-seeking orientation to their worklife that included, viewing life as a journey, maintaining a hopeful perspective, holding ‘down-to-earth’ expectations, and viewing hope-seeking as a learnable skill. Participants associated hope with both motivation and meaning, believing that hope was a necessary ingredient in their work and a resource to combat work-related exhaustion. Implications for counselling include sustaining hope at work through a variety of means, including perspective change.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously headed for success, but rather, an ability to work for something because it is good, not just because it has a chance to succeed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325010382325">Havel, 2004</xref>: 82)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Reintegration counsellors work with convicts transitioning from correctional facilities into the community. These helping professionals, work with individuals facing some of life’s most difficult circumstances including poverty, addictions, and legal issues, often within the context of poor life skills, struggles for employment, and limited housing options. Reintegration counsellors typically offer community resource referrals, life skills instruction, and counselling. The work is difficult and the impact on reintegration workers can be significant. An extensive literature search revealed no research examining the working experiences of reintegration counsellors, nevertheless, the importance of this work and its inherent difficulties are apparent.</p>
<p>As a former reintegration counsellor, the first author (K.F.) witnessed the challenges of reintegration work for clients and counsellors, along with the hopes that both often seemed able to access during especially dark times. While research is silent on the role of hope in the work of reintegration counsellors, meta-analyses of psychotherapy and psycho-educational research reveal that hope is a crucial factor in the change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325010382325">Hubble et al., 1999</xref>). Leading researchers assert that effective counselling involves ‘relationships that traffic in hopeful thinking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325010382325">Snyder, 1994</xref>: 289) especially during times of great difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325010382325">Hanna, 2002</xref>). Given the dearth of research on reintegration work and the role that hope may play in it, this exploratory qualitative study was designed to examine working accounts of experienced reintegration counsellors and their reflections on hope in their work.</p>
<p>Seeking an in-depth understanding of reintegration counselling work, this qualitative study explores the accounts of five experienced reintegration counsellors. The article begins with a review of literature informing the work of reintegration counselling, followed by a description of the research methodology. The findings offer an insider view of the role of hope within reintegration counselling, providing insight into the challenges of reintegration work along with the role of hope in sustaining counsellors engaged in this type of work.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1473325010382325"><title>LITERATURE REVIEW</title>
<sec id="sec3-1473325010382325"><title>Challenges Facing Women on Parole and Probation</title>
<p>In North America, women are the fastest growing prisoner population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325010382325">Bloom et al., 2003</xref>). Incarcerated women face a variety of challenges, including prior victimization, coping skills deficits, and addictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325010382325">Green et al., 2005</xref>). One-on-one meetings with reintegration counsellors (e.g. social workers and prison liaisons) are a well-utilized method for facilitating transitions back into the community. Tackling the challenges of working with a marginalized population, like women on parole/probation, demands high energy, relational commitment, and resilience in the face of setbacks. Facing these types of challenges can also seriously threaten counsellors’ hope and therapeutic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325010382325">Koenig and Spano, 2007</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325010382325"><title>Challenges Facing Reintegration Counsellors</title>
<p>Reintegration counselling is often emotionally draining work. Administrators in the field report that counsellors can face exhaustion from working with clients who give up because of seemingly constant challenges or because clients are simply not ready to make life changes (Toni Sinclair<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473325010382325">1</xref></sup>, personal communication, 13 December 2008). In a narrative case study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473325010382325">Terrell and Staller (2003)</xref> describe the ‘enormous emotional toll’ (p. 14) working with incarcerated inmates has on social workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325010382325">Edey and Jevne (2003)</xref> comment further on the emotional fatigue associated with working with clients in these types of situations, writing ‘it is difficult to be hopeful in the presence of those clients who don’t change, don’t try, and won’t take advice’ (p. 46). Jevne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325010382325">Jevne and Nekolaichuk, 2003</xref>), an influential hope scholar, takes this a step further. ‘Professionals must find a way of sustaining a hopeful orientation in the presence of those who don’t comply with treatment, don’t get well, won’t take advice, and don’t convey a sense of appreciation’ (p. 197). To create meaningful, practical strategies to support reintegration counsellors’ hopeful engagement, their experiences of hope must first be understood.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1473325010382325"><title>To Offer Hope, One Must Have Hope</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473325010382325">Stephenson’s (1991)</xref> illuminating review of the construct of hope as ‘a process of anticipation that involves the interaction of thinking, acting, feeling, and relating, and is directed toward a future fulfillment that is personally meaningful’ (p. 1459) offers a multidimensional perspective of hope useful in counselling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325010382325">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>). Counsellor hope is increasingly understood as an important factor in therapeutic effectiveness. A counsellor who genuinely believes in the client and can communicate this belief both holds and offers hope to the client. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325010382325">Edey and Jevne (2003)</xref> remark that hope is ‘the fuel that keeps the counsellor going’ (p. 45). Research consistently reveals that professional care-giving relationships serve as key sources of client hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325010382325">Eliott and Olver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325010382325">Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473325010382325">Wong-Wylie and Jevne, 1997</xref>). Similarly, research on professional burnout supports the claim that hope is ‘an essential attribute of effective social work clinicians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325010382325">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>: 105). Nevertheless, how hope is experienced within social work contexts has received little attention.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325010382325"><title>Hope and Burnout</title>
<p>Research on the impact of long-term exposure to client problems finds that helping professionals are prone to frustration and emotional exhaustion, major contributors to the development of work-related burnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325010382325">Horowitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473325010382325">Ratliff, 1988</xref>). Professional burnout is defined as ‘a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473325010382325">Maslach and Jackson, 1986</xref>: 1). Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473325010382325">Snyder (1994)</xref> defines burnout as the absence of hope. Given the emotional strain of working closely with recently released parolees, reintegration counsellors are at risk for burnout and loss of hope. Recognizing the strain on professionals working in the rehabilitation context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325010382325">Collins and Kuehn (2004)</xref> suggest that coping with everyday and extraordinary client-situations ‘is not likely to be accomplished without a healthy level of hope’ (p. 181).</p>
<p>Given the established importance of hope in the counselling context, how counsellors sustain hope and face inevitable threats to hope in the course of challenging work becomes an important consideration. The current study investigated how reintegration counsellors’ describe hope within their working contexts – with specific interest in how hope may be challenged, fostered, and sustained in their work.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1473325010382325"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN</title>
<p>This study utilized a basic interpretive approach to qualitative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473325010382325">Merriam, 2002</xref>), a flexible research methodology well-suited to exploring new domains because of its emphases on (a) in-depth description, (b) understanding how participants interpret and create meaning from experience, and (c) the active role of the researcher. Basic interpretive inquiry draws from a constructivist epistemology presupposing that ‘meanings are constructed by human beings as they engage with the world they are interpreting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325010382325">Crotty, 1998</xref>: 43). Constructivism proposes that reality is individually constructed, socially influenced, and open to multiple interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325010382325">Crotty, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325010382325">Patton, 2002</xref>). Given this epistemological orientation, the authors acknowledge their constructivist influence in this research, including their influence on the research questions and conversations as well as the research interpretations and write-up.</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of quality standards and the professional ethics of conducting responsible systematic research, the authors attended to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325010382325">Elliott, Fischer and Rennie’s (1999)</xref> seven standards for high-quality qualitative research, including (a) explicit description of the scientific context (e.g. within existing research literature) and intended purpose of the research, (b) choice of appropriate research methods, (c) respect for participants, (d) specification of methods, (e) appropriate discussion of data and their relevance, (f) clarity of presentation, and (g) contribution of knowledge to the academic community. Both Elliott et al. and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325010382325">Crotty (1998)</xref> remind us that reflecting upon and naming the researchers’ understandings are important to the context of understanding interpretive, constructivist research. The authors emphasize the care taken to attend to our interpretive role as researchers by exploring and naming our prior understandings relative to hope and reintegration counselling. As such, both researchers were well-versed in hope literature and the first author had previously been a reintegration counsellor. While these qualities allowed us to bring expertise to the study, they also required us to engage thoughtfully in all aspects of the research process to remain open to participants’ unique stories and avoid simply applying our preconceptions to their accounts. Further, we acknowledge the limited truth claims a constructivist orientation behoves; hence, we embrace this epistemological perspective with the modest intention of contributing understandings that can prove useful regarding the potential role of hope in reintegration counselling.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1473325010382325"><title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were selected using complementary practices of purposeful and snowball sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473325010382325">Patton, 2002</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1473325010382325">2</xref></sup>. As selection criteria we chose participants who: (a) currently worked with women on parole/probation or who had ceased this work within six months of their research interviews, (b) had worked with women on parole/probation for at least eighteen months, and (c) occupied a role emphasizing support rather than discipline. Participants in this study were five women who worked with women on parole/probation in a large western Canadian city. Focusing on the area of women’s reintegration allowed access to a relatively smaller population of potential participants, as women represent less than 10% of the correctional population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325010382325">Beattie, 2006</xref>), which simultaneously limits the number of reintegration counsellors working in this field. The investigators limited their selection of counsellors to those working with women because of differing circumstances facing female versus male offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325010382325">Salisbury and Van Voorhis, 2009</xref>) which could potentially impact counsellors’ working experiences. For example, women typically enter the criminal justice system through pathways involving childhood victimization, dysfunctional relationships, or lack of social/human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473325010382325">Salisbury and Van Voorhis, 2009</xref>) which differ from the ways men reportedly enter criminal activity. Participants engaged in reintegration counselling through various agencies and held occupational titles including: therapist, chaplain, community support worker, and prison liaison. At their highest level of education, two participants possessed diplomas in Social Work, two held Bachelor’s degrees, and one participant held two Master’s degrees. Participants had worked with women on parole/probation between three and thirty-one years.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1473325010382325"><title>Data Collection and Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were collected by the first author (K.F.) during individual semi-structured interviews lasting between sixty and one-hundred minutes. The interviews offered space to engage in the collaborative process of exchanging information and building understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325010382325">Fontana and Frey, 2005</xref>). Interview questions explored work-related experiences that encouraged and threatened hope, as well as counsellors’ perception of the role of hope for both themselves and their clients. In qualitative research, data collection and data analysis are not mutually exclusive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325010382325">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Therefore, the authors began research analysis and discussions following the first interview. In addition, a research journal was maintained throughout the course of the study to record personal observations, emerging ideas, and the researchers’ role in the research process.</p>
<p>Data were analysed using thematic analysis, ‘a method for identifying, analysing, and reporting patterns (themes) within the data’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325010382325">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>: 79). Following transcription of the interviews, it was important to read and re-read the transcripts to become familiar with the material, coding and creating tentative categories containing similar ideas and apparent patterns. Taking the research lead (K.F.) consulted on an ongoing basis with the second author (D.L.) regarding interpretation, coding, and categorization. On occasion, differences of interpretation existed, leading the authors to engage in thoughtful dialogue regarding the meaning of the text. With respect to the methods themselves, first order themes tended to be descriptive of content and patterns. Subsequently, categories were more interpretative in nature, based on similar content, processes, and language across the themes. From a constructivist perspective, we acknowledge our active role in the analytic process, preferring to think of our analysis as carefully <italic>constructing</italic> themes and categories rather than <italic>discovering emergent themes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325010382325">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Following data analysis and the writing process, participants were sent a copy of the findings for their review and feedback. Although little feedback was given, the authors considered it important that participants be offered opportunities to respond.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1473325010382325"><title>FINDINGS</title>
<p>Hope appeared to be a worklife theme easily discussed by the participants in the context of their personal and professional stories. Through the interview and analysis process, it became apparent that hope formed a meaningful worldview, or at least a <italic>workview</italic>, that framed many work experiences of the study participants. As such, the overarching theme of our findings is entitled <italic>Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation.</italic> Within this theme, several sub-themes elucidated the complexity of maintaining a hope-seeking orientation in the context of reintegration counselling, including: (a) <italic>understandings of hope,</italic> (b) <italic>life is a journey</italic>, (c) <italic>hope maintained through life perspective</italic>, (d) <italic>hope maintained by ‘down-to-earth’ expectations</italic>, and (d) <italic>finding hope is a learnable skill</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec11-1473325010382325"><title>Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation</title>
<p><italic>Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation</italic> related specifically to the worldview, participating reintegration counsellors appeared to bring to their work. Worldview has been defined as a set of presuppositions individuals hold about the basic makeup of their world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1473325010382325">Sire, 2004</xref>). For reintegration counsellors, hope was seen as a necessary ingredient in their work. For example, Emily described how she needed to hold hope in the ongoing process of client change, especially when facing setbacks: ‘I have to believe that there’s still another step, and if I lose that hope then it’s gonna be pretty hard for me to be as beneficial for them as I could be’. Roberta also shared how hope was crucial for herself, as a professional and for her clients:<disp-quote>
<p>We need to, often if [clients] have made a mistake, rebuild on that hope. In terms of relapse, it’s a part of the addiction process, right? We expect relapse. So we have to make sure that doesn’t diminish our clients’ hope and make sure it doesn’t affect our own.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Striving to maintain a hopeful orientation, created a vital work perspective that sustained counsellors through client difficulties and times when the counsellor’s own hope could be threatened. The counsellors also believed that maintaining a hope-seeking perspective allowed them to offer hope at times when clients’ own hope for successful reintegration was challenged.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325010382325"><title>Understandings of Hope</title>
<p>Participants’ conceptualizations and descriptions of hope underscore its importance in their worklife accounts. Specifically, reintegration workers described hope as an important source of motivation or inspiration. Hope provided the energy necessary to face challenging work situations, believing that a good future was possible. In addition, hope was described as addressing several key concepts including temporality, relationships, necessity, and meaning.</p>
<p><italic>Temporality.</italic> Maya and Roberta spoke often about their hopes that clients would continue making changes leading to healthier, happier, and safer lives. A future orientation is one of the most commonly cited attributes of hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325010382325">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, speaking about hope in future terms opens the door to as yet unrealized possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325010382325">Collins and Kuehn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325010382325">Dufault and Martocchio, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325010382325">Jevne and Nekolaichuk, 2003</xref>). For example, Roberta viewed the future as unscripted. As she put it, ‘Hope is when we see possibilities, when we see potential in ourselves, when we see potential in others, when there’s a greater good.’ Further, Ursa and Ann spoke about hope as a present-oriented phenomenon. In these terms, hope was believed to be ever-present in situations, waiting to be uncovered in simple moments or notable insights. Rather than questioning whether hope could be found in the present, Ursa and Ann simply assumed the presence of hope.</p>
<p><italic>Relationships.</italic> Meaningful connections with others, a higher power, and oneself are a recurrent theme within psychosocial research on hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325010382325">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>). Participants in this research repeatedly echoed the importance of relationships to hope. For example, Ursa was emphatic about how community and spirituality were essential to hope, stating:<disp-quote>
<p>I think feeling good and having a place in the world that’s healthy, where you belong, [and] where the Creator has decided that you belong – and people being kind to each other – that’s hope in a huge way. Everybody’s kind to each other, everybody feels together, like there’s a sense of togetherness and everybody’s a family.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Necessity.</italic> Reintegration workers described hope as essential to their work and to life. Indeed, the thought of facing the challenges of reintegration without hope threatened the very possibility of being able to do their work. Various researchers have also asserted that hope is necessary when facing serious life difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473325010382325">Morse and Doberneck, 1995</xref>), though perhaps, none more potently than Ann, a counsellor in this research:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s what keeps me alive. I don’t know how else to put that. What it means to me is that, I couldn’t do this work if I didn’t believe in people’s ability to be good people … It just means it’s what life is about. [It] is about hope and spreading hope and encouraging that and not taking it away from people.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Meaning.</italic> Ann’s last quote hints at the close relationship she made between meaning and hope. Other participants echoed this notion, suggesting that if purpose and potential could be found in a struggle, there was hope. Maya’s description was simple yet powerful: ‘[Hope means] that I or anyone else can become who [we were] created to be’. For Maya, finding a meaningful personal purpose in the midst of suffering offered hope. Others who have suffered personal traumas share this conviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325010382325">Harris and Larsen, 2007</xref>). Vaclav <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325010382325">Havel (2004)</xref>, a former political prisoner and president of the Czech Republic, describes how the promise of meaning in the face of struggle offers hope and encourages one to keep trying:<disp-quote>
<p>[Hope] is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out … It is … hope, above all which gives us the strength to live and continually to try new things, even in conditions that seem as hopeless as ours do … . (pp. 82–3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, the conviction or belief in a meaningful future inspired hope and perseverance for reintegration counsellors in this study. As Emily put it, ‘I’ve said “believe” a lot and I think belief and hope for me, kind of, coincide. If you believe in someone, you have hope, right?’ Further, holding hope offered Emily confidence in the midst of uncertainty. When she <italic>believed</italic> in something, she did not know the outcome, but she held firmly to the possibility that it could be good. Further, Emily had come to believe that hope was a subtle, yet constant presence in her work: ‘Sometimes [hope]’s ingrained, so it just happens, without actually thinking about it’.</p>
<p>Reintegration counsellors clearly viewed hope as a motivating and sustaining force in their work. The importance of hope may have been especially clear to these participants given the serious client issues they face. Reintegration counsellors identified four key means by which they supported their own hope during their work: (a) viewing life as a journey, (b) life perspective, (c) maintaining ‘down-to-earth’ expectations, and (d) understanding that hope is a learnable skill. It is toward these themes that we now turn our attention.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325010382325"><title>Life is a Journey</title>
<p>The duties of reintegration counsellors were described by participants as unpredictable and difficult. Speaking about journeys, paths, and walking together was a common way participants described their working relationships with clients. As Maya put it, ‘My job is to journey with them’. Viewing counselling as a journey highlighted the relational aspect of reintegration work. The therapeutic relationship allowed participants the opportunity to build hope as they observed change and small successes accumulating over time, even in the face of serious setbacks.</p>
<p>Viewing life as a journey seemed to offer a hopeful stance for these counsellors because they recognized that client journeys were ongoing and uncompleted. During client difficulties, such as addictions relapses, counsellors remembered client growth in the past and used these memories as evidence for the possibility of positive future developments. Describing the ups and downs which often occurred during life’s journey for women on parole/probation, Maya stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I get the privilege of having been around with them enough to have seen the worst … and to be able to … affirm the hope of this [as a] continuing, healing journey. Or to have seen the best. And they’re sitting in front of me feeling the worst and able to say ‘Remember when you were going to your meetings? When you had done treatment? … You told me then that you were feeling lots better about yourself and things were going better. That place is still a place that you know how to go to’.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Knowing that peaks and valleys were inevitable in life seemed to support the counsellors’ hope, which they then tried to impart to clients.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1473325010382325"><title>Hope Maintained Through Life Perspective</title>
<p>Having a hopeful perspective appeared to allow participants to cope with the challenges of their job by recognizing that hope intermingled with sorrow in life. Instead of focusing solely on major life changing transformations, participants chose hopeful perspectives that permitted identification of seemingly simple glimmers of hope. Searching for hope in both positive and negative situations seemed to help participants cope with the potentially defeating or overwhelming circumstances that faced clients. In a poignant example, Ursa described how she found hope by reminding herself that returning to prison for a reason other than committing a new criminal offence was a hopeful sign for one of her clients.</p>
<p>Indeed, intentionally shifting perspectives on a situation was one way that participants sought to support their own sense of hope when facing difficulty with clients. Emily described the impact that taking a new look at a situation had when she stated, ‘I think it’s hope-rebuilding and [provides] self-care as a worker. Just needing to reassess the situation’. The counsellors in this study also described changing perspectives as they attempted to uncover hope with clients as well. In one example, Maya discussed the idea of finding hope intermingled with the pain of life by switching viewpoints and sharing it with clients. She offered:<disp-quote>
<p>I call us ‘Rainbow People’. That at any one given time we’re not all black or we’re not all yellow, we’re not all blue. And so part of helping someone articulate hope is helping them when they’re feeling black and purple and blue, to see that yellow and green and red are still happening in different places in their life.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In the face of setbacks, actively seeking out hope and remembering that hopeful stories remain available, were valuable ways for counsellors to maintain a hopeful outlook in their work.</p>
<p>Participants’ shared several simple strategies they used to support their hopeful perspective. For example, participants identified how their work made them grateful for blessings in their own lives. Other practical ways participants supported a hopeful perspective included having a sense of humour, acknowledging simple, concrete successes (e.g. completing a row of knitting), and reminding themselves of the positive impact they knew they had made in clients’ lives. Finally, even while speaking about work-related challenges, participants often ended with statements about the fulfilment and meaning they found at work.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec15-1473325010382325"><title>Hope Maintained by ‘Down-to-Earth’ Expectations</title>
<p>While looking for hope in every situation, participants expressed very down-to-earth perspectives on reintegration work and their clients’ lives. Each participant spoke at length about the challenges women faced while transitioning into the community and the difficulties of working with this population. Indeed, Maya talked about overcoming obstacles as a natural, necessary part of life, experienced by all. Instead of viewing re-incarceration as an end, Ann viewed it as part of the larger process of client change and transition:<disp-quote>
<p>I have hope when, even if a women is out [of the correctional facility] for a period of time and she ends up going back. I have hope that next time she journeys out that she’s found some skills. Not … that she’ll never go back again, but I’m hopeful that that piece of that journey is only going to make her stronger for next time.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>These perspectives seemed to help participants take apparent setbacks in-stride.</p>
<p>Although each participant adamantly stated her conviction about the importance of hope in reintegration counselling, they all admitted there were times when hope seemed problematic. Participants’ main concern about explicitly using hope appeared to be fear of disrespecting clients’ experiences of suffering and hardship. Jokingly, Maya referred to hope as ‘the old four letter word’. Throughout the interview, Maya balanced her belief that hope was vital with her perception that using the word <italic>hope</italic> in counselling could, at times, be difficult for struggling clients. Similarly, Ann expressed, ‘It can sound very shallow and hollow to say, “There’s hope around the corner.” ’ Inherent in participants’ concerns was the idea that hope needed to be shared in a way that honoured client fears and difficulties.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1473325010382325"><title>Finding Hope is a Learnable Skill</title>
<p>In terms of sustaining their own hope, participants talked about finding and utilizing hope as a skill that took effort. ‘I think keeping hope, as a worker in this field, takes work. It isn’t just there’ remarked Emily. Further, Maya noted that not all reintegration counsellors who worked with women on parole/probation hold a particularly hopeful perspective:<disp-quote>
<p>I see people in the field who burn out really easily, because they’re either not able to seek or find hope within themselves. Or they’re not able to be aware, or could care less about being aware of moments of hope.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, after practicing from a hopeful perspective for many years, Maya described her own hope-seeking orientation as an ingrained way of thinking and acting. Like any skill, recognizing and using hope may have become easier with practice.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec17-1473325010382325" sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec18-1473325010382325"><title>A Hope-Seeking Orientation</title>
<p>Despite the often heart-wrenching and seemingly helpless situations counsellors in this study faced with clients, each participant related her active efforts to find small rays of hope for both herself and her clients. The overarching theme of this study, <italic>Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation,</italic> describes the hopeful workview that oriented participants to their role and impact on their work<italic>.</italic> Participants oriented to their work around the perspective that a better future was possible for clients and that the reintegration counsellor was an important collaborator in its co-creation. Ingrained within this orientation were participants’ beliefs that hope was both necessary and, with effort, available for both clients and themselves. Indeed, research within positive psychology parallels participants’ belief in the importance of hope to a satisfying worklife. In a large scale survey of character strengths (i.e. positive traits reflected in thoughts, feelings, and behaviours), hope was strongly and consistently associated with life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473325010382325">Park et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholarship suggests that hope offers an orientation to life along with an active behavioural response. Research consistently associates elevated hope with motivation and action in the service of change or goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325010382325">Cheavens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325010382325">Hubble et al., 1999</xref>). Participants in this study shared this perception of hope as a source of motivation and inspiration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325010382325">Jevne (2005)</xref> proposes the idea of hope as ‘<italic>an orientation</italic>, and <italic>hoping</italic> as <italic>a search behaviour, as a way of orienting ourselves as we search for that which will enable the optimal physical or emotional survival</italic>’ [italics in original] (p. 269). Further, from a rehabilitation perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325010382325">Collins and Kuehn (2004)</xref> characterize a hopeful orientation as ‘looking forward to something with desire and confidence, or having an expectation of something desired’ (p. 176). From a clinical social work perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473325010382325">Shechter (1999)</xref> confirms the link between a hopeful orientation and action describing hope as a trait that ‘organizes practice behaviour’ (p. 372). Finally, in her case study of a domestic shelter worker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325010382325">Bernard (2000)</xref> portrays hope as a worldview: ‘Through this hopeful lens human nature is viewed in a positive fashion and there is a strong belief in the human ability to create positive change’ (p. 71). Collectively, these studies along with the current one point to a hopeful workview as an important and active orientation for facing client struggle.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec19-1473325010382325"><title>Hope as Protective for Counsellors</title>
<p>Participants in this study associate hope with motivation and meaning, believing that hope is a necessary ingredient in sustaining themselves at work. Indeed, Maya made a direct connection between lack of hope and increased professional burnout. Research indicates that a personal sense of hope reinforces the ability to cope with employment-related stressors for social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325010382325">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473325010382325">Shechter, 1999</xref>), mental health practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325010382325">Dufrane and Leclair, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325010382325">Edey and Jevne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325010382325">Frost, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473325010382325">Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473325010382325">Sutherland, 1993</xref>), and front-line, community workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325010382325">Bernard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325010382325">Janzen, 2001</xref>). For example, higher hope has been related to lower perceived burnout for social workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473325010382325">Schwartz et al., 2007</xref>) and nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473325010382325">Sherwin et al., 1992</xref>). As a source of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325010382325">Edey and Jevne, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473325010382325">Snyder et al., 1991</xref>), hope can offer reintegration counsellors avenues to address work-related exhaustion. As such, hope may act as a protective factor for reintegration counsellors facing difficult client situations.</p>
<p>When facing adversity, hope does not negate struggle but it may sustain participants’ effort and morale by emphasizing that the future still holds unwritten possibilities. Social and health sciences literature is replete with descriptions of the importance of balancing perspectives that both seek hope and respect despair (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325010382325">Flaskas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325010382325">Jevne, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473325010382325">Shechter (1999)</xref> proposes that hope assists social workers to envision hopeful possibilities, even in the midst of client tragedies. Indeed, the need for hope may be most fully understood in adverse circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325010382325">Fromm, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473325010382325">Sutherland, 1993</xref>), like the ones faced by reintegration counsellors. Recognizing the need for hope when facing adversity, counsellors sought to remain vigilant for hope while simultaneously contending with the frustrations engendered by addiction relapses and re-incarceration.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec20-1473325010382325"><title>Hope and Perspective Change</title>
<p>Participants described changing perspectives as a hope-sustaining strategy for both themselves and their clients. Sharing her belief on the importance of one’s perspective when seeking hope during difficulty, Ann stated, ‘You have to look at it differently. It’s just a matter of finding another angle to find that seed of hope’. Similarly, in a study of HIV peer counselling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325010382325">Harris and Larsen (2007)</xref> found that changes in perception were one of the benefits for clients receiving peer counselling. During peer counselling, participants shifted their ‘cognitive framework’ (p. 851), expanding their understandings of personal circumstances and gaining new hope. Further, in a study of therapists’ use of hope in early counselling sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325010382325">Larsen and Stege, 2010</xref>), facilitating perspective changes served as a key means to foster client hope. Therapeutic perspective-changing mechanisms employed to foster client hope within their study included: reframes, metaphors, sharing personal stories, externalization, and humour.</p>
<p>Reintegration counsellors in the current study also described using metaphors, reframes, humour, and stories to change perspectives on circumstances for both themselves and their clients. For example, the <italic>journey</italic> metaphor used by counsellors in this study offered powerful imagery within which to frame client successes and failures during reintegration. All of the participants in this study described how they altered their perspective to recognize and acknowledge even the smallest success. When asked by individuals about the success of a program she ran, Roberta stated explicitly, ‘I always say “Yes. But I define success differently than, probably what you do” ’. Ann offered an example where she combined both reframing and humour. Recalling a conversation with a client overcoming an addiction, Ann recounted, ‘It is a change of perspective. It’s “Yeah, this has gone wrong. [That] has gone wrong. Yeah, your dog died. But did you use?” ’ Joking with the client, Ann reframed the client’s difficult situation as an opportunity for drug-use that was resisted and overcome. Finally, all of the participants in this study shared how they used both personal and professional stories to encourage clients to take a different perspective and see possibilities for change. The stories, perceptions, and possibilities that reintegration counsellors emphasized in their work supported them when handling stressors and uncovering hope.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-1473325010382325"><title>Hope as a Skill to be Learned</title>
<p>Studies on hope across of variety of difficult life circumstances indicate that hope can require hard work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325010382325">Hinds and Martin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473325010382325">Turner, 2005</xref>). Reflecting on the need for hope as a professional caregiver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325010382325">Jevne (2005)</xref> goes so far as to assert that nurturing one’s hope is a professional competency that requires both effort and learning. Within this study, participants described hope as a skill that both counsellors and clients can learn over time. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitively-based interventions designed to teach hopeful thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325010382325">Cheavens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325010382325">Klausner et al., 1998</xref>). Further, the field of positive psychology emphasizes ‘the identification of affirmative resources and strategies to support “learned hopefulness” ’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325010382325">Hollis et al., 2007</xref>: 53). Reflective practice with an intentionally hopeful orientation can be utilized to address hope in difficult situations. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325010382325">Larsen et al. (2007)</xref> offer a number of reflective questions designed to support an explicitly hope-focused perspective, such as, ‘What would a hopeful person do in this situation?’ (p. 412). By practicing with a hope-seeking orientation, reintegration counsellors may bolster their ability to find hope and new possibilities, potentially sustaining their ability to work in the midst of painful client situations.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec22-1473325010382325"><title>Limitations of the Study and Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>Qualitative inquiry provides an opportunity for rich, in-depth descriptions of a phenomenon. Due to the clearly defined focus of this research, including a small sample size and a specialized population, care should be taken in making generalizations. However, this study offers new knowledge about reintegration work and the ways hope may be used by reintegration counsellors while working towards better futures for clients, even in the midst of adversity.</p>
<p>Considering future research, all counsellors in this study were females working with female clients. Men who work with this population may possess differing accounts of hope during reintegration work than those found in this study. Future studies could purposefully seek out male reintegration counsellors to gain their perspectives. In addition, research examining the experiences of reintegration counsellors working with male clientele would provide much needed information about any similarities or differences between work with male and female clientele. Also, participants in this research held no disciplinary responsibilities with their clients. The role of probation and parole officers requires a complex combination of support, surveillance, and discipline which would likely impact the work-related experience of hope for those working with individuals on probation/parole</p></sec>
<sec id="sec23-1473325010382325"><title>SUMMARY</title>
<p>Working closely with a multi-barriered population like women on parole/probation places reintegration counsellors at serious risk of burnout and hopelessness. Further, a large body of research consistently confirms the importance of hope in the human change process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325010382325">Hubble et al., 1999</xref>), both for clients and clinicians. Consequently, the current study investigated how reintegration counsellors describe hope, leading to rich descriptions by participants of how they fostered and maintained hope in the context of their work with women on parole/probation. The overarching theme of the findings, <italic>Maintaining a Hope-Seeking Orientation</italic> uncovers the complexity of maintaining a hope-seeking orientation while facing the challenges of reintegration counselling. Specifically, participants in this study were understood to hold a hope-seeking orientation to worklife that included, seeing life as a journey, maintaining a hopeful perspective, holding ‘down-to-earth’ expectations, and viewing hope-seeking as a learnable skill. Importantly, participants associated hope with motivation and meaning, believing that hope was a necessary ingredient in their work and a resource to combat work-related exhaustion. Finally, participants described the hopeful attitudes and skills that they employed in their work as a much needed positive workview which supported their ability to envision better futures for their clients during the struggles of reintegration.</p></sec>
