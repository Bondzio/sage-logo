<p>We are very pleased to present this special issue on social work in Latin America. This special issue was motivated by a desire to shed light on a region that despite a long social work history has enjoyed little recognition on an international scale. Social work publications in Spanish in the region are plentiful, however the literature found in English is scarce and provides only a glimpse of the rich and extensive tradition of social work in the region. It is for this reason we hoped that a special issue focused on Latin America would provide Latin American scholars and practitioners the platform from which to share their work.</p>
<p>Although Latin America is a vastly diverse region made up of multiple social, cultural and political entities, it is bound by shared histories of colonialism, imperialistic interventions, dictatorships, violations of human rights, and neoliberal restructuring. These experiences have had lasting effects on the region, its people in general, and social work in particular. Today, perhaps the greatest challenges social work faces in the region are growing inequalities, violence, and the marginalization of different social groups.</p>
<p>Presently Latin America faces a contradictory situation of extraordinary wealth of human and natural resources that have led to a positive economic upturn (UNDP, 2007). Yet despite these positive economic numbers, the region continues to present extremely high levels of income inequality as compared to other regions. While a majority of the countries in Latin America are middle income and have mainly high or medium levels of human development, a large proportion of the population in Latin America continues to lives in poverty or extreme poverty. Those with immense wealth are a tiny minority while the proportion of people in the ‘middle class/middle income’ group is relatively small.</p>
<p>One aspect of concern relating to poverty in Latin America is the persistence of vulnerability gaps tied to demographic characteristics, particularly age, gender, and ethnicity. Poverty among children under the age of 15 is, on average, 1.7 times higher than poverty among adults (CEPAL, 2010; UNICEF, 2009). The poverty rate of women is 1.15 times higher than that of men, and the widest gender gaps are found in Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Panama and Uruguay. The poverty rate is 1.2–3.4 times higher for indigenous peoples and those of African descent than for the rest of the population, and that gap has grown in all countries studied, except for Brazil (CEPAL, 2010).</p>
<p>Where does social work fit into these social problems in Latin America; and what is Social Work in Latin America? What do we know in the “North” about Latin American social work discourses? What do Latin Americans know about social work in the North as well as other world regions? Is there a Latin American social work paradigm? And if so, how does it shape practice? These were only some of the questions we asked as academics and practitioners located in both worlds – two of us in Chile educated both in United States and Chile and one educated and living in Canada from a diaspora group. As we reviewed the social work literature from Latin America, we found a strong division between those who work within the academic settings and those who practice in direct settings. Although there is the discursive call to break down that separation between theory and practice, writings seem to remain highly abstract and written in a hard to reach language. In comparison to the language of English, Spanish writing is rich in descriptions. We faced multiple barriers in translating articles from their native Spanish to English and the translations may in fact be a limitation to this special issue as well as publishing Latin American works in general.</p>
<p>While critical social work as expressed in the ‘North’ in its diverse forms - structural, anti-oppressive, postmodern social work discourses has critiqued the so called traditional social work emphasis on individualist approaches toward its practice – Latin American social work can be critiqued for its overemphasis of the sociological and economistic–sociologization of the discourse of social work. Can the discourses from the Reconceptualization-critical approach to social work during the decade of the 70s, really explain and provide a guide to the new realities of diverse populations within Latin American–Afro descendants, indigenous peoples, and queer people, among others?</p>
<p>Neo-liberalism and marketization of social realities has had a tremendous impact and seriously affected the practice social workers face within their own weak labour circumstances as well as with those populations they are mandated to work with. Social work in Latin America is not a homogenous discipline despite historical and current efforts to develop a unified theory and approach. Social work as a discipline has negotiated its position differently in different countries of the region. There is a relative strong tradition of social work discourses and practices in countries such as Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Other regions such as El Salvador, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic have weak traditions, at times non-existent, and without a recognized space for a professional practice.</p>
<p>In the following issue we made an effort to ensure certain form of regional representation, including articles from Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, and Guatemala. We also looked to provide a range of social work practice arenas as well as discourses ranging from poverty and food security, child participation social work with indigenous populations, social work job satisfaction, youth violence as well as an article that presents a critique of social work discourses in the region. We wish to highlight that this issue only begins to scratch the surface of the rich history of social work in the region.</p>
