<abstract>
<p>This article presents the results and analysis of Acoustic Emission (AE) as recorded in a reinforced concrete (RC) slab supported by four steel columns and subjected to earthquake-type dynamic loading on a shake table. Fifteen seismic simulations were conducted using an accelerogram registered during the Campano-Lucano earthquake (Italy, 1980). The peak acceleration applied to the shake table was increased until the slab reinforcement was on the brink of yielding and slippage of the bars within the concrete occurred. This limit state is commonly associated with low-to-moderate intensity earthquakes in earthquake-prone regions. The evolution of damage to the slab was monitored in terms of AE energy and the history of plastic strain energy was calculated from the acceleration and displacement measurements. A good correlation was found between the energy dissipated by the concrete through plastic deformations and the AE energy associated with concrete cracking and friction. On this basis, a tentative formula is proposed for predicting the level of damage to RC slabs, based on the AE energy recorded by sensors located near the region of expected damage concentration under lateral loads.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1475921711401128" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>One considerable source of damage in reinforced concrete (RC) structures in earthquake-prone areas is cyclic loading induced by ground acceleration during seismic events. These structures are commonly designed to sustain two levels of seismic action:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1475921711401128">1</xref></sup> low-to-moderate intensity earthquakes (Level I), and strong earthquakes (Level II). In Level I earthquakes, the RC structure must remain basically elastic; that is, plastic deformations in the reinforcing bars are not tolerated. For earthquakes of Level II, the structure can endure large plastic deformations – as long as collapse is prevented – through the action of a ductile total yield mechanism. In moderate-or-high seismicity regions, a RC structure can experience several tens of low-to-moderate intensity earthquakes during its lifetime. Under Level I seismic action, although the steel bars are not expected to yield, concrete cracking is certain to occur due to the low tensile strength. Concrete degradation associated with cracking caused by hundreds of deformation cycles eventually results in cumulative damage (low-cycle fatigue damage) to the structural RC components, leading to a state in which repair becomes necessary for reasons of durability or safety. One important consequence of concrete degradation under cyclic loading is the slip between reinforcing steel and concrete, which is considered seriously damaging to RC elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921711401128">2</xref></sup> The damage limit allowable in a structure under Level I seismic actions is defined by the initiation of such slip between concrete and rebars, together with the rebar yielding.</p>
<p>Visual inspection of the structure is complicated by the presence of nonstructural elements such as brick veneers, casings, cement plaster, stuccos, etc. Even so, it may provide some qualitative information about the ‘apparent’ damage suffered, evidenced by cracks. This ‘apparent’ damage is related to the maximum lateral displacement of the structure during the earthquake, but it gives no information about the cumulative damage. It is known that the level of structural damage by earthquakes does not depend only on maximum displacement, since the cumulative damage resulting from numerous cycles must be taken into account. Also, because simple inspection cannot provide quantitative information on the damage accumulated in the structure during the cyclic reversals, nondestructive techniques can prove important. The methodology based on acoustic emission (AE) is very effective for this purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1475921711401128">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnosis and monitoring techniques are increasingly important for assessing structural health and reliability, one application being structural damage diagnosis in RC structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921711401128">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup> The measurement and recording of AE signals generated during a test and their analysis using typical parameters (peak amplitude, energy, rise-time, and duration), their spectral features, or more sophisticated signal processing techniques, may be applied on-line as a nondestructive technique for dealing with inaccessible parts of a structure. The AE technique applied to RC elements has been investigated by several authors, most of them focusing on the material (concrete) or individual elements (beams, columns).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921711401128">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1475921711401128">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup> Comparatively little research has been carried out at the structural level, that is, with assemblages of several structural elements. Carpinteri et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup> recently studied RC frames subjected to vibrations induced by traffic. Studies applying AE to monitor damage to RC structures subjected to earthquake-type dynamic loadings are scarce; yet, one example can be found in Carpinteri et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1475921711401128">8</xref></sup> describing masonry towers affected by regional seismicity. A large amount of AE work has been published in many fields. The recent book referred in Grosse and Othsu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1475921711401128">9</xref></sup> covers applications of the AE technique to real large-scale structures as well as observation of the cracking process in the laboratory.</p>
<p>The slab is a very common element in RC structures. RC flat slabs typically have reduced depth (about 150–200 mm) and can be supported along their edges by walls or beams, or on intermediate columns. In the latter case, the slab–column connection is generally the most critical point. Under the combined action of gravity and lateral seismic loads, cracking of the concrete slab tends to be concentrated near the column, and such degradation can lead to severe damage. Yuyama et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1475921711401128">2</xref></sup> evaluating fatigue damage in RC slabs supported along their edges and subjected to cyclic loading induced by traffic, concluded that damage levels under live loads in service can be evaluated by monitoring the AE energy.</p>
<p>This article presents research, likewise, based on monitoring the AE energy, but applied to damage assessment of RC slabs supported on columns and subjected to seismic-type cyclic loading demands up to the state of damage admissible for Level I earthquakes. The cyclic loads were applied dynamically using a shake table that reproduced the ground acceleration recorded at Calitri (Italy) during the Campano-Lucano earthquake. In contrast to experiments with static loads, in dynamic shake table tests, many parts of the auxiliary set-up are in movement during the experiment, thus generating spurious AE from diverse sources unrelated to concrete cracking and friction. After filtering this spurious AE, the concrete damage can be quantified in terms of AE energy and dissipated plastic strain energy. The limit of damage admissible for Level I earthquakes is determined by the onset of slippage between concrete and reinforcing steel, and of yielding in the reinforcing bars. A damage index based on AE monitoring that predicts the proximity to the damage limit above is tentatively proposed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1475921711401128"><title>Experiment</title>
<sec id="sec3-1475921711401128"><title>Test model</title>
<p>A prototype structure consisting of a RC slab supported on four box-type steel columns was designed according to Spanish codes. It had one story 2.8 m in height and 4.8 × 4.8 m<sup>2</sup> in plan, and was assumed to be located in the moderate-seismicity Mediterranean area. To satisfy the similitude laws<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921711401128">10</xref></sup> of scale model design, we opted for a reduced-scale model using material with the same properties as those of the prototype but with additional nonstructural mass. Accordingly, the corresponding test model was derived by applying the following scaling factors for geometry, acceleration, and stress, respectively: <italic>λ<sub>l</sub></italic> = 1/2, <italic>λ<sub>a</sub></italic> = 1, and <italic>λ<sub>σ</sub></italic> = 1. Here, <italic>λ<sub>l</sub></italic>, <italic>λ<sub>a</sub></italic>, and <italic>λ<sub>σ</sub></italic> are the constants by which the geometry, acceleration, and stress, respectively, which in the prototype must be multiplied to obtain the corresponding dimension in the test model. The scale factor <italic>λ<sub>l</sub></italic> = 1/2 allowed us to make the model compatible with the laboratory equipment. The values <italic>λ<sub>a</sub></italic> = 1, <italic>λ<sub>σ</sub></italic> = 1 are considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1475921711401128">10</xref></sup> the only practical way to conduct true modeling of RC structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921711401128">Figure 1</xref> shows the geometry and reinforcing details of the test model. The slab measures 125 mm in depth and is reinforced with two steel meshes, one at the top made with bars 6 mm in diameter spaced at 100 mm, and another at the bottom consisting of bars 10 mm in diameter spaced at 75 mm. The slab was reinforced at the corners by shearheads consisting of steel U-shapes 60 mm in depth to prevent punching shear failure. The test model was prepared in the laboratory. The average yield stress <italic>f<sub>s</sub></italic> of the reinforcing steel was 467 MPa, and the average concrete strength <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 23.5 MPa.

<sec id="sec4-1475921711401128"><title>Loading set-up and seismic simulation</title>
<p>The required total mass on the slab in the test model was determined by multiplying the total mass on the prototype structure (27.54 kNs<sup>2</sup>/m including dead and live loads) by the scaling factor for mass (0.25). The mass of the added steel blocks was determined as the difference between the required total mass on the slab (6.89 kNs<sup>2</sup>/m) and the self-mass of the slab in the test model (2.32 kNs<sup>2</sup>/m).</p>
<p>The test model was placed on the uniaxial MTS 3 × 3 m<sup>2</sup> shake table of the University of Granada (Spain), as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1475921711401128">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1475921711401128">Figure 3</xref> shows a general view of the test set-up. The bottom ends of the columns were fixed to the table by bolts. To satisfy the similitude requirements between prototype and test model, additional steel blocks were attached on top of the RC slab. The total mass of the slab including the added steel blocks was <italic>m</italic> = 7.39 Ns<sup>2</sup>/mm. The steel blocks were designed to be nonstructural and fixed to only two sides of the slab (those parallel to the loading direction) in order to minimize effects on the structural stiffness and strength of the test model. When the shake table was accelerated, the inertial force generated in the RC slab and the additional steel blocks dynamically loaded the test model. The shake table motions were patterned after the Calitri 1980 NS earthquake (Campano-Lucano, Italy), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921711401128">Figure 4</xref>, with the time scale compressed by a factor of <italic>λ<sub>l</sub></italic> = (1/2)<sup>0.5</sup> = 0.707.

<p>Control of the shake table was carried out with the 469 Uniaxial Seismic Controller (469-USC) of MTS. The 469-USC is a real-time, uniaxial, digital controller that provides three-variable-closed loop control along with adaptive control. The control hardware architecture is based on Digital Signal Processing technology which optimizes the performance of the embedded control system and allows for the implementation of advanced control and data filtering operations. The controller has imbedded processors, real-time hardware, and contains AC and DC conditioning, valve drivers, and hydraulic control. The 469-USC software consists of real-time control software and control panel software. The test controller provides three-variable control (TVC), adaptive control techniques (ACT), servovalve flow linearization (SFL), and differential pressure stabilization (DPS). TVC provides simultaneous control of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. ACT includes amplitude/phase control, adaptive harmonic cancellation, amplitude inverse control, and online iteration. To confirm that the acceleration experienced by the test model is very close to that which would be experienced during the earthquake, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1475921711401128">Figure 4</xref> shows the ground motion recorded during the earthquake (with solid lines) and the actual acceleration measured on the shake table (with dotted lines).</p>
<p>Two series of seismic simulations were conducted using the Calitri 1980 NS accelerogram, scaled to different amplitudes. The values of the peak acceleration (PA) applied in each are summarized in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711401128">Table 1</xref>, expressed in terms of the acceleration of gravity <italic>g</italic>. The first series consisted of eight simulations with PA increasing progressively from 0.08 to 0.58 <italic>g</italic>, and the second consisted of seven simulations with PA increasing from 0.19 to 1.1 <italic>g</italic>. The second series started with values of PA smaller than the maximum attained in the first series, so as to reproduce two types of situation in the structure: (1) one in which AE energy and plastic strain energy are dominated by new damage associated with the opening and extension of cracks; and (2) AE energy and hysteretic energy are dominated by friction generated from existing damage. Both situations are realistic scenarios that a structure may experience over its lifetime.

<p>Two different data acquisition systems, one for the AE and the other for acquiring accelerations, displacements, and strains, were used. The two acquisition systems were synchronized but the scan rate was set different for each. The AE signals were digitalized to a scanning rate of 1 MHz, covering the frequency band between 25 and 180 kHz. The data acquisition system for accelerations, displacements and strains was set to 200 Hz, which covers the frequencies of the relevant vibration modes of the test model, in the range between 11.4 and 24.2 Hz.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1475921711401128"><title>AE Monitoring</title>
<p>The Vallen System ASMY-5 was used to measure AE during the tests. Eight AE low-frequency sensors (type VS30-V, whose sensitivity curve is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1475921711401128">Figure 5</xref>), were placed on the test model as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921711401128">Figure 1(b)</xref>. As in most research on AE applied to large concrete structures, low-frequency sensors were used here because the material has considerable acoustic attenuation and dispersion, which becomes greater as the frequency increases. Thus, working at low-frequency provides for lower attenuation and dispersion of the acoustic waves, and therefore higher detection and location capability in large structures. Four sensors were attached along the four lateral sides of the slab, and the other four sensors were placed on the lower part of the slab. They were fixed with adhesive silicone for coupling, after sandpapering and cleaning the concrete surface. In all channels, 25 kHz high-pass and 180 kHz low-pass filters were used. The 25 kHz high-pass filter was introduced to avoid low-frequency noises such as those coming from machinery and environmental noise. The 180 kHz low-pass filter was introduced to avoid electromagnetic noise and other noises of an unknown source. It is well documented in the literature that concrete cracking produces large AE signals in the 25–180 kHz band. The discrimination duration time and the rearm time were set at 400 µs. The detection threshold of the AE sensors was set at 45 dB (the definition of dB of norm EN14584 was used: <italic>A</italic> = 20 log(<italic>V</italic>/1µV), where <italic>A</italic> is the amplitude in dB and <italic>V</italic> the amplitude in volts); sensor threshold and position were chosen taking into account the electrical noise existing in the laboratory, values used by other authors, and results of acoustic attenuation tests carried out by breaking a pencil lead (AE Hsu-Nielsen source). Before testing, we corroborated that the AE generated by a pencil lead being broken at any place in the specimen was captured by all eight sensors.
<fig id="fig5-1475921711401128" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Sensitivity of the sensors.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711401128-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>To prevent undesired noise generated by the contact between the base plate of the columns and the shake table, four guard sensors were placed near the bottom end of the columns, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1475921711401128">Figure 1(a)</xref> (one sensor per column). Thus, the AE events that had a guard sensor as their first-hit sensor were eliminated for the rest of sensors (1–8). To remove or reduce the sources of spurious friction noise, rubber layers and teflon films were placed between the added steel blocks and the slab. Teflon films were also inserted between any metallic surfaces with contacts that might generate spurious friction noise, such as screws, steel plates for fixing the accelerometers to the slab, cables, etc. Because of the complexity of this type of test, and despite the preventive measures adopted, some signals deriving from friction or electromagnetic noise were registered by the AE sensors. It was therefore, essential to carry out off-line AE data filtering after the test. After detailed observation of the AE waveforms, we found two types of signal that were qualitatively different: (1) short-duration signals, whose energy was concentrated mainly at the beginning of the signal and whose duration was not excessively long; and (2) long-duration signals, whose energy was not concentrated at the beginning of the signal, but distributed along the whole signal. The filtering procedure starts from the premise that short-duration signals referred to above as type (i) correspond to concrete cracking, while the long-duration signals designated as type (ii) are associated with various spurious sources other than concrete. To separate them, we calculated the root mean square (RMS) of all the signals in three temporal windows defined as: W1: 0–450 µs, W2: 450–1300 µs, and W3: 1100–1300 µs. We denoted the RMS of the signal in each of these three windows as <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub>. The following filtering criteria were then established: a signal was considered of type (i), if <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> ≥ 1.0 and <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> ≥ 1.2; otherwise, the signal was considered as type (ii). The first condition acknowledges the fact that if a signal is of type i, its RMS should be higher at the beginning of the signal than at the end (i.e., <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>). The second condition (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>3</sub> ≥ 1.2) was introduced in order to filter out some signals with a lot of energy at the end of the waveform.

Over these events, the typical AE parameters (i.e., amplitude, counts, energy, etc.) of the first-hit, in particular, the MARSE energy (Measured Area under Rectified Signal Envelope) of the first-hit recorded during each seismic simulation (energy units: 1 ue = 1 nV s), were calculated as well as the AE energy accumulated over the whole test. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1475921711401128">Figure 6</xref> shows a particular signal recorded during the C2 simulation which passed the filtering procedure.

For a particular AE signal, the MARSE energy is defined as the measured area under the rectified signal envelope from the arrival time (in which the signal crosses the threshold for the first time) to the duration time (in which the threshold is crossed for the last time).

<p>Prior to the first series of runs and between every two consecutive simulations, a free vibration test was conducted to calculate the vibration period <italic>T</italic> and the viscous damping fraction of the structure, <italic>ξ</italic>. The amplitude of the free vibration was made small enough to keep the response within the elastic range. The values of <italic>T</italic> and <italic>ξ</italic> obtained after each simulation are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711401128">Table 1</xref>. While period <italic>T</italic> remains almost constant until the last simulation, the damping fraction <italic>ξ</italic> increases with greater levels of seismic loading due to degradation of the concrete. The variation of <italic>ξ</italic> is an indicator of the level of damage to the structure.

<p>Since both the slab longitudinal bars and the steel columns remained elastic until the end of the seismic simulation F1, the variation of <italic>ξ</italic> up to this simulation F1 can only be attributed to the progress of damage on the concrete, which is monitored through the AE in this study.

<p>As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711401128">Table 1</xref>, the maximum strain in the longitudinal reinforcement <italic>ε</italic><sub>max,rebar</sub> (=1995 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) came very close to the yield strain <italic>ε<sub>y</sub></italic><sub>,rebar</sub> (=2225 × 10<sup>−6</sup>).

In conventional earthquake-resistant design, the structures are prepared, so that <italic>ε</italic><sub>max,rebar</sub> ≤ <italic>ε<sub>y</sub></italic><sub>,rebar</sub> under a Level I earthquake intensity. Since, in our experiments, <italic>ε</italic><sub>max,rebar</sub> reached 0.90<italic>ε<sub>y</sub></italic><sub>,rebar</sub>, we can affirm that the model was driven very close to the limit admissible in an RC structure under a Level I earthquake. The fact that <italic>ε</italic><sub>max,rebar</sub> remained below <italic>ε<sub>y</sub></italic><sub>,rebar</sub> does not mean that the RC slab remained undamaged. On the contrary, the presence of AE activity during the seismic simulations implies – as discussed later – that energy was being released, that is, damage was being propagated. Conversely, the absence of AE activity is an indicator that seismic vibrations – even when perceptible in the building – are efficiently absorbed by the inherent structure’s damping capacity, and do not result in cracking phenomena.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A detailed analysis of the strains recorded by the gages attached to the longitudinal reinforcing bars of the slab revealed that concrete degradation associated with cyclic loading reversals produced serious damage in the form of slippage between reinforcing steel bars and concrete at and beyond seismic simulation D2. The slippage is apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">Figure 8</xref>, which shows the distribution of strains in the longitudinal reinforcement of the slab when the test model reached peak lateral displacement in the positive and negative domains, for several seismic simulations. The positive lateral displacement of the slab corresponds to positive bending moments (i.e., counterclockwise) in the instrumented corner of the slab, and conversely, negative lateral displacement corresponds to negative bending moments (i.e., clockwise). If slip between longitudinal reinforcement and surrounding concrete does not occur, under positive bending <italic>M<sup>+</sup></italic>, the bottom bars will be in tension and the top bars in compression, whereas under negative bending <italic>M</italic><sup>−</sup>, the bottom bars will be in compression and the top bars in tension. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">Figure 8(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">b</xref>) shows that this rule holds for seismic simulation C2 – and also for previous simulations, though this is not shown in the figure for considerations of space. However, in the seismic simulation D2, a top bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">Figure 8(c)</xref>) that was supposed to be in compression is in fact in tension. This inversion is due to the slip of the bar within the concrete. The slippage effect takes place in all seismic simulations beyond D2 and is more exacerbated each time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">Figures 8(e)</xref> and (g–j)). In the final seismic simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1475921711401128">Figure 8(i)</xref>), slippage affects almost all the reinforcement located within the effective width (about 60 cm) of the slab, indicating severe damage. This can be considered as the limit of cumulative damage admissible in an RC slab under Level I earthquakes.

<p>Under seismic loading, the test specimen dissipates plastic strain energy, the source of which is twofold: (1) the cracking of the concrete and the friction between the planes of fracture after cracking; and (2) the change in the microstructure and the increase of temperature in the steel that forms the columns and reinforcing bars inside the concrete. This plastic strain energy can be estimated as follows.

Past research ascertained that a change in specimen size does not have appreciable effects on damage patterns,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1475921711401128">13</xref></sup> but the volume <italic>V</italic> of damaged concrete affects the number of AE events as well as <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup> Simple relationships have been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1475921711401128">7</xref></sup> that relate <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> with <italic>V</italic>; further, the volume of cracked concrete <italic>V</italic> can be roughly estimated based on the concept of ‘effective width’ of the slab,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1475921711401128">14</xref></sup> and the length of the region where plastic deformations take place under lateral earthquake loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1475921711401128">15</xref></sup> Generalization of the damage index defined by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1475921711401128">Equation (6)</xref> to include concrete volume is, however, beyond of the scope of this article and is left to future research.</p>
<p>It is worth emphasizing that the above formula has been calibrated for the <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> (in eu) recorded by VS30 sensors, using a detection threshold level of 45 dB. The signals were processed with 25 kHz high-pass filters and 180 kHz low-pass filters. Further experimental studies are needed to verify and refine the tentatively proposed formulae.</p></sec>

<p>The feasibility of the proposed index of damage ID was assessed using the results of another shake table test conducted on a second test model which only differed from that described in ‘Test model’ section in the presence of two hysteretic dampers. It is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1475921711401128">Figure 12</xref>. The second test model was subjected to one series of dynamic tests consisting of seven seismic simulations. The acceleration record and the PA of these seismic simulations were identical to those applied to the first test model in simulations A2 through G2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1475921711401128">Table 1</xref>). As with the first test model, the plastic strain energy, <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic>, and the AE energy, <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup>, were calculated from the readings of the accelerometers, displacement transducers, and the signals of the AE sensors. It is worth noting that even though the RC slab and the steel columns were identical in the two test models, the presence of the hysteretic dampers in the second one modified the fundamental period of the structure. As a result, the response of the two test models in terms of number and amplitude of imposed cycles of deformation was completely different. Further, the presence of the hysteretic dampers reduced the level of damage in the RC slab, as discussed later. Therefore, since the cycles of deformation and damage imposed to the RC slab are different in the two test models, the second can be used as a feasibility test of the index of damage ID proposed on the basis of the results of the first test model.
<fig id="fig12-1475921711401128" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><p>Test specimen with hysteretic dampers.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711401128-fig12.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The readings of the strain gages attached to the reinforcing bars of the slab of the second test model (i.e., the one with dampers) indicated that they remained elastic in all seismic simulations. By contrast, the strain gages attached to the steel columns indicated that they remained elastic only until the end of seismic simulation E2, which had a peak acceleration of PA = 0.74 g. Beyond the seismic simulation F2, the columns underwent plastic deformations. Therefore, until the end of seismic simulation E2, all the plastic strain energy <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic> was dissipated by the concrete. Similar to the first test model, the AE energy, <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup>, and the plastic strain energy, <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic>, accumulated over the successive seismic simulations were calculated for the second test specimen. Both <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> and <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic> were normalized by their respective values at the end of the seismic simulation E2. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1475921711401128">Figure 13</xref>, where it is also observed that there is a good correlation between the two quantities until the columns started to undergo plastic deformations (i.e., until the end of simulation E2). At the end of the seismic simulation E2, the accumulated plastic strain energy was <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic> = 2.4 × 10<sup>7</sup> N× mm and the accumulated acoustic energy <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> =37966 ue. Making <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> = 3796 ue in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-1475921711401128">Equation (6)</xref>, the corresponding index of damage ID of the test model with dampers at the end of the seismic simulation E2 is ID = 37966/182950 = 0.21. These values of ID (=0.21) and <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic> (=2.4 × 10<sup>7</sup> Nmm) for the second test model (i.e., the one with dampers) at the end of the seismic simulation E2 (PA = 0.74 g) are consistent with those obtained for the first test model (i.e., the one without dampers) at the end of the seismic simulation F1 (PA = 0.38 g), for which <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic> = 3.2237 × 10<sup>7</sup> Nmm and ID = 0.25. The consistency lies in the fact that the ratios <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic>/ID in the first and second test models are similar (i.e., <italic>W<sub>p</sub>/</italic>ID = 12.9 × 10<sup>7</sup> Nmm and <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic>/ID = 11.4 ×10<sup>7</sup> Nmm, respectively).
<fig id="fig13-1475921711401128" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><p>History of cumulative plastic strain energy, <italic>W<sub>p</sub></italic>, and AE energy, <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup>, in the second test structure normalized by their respective values at the end of simulation E2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1475921711401128-fig13.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is worth noting that although the second test model (with dampers) experienced seismic simulations with peak accelerations (PA = 0.74) almost double the size of the maximum PA experienced by the first test model (without dampers) (PA = 0.38), the value of the index of damage ID in the former is much smaller than in the latter. This fact corroborates the effectiveness of the hysteretic dampers in reducing damage in the RC slab.</p></sec>

<p>A half-scale RC slab supported on four steel columns was subjected to two series of seismic simulations on a shake table. The PA applied to the shake table was increased until the longitudinal reinforcing bars of the slab were on the brink of yielding, and concrete degradation resulted in slippage between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. Eight low-frequency sensors, set to a threshold level of 45 dB, were located on the bottom surface of the slab within a 75 cm radius centered on the column–slab connection, where damage concentration was expected. Four additional guard sensors were placed further from the region of damage concentration to remove spurious noise. Due to the type used and the threshold level of the sensors, they captured only AE from concrete. The AE, lateral displacements, accelerations, and strains in the reinforcing bars and steel columns were continuously recorded. From the experimental results, the following conclusions are reached:
<list id="list1-1475921711401128" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>AE monitoring proved effective for assessing the damage to RC slabs supported on columns subjected to realistic seismic-type cyclic loading.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The successive seismic simulations could be divided into two sequential stages (Stages I and II) delimited by the onset of yielding in the steel columns. The reinforcing steel of the slab remained elastic during all seismic simulations. In Stage I, the plastic strain energy dissipated by concrete <italic>W<sub>p</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>c</sub></italic> and the AE energy <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> due to concrete cracking and friction, both normalized by their corresponding values at the onset of yielding of the steel columns <italic>W<sub>p</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>o</sub></italic> and <inline-formula id="ilm12-1475921711401128"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math12-1475921711401128"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AE</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, respectively, were found to be strongly correlated.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Based on this correlation, a tentative formula is proposed for predicting the level of damage and the closeness to the limit state admissible in RC slabs under low-to-moderate earthquakes. This formula is based on the following assumptions: (a) the correlation between <italic>W<sub>pc</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sup>AE</sup></italic> is maintained in Stage II, that is, beyond the onset of yielding of the steel columns; (b) the low-cycle fatigue damage in the slab can be characterized by <italic>W<sub>pc</sub></italic>; and (c) the <italic>E</italic><sup>AE</sup> occurs in a fractal domain with exponent 2.3. With the proposed formula, the level of damage can be estimated from the AE energy recorded by sensors located within a radius of 75 cm centered on the column–slab connection and the volume of concrete in the region where damage is expected.</p></list-item>
