<body>
<p>An asymptomatic 42-year-old woman was found to have elevated serum levels of calcitonin, 51.4 pg/mL (normal &lt;14 pg/mL). As a result of this abnormal test, her thyroid gland was scanned, revealing a 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm nodule in the right lobe. Two nodules measuring less than 1 cm in diameter were also found in the left lobe, one of them partially calcified. A fine needle aspiration of the right lobe nodule was interpreted as “consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma.” The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy, following which her serum calcitonin level fell to &lt;2.0 pg/mL.</p>
<p>Workup for multiple endocrine neoplasia was negative, including normal values of serum calcium, serum PTH, and 24-hour urinary metanephrines.</p>
<p>The hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of the right thyroid lobe showed a multifocal papillary carcinoma with a partially follicular pattern of growth and focal tall cell features. The tumor cells had characteristic ground glass overlapping nuclei, with occasional longitudinal grooves.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CK19, thyroglobulin, and TTF-1. Remarkably, the thyroid tissue adjacent to the papillary carcinoma contained numerous cells that were intensely positive for calcitonin, synaptophysin, TTF-1, and CEA and negative for thyroglobulin. Some of these cells completely encircled normal-sized or dilated follicles, whereas others totally replaced smaller follicles, with formation of small nodular clusters. These were interpreted as foci of C-cell hyperplasia. It was further hypothesized that this C-cell hyperplasia present in the nonneoplastic thyroid tissue surrounding the papillary carcinoma was the source of the increased serum calcitonin levels. Sections of thyroid tissue taken at a distance from the papillary carcinoma showed practically no C-cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911432883">Figures 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1066896911432883">6</xref>).</p>

<p>In hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections it is very difficult to identify C-cells with certainty. Normally, the density of C-cells is typically highest in the upper two thirds of the lateral lobes of the gland. Immunostains show that these cells are unevenly distributed and often seen between the the follicular epithelium and its basement membrane, either as single cells or in small groups.</p>
<p>Because of the heterogeneous distribution of these cells within the thyroid gland and among different individuals, the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia poses difficult problems.</p>
<p>Albores-Saavedra et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref></sup> measured the number of C-cells in the thyroid of 20 previously healthy subjects whose sudden death prompted investigation by the medical examiner. The number of C-cells at a magnification of 100× ranged from 0 to 42. The authors therefore proposed that at least 50 C-cells must be present in one 100× field to substantiate the diagnosis of C-cell hyperplasia.</p>
<p>Wolfe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911432883">2</xref></sup> found an average of &lt;10 C-cells per low power field in areas with the highest density in the normal adult thyroid. Gibson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911432883">3</xref></sup> reported a wider range, which included 3 cases showing densities greater than 1000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; such densities usually corresponded to a maximum well over 100 cells per 10×field.</p>
<p>The reason for the sometimes considerable differences in the number of C-cells among adult thyroid glands is unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref></sup> Although it is difficult to draw the line between “normal” C-cell density and hyperplasia, we feel that the present case clearly qualifies as hyperplastic, combining diffuse and nodular features, the latter resulting focally in complete obliteration of small follicular spaces by the C-cells.</p>
<p>The biologic and clinical significance of C-cell hyperplasia associated with thyroid neoplasms of follicular cell origin is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref></sup> Conceivably, it could have a neoplastic potential. Along these lines, Albores-Saavedra et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911432883">4</xref></sup> mentioned 2 cases of papillary carcinoma and medullary carcinoma coexisting in the same thyroid gland and postulated the existence of a mixed medullary and follicular carcinoma. An alternative explanation is induction by the thyroid tumor of a reactive or compensatory type of C-cell hyperplasia. In fact, hyperplasia of neuroendocrine cells has also been demonstrated in response to a variety of nonspecific chronic stimuli in many other organs, including lung, stomach, small and large intestine, gallbladder, urinary bladder, and skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref></sup> It is also possible that destruction of thyroid parenchyma (including C-cells) by the tumor leads to chronic TSH oversecretion, with secondary stimulation of both follicular and C-cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>C-cell hyperplasia is not only recognized as a precursor of medullary carcinoma (especially in multiple endocrine neoplasia types IIA and IIB) but can also be seen in association with a number of other conditions, including advanced age, hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia due to Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, Hashimoto disease and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasms (as demonstrated by this case), exogenous estrogen administration, and cimetidine treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911432883">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911432883">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because tissue sections are not likely to be stained for calcitonin in the absence of a prior consideration of a C-cell disorder, C-cell hyperplasia can be easily overlooked as it can be subtle or inapparent in hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections.</p>
<p>The presence of serum hypercalcitonemia has considerable importance, since its occurrence in the presence of a thyroid mass is considered almost diagnostic of medullary carcinoma. Secondary C-cell hyperplasia associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma and the other conditions listed above may be a source of error and should be considered in the preoperative differential diagnosis of these patients.</p>
