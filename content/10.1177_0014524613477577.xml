<title>New English Translation of the Septuagint</title>
<p>Albert Pietersma and Benjamin G. Wright (eds), <italic>A New English Translation of the Septuagint – and the Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included under That Title</italic> (Oxford/New York: OUP, 2007. £22.50. pp. xx + 1027. ISBN: 978-0-19-528975-6).</p>
<p>As the editors point out in their introduction, this translation of the Septuagint (NETS) is only the third English translation of the entire Septuagint. The other two, Charles Thomson (1808) and Lancelot Brenton (1844), while still serviceable are showing signs of age. This is not only due to the style of English employed, but the result of new manuscript discoveries, the publication of critical editions of LXX texts rather than reliance on a single manuscript, and advances in the field of Greek lexicography. The translation offered here is based on the New Revised Standard Version, especially in terms of the style and character of the translation. However, as the editors are keen to emphasize the NETS translation should not be understood as ‘the-NRSV-once-over-lightly but rather a genuine representation of the Greek, reflecting not only its perceived meaning but also, to the extent possible in an English translation, its literary nuggets as well as its infelicities, pleonasms, problems and conundra.’ (p. xviii). This task of translation was undertaken by a team of over thirty scholars. In comparison to the Rahlfs’ hand-edition of the Greek text of the Septuagint, NETS omits the <italic>Odes of Solomon</italic>, but includes the so-called Alpha-Text of Esther. In relation to the omission of the <italic>Odes</italic> this is due to the text’s ‘dubious integrity as a literary unit’ (p. xix). By contrast, the guidance for inclusion of the Alpha-Text of Esther has been found in the Göttingen Septuagint where two parallel texts of Esther are presented.</p>
<p>The translation of each book of the Septuagint, or sub-collection, such as the twelve Minor Prophets, is preceded by a helpful introduction. These introductions include subsections covering topics such as discussion of the edition of the Greek text used, explanation of the translation profile of the text, editorial approach, and a useful bibliographical note. These introductory elements are varied to some extent from text to text, depending on the translational issues thrown up by individual texts. This common sense approach makes these discussions far more useful than would have been the case if they had been made to conform to some Procrustean model.</p>
<p>It is certainly the case that this new NETS translation will establish itself as the standard English translation of the Septuagint. The editors and the team of translators have produced an excellent reference volume. Hopefully this translation will add further impetus to the already growing and renewed interest in Septuagintal studies. Furthermore, it is encouraging to see such a volume produced at an affordable price, which means it is able to be purchased by individuals as well as institutional libraries.</p>
