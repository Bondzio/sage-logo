<body>
<p>First, we thank Kohui and Ghazavi for the observations that gave us the opportunity to clarify the treatment adopted for our patient.</p>
<p>As you know, the section in which the article has been published limits the words to 700. Thus, our aim was essentially devoted to introducing another possible etiology (Eustachian tube insufflation) for the pneumolabyrinth related with perilymphatic fistula (PLF), and our recommendation was to “exercise caution when recommending this treatment option or other particular process of cannulation of ET for patients with history of stapes surgery.”</p>
<p>We have never recommended, as you stated, the subtotal petrosectomy as a first choice of treatment strategy. The patient had been initially treated by other physicians with conservative management, and the results were unsuccessful with a persistent profound hearing loss and vestibular symptoms. We performed 2 exploratory tympanotomies with no resolution of the pneumolabyrinth, and at this time, we decided to perform subtotal petrosectomy combined with Eustachian tube, middle ear, and mastoid obliteration. This strategy induced an initial improvement of the vestibular symptoms, but it is obvious that the following complete recovery of vestibular symptoms is attributable to adaptive mechanisms and that surgery was inconsistent at improving sensorineural hearing loss. In our case, we considered the subtotal petrosectomy as the best approach for the fistula repair, also taking into consideration the 2 months of persistence of the pneumolabyrinth, leaving the patient at risk for otogenic meningitis via the Eustachian tube. Note that one of the indications given by Fisch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813480482">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813480482">2</xref></sup> for the subtotal petrosectomy technique was to prevent the risk of meningitis in lesions violating the otic capsule. The first goal in patients with persistence of pneumolabyrinth suffering from profound hearing loss is to repair, as soon as possible, this potentially risky condition.</p>
