<p>Over the past couple of years, more and more people have started listening to music on vinyl. For some, this is a return; for others, a newly discovered experience. It is happening across Europe, in Australasia and in the United States. The records may be second-hand, refurbished new editions, or new repertoire, yet together there has been an approximate 45% increase in vinyl consumption. That may be only a small slice of overall international music sales, across all formats, but it is still a huge leap upward. To a certain extent, what it represents is an anti-digital backlash. As such it can largely be explained as a response to the relative quality of sound reproduction. As Lyor Cohen, the CEO of Recorded Music for the Warner Music Group, put it in 2011: ‘vinyl will definitely outlast CDs because of the resonance, the sound; the quality is closest to the way the artist wants you to hear it’ (<italic>The Guardian</italic>, 21 July 2011). But it is also due to the attendant aesthetics of listening that are associated with the LP cover and notes as opposed to the dull, utilitarian plastic case of the compact disc. The increasing number of CDs now being packaged in cardboard only emphasizes the contrast as we place the 12-inch-square covers of LPs with memorable artwork on the front, deriving from the days of Charles Mingus, Elvis and The Beatles, alongside their CD miniature imitations that are roughly the size of beer mats and whose artwork they roughly approximate. Vinyl nostalgia is an implicit critique of digital culture in all its dimensions.</p>
<p>This is, then, a fitting moment for Richard Osborne to appear with his study of the vinyl record. He aims not only to relate the historical development of vinyl, but also examine its appeal as a musical conduit. His approach is more or less chronological, and this enables him to explore in turn the key components of vinyl records, beginning appropriately enough with the groove wherein is stored the sounds of music, the indexical results of what was recorded, the inscribed furrows of vibration perennially unearthed by the plough of the needle. Osborne then turns to the disc. It was this format, pioneered by Emile Berliner, which eventually triumphed over Edison’s wax cylinder, and it was this format, developed by an increasingly profitable global music industry, which emphatically marked the ascendancy of professional over amateur recording. With the disc came the label, and labelling practices, which in turn marked the ascendancy of the manufacturing company. It was the label which signified the marketed brand, and helped define the particular product and the genre to which it had been assigned. These issues are covered by Osborne’s third chapter, which also features as a case study the consequences of establishing a firm line of demarcation between ‘race’ and ‘hillbilly’ as distinct consumer markets – distinct from each other and distinct from mainstream popular music. From here Osborne moves on to deal with vinyl itself, the material of choice for the manufactured product and successor to shellac, its advantages over its predecessor including greater durability, closer groove spacing, lower speeds, and less surface noise. The remaining four chapters cover the LP, the 45 rpm single, the B-side and 12-inch single, and finally the record sleeve, a crucial aspect of analogue music packaging that has proved hugely influential in defining or rather, giving identity to, the music itself.</p>
<p>Central to Osborne’s book is the contention that the most fruitful musical outcomes on vinyl formats have arisen out of those genres most loyal to them, such as indie rock and dance music, and out of those breakthrough moments when musical boundaries were extended and all the previous various components of disc recordings were articulated and given unity of connection and purpose. These include disc sizes and speeds, record labels and sleeves. Along with this he argues that analogue technologies and formats continue to exert a powerful influence over popular music, not only in providing the originating sources of much of the music that continues to be played, but also in providing the defining conditions for the ways in which music is understood. Digital technologies and formats are by comparison only infants in this respect.</p>
<p>Osborne has produced a valuable study of the vinyl record and its enormous significance in modern popular music. His anatomical approach proves enjoyable and satisfying because it historicizes each essential aspect of disc music and helps explain why the vinyl record has had such durable appeal. The book is another feather in the cap of Ashgate’s popular and folk music series.</p>
