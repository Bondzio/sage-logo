<abstract>
<p>Travel journalism provides unique insights into changing notions of culture, media, and mobility. This study examines ‘Why we travel,’ a <italic>New York Times</italic> collection of over 2000 reader-submitted photos and captions about travel. To locate trends within this multi-authored text, the author refers to the theories of tourism scholars MacCannell and Urry to distinguish between enduring and emergent travel representations. The former include unequal distributions of certain subject matter across regions, emphasis on ‘authentic’ touristic experiences, and visual methods for minimizing signs of western culture. Within the same collection, however, emergent representations feature ‘new’ tourisms, highly reflexive portraits of tourists, and conscious confrontation of interconnectivity. In conclusion, the study considers some of the cultural messages communicated by ‘Why we travel’ as it coheres under the <italic>New York Times</italic>’ authoritative aesthetic. More than a travel feature, the collection can be read as a guide to global mobility in the 21st century.</p>

<p>In an era of accelerating media globalization, travel journalism has become a locus of increasing media research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712468608">Cocking, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712468608">Fürsich and Kavoori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0163443712468608">Hanusch, 2010</xref>). Travel journalism is a media genre that has historically been both dependent and influential on the international circulation of people, texts, and visuals, making it a rich repository for changing ideas about mobility and mediation. Furthermore, like its counterparts in the ‘hard’ news sections of newspapers, the ‘soft’ news of travel journalism is loaded with culturally coded messages and representations of cultural difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712468608">Cocking, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">Lutz and Collins, 1993</xref>). Finally, despite circulating within a broader media- saturated environment in which images of foreignness and faraway places may be diminishing in novelty, travel journalism manages to maintain what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712468608">Fürsich and Kavoori (2001</xref>: 150) call a ‘privileged position in public discourse’ through its placement within a journalistic textual system that defines it as true. In short, travel journalism—just like ‘serious’ forms of journalism—warrants attention as documentation of the shared assumptions between journalists and readers about what representations are relevant from beyond their borders.</p>
<p>Despite a rising scholarly interest in travel journalism, this field of inquiry has yet to acknowledge the shift towards ‘participatory journalism’ that is being closely observed in other areas of news production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712468608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712468608">Domingo et al., 2008</xref>). In an era of shrinking newsrooms and proliferating mobile media technologies, readers are increasingly becoming contributors of various types of news content, including images and stories related to travel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712468608">1</xref></sup> A question that arises from this development is whether the growth of user-generated travel content will lead to a diversification of international representations within traditionally ‘gated’ American news venues, which have historically tended to reinforce rather than challenge dominant ideas about foreign people and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712468608">Gans, 1979</xref>: 32–42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">Lutz and Collins, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>To offer one approach to this issue, this article examines some core visual and discursive themes that appear in ‘Why we travel’ (WWT), a collection of travel photos and captions submitted by over 2000 readers of the <italic>New York Times</italic> to the publication’s online travel section in the late 2000s. At first glance, the pictures compiled in WWT present a portrait of 21st-century global tourism as diverse, individualized, and characterized by unprecedented freedom and variety. But when analyzed more closely, the variability of WWT can be reduced to a handful of familiar visual genres and travel conventions—what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712468608">Adler (1989)</xref> calls ‘travel styles.’ This study uses content and discourse analysis to map out the predominant themes represented in WWT, and concludes by discussing some possible cultural meanings offered by this multi-authored, polysemic text as it coheres under the authoritative aesthetic of the <italic>New York Times</italic>. WWT mixes together a range of modern and postmodern touristic signifiers—what I am calling <italic>enduring</italic> and <italic>emergent</italic> representations. By authorizing both types of representations, rather than promoting the latter as a more sophisticated version of the former, the <italic>Times</italic> portrays 21st-century global mobility as a trend that is at once novel and recognizable, open to individual customization while still associated with the familiar paradigms and prestige values of international mobility, neocolonialism, and western modernity.</p>
<p>The <italic>Times</italic> is not only an influential conveyor of news, but also an arbiter of taste among the mobile classes. By sanctioning a multivalent travel text like WWT, it makes a statement about the social value of experimenting with different ‘travel styles’ in the globalization age. WWT not only combines the variable views of travel supplied by readers, but also merges them within the <italic>Times</italic>’ online news aesthetic, evenly authorizing its uneven representations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712468608">Johnston and Baumann (2007)</xref> observed a similar legitimating practice in their sociological study of gourmet food magazines. They argue that the deliberate mixing of ‘high’ and ‘lowbrow’ signifiers in high-status media texts—such as the recent appearance of hamburgers and other ‘working-class foods’ in <italic>Bon Appétit—</italic>does not, despite appearances, indicate a move towards more ‘democratic’ social attitudes to consumption. Rather, these inclusions reflect how publications like <italic>Gourmet—</italic>and I would add, the <italic>New York Times—</italic>function as cultural guides to upper- and middle-class audiences on the latest ways of achieving social distinction. Their display of omnivorous (both ‘high’ and ‘low’) cultural preferences can be seen as offering readers a consumption strategy for accumulating cultural capital in an age when class boundaries are increasingly blurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712468608">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0163443712468608">Peterson and Kern, 1996</xref>). This article proposes that we read ‘Why we travel’ in a similar way. As a collection created by and for highly mobile readers, WWT serves as both report and recommendation to the broader <italic>Times</italic> readership on the omnivorous range of ways in which they might tour their over- represented world. Its positive treatment of both enduring and emergent touristic representations assures readers that travel remains distinctive, customizable, and worthwhile, even as it becomes more widely accessible.</p>
<sec id="section1-0163443712468608">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In 2007, ‘Why we travel’ began as a small recurring slideshow on the <italic>New York Times</italic> website, featuring 16 photos submitted by both readers and reporters. It ran repeatedly thanks to fresh submissions from readers, who quickly became the main contributors of content. By 2009, the slideshow had ballooned into a collection of over 2000 reader-submitted photographs. While continuing to publish WWT in regular installments of pre-arranged slideshows, the <italic>Times</italic> also migrated the collection to a new permanent home in an online gallery, where images were reorganized by region, country, and travel theme (e.g. hiking, wildlife, and beaches).</p>
<p>This change in format brought a new set of functions for the images. As before, readers could view where and how other <italic>Times</italic> readers had traveled. But instead of perusing photos in small batches pre-arranged by <italic>Times</italic> staff, readers now had instantaneous access to the entire collection and could click their way through it according to their geographic or traveling interests. The gallery also became accessible via a stable link on the Travel homepage, embedded within a regularly updated, eye-catching photo and caption. At the time of writing, the WWT box is currently a mainstay of the Travel homepage, residing within the same prestigious online zone as a suite of travel tools, such as the <italic>Times</italic> Travel archives, flight and hotel booking through Expedia, and the ‘Frugal Traveler’ blog. This new arrangement invites readers into a heightened involvement with the images, encouraging them not to passively view, but to search and customize the collection according to their own travel-planning needs or desires. Following the analysis of images and captions, I will return to these interactive features of WWT to discuss some of their potential meanings within the text.</p>

<title><italic>Enduring</italic> and <italic>emergent</italic> representations of tourism</title>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712468608">Fürsich and Kavoori (2001</xref>: 155–8), this study refers to the seminal works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712468608">MacCannell (1976)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry (2002)</xref> to map out how the practice of tourism, and particularly its emphasis on visual consumption and representation, has been previously conceptualized within both <italic>modern</italic> and <italic>postmodern</italic> frameworks. MacCannell traces tourism to the emergence of industrial modernity, the structural differentiation of society into spheres and work and leisure, and the resultant desire among modernized to citizens seek ‘authenticity’ outside of their workaday lives. Urry, while recognizing tourism’s basis in modernity, calls attention to its postmodern dimensions, including the fragmentation of tourism into individuated ‘niche’ experiences, the prevalence of pastiche and kitsch in touristic displays, and the prominence of mediation and technology in tourist expectations and experiences. While Urry’s work is particularly concerned with the role of the visual in tourism, both his and MacCannell’s perspectives can be seen as highlighting distinct lenses, or ‘gazes,’ that tourists employ as they travel and consume new sights. This study takes MacCannell and Urry’s theories as complementary—both are needed to appreciate the historically layered touristic themes and gazes (combining notions of leisure, authenticity, neocolonial exoticism, kitsch, and class) that are exhibited in WWT. However, in an effort to move away from the temporal associations of these descriptors, I substitute the notions of <italic>modern</italic> and <italic>postmodern</italic> travel representations with <italic>enduring</italic> and <italic>emergent</italic> ones. The latter categories are meant to be less temporally bounded and more open to interpretation (<italic>enduring</italic> representations might alternatively be described simply as ‘classic’ or ‘clichéd,’ and <italic>emergent</italic> ones as ‘creative’ or ‘quirky’). While my categorizations are interpretive and in no ways exhaustive (Lutz and Collins, for example, propose that up to seven different types of gazes intersect in <italic>National Geographic</italic> images [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">1993</xref>: 187–216]), I use them here primarily to highlight the tensions that emerge when conventional and unconventional touristic signifiers appear bundled within the same text, and at times within the same frame.</p>
<p>This analysis bases the category of <italic>enduring</italic> representations on those that have been described elsewhere as modern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712468608">Graburn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712468608">MacCannell, 1976</xref>). These reference travel in ways that have been familiar within western popular culture ever since tourism first emerged in mid-19th-century Europe, when industrializing cities and railways created the conditions for mass touristic escapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712468608">Towner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>). Enduring forms portray the worth of travel in terms of authenticity, aesthetic, or educational value. Many of these pictures draw upon themes of intellectual journey, spiritual pilgrimage, or colonial notions of adventure rooted in exploration, ‘discovery,’ and ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712468608">Adler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712468608">Graburn, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712468608">MacCannell, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0163443712468608">Towner, 1985</xref>). They also reinforce the modern notion of leisurely travel as sacred time, wholly separate from the mundane activities of everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712468608">Graburn, 1989</xref>). In short, enduring representations are linked to tourists’ reliance on a romantic gaze that seeks out the ‘authentic’ in their surroundings, fostering a contemplative, auratic, and semi-spiritual relationship with the objects they see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>: 78).</p>
<p><italic>Emergent</italic> forms, on the other hand, make reference to more recent processes of international travel, globalization, and connectivity, specifically the introduction of new alternatives to Americans’ range of travel options as well as to their media environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712468608">Graburn (1995</xref>: 171) observes that in today’s image-saturated societies, ‘the seriousness of modernity and addiction to authenticity is waning,’ thus freeing tourists to exercise a heightened awareness of tourism itself. As ‘post-tourists,’ many tourists today are aware that tourism is a staged and highly commodified experience. In response, they choose to playfully acknowledge their outsider status abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712468608">Feifer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>: 74). In ‘Why we travel,’ post-tourism is further evidenced by the ways that <italic>Times</italic> readers use their photographs to confront, rather than eschew, signs of interconnectedness between formerly ‘peripheral’ places. Rather than masking or avoiding signs of westernization or modernity, these photographs highlight the global-ness of the local (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712468608">Appadurai, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>: 146). Apparently dissatisfied with overly familiar images of landscapes or landmarks, these tourists experiment with emergent representations as they take up unconventional ways of touring, whether by engaging in humanitarian work, study abroad, or intrepidly touring traditionally un-tourable locales like impoverished, war-torn, and back-alley zones. The gaze behind these emergent forms, in other words, is not romantic but problematic, political, and sometimes playfully ironic.</p>
<p>The <italic>Times</italic> is an American publication that boasts a global readership online, and WWT contains submissions from readers all over the world. Yet the feature—and correspondingly, this study—approaches the topic of travel from a U.S. perspective. Part of the journalistic ‘story’ that WWT reports is the fast-evolving ease with which the American mobile classes are able to travel―both physically and virtually―and capture, share, and consume images of once-distant or ‘exotic’ places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712468608">Crawshaw and Urry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163443712468608">Crouch et al., 2005</xref>). The general proliferation of global media in tourists’ home environments, furthermore, suggests that today’s tourists have at their disposal a vast range of traveling ‘styles’ and ‘gazes’ which they can legitimately ‘try on’ as they move through unfamiliar places, cameras in hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712468608">Adler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712468608">Jenkins, 2003</xref>). In WWT, contributors’ representational choices reflect such a range, from reproducing centuries-old themes of religious pilgrimage to parodying the mid-20th-century American ‘tourist pose’ in front of landmarks like the Eiffel Tower. But despite the unprecedented ease with which travelers are able to produce, consume, and recirculate global imagery according to their own tastes, WWT suggests that recognizable patterns still hold— particularly within the circumscribed taste culture promoted by the <italic>New York Times</italic>.</p>

<title>Description and analysis: the images and captions</title>
<p>The 957 photos analyzed for this study make up a specific subset within the WWT collection called Readers’ Picks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712468608">2</xref></sup> To be categorized as such, each of these photos was ‘recommended’ by at least one reader of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</ext-link>. Readers ‘recommend’ a photo by simply clicking on the ‘Recommend this photo’ link below it in the WWT gallery. For this study, each recommended photo and accompanying caption was downloaded and sorted into folders separated by geographic region.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163443712468608">3</xref></sup> I adopted the same regional categories used by the <italic>Times</italic>, but with two changes: I removed Mexico and Central American countries from the North American category and moved them to South America, which I renamed ‘Latin America’ to account for the shared cultural, linguistic, and touristic characteristics of these regions. I made a similar change to Australia and New Zealand, renaming this region ‘Oceania’ and merging photos from the Pacific Islands. I then coded the photos in three steps. In a first pass, I analyzed each group of images for subject matter, grouping the observed subjects into 13 predominant subject codes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0163443712468608">Table 1</xref>). I then analyzed each image again, tagging each with up to three subject codes from the list.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0163443712468608">4</xref></sup> Finally, I turned to the verbal (caption) content to perform a discourse analysis on the photographers’ interpretations.</p>

<title>Unequal distribution of subject matter</title>
<p>One of the most enduring notions of travel represented in WWT is that all tourist destinations are not created equal. When browsing the 2076 total photos in the collection, the sidebar tallies reveal that the majority were taken in Europe (45%) and North America (30%). Far fewer were taken in Asia (15%), Latin America (5%), Africa (4%), and Oceania (1%). A similar representational imbalance is captured in the set of recommended photos. Overwhelmingly, photos from Europe dominate both the general collection (45%) and the Readers’ Picks (65%). This is not surprising given that most Americans do not travel internationally, and Europe remains the most popular overseas destination for those who do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0163443712468608">Office of Travel and Tourism Industries, 2009</xref>). What <italic>is</italic> significant is the drop in importance of North American photos between the general collection, where they constitute 30% of all photos, and the Readers’ Picks, a mere 9%. The first figure speaks to the fact that many Americans continue to tour and photograph their own continent despite the growing accessibility of international travel. But the much lower level of recommendation suggests that the North American photographs may not seem as notable (or beautiful, exotic, etc.) to readers as those taken abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to privileging certain regions over others, the WWT photos associate each region with different kinds of subject matter. In a striking example, the subject of nature (e.g. landscapes, mountains, sunsets, bodies of water), which occurs in over 40% of the photos in every region, dominates 80% of the photos from North America. A possible explanation for this imbalance, which the distributions of other subjects support, is that certain subjects, such as poverty, locals, industry, and merchandise, are not considered exceptional by the predominantly American readers of the <italic>Times</italic> when they travel through the U.S. and Canada, and are therefore less likely to be photographed. In lieu of these mundane and familiar subjects, the North American photos favor sweeping natural vistas and national parks. Accordingly, the travel style featured in this set celebrates the exploration of the outdoors: hikers, kayakers, mountain-climbers, and beach-combers are common within the North American landscapes, and <italic>only one</italic> North American photo in the Readers’ Picks (a bakery in Quebec) was taken indoors. Similarly, readers portray Oceania as a destination best enjoyed by rugged outdoor types. With the exception of two photographs of the Sydney Opera House, all images from Oceania feature landscapes, animals, or tourists interacting with either of the two.</p>
<p>In Europe, where historic urban centers dominate, natural subjects are less common, and the vast majority of those are pastoral. There is also a recurrence of certain sites: sunflower fields, wildflowers in Provence, cliffs and highlands of the British Isles, and the Alps are popular scenes. Gardens, rural churches, villages nestled in mountains, and vineyards are also common. Between the farm animals, churches, country roads, and rows of cultivated crops, the photos of natural European settings differ from those in North America in that they are rarely free of signs of humanity, preferring instead to balance scenes of serene nature against the quaint, crumbling walls and buildings of European history.</p>
<p>Most pictures of nature in Asia and Africa, however, feature humans interacting with it. Interestingly, pictured people’s roles within nature differ considerably if they are locals or tourists. While tourists skydive, scuba, dune-climb, safari, paraglide, and hot-air balloon their way through natural settings in Asia and Africa, locals appear as if frozen in pre-industrial times. They cultivate rice, rest on hilltops in traditional clothes, wash their clothes in rivers, and paddle through waters in pre-industrial boats. Such representational imbalances across regions signal not only the well-worn paths of the world’s touristic circuits, but also the persistence of neocolonial cultural themes in travel photography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">Lutz and Collins, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712468608">Parameswaran, 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-0163443712468608">
<title>Seeking the ‘authentic’ and traditional ways of ‘othering’</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0163443712468608">MacCannell (1976)</xref>, modern tourists leave home to go in search of the ‘authenticity’ that is lacking in their industrialized, workaday lives. They gravitate towards areas or attractions that appear unaltered by modernity. In these settings, representations of local people are powerful signifiers of authenticity because they embody the survival of pre-modern lifestyles in the modern world. Consistent with this enduring notion of travel, in WWT locals are represented in highly imbalanced ways between ‘developed’ and ‘underdeveloped’ regions. Locals occur more often in poorer destinations, and appear in nearly half of the photos in Africa. Unlike in Europe, where locals mill about in groups though plazas, sporting events, and historic public spaces, often photographed in inconspicuous positions, a significant portion of the African and Asian photographs <italic>focus</italic> on locals—a single person or a pair—as the primary subject, dominating the frame and often looking directly at the camera. A possible explanation for this difference is that in developing regions, once viewed as ‘peripheral’ to the West, the residents still generate enough mystery in the minds of western travelers that they result in photos with an ethnographic bent. The scarcity of locals in North American photos would support this claim. Similarly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">Lutz and Collins (1993)</xref> have shown in their study of <italic>National Geographic</italic> imagery, dark skin, bright colors, and non-western clothes make for compelling photos for American audiences. An alternative explanation is that amateur photographers, inundated with signs of difference when traveling in non-western settings, tend to select and pattern their representations on those that predominate in the international media they consume at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0163443712468608">Jenkins, 2003</xref>). In turn, when deciding to submit their photos to the <italic>New York Times</italic> as ‘citizen journalists,’ these photographers may opt to publish those photos that most clearly exhibit established journalistic visual cues and conventions, potentially reinforcing the enduring neocolonial representations associated with traditional photojournalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0163443712468608">Parameswaran, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, in both Africa and Asia, most locals are photographed carrying out everyday activities: hauling water, eating, grooming, washing, weaving, working, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0163443712468608">Lutz and Collins, 1993</xref>: 106) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0163443712468608">Figure 1</xref>). Like the ethnographic tone of <italic>National Geographic</italic>-style portraits, these shots capture the curiosities of non-western and pre-modern lifestyles, surrounding subjects with their unique tools, modes of transport, furniture, and clothing. In Asia in particular, many tourists’ cameras favor subjects dressed in traditional religious garb, such as Buddhist monks, an Indian guru, and a Balinese Hindu priest. Neither of these trends hold true in Europe, where the few locals who are prominently pictured fall into one of two categories: (a) people employed by the tourist industry (e.g. street performers, historical re-enacters, flamenco dancers, gondoliers), and (b) elderly Europeans, often sitting on park benches.</p>

</fig>
<p>Just as there are different ways of representing locals, so too are there varying strategies for tourists to represent themselves. The WWT collection mirrors what tourism researchers have found to be historically varying degrees of tourist reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712468608">Feifer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>), with enduring representations avoiding images of the awkward tourist and portraying the tourist instead as a contemplative gazer, a ‘witness’ who unobtrusively moves through an awe-inspiring setting. In WWT, this is exemplified by a number of hiking and outdoor activity shots, where observers reverently position themselves within majestic or culturally significant surroundings. Overwhelmingly in this category, tourists have their backs to the camera, conveying a sense of candid interaction with their environment—a visual ‘moment’ rather than snapshot—and downplaying the mediation of the lens.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0163443712468608">
<title>Masking and controlling modernity</title>
<p>A corollary to seeking out the authentic in a cross-cultural encounter is masking, or minimizing, signs of the modern or ‘inauthentic’ through photography. In addition to gravitating towards material signs of the pre- modern, some tourists try to control the signs of modernity that inevitably appear on their tours through creative composition. While I will not speculate on the kinds of subjects that tourists may have intentionally <italic>not</italic> photographed, their representations of transport in WWT provide interesting visual evidence of how ‘old’ and ‘new’ versions of the same subjects are treated with different aesthetic techniques. Similar to how local people in Africa and Asia are pictured centrally in the frame, ‘older’ and nostalgic ways of moving (e.g. by gondola, canoe, Volkswagen beetle, or rickety bus) also appear to be so meaningful or intriguing that they can ‘carry’ an entire photograph as the sole subject. Wooden boats with chipped paint, for example, which were captured by several different photographers in multiple locations including India, Thailand, Sweden, and Greece, are all pictured centrally as vacant, docked, and motionless. With their functionality and human element stripped away, they resemble museum artifacts, worth contemplating for the ways they contrast against their industrial, western, unpictured counterparts. Newer modes of movement, on the other hand, such as subways, tour buses, cable cars, and routine automobile traffic, are never photographed for their own sake and always share the frame with something or someone else. A recurring example of this appears in the European set. A streak of colored lights, indicating fast-moving traffic at night, is always juxtaposed against an iconic image of floodlit oldness, such as Big Ben, the Coliseum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0163443712468608">Figure 2</xref>), historic Stockholm, or the arches of the Puerta de Alcalá in Madrid.</p>

</fig>
<p>To summarize, one photo and its accompanying caption exhibit a number of the enduring ideals of travel that are discussed above. In it, a Kenyan man dressed in western clothes stands on a hilltop, accompanied by a dog. With backs to the camera, the pair appear to contemplate a picturesque landscape of mountains, lake, and puffy-white clouds against a blue sky. The reader writes:<disp-quote>
<p>[This man] lives on Mfangano Island. He has been on the island since it was discovered. I was invited to his home last summer. The most precious memories are sometimes found in the most simplest people [sic]. If we all lived like the people of Mfangano we would find the meaning of life as it was meant to be enjoyed as he enjoyed the view from the top of this sacred area [sic].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0163443712468608">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The visual and verbal rhetoric of this text convey a number of enduring touristic notions, all rooted in the imagined existence of the ‘authentic’ as located in those areas isolated from the West, or only recently ‘discovered’ by modernity. The reader’s narrative recalls the same imperialist-nostalgic tropes that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712468608">Bruner (2001)</xref> found to underlie other forms of Kenyan tourism geared towards internationals. Glorifying the ‘simplest people,’ the reader laments that ‘we,’ the over-industrialized residents of modern societies, fail to grasp the meaning of our complicated lives. By being invited to this ‘sacred’ place by a local host, the contributor is freed from the artificial associations of tourism and finds authenticity through a personal relationship. His view echoes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712468608">Graburn’s (1989)</xref> notion of travel as a sacred journey with the power to restore simplicity to complex modern lives, however temporarily.</p>

<title>Emergent forms</title>
<p>In a departure from the enduring forms of representation that are rooted in historic ideals of western travel, the emergent forms in WWT make more overt references to more recent processes of globalization. In his study of travel photography and visual culture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">Osborne (2000)</xref> writes that the value of the travel photograph has declined as the world becomes saturated with images of itself. This global hypermediation has brought about an over-representation of people and places, transforming a previously vast and mysterious world into something ‘too well known, too fast’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">Osborne, 2000</xref>: 184). Tourism, along with other practices of global moving and seeing, has rapidly depreciated in cultural value, as ‘the traveler’s old certainties of self, art, and the old qualities and purposes of journeys are being lost’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">2000</xref>: 184). Against such disorienting difficulties of 21st-century travel, the emergent representations in WWT convey the sentiment that travel continues to be sustainable and socially worthwhile, despite its problematic dimensions and the declining importance of geographic barriers. This section explores some of the emergent ways in which that worth is communicated, primarily through new ways of touring, reflexive representations of tourists, and the confrontation of connectivity.</p>
<sec id="section9-0163443712468608">
<title>‘New’ ways of touring</title>
<p>In recent decades the tourism market has expanded to accommodate the fragmenting interests of the growing mobile classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0163443712468608">Mowforth and Munt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712468608">Munt, 1994</xref>). Conventional tourism is increasingly being counterbalanced by a growth of accessible travel options in the realm of business, study abroad, healthcare, and humanitarian work. In a number of captions in WWT, photographers highlight the fact that they took their featured picture while traveling for some purpose other than leisure, and that these purportedly non-touristic structures of travel enhanced their trips’ meaning. One reader snapped a photo of the moon in Rome, fading in the morning sky above the impressive dome of a church. For the photographer, this moment of photographic serendipity was made all the more meaningful by the studies she was undertaking in Europe:<disp-quote>
<p>I spent two months in Rome studying Italian after completing a degree in art history and a thesis focusing on the Italian renaissance. […] Being in that city made everything I’d learned in college come alive. I was surrounded by the art and architecture that had existed in my mind only as slides and powerpoints [sic].<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0163443712468608">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other captions, readers signal how easily, and even routinely, they are able to see the world through ‘non-touristic’ travel. They eschew the awed, ‘sacred’ tones of enduring representations, presenting instead the extraordinary activities of travel as ordinary and familiar. Well aware of what to expect before they arrive, these readers are not traveling to be surprised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">Osborne, 2000</xref>: 184). A volunteer to Africa writes the following about a photo of two young boys with ‘hardened faces’:<disp-quote>
<p>I have a thing for little-known countries, so in a way I was bound to wind up in Burkina Faso sooner or later. I chose to work at […] a local NGO that has a center for street children. I spent my days tutoring children in French and English, bandaging wounds, playing soccer […] and breaking up fights. [These boys] are both about eleven years old, but their hardened faces reveal the stark realities they have dealt with.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0163443712468608">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">Osborne (2000)</xref>, we can interpret this reader’s rhetorical strategy as one of an assortment that travelers use to re-present the value of travel in a media environment in which it is over-represented. Here she ‘reinvents the journey,’ discarding touristic modes of once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage for a more mundane form of ‘working’ travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">2000</xref>: 185). Others ‘reinvent’ their travels by venturing through the hidden and ‘unnoticed’ parts of popular destinations, striving to photograph the over-photographed from unconventional angles. Various pictures of the Eiffel Tower viewed from the inside, from underneath, or reflected in a pair of oversized sunglasses, reveal this trend.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to abandon altogether the expectations of self-expression that accompany most tourists on their trips, and create instead a structure for a journey that originates ‘entirely outside’ of oneself and the norms of tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">Osborne, 2000</xref>: 185). These photos do not aspire to document authentic experience, and are organized instead around the playful pursuit of themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0163443712468608">2000</xref>: 186). One tourist, for example, recounts seeking out and photographing all of the bagel shops in Montreal. Others are so cautious of clichés that they use their caption space in the <italic>New York Times</italic> as a platform to criticize other tourists and their hackneyed descriptions. One reader invokes the worn-out, self-centered descriptions of travel as he explains the alternative significance of his photo, which features friends hitching a ride in a covered truck in Otavalo, Ecuador:<disp-quote>
<p>There’s nothing hifalutin’ about it—it’s not about expanding horizons or pushing boundaries or learning about oneself. It’s just about going—not even ‘traveling’ and all the complications and implications involved: meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, etc. No, none of that. This is far more basic: just going.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0163443712468608">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the discursive level, this reader’s caption would suggest that there <italic>is</italic> something inescapably ‘hifalutin’’ about travel. Global mobility, it reminds us, remains highly problematic. Travel retains connotations of high status even as it becomes more attainable for the masses. The more that travelers attempt to avoid the label of ‘tourist’ (or even the now-common ‘traveler’) through their choices of itinerary and representations, the more they entrench themselves in an exercise of social distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0163443712468608">Munt, 1994</xref>). By attempting to distance himself from travelers of all stripes, this reader only manages to further posture himself as highly distinctive and mobile.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0163443712468608">
<title>Reflexive tourists</title>
<p>Readers’ attempts to reinvent and redefine travel are also evident in the instances in which they photograph themselves. Keying into a larger trend of ironic self-representation in photography, the photographs of self-conscious tourists evidence what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0163443712468608">Scott (2004</xref>: 31) calls the ‘postmodernist distrust of meta-narratives and dominant representations’ about tourism. Emergent representations show tourists bucking against the traditional conventions of travel photography, abandoning controlled or candid-like poses in favor of unusual—and some might say irreverent—ones (e.g. mountains viewed over the photographer’s toes, tourists climbing on famous monuments, or jumping so as to appear suspended in mid-air over tourist sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0163443712468608">Figure 3</xref>)). Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712468608">Feifer’s (1985)</xref> ‘post-tourists’ who acknowledge that they are visitors temporarily on tour of commodified attractions, these travelers openly communicate a sense of silliness, freedom from constraint, unapologetic cluelessness, or vulnerability in their new surroundings. These shots convey personality, too, as they are highly individualized. Tourists very rarely share the frame with each other in this category.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0163443712468608" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0163443712468608-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the most reflexive representations, tourists photograph themselves and others in the act of being tourists. As in the previous category, these images are often ludic, but they differ in that they foreground the liminal-outsider status of the tourist, primarily by highlighting the role of the camera. Here, tourists photograph themselves in reflections of puddles, mirrors, and shop windows. These touristic self-portraits come off as carefully composed, an opportunity to simultaneously document the extraordinary surroundings while making a meta-statement on the ubiquity of the travel photograph. These statements could be interpreted as criticisms of, or more optimistically as attempts to render artful, the inescapability of tourism all over the world.</p>
<p>As a final point, it is only in the European set of WWT photos that <italic>Times</italic> readers strike the conventional ‘tourist pose,’ standing with arms around each other, saying ‘cheese’ for the camera. Interestingly, in these instances the tourists are always interacting with some recognizable symbol of tourist kitsch. They wear traditional Bavarian clothing at Oktoberfest, berets in Paris, and stand in an enormous wooden shoe in Amsterdam. These images come off as ironic allusions to the Euro-centric tourist photographs of yesteryear, temporary appropriations of old photographic conventions for the sake of parodying them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0163443712468608">
<title>Confronting connectivity</title>
<p>An extension of reflexive tourist imagery, this final category of emergent representations deals with the ways in which photographers acknowledge the arrival of ‘modernity’—whether in the form of tourism, western media, or modern technology—to places that are commonly toured for their pre-modern features. In contrast to the final category in enduring representations (‘masking modernity’), these photographs often involve conscious juxtaposition of new technologies against symbols of the old. For example, one picture shows the words ‘Tourists are Terrorists’ spray-painted on an old wall in Lisbon. ‘It’s a sad situation,’ writes the photographer. ‘The more we travel the more things look the same.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0163443712468608">9</xref></sup> While one could argue that these juxtapositions are simply new ways of othering pre-industrial objects and practices, I believe that these photos are, on some level, attempts to destabilize the traditional barriers between ‘us’ and ‘them,’ ‘modern’ and ‘authentic’ that predominate in enduring representations. Rather than portraying tourists as the gazers and locals the object of their gaze, these photos declare that tourists and locals are connected to each other, from their economic relationship at the tourist site to their shared dependence on modern technology and consumption of global brands.</p>
<p>In one photo, a group of elderly Vietnamese friends huddle around the photographer’s iPod, smiling in amazement, for ‘they had never seen anything like it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0163443712468608">10</xref></sup> Other photos highlight the ostensibly incongruous use of cell phones by people in traditional garb, including a religious man in Israel and—in a dual poke at tourism and technology—a text-messaging Venetian gondolier. In an example of not only confronting connectivity head-on, but celebrating it, a pair of Western cyclists is pictured devouring noodles in a rundown Chinese cafe packed with curious local onlookers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0163443712468608">Figure 4</xref>). One tourist cheerfully poses for a Buddhist monk, who grins while positioning his camera. The reader recalls that upon stumbling into this cafe,<disp-quote>
<p>[P]hone calls were made and before long the entire town as well as the population of the local monastery were crammed into this little noodle shack. The only person with a camera was a monk and pretty soon we were the subject of an intense photo shoot. I still wonder if he posted my picture on his blog, just like I posted his picture on my blog.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0163443712468608">11</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>This photo aptly captures the combination of cultural difference, wonder, and novelty that characterize the majority of the cross-cultural encounters pictured in WWT. Here, however, those familiar distinctions are described as bridged in new ways by travel and technology, blurring the roles of tourist/touree and redefining the source of the traveler’s excitement as one of potential similarity, not difference. The image recognizes that locals, contrary to their traditional treatment by the tourist’s camera as objects of the gaze, are themselves active gazers and agents within their own mediated societies.</p>

<title>‘Why we travel’ as illustrated guide to global mobility</title>
<p>Readers’ representations in ‘Why we travel’ paint a picture of 21st-century travel as highly varied and driven by individual whims. However, their treatments of recurring subjects—like locals, poverty, nature, and transport—show underlying patterns of <italic>enduring</italic> and <italic>emergent</italic> themes. Some <italic>Times</italic> readers reproduce classic representations of tourism in their photographs, perhaps in an attempt to render the kind of ‘quality’ content that they expect of a widely read and respected newspaper. But in the same collection, others aim to challenge those dominant ideas with more personalized, problematic representations. Such divergent notions of travel and representation have appeared within different social groups and at different points in history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0163443712468608">Snow, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0163443712468608">Urry, 2002</xref>). ‘Why we travel’ is significant for bringing them together within a single mainstream text. This final portion of the article considers the cultural messages that the <italic>New York Times</italic> conveys by soliciting and designing a complex, polysemic feature like WWT. Though ranging from clichéd to creative, kitschy to political, the collection is displayed prominently within a respected online space that imbues it with a sense of legitimacy and coherence. Moreover, it is highly interactive, making it consistent with broader media trends that have transformed both 21st-century journalism and tourism into highly visualized and individualized experiences. By presenting WWT in this way, the <italic>Times</italic> promotes a distinctive vision of high-status global mobility, tailored to the tastes of a media-savvy, upper- and middle-class readership.</p>
<p>WWT can be viewed as something of a transitional travel text, at once drawing upon and departing from reporting conventions from the days of print. As this article has tried to show, the most striking feature of WWT is that it is not authored by a single <italic>Times</italic> reporter, but by <italic>Times</italic> readers—over 2000 of them. But the <italic>Times</italic> hardly hands over the representational reins to readers. Rather, it absorbs their evidence of world travel into its global brand. By using the pronoun ‘we’ in the title ‘Why we travel,’ the <italic>Times</italic> indirectly acknowledges the dissolving barriers between staff and ‘citizen’ journalists, evoking notions that they are all part of a globetrotting ‘<italic>Times</italic> community’ with shared tastes and desires. It presumes that when it comes to the topic of travel, anyone who has ‘been there’—and has the photographs to show for it—can legitimately report on what they saw. In exchange for the free labor and content, the <italic>Times</italic> lends additional authority to the readers’ work by packaging it within the paper’s signature visual aesthetic (with standardized web design, slideshow mechanics, and fonts) and publishing it on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nytimes.com">nytimes.com</ext-link> under its prestigious masthead. However ludic or personalized the individual components of WWT may be, its stable spot on the Travel main page imbues it with an aura of legitimacy and trueness similar to that found in more ‘serious’ parts of the paper.</p>
<p>It is also significant that travel is the topic for which the <italic>New York Times</italic> has so widely opened its gates to reader-authored content. The <italic>Times</italic> has carefully guarded its traditional reporting conventions ever since it began migrating content to the web in the mid 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712468608">Boczkowski, 2004</xref>). Despite the availability of new interactive features on the site, such as options for readers to leave comments and ‘recommend’ links, few other projects have challenged the ‘we publish, you read’ mindset (2004: 102) to the extent of WWT. Among other user-generated features on the website, WWT is significant in its size, scope, and longevity, running regularly from 2007 to the time of writing. The fact that mainstream travel reporting can be so easily ‘crowdsourced’ raises questions about what kind of content, knowledge, and reporting authority is deemed appropriate by newspaper editors and audiences to entrust to ordinary readers.</p>
<p>WWT also departs from traditional reporting in its format. Unlike most stories in both print and online outlets, WWT is not ‘read’ from top to bottom, nor is it a one-time report on a single destination or itinerary. Instead it is an interactive, multi-purpose library of readers’ travel images from around the world. This underscores a third way in which WWT breaks the travel journalism mold: its extensiveness of coverage and customizability would have been inconceivable in the days of print journalism. The online collection is built specifically for users to interact with in instantaneous, individualized ways and, as a result, it is a logical neighbor to the travel-planning resources that surround it on the Travel homepage. Thus from its content to its form, WWT conveys a sense of boundless global access and individual customizability. In this way, WWT is as much a document of readers’ travel experiences as it is of the editors’ assumption that readers are interested in perusing such travels virtually, and are familiar with navigating the sorts of information technologies needed to do so.</p>
<p>These assumptions about <italic>Times</italic> readers point to a final issue with WWT: what kinds of normative, cultural messages does the collection convey by being associated with a publication like the <italic>New York Times</italic>? The <italic>Times</italic> occupies a unique position in media culture, boasting world-class journalistic talent and coverage while striving to remain relevant to a broad American and international readership. Targeting educated, left- leaning audiences, it publishes content that both reflects and shapes the tastes of the mobile classes. Some defenders of high culture and media analysts have described publications like the <italic>Times</italic> as middlebrow, or part of a growing wave of ‘serious but inadequate’ media geared towards a general educated audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712468608">Dornfeld, 2002</xref>: 257; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0163443712468608">Jumonville, 1991</xref>: 152). The <italic>Times</italic> has been criticized for its ‘simple coverage’ of serious cultural topics ranging from art to books and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0163443712468608">Rubin, 1992</xref>: 34). But it is precisely this accessible ‘snobbishness’ of the <italic>Times</italic> that makes it worth considering as a prescriptive site, where high-status topics are interpreted in plain language, catering as much to readers’ need for information as their desire for quick-and-easy cultural enlightenment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712468608">Johnston and Baumann (2007)</xref> have demonstrated that high-status publications like gourmet food magazines subtly instruct readers on matters of taste in an increasingly democratized, omnivorous consumer culture where class barriers are no longer clear. In that vein, <italic>Times</italic> columnist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712468608">David Brooks (2000</xref>: 115) has described the arts and culture reporting of his newspaper as a daily record of ‘the changing ingredients of elite status.’ Travel to exotic locales, he points out, now figures much higher in this equation than it once did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712468608">2000</xref>: 203–5, 135). Thus, however ‘inadequate’ by highbrow standards, the <italic>Times</italic>’ coverage on food, real estate, weddings, health, and travel is effectively designed to outline for readers the latest concerns of a globally conscious bourgeois ‘taste culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712468608">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>: xi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712468608">Gans, 1999</xref>: 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0163443712468608">Johnston and Baumann, 2007</xref>). When subject matter is problematic or disorienting, as exhibited in WWT’s uneven representations of poverty, war, or gawking tourists, the publication works to legitimate them, presenting them as intelligible, uncontroversial, and worthy of contemplation and consumption.</p>
<p>In other words, as definitions of American mobility expand in response to media growth and globalization, so do the contours of ‘the good life’ that the <italic>Times</italic> constructs through its coverage. The changing patterns in the <italic>Times</italic>’ content and presentation, particularly visible in user-generated texts like WWT, do not necessarily reflect the inherent importance or newsworthiness of certain topics, but rather their perceived relevance to middle- to upper-class audiences. This is what makes the journalistic take-away of WWT—that <italic>Times</italic> readers are traveling and photographing the world, and in highly varied, personalized, but ultimately recognizable ways—socially significant. While the non-traditional features of WWT outlined above appear to indicate that the <italic>Times</italic> may be adjusting its reporting stance, dissolving the long-standing barriers between news producers and consumers, and democratizing its coverage of other nations by opening up space for readers to describe their own experiences abroad, the collection might be more accurately understood as a merely updated and globalized expression of a 21st-century ‘upper-middle’ taste culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712468608">Gans, 1999</xref>). WWT suggests that whereas the tourists of yesteryear went sightseeing in buses and cruise ships, following preordained itineraries, the prospective travelers of today ought to literally ‘click’ and choose where, how, and when to tour according to their individual tastes. In all, the customizable gallery of WWT is an apt artifact of the 21st-century mobile culture it ‘covers.’ With its vast library of readers’ own testimonies of ‘Why we travel,’ the <italic>Times</italic> invites, as well as instructs, the wider readership to scroll through seemingly endless, but ultimately circumscribed, combinations of destinations, traveling styles, and global representations. It reassures that gazing upon them all, even at once, is now legitimately possible and advisable.</p>

<p>To account for the occurrence of multiple subjects in one frame, a maximum of three subjects were coded in each photo. For example, an image of a scuba-diving tourist in the Great Barrier Reef who is photographed touching a large fish was coded as Tourist, Animal, and Nature. The maximum number of subjects were coded only if all three were considered definitive or central to the picture. For example, cars appeared frequently in photos, but were only coded as Transport subjects if they were featured prominently in the image.</p>
