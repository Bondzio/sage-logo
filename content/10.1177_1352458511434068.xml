<title>Rebuttal</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) exclusively affects humans. Epidemiology encompasses the study of disease in people, being defined as ‘the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control of health problems’. The word ‘epidemiology’ stems from Greek: <italic>epi</italic> meaning ‘upon, among’, <italic>demos</italic> being ‘people, demography’, and <italic>logia</italic> meaning ‘study or discourse.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434068">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The field of epidemiology has made substantial contributions to our understanding of health and disease; landmark findings include elucidation of the relationships between smoking and lung cancer;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434068">1</xref></sup> diethylstilboestrol (DES) exposure during pregnancy and long-term complications in female offspring (‘DES daughters’); artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434068">1</xref></sup> as well as the development of the Framingham risk scores for cardiovascular risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434068">1</xref></sup> Imagine if the equivalent of any of these associations could be established for MS.</p>
<p>For something to have ‘had its day’, its popularity and influential period must have now passed. This does not appear to be the case with epidemiology; on the contrary, evidence suggests that it is a rapidly developing field and is considered a ‘young science’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511434068">1</xref></sup> Today, epidemiology encompasses an ever-growing field of focused specialities, ranging from methodological specific (e.g. meta-analysis) to disease specific (e.g. neuroepidemiology); other examples include: genetic epidemiology (i.e. the interaction of genes and environment in relation to population health); pharmacoepidemiology (the study of the use and effects of drugs in large cohorts of people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511434068">2</xref></sup>); life-course epidemiology (birth cohorts and foetal origins of adult disease); and spatial epidemiology (the spatial distribution of disease). Broadly speaking, clinical trials also fall under its umbrella, and are considered as experimental or clinical, interventional epidemiology. Well-designed randomized clinical trials (RCTs) play a very useful role in determining drug efficacy, at least over the short term in select patients, facilitating the drug licensing and approval process.</p>
<p>So what has epidemiology done for MS recently? There are too many studies to cover here, but some recent highlights include the identification of risk factors, such as <italic>HLA-DRB1*15</italic> alleles, previous Epstein–Barr virus infection, and low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, that are associated with the onset of paediatric MS (in a prospective Canadian study);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511434068">3</xref></sup> similar risk factors have been identified in adult MS populations and smoking (passive or active) may also play a role. In addition, the pattern and prevalence of adverse effects associated with drug treatment for MS have been elucidated. For example, based on current data, the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) associated with natalizumab appears to be around 1 in 1000, likely higher for those exposed longer than 1–2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511434068">4</xref></sup> Leukaemia secondary to mitoxantrone treatment may affect as many as 1 in 300 treated MS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511434068">5</xref></sup> All of these studies have important implications for patient counselling, diagnosis, risk-management, and present opportunities to modify future risk.</p>
<p>Epidemiology is certainly not without its challenges. Confounding and bias can occur; some are well recognized and some are complex. As in any area of research, all such challenges provide opportunities to learn, develop and improve upon future endeavours. We now know that ‘observation (information) bias’ can affect studies that examine risk factors associated with MS. Examples include sex-specific recall and reporting biases when collecting family history information; women tend to give more comprehensive family member medical histories than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511434068">6</xref></sup> ‘Recall bias’ may have lead to spurious associations between hepatitis B vaccination and MS; when the study design was improved (through a nested case–control approach), no such association was evident.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511434068">7</xref></sup> ‘Immortal time bias’ can affect findings from observational studies of drug effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511434068">8</xref></sup> ‘Follow-up time bias’ can affect studies examining potential changes in MS demographics over time, leading to the spurious findings of an apparent lowering of the MS onset age, if there is unequal follow-up time between time-period groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511434068">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Communication of epidemiological findings to end users, healthcare professionals and the public can also be a challenge. For instance, reporting benefits (or adverse effects) of a pharmacological intervention using the relative-risk is more persuasive than the absolute risk, although many find either difficult to interpret.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511434068">10</xref></sup> Epidemiological findings can be misinterpreted and reported by the media, or by other sources, in such a way that misleads, causes confusion and ultimately generates public distrust. These issues do not negate the importance or need for epidemiological studies, rather they highlight the necessity to engage the skills of an epidemiologist, to improve communication of findings and to educate the public and relevant end-users on realistic study interpretation and risk perception; this would ultimately help better, more informed health-related decisions to be made.</p>
<p>So, has MS epidemiology had its day? Do we need any more clinical trials (experimental, interventional epidemiology), or are there no more new drug entities to test? Do we need to know about drug effectiveness and adverse effects in the wider ‘real-world’ clinical practice setting (pharmacoepidemiology), or should we rely on anecdotes? Do we need to know more about the risk of PML with natalizumab or adverse effects associated with the newer drugs for MS, such as infections and fingolimod, or do we already know enough? Is it important to determine robust estimates as to how many people have MS and whether this is changing over time (surveillance epidemiology) or is influenced by geographical features (spatial epidemiology), or should we just guess? Do we need to know about prognosis, disease progression and mortality in MS (natural history epidemiology), or should we rely on patient/physician/family testimony? Finally do we care about issues which ethically only epidemiological studies can test, such as drug exposure during (human) pregnancy (reproductive epidemiology)? These rhetorical questions corroborate the importance, the need and the vital role of epidemiology in MS research.</p>
<p>What about other disciplines? Should epidemiology be used to the exclusion of other research methodologies? Absolutely not. The vast breadth of research ongoing in MS is one of the fields’ greatest strengths. Where would we be without the basic sciences to find the biological rationale that underpins epidemiological studies? Where would the clinical trial be without the years of pre-screening, pre- testing, toxicology, pharmacology, immunology, all performed in the (wet) laboratory setting?</p>
<p>These are exciting times for MS epidemiology. We are now in the post-genomic era. The human genome project coupled with more advanced epidemiological techniques has opened up new avenues. A multi-disciplinary team approach and a broad out-look can only enhance the scientific community’s ability to further knowledge, to improve quality of life for those affected by MS, to reduce the risk and ultimately, to develop a cure for this devastating disease.</p>
