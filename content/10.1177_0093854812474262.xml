<abstract>
<p>A number of methodological techniques and theoretical propositions have been used in the extant literature on specialization/versatility. These various methodologies and theories have created an ongoing debate that has revealed several areas of focus that need to be addressed. The current study applies Moffitt’s (1993) taxonomy and uses a series of random effects logistic regression models to estimate the impact of a violent, property, drug, or other prior offense on the commission of a subsequent offense across different types of criminal careers. Specifically, we attempt to determine the odds a prior offense has on predicting a subsequent offense among four offender trajectories, controlling for various aspects of the criminal career and demographic characteristics. Findings suggest that the odds of committing any offense type over the life course are greater if the prior offense was of the <italic>same</italic> type. This relationship remains consistent across offender trajectories.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate between specialization and versatility in offending is both theoretical and methodological. Scholars like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> contend that there is great variability in the criminal acts that an individual engages in and it is unreasonable to assume that offenders specialize in particular types of crime. Alternatively, positive learning theories suggest that certain offenders will repeat specific forms of crime, insinuating the possibility of specialization and distinctive subcultures of delinquency based around particular crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093854812474262">Cloward &amp; Ohlin, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt, 1993</xref>). Early research using transition matrices, factor analyses, and simple comparisons of crime involvement demonstrate that there is a lot of versatility in offending with minor specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812474262">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812474262">Farrington, Snyder, &amp; Finnegan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812474262">Hindelang, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812474262">Hindelang, Hirschi, &amp; Weis, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093854812474262">Klein, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093854812474262">Petersilia, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093854812474262">Rojek &amp; Erickson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang, Figlio, &amp; Sellin, 1972</xref>). Yet, current research using more advanced statistical methods, such as log-linear methods, latent class analysis, item response theory, and short-term data from smaller time periods, finds higher levels of specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812474262">Francis, Liu, &amp; Soothill, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812474262">Francis, Soothill, &amp; Fligelstone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812474262">McGloin, Sullivan, &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan, McGloin, Pratt, &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan, McGloin, Ray, &amp; Caudy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of this theoretical and methodological debate, specialization has become one of the most widely studied topics in criminal career research, appealing to crime scholars and public policy specialists alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812474262">Mazerolle, Brame, Paternoster, Piquero, &amp; Dean, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, its important implication for theory and policy has led scholars to continue to refine their measures and explore nuances of specialization in both the short term and the long term. These efforts have produced an extensive literature testing the presence of specialization/versatility among various types of offenders using multiple methods. A specialist is identified in the literature as having a greater tendency to repeat the same crime or offense, whereas a nonspecialist commits different offenses on various occasions, with no inclination to pursue a specific criminal act or pattern of criminal acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093854812474262">Paternoster, Brame, Piquero, Mazerolle, &amp; Dean, 1998</xref>). Therefore, tests of specialization are designed to determine whether an offender is more likely to commit the same offense or a different offense over a particular time span.</p>
<p>Even among those studies that find greater versatility and less specialization, it is noted that the highest probabilities in the transition from one offense to the next are the transitions between similar offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812474262">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>). Considering that many tests of specialization using various methods are criticized for random error in the calculations, confounding effects, unclear meanings, aggregation, and the inability to identify the type of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812474262">Farrington, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin, Sullivan, Piquero, &amp; Pratt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>), these findings must be considered with some degree of caution. However, what remains clear throughout these studies is that when specialization is observed, it is because there is a larger probability for specialization, demonstrated either by the transition between offenses or the creation of latent classes.</p>
<p>In order to advance the theoretical and methodological debate surrounding specialization/versatility, this study sets out to expand upon prior methods of testing specialization using the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812474262">Tracy &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093854812474262">Tracy, Wolfgang, &amp; Figlio, 1990</xref>). We consider the theories and methods that have been used to test specialization/versatility and select a theoretical framework in which to study specialization that addresses some of the methodological concerns while also considering that not all offenders have similar trajectories over the life course. Specifically, we consider the propositions established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> and create offense trajectories to simulate the groups delineated by her. We then disaggregate by these trajectories to determine whether specialization is more likely for certain offenses depending on the type of offender. To test for specialization, we use a series of random effects logistic regression models to predict the likelihood that an offender’s subsequent offense is the same as the prior offense he or she committed for violent, property, drug, and other crimes across the life course. Both the theoretical framework and the actual model facilitate in accounting for several limitations of prior studies, including the lack of control for other variables, the inability to account for multiple types of offenses and offending patterns, and the tendency to aggregate the data.</p>

<title>The Theoretical Debate</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> identify four elements in their notion of low self-control: (1) stability of individual differences over time, (2) great variability in the kinds of criminal acts committed, (3) conceptual equivalence of criminal and noncriminal acts, and (4) inability to predict forms of deviant engagement. Of central importance for the specialization/versatility debate is their emphasis on the variability in the offenses committed by individuals. Because they believe that crime will be engaged in at a high rate by people with low self-control, they conclude that there will be versatility in offending as a consequence. To bolster their argument, they point to overwhelming evidence of versatility in the literature, including the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al. (1972)</xref> cohort study, the work by Hindelang and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093854812474262">1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093854812474262">1981</xref>), and the research of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093854812474262">Rojek and Erickson (1982)</xref>. According to Gottfredson and Hirschi versatility even extends to analogous behaviors, including truancy, dropping out of school, employment instability, alcohol use, drug use, child and spouse abuse, motor vehicle accidents, and unrestrained sexual activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In the discussion of their theoretical propositions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> address the concept of the criminal career as well. They note that the career model implies a certain terminology, including specialization, amount of time and effort devoted, level of accomplishment, productivity, current direction, overall shape, and time out for other activities. According to the theorists, crime as a career is refuted by their concept of low self-control, and it is not reasonable to assume criminals can specialize, crime escalates, or even that there is intermittency or a “time out” between offenses (p. 266). Specifically, the labels placed on offenders in relation to these careers, such as <italic>robber, burglar, drug dealer, rapist</italic>, and <italic>murderer</italic>, are “retrospective rather than predictive” and they ignore criminal behavior committed by these offenders that is not consistent with the label they have been given (p. 92).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1994)</xref> do recognize that specialization in offenses can occur for some offenders. They argue that this apparent specialization that is sometimes observed is a function of opportunity and circumstance and not necessarily a characteristic of the offender. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood and Schreck (2007)</xref> note, Gottfredson and Hirschi claim that a pattern whereby an individual commits a disproportionate number of identical offenses “reflects erratic variation in opportunities rather than lasting individual traits or preferences” (p. 301). If this view is taken, it is probable that offenders will occasionally specialize, and therefore any finding of specialization is an artifact of this inherent probability and not necessarily an indicator of a specialized career.</p>
<p>While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> focus on low self-control and how individuals low in self-control will experience versatile offending throughout the life course, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812474262">Farrington’s (2005)</xref> integrated cognitive antisocial potential (ICAP) theory focuses on antisocial potential and how high levels of antisocial potential can lead to versatile offending patterns. According to his theory, people with high antisocial potential are more likely to commit many different types of antisocial acts, including different types of offenses. This would mean that offending and antisocial behavior are versatile, not specialized. Similar to Gottfredson and Hirschi, Farrington recognizes that the commission of offenses and antisocial acts depends on the interaction between individuals and their social environments, which means that the commission of delinquent acts is dependent on opportunity. Following the logic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1994)</xref>, any observation of specialization would be an artifact of opportunity.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> taxonomy is built around the criminal career model and explicitly recognizes the possibility of specialization among certain types of offenders. She identifies two groups of offenders: adolescence-limited (AL) and life course–persistent offenders (LCP). ALs generally follow the age-crime curve, committing the majority of their offenses in their teenage years and dropping out of crime shortly thereafter. These offenders lack consistency in their criminal behavior, often exhibiting sporadic, crime-free periods throughout their short criminal careers. AL offenders are expected to engage primarily in crimes that symbolize their adulthood, such as vandalism, public order offenses, substance use, and theft. Unlike ALs, LCP offenders continuously offend throughout the life course. These offenders fall into a pattern of criminal behavior that becomes inescapable as they continue to suffer the consequences of their behavior and fail to learn prosocial alternatives to crime. LCP offenders are expected to engage in a wide variety of offenses, including violence and fraud, and they are expected to have lower levels of self-control and would presumably have higher levels of antisocial potential. Therefore, it is LCPs that resemble the offenders identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812474262">Farrington (2005)</xref>.</p>
<p>Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> propositions, specialization becomes a plausible possibility in the commission of offenses across the life course. In accordance with this possibility, recent studies have looked at specialization for specific types of offenders and offense overlap among offenders to determine if there is evidence of specialization. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812474262">Rosenfeld, White, and Esbensen (2012)</xref> found a large amount of overlap among different types of offending during adolescence and young adulthood and from adolescence into young adulthood, suggesting versatility over specialization, especially among drug dealers. However, they found both versatility and specialization in sex and homicide offending, in that these offenders were more likely to be arrested for another sex offense or homicide than were those imprisoned for other types of offenses. The authors also noted that the modal offense category for prior arrests of each crime type was the offenses for which the individual was imprisoned. For example, about 88% of those who were in prison for a property crime had a prior arrest for property crime.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812474262">Loeber, Farrington, Stouthamer-Loeber, and Raskin White (2008)</xref> used data from the oldest and youngest cohorts of the Pittsburgh Youth Study, a self-report study, to look at specialization and versatility, among other elements of the criminal career. According to their results, there was a considerable amount of specialization in serious violence and theft, with a little less than half of all violent offenders specialized in violent offenses and one third of all theft offenders specialized in theft offenses. Similar to these findings, trajectory models also showed more evidence for violence specialization than theft specialization. In addition, they found partial confirmation that offense specialization increases with age and that specialization may depend on the level of severity of the offense. The authors concluded that “the data contradict the notion that specialized offenders are uncommon and generalized offending is the rule” (p. 128).</p>
<p>Essentially, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> predicts that ALs specialize in the delinquent offenses they commit, whereas LCPs are more versatile, committing multiple types of offenses over their life course. In this sense, versatility is only characteristic of life course–persistent offenders. The switching between offenses that Moffitt refers to in these scenarios is the switch that occurs between categories of offenses, and not necessarily within categories of offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero, Paternoster, Mazerolle, Brame, &amp; Dean, 1999</xref>). Therefore, any specialization that occurs among AL offenders should involve less serious forms of crime, such as property, drug, and other lower forms of crime. Because LCPs are expected to commit more violent forms of crime, specialization among violent offenses should be unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812474262">Piquero, Farrington, &amp; Blumstein, 2007</xref>), although research to date seems to indicate otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812474262">Loeber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812474262">Rosenfeld et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>The Methodological Debate</title>
<p>Because specialization/versatility is such a highly debated topic theoretically, a methodological debate was initiated in an effort to find the best way to statistically capture specialization/versatility. In the research to date, most studies incorporate probabilities and indices built from probabilities to capture specialization/versatility. The original use of probabilities dates back to the 1970s and 1980s with the initiation of transition matrices, or aggregate probabilities of offending behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf, 1987</xref>). Transition matrices reflect the probability that an individual committed a certain offense on arrest <italic>k</italic> and then committed the same offense on arrest <italic>k</italic> + 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812474262">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>). According to the transition matrices, there was a lot of versatility among offenses, but as referenced previously, the highest probabilities were the transitions between similar offenses, suggesting some specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812474262">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>These original transition matrices were further complicated by the introduction of the Forward Specialization Coefficient (FSC) as an index of the degree of specialization on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 is complete versatility and 1 is perfect forward specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812474262">Farrington, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812474262">Farrington et al., 1988</xref>). Studies using the FSC have reached various conclusions. Whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf (1987)</xref> found low overall specialization based on low FSC values, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812474262">Farrington et al. (1988)</xref> found low FSC values also, but these values were significantly different from zero, suggesting evidence of forward specialization. According to their analysis, persistent offenders were more specialized, whereby the average FSC of persistent offenders increased with each transition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093854812474262">Armstrong (2008)</xref> noted the influence of age on this relationship and the tendency for higher specialization among persistent offenders in drug and miscellaneous offenses, but not in violent and property offenses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al. (1999)</xref> also found that higher FSCs, which demonstrate greater forward specialization, are characteristic of offenders with a late age of onset. Overall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812474262">Farrington et al. (1988)</xref> concluded that there seems to be some evidence of specialization among a lot of versatility in offending.</p>
<p>Due to criticisms of the FSC, scholars have continued to use probabilities, but in improved methods that take into account some of the issues related to the FSC and earlier transition matrices, such as random error, unclear meanings, aggregation, and confounding effects of frequency of offending and sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, the FSC cannot determine whether specialization exists in an individual’s criminal career; it only addresses whether there is specialization within the offending patterns of the entire sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt (1996)</xref> proposed a measure of specialization based on the log-linear analytic method. Offense specialization is when the log-odds of repeating the same offense are greater than switching between offenses for each pair of offense types. Using this model, the findings indicated that there was a greater likelihood of repeating the same offense rather than switching offenses, providing stronger evidence of specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093854812474262">Britt, 1996</xref>). There was also evidence that specialization varied across groups of offenders based on race. Stemming from this log-linear method, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093854812474262">Armstrong and Britt (2004)</xref> used multinomial logistic regression for five offense types across 10 transitions to find increases in the probability of repeating a given offense for miscellaneous offenses, drug offenses, and violent offenses. They also found that when controlling for correlates of offending, the average offender is not likely to repeat the same offense, but this varies when considering age at time of arrest.</p>
<p>As another alternative method to the FSC, some researchers have used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812474262">Agresti and Agresti’s (1978)</xref> diversity index. The diversity index is the probability that any two offenses drawn randomly from an individual’s set of offenses belongs to two different offending categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>). The index ranges from a minimum value of 0, representing the least diverse population (specialization), to a maximum value of (<italic>k</italic> – 1)/<italic>k</italic>, representing the most diverse population that is evenly spread over <italic>k</italic> categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093854812474262">Agresti &amp; Agresti, 1978</xref>). Because this is a probability based on an individual’s set of offenses, it measures specialization at the individual level and captures the overall versatility of an individual offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812474262">Mazerolle et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Using the diversity index, scholars assess specialization in terms of age, onset age, gender, persistent offending, and local life circumstances. Studies using the diversity index show that versatility increases as age and age of onset decrease and as the number of offenses increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812474262">Mazerolle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, younger early onsetters that are more persistent offenders have greater offending diversity among both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812474262">Mazerolle et al., 2000</xref>). It appears that early adulthood is characterized by increased diversity in offending that decreases into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812474262">Nieuwbeerta, Blokland, Piquero, &amp; Sweeten, 2011</xref>). It has also been found that specialization varies across offending trajectories, where sporadic offenders are more specialized and frequent offenders are more diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812474262">Nieuwbeerta et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Also incorporating the use of probabilities, some researchers have turned their attention to latent class analysis. In these models, specialization is classified depending on whether the identified latent classes reflect subgroups around distinct offense types, indicating specialized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812474262">Francis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Other research has expanded latent class analysis to latent transition analysis, “an autoregressive model that examines change and stability in latent groups over time” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2009</xref>, p. 249). It provides a probability of transition across latent categories and infers whether individuals show change and the form of change in offending behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2009</xref>). Studies using both models have found distinct latent classes involving drugs, burglary, theft, and shoplifting, with some tendency toward versatility depending on the age and gender of the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812474262">Francis et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812474262">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A more recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood and Schreck (2007)</xref> used item response theory to model specialization as a latent variable. Through a multilevel analysis, they assessed the presence of specialization in violence by determining the log-odds that an individual committed an offense depending on (a) individual differences in the rate of offending or the tendency of an individual to offend, (b) the base rate of that offense (with rare offenses having lower values), and (c) the probability of committing each offense or specialization (the difference between the log odds of committing a violent offense versus the log odds of committing a nonviolent offense). This model distinguishes between offending frequency and versatility, and it considers individual patterns of specialization relative to offense patterns of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Using this model, specialization has been found among violent offenses and intimate partner violence among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812474262">Bouffard, Wright, Muftic, &amp; Bouffard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Through the evolution of methods to study specialization/versatility, it has become clear that specialization is more apparent than the early research suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093854812474262">Bouffard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812474262">Francis et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812474262">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). These studies demonstrate that it is important to separate specialization from offense frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812474262">Farrington, 1986</xref>), address specialization at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>), consider the unique offending patterns of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>), and indicate the type of crimes for which offenders tend to specialize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Measures of specialization that can be employed in regression analyses are also beneficial, since the researcher can control for other factors that may be impacting the likelihood of specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>). Conclusions from these analyses reveal that specialization/versatility (a) varies depending on the type of offender, specifically in relation to persistent offenders and offense trajectories, and (b) age, onset age, race, offense rank, and gender are important predictors of specialization/versatility and should be considered within regression analyses.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Addressing both the theoretical and methodological debate, this study uses a random sample of 2,500 individuals with two or more offenses, responsible for a total of 14,649 offenses, from the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0093854812474262">Tracy et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812474262">Tracy &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 1996</xref>). We limit the study to offenders with at least two offenses in order to capture patterns of specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>) and offenses committed after the age of 7, since 7 is generally considered to be the minimum age at which individuals may be held accountable for their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093854812474262">Bernard, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093854812474262">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093854812474262">Farrington &amp; Welsh, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0093854812474262">Tanenhaus, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0093854812474262">Zimring, 2005</xref>). This data set contains various measures for individuals from birth to age 26, who were originally born in Philadelphia in 1958. Until age 18, police contact data were recorded, along with records of “remedial, or informal, handling of the youth by an officer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812474262">Tracy &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 1996</xref>, p. 65). Once the cohort reached age 18, “court files included police reports, so data on adult crime are comparable to that for delinquency,” but there were no remedial reports for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0093854812474262">Tracy &amp; Kempf-Leonard, 1996</xref>, p. 65). The individual measures and police contact/arrest information combine to form a nested data set of offenses within individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0093854812474262">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The dependent variable consists of various offenses combined into offense categories based on the nature of the offense. Specifically, four offense types were created: violent, property, drug, and other. Violent offenses are operationalized as all offenses identified by the police as homicide, rape, robbery, assault, weapons possession, and domestic violence. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al. (1999)</xref>, we classified robbery as a violent crime. Burglary, theft, auto theft, arson, forgery, fraud, embezzlement, stolen property, and vandalism are considered property offenses. Included among the drug offenses are narcotic and drug law violations. Other offenses are comprised of prostitution, sex offenses, gambling, driving while intoxicated, liquor law violations, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, vagrancy, minor disturbances, and miscellaneous offenses. The miscellaneous offenses classification is rather ambiguous and there is little additional information to help further elucidate this group of offenses; still, we think it is important to include this classification of offenses even if we are unable to identify a specific offense for which individuals came into contact with the police. Each offense type was dichotomized accordingly into four variables: violent (1) and nonviolent (0), property (1) and non-property (0), drug (1) and non-drug (0), and other (1) and non-other (0) offenses.</p>
<p>We are aware that the broad categorization of offenses can potentially hide the switching that occurs within offense types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>). As recognized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al. (1999)</xref>, Moffitt combines property and other offenses into a nonviolent category to compare against violent offenses in her own research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093854812474262">Moffitt, Caspi, Dickson, Silva, &amp; Stanton, 1996</xref>). Following this logic, it is clear that she is more concerned with the switch that occurs between broad categories of offenses, not within categories of offenses. In terms of her research, our categorizations are slightly less broad, considering that we create four different categories of offenses, but they still fall into the broad conceptualization she advocates. Also, because of the tendency of offenses to aggregate toward distinct groups and the desire to maintain clarity and simplicity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093854812474262">Cohen (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093854812474262">Spelman (1994)</xref> have recommended the use of broad categories of offenses. We are aware that others, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093854812474262">Farrington et al. (1988)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812474262">Rosenfeld et al. (2012)</xref>, have identified certain offenses within these categories as specialized offenses. However, following the theoretical foundation of this study, and in order to create a clear and simplified analysis, we maintain the violent, property, drug, and other crime distinctions.</p>
<p>The main independent variable in the analysis is type of prior offense. Four dichotomous variables were created to denote whether the prior offense was violent (yes = 1), property (yes = 1), drug (yes = 1), or other (yes = 1). The first offense was dropped for all models because there is no prior offense (<italic>J</italic>) to predict the subsequent offense (<italic>J</italic> + 1). Separate models were analyzed for each type of offense <italic>J</italic> predicting each type of offense <italic>J</italic> + 1 so that, for example, the odds of having a recorded police contact for a violent offense were predicted if the prior recorded police contact was for a violent offense, property offense, drug offense, or other offense.</p>
<p>The gap between contacts, or intermittency, is operationalized as the months between offenses. Recorded police contacts that occurred in the same month and police contacts that occurred in consecutive months were scored 0, such that there were 0 months between police contacts. The 1958 Birth Cohort Study only contains the month and year of each contact, so we are limited to studying intermittency as the months between contacts. Recent research has noted the importance of intermittency in the study of criminal careers and its effect on offense seriousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812474262">Baker, Falco Metcalfe, &amp; Piquero, in press</xref>). Intermittency is also a confounding factor in analyses including age, age of onset, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES), since it is dependent on each of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812474262">Baker et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093854812474262">Piquero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 2007</xref>). Because of this, we control for intermittency in our models predicting offense specialization.</p>
<p>Following prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093854812474262">Patterson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0093854812474262">Tibbetts &amp; Piquero, 1999</xref>), age of onset is a dichotomous variable coded early onset (1) for offenders with an onset age before 14 years and late onset (0) for offenders with an onset age of 14 years or older. A dichotomous measure of onset age was chosen, as opposed to a continuous measure, to align with the theoretical propositions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> and to address the potential confounding effects of age and age of onset suggested by prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>). Age is a continuous variable measured in years, while SES,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093854812474262">1</xref></sup> race, and sex are dichotomized by high SES (1) and low SES (0), White (1) and non-White (0), and male (1) and female (0).</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The analysis in the current study involves a twofold process by first estimating trajectories for the random sample of 2,500 individuals with two plus offenses and then analyzing the data using random effects logistic regression models disaggregated by the offense trajectories. The trajectories are designed to address the propositions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref>. According to Moffitt, adolescence-limited offenders should exhibit patterns of specialization, especially among less serious offense types, while life course–persistent offenders should demonstrate greater versatility. The trajectories also address the methodological concern regarding consideration of the unique offending patterns of individuals within models of specialization/versatility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The choice of random effects models is meant to address some of the methodological issues while also providing an alternative method of testing for specialization/versatility. By using random effects logistic regression models, we are able to test the odds that police contact <italic>J</italic> + 1 falls into the same offense category as police contact <italic>J</italic> for four types of offenses: violent, property, drug, and other offenses. Using random effects logistic regression to predict the odds of coming into contact with the police for offense <italic>J</italic> + 1 extends prior research exploring specialization, addressing several of the methodological flaws identified by prior studies. Specifically, while past research predicting specialization uses transition matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>), forward specialization coefficients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812474262">Farrington, 1986</xref>), diversity indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093854812474262">Piquero et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>), latent classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093854812474262">Francis et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093854812474262">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2009</xref>), and/or item response theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>), each is limited either from the inability to control for other substantive variables of interest, account for more than one type of offense (i.e., violent vs. nonviolent offenses), or measure specialization at the individual level. Acknowledging these limitations, the current analysis provides a method for remedying these issues by predicting the odds of coming into contact with the police for offense type <italic>J</italic> + 1 based on prior police contact for offense type <italic>J</italic>, controlling for time-varying factors, such as type of prior offense, intermittency, and age, and time-invariant factors, such as age of onset, SES, sex, and race.</p>
<p>While other methods have their own advantages, the random effects logistic regression models applied in this study (a) adjust for the differing numbers of police contacts per person, (b) provide an individual-level approach to studying specialization/versatility, and (c) focus on different types of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093854812474262">Farrington, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">2009</xref>). Furthermore, disaggregating by offense trajectories accounts for individual offending rates, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> posits and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood and Schreck (2007)</xref> demonstrate could influence specialization/versatility.</p>

Considering that the dependent variable in this analysis was a count-based measure representing the number of police contacts by age, and there was an overrepresentation of zeros in the data, a zero-inflated semi-parametric Poisson model was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093854812474262">Nagin, 2005</xref>).

<p>Before reviewing the trajectory results estimated in the current study, it is considerably important to note here that the trajectory method has been criticized for what has been referred to as “the reification of groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093854812474262">Sampson &amp; Laub, 2005b</xref>). In response to this criticism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093854812474262">Nagin and Tremblay (2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093854812474262">2005b</xref>) have provided additional clarifications in this regard by stating that the groups are labeled not as an exercise in reification, rather they are assigned a label purely for “literary convenience.” Or in other words, these labels facilitate the discussion of comparisons and contrasts that can be made between similar and/or different observable patterns of behavior across trajectory groups. Furthermore, “discovering” trajectory groups is a statistical approximation (e.g., sometimes you may find two groups, sometimes three groups, etc.; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093854812474262">Jennings &amp; Reingle, 2012</xref>), and as such, the observed trajectories in any particular study with any sample are not meant to be interpreted as factual representations of reality (a common limitation of all statistical models). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093854812474262">Sampson and Laub (2005c)</xref> even argued that they were not suggesting that trajectory models should not be used or are not relevant, they just wanted to acknowledge the potential limitation that modelers may apply and misinterpret the results (e.g., or reify groups), which is a mistake akin to researchers making errors in interpreting regression results as causal versus correlational (for further discussions, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093854812474262">Maughan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093854812474262">Nagin &amp; Tremblay, 2005c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093854812474262">2005d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093854812474262">Raudenbush, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093854812474262">Sampson &amp; Laub, 2005a</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093854812474262">Skardhamar (2010</xref>; although also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093854812474262">Brame, Paternoster, &amp; Piquero, 2012</xref>, in defense of the method) provided a simulation experiment with trajectory models and concluded with offering the following words of caution when applying trajectory models:<disp-quote>
<p>It might be that the direct interpretation of the trajectory groups is reasonable in some special cases, but this finding will have to be justified explicitly in each application. Given the predominantly exploratory approach in criminological studies that apply SPGM, the findings from these studies are typically equally in accordance with both general and typological approaches and, therefore, are not a test of either. (p. 315)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Acknowledging the importance of the reification issue and related debate reviewed previously, though our trajectory solution produced four separate trajectories, they fall into two distinct categories of offenders—adolescent peaked offenders and chronic offenders (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093854812474262">Figure 1</xref>). We use these categorizations to stay consistent with prior trajectory analyses of the 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study where four similar trajectories of offenders were produced and labeled as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093854812474262">D’Unger, Land, &amp; McCall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093854812474262">D’Unger, Land, McCall, &amp; Nagin, 1998</xref>). To avoid confusion, however, it is important to note that <italic>chronic</italic> refers to persistence in offending, not frequency. Frequency in offending is captured in the delineation between low-rate and high-rate offending. Therefore, these two categorizations resemble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> ALs and LCPs. Finding multiple trajectories within these offending categories is not uncommon (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093854812474262">Ferguson, Horwood, &amp; Nagin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093854812474262">Nagin, Farrington, &amp; Moffitt, 1995</xref>). Though Moffitt originally posited two patterns of offending, she concedes that the original AL/LCP groups were “defined several years ago using cutoff methods that have recently been superseded by trajectory-detection methods less susceptible to misclassification error (Nagin, 1999; Roeder et al., 1999). Our future studies will adopt trajectory methods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093854812474262">Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, &amp; Milne, 2002</xref>, p. 201). As such, we have chosen the trajectory method and our four-group model to test the propositions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> original assertions regarding ALs and LCPs.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics for each offender trajectory are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093854812474262">Table 1</xref>. Due to the fact that the main independent variables are dichotomous, the means for each statistic are the percentage of the total sample of each trajectory that came into contact with the police for a particular offense. For example, a mean of .22 for prior violent offenses among low-rate adolescent peaked offenders indicates that 22% of all prior police contacts of low-rate adolescent peaked offenders were for violent offenses. This allows us to see which trajectory had the highest percentage of police contacts for each offense. High-rate chronic offenders have the highest percentage of police contacts for prior violent offenses (30% were violent), high-rate adolescent peaked offenders have the highest percentage of police contacts for prior property offenses (45% were property), low-rate chronic offenders have the highest percentage of police contacts for prior drug offenses (10% were drug), and low-rate adolescent peaked offenders have the highest percentage of police contacts for prior other offenses (40% of the offenses). This pattern holds for the dependent variable as well, with the exception of violent crime, since 33% and 32% of police contacts of low-rate chronic and high-rate chronic offenders, respectively, are for violent offenses.</p>

<p>The number in parentheses denotes the number of police contacts within each trajectory and the average number of police contacts per offender in that trajectory, respectively.</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In terms of career attributes, the high-rate offenders have the shortest gaps between police contacts, and the low-rate offenders have the longest gaps, with low-rate chronic offenders experiencing the longest time between police contacts on average (23.45 months). The majority of offenders are early onsetters, except for low-rate chronic offenders (35% early onset). Demographically, the vast majority of the sample is male. There are actually no females in the high-rate adolescent peaked trajectory, and only 4% of the high-rate chronic trajectory is female. The majority of the sample is non-White and comes from a low SES background. The mean ages range from approximately 15 to 20 years of age, with high-rate adolescent peaked representing the youngest group (14.85) and low-rate chronics the oldest (19.74) group.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812474262">Table 2</xref> shows the odds of contact with the police for a particular offense type based on the offense type of the prior contact, controlling for intermittency, early onset, age, SES, race, and sex. Regardless of type of offender, the odds of contact with the police for a violent offense versus any other type of offense are more likely if an individual’s prior police contact is for a violent offense. These odds are greater for the high-rate adolescent peaked offenders and the high-rate chronic offenders than their low-rate offender counterparts. High-rate chronic offenders have greater odds of repeat police contacts for violence (1.67) than high-rate adolescent peaked (1.58) offenders. While these greater odds of specialization for the chronic life course offender may seem counterintuitive given prior literature demonstrating the versatility of persistent offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093854812474262">Mazerolle et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093854812474262">Nieuwbeerta et al., 2011</xref>), these results are consistent with the findings exploring the odds of committing a particular offense type following the commission of that same offense category (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093854812474262">Bursik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093854812474262">Kempf, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>). Perhaps just as interesting is the finding that both high-rate adolescent peaked and high-rate chronic offenders are significantly less likely to have a police contact for a property offense following a police contact for a violent offense (0.76 and 0.70, respectively).</p>

<p>The results predicting property offending are similar to violent offending, with all offender trajectories exhibiting specialization in offending. Again, high-rate chronics display the greatest odds of specialization in offending (1.79) and low-rate adolescent peaked have the smallest odds (1.25). Police contacts for violent and other offenses are significantly less likely following a police contact for a property offense among all four offender trajectories, excluding property to violent for low-rate adolescent peaked offenders. Police contacts for drug offending again provide evidence of specialized criminal careers with the highest odds of repeat police contacts for all offender trajectories, excluding high-rate adolescent peaked offenders. Both low-rate and high-rate chronic offenders display significant odds of repeat police contacts for drugs greater than 2 (2.31 and 2.11, respectively), and low-rate adolescent peaked offenders display odds of repeating drug offenses just under 2 (1.92). Other offenses closely parallel the findings of the violent, property, and drug offenses. High-rate chronic offenders exhibit the greatest odds of repeat police contacts for other offenses (1.70), with low-rate adolescent peaked offenders exhibiting the smallest odds (1.35). Again, each trajectory shows significant findings supporting specialized criminal careers.</p>
<p>Excluding the relationship from a prior police contact for a drug offense to a subsequent police contact for a drug offense among high-rate adolescent peaked offenders, all offender trajectories display positive significant relationships supporting specialized criminal careers. These findings alone are compelling, but just as compelling are the negative significant relationships between police contacts for certain offenses and particular categories of unrelated offenses, or nonsignificant relationships among expectedly linked crime categories.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812474262">Table 2</xref> essentially shows a summary of figures for 64 detailed models, presenting only the odds ratios for the effect of prior offense type on subsequent offense type, but while intermittency, sex, race, age of onset, age, and SES are controlled. The effect of each on the likelihood of being contacted by the police for committing the various types of offenses by offender trajectory is not elucidated.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093854812474262">Table 3</xref> presents the odds of contact by the police for committing a violent offense among each offender trajectory. Race and age are significant predictors for all offender trajectories, with Blacks displaying higher odds of contact by the police for committing violent offenses and higher odds of contact by the police for committing violent offenses as age increases. Intermittency significantly predicts the odds of contact by the police for committing a violent offense among high-rate adolescent peaked and low-rate chronic offenders. However, the directions of the relationships are not the same. Intermittency has a negative significant effect on the odds of a police contact for committing a violent offense among high-rate adolescent peaked offenders (0.96), but a positive significant effect among low-rate chronic offenders (1.01). Neither of these findings greatly differs from 1, so while statistically significant, substantively these findings are not very compelling.</p>
<p>The odds of contact by the police for committing a property offense among each offender trajectory are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0093854812474262">Table 4</xref>. Unlike the consistency across offender groups found among violent offenses, the odds of contact by the police for committing a property offense differ among each trajectory. The odds that low-rate adolescent peaked offenders are contacted by the police for committing a property offense are significantly higher for males (1.32) and are lower as individuals age (0.95). High-rate adolescent peaked offenders show similar odds for age (0.92), though sex is not measured for high-rate adolescent peaked because no females from the sample fall into this offender trajectory. Higher SES increases the odds of a property offense (1.52) for high-rate adolescent peaked offenders. Black low-rate chronic offenders have higher odds of contact by the police for committing a property offense, while White high-rate chronic offenders have higher odds of contact by the police for committing a property offense.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0093854812474262">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0093854812474262">6</xref> show the odds of contact by the police for committing a drug offense and the odds of contact by the police for committing other offenses, respectively, by offender trajectory. Age is a positive and significant predictor of drug offenses for all offender trajectories and a negative and significant predictor of other offenses for all four trajectories. For low-rate adolescent peaked offenders, early onset increases the probability of contact by the police for committing a drug offense while it decreases the odds for other offenses. Greater intermittency produce higher odds of contact by the police for committing a drug offense among the low-rate adolescent peaked and low-rate chronic, though longer gaps in offending decrease the odds of contact by the police for committing other offenses for low-rate chronic offenders.</p>
<p>The prior offense is the strongest nondemographic predictor of each offense type for all offender trajectories, excluding high-rate adolescent peaked drug offenses. Including demographics, the previous offense is the greatest predictor in 10 of the 16 models and the second strongest predictor in 4 others. Contact by the police for committing the same offense versus any other offense increases the chances of contact for that offense again by as little as 25% for low-rate adolescent peaked offenders contacted for property offenses, to a high of 131% for low-rate chronic offenders contacted by the police for a drug offense. Together, these results present a strong case for the existence of specialization in offending throughout the life course.</p>

The criticisms offered from both those who argue for specialization and those who advocate versatility have been the lack of fully specified models, the relatively few measures of specialization at the individual level, the inability to account for multiple types of offenses, and the failure to consider the nature and chronicity of the offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). We sought to address these issues by predicting the odds of contact by the police for committing a particular offense throughout the life course based on the offenses previously resulting in a police contact while controlling for additional aspects of the criminal career and demographic variables. To address the theoretical arguments presented by Moffitt, we disaggregated the models by four distinct offender trajectories. Our findings lend support to the recent literature demonstrating greater evidence of specialization in offending. We find that the odds of contact by the police for a particular offense during the life course are increased if the prior offense is of the same offense type across individuals, even when controlling for other covariates. Additionally, we find no support for significantly increased odds of switching between offense types.</p>
<p>Since it was our goal to test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> and remedy some of the methodological issues in the specialization/versatility literature, it is important to note the contribution of our findings to both the theory and methods. The finding that a prior offense of the same offense category as the subsequent offense is the strongest nondemographic predictor in 15 of the 16 elaborated models (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093854812474262">Table 2</xref>) provides evidence to challenge the idea that specialization is an artifact of opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>). The current analysis provides support for stability in offending specialization, not versatility. The results demonstrate that the best predictor of the type of offense is an individual’s prior offense of the same type, even when controlling for onset, age, productivity (offender trajectory), and intermittency, all of which have been shown to significantly impact offending behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093854812474262">Baker et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093854812474262">Laub &amp; Sampson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0093854812474262">Piquro et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0093854812474262">Wolfgang et al., 1972</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref> posits versatility among LCPs while predicting specialization among ALs. We find support for the latter prediction of specialization in the most limited offenders (low-rate and high-rate adolescent peaked), but we also find specialization among the most persistent offenders, which is contrary to Moffitt’s expectations. Rather than finding some evidence of versatility between offense types for the most persistent offenders, we find significantly reduced odds of switching between offense types in several categories. For example, the odds of contact by the police for committing a property offense are significantly lower for high-rate chronic offenders whose prior police contact was for a violent or a drug offense, and for low-rate chronic offenders, the odds of contact with the police for a drug offense are significantly less likely if their prior contact was for either a violent or other offense. Contrary to Moffitt’s predictions, it appears that offenders, despite their level of chronicity, tend to offend within the same offense categories. We do acknowledge that there may be versatility in the types of offenses committed within each of the delineated categories—violent, property, drug, or other—but the findings suggest that offenders do specialize within these broader categories. Someone who commits a violent act, whether it be a homicide, robbery, or assault, is significantly more likely to commit another violent act and even significantly less likely to commit other types of offenses, whether it is a property, drug, or other offense. In this sense, the type of offense seems to matter more than the type of offender, which is consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812474262">Loeber et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093854812474262">Rosenfeld et al. (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>We also find similar inconsistencies in some of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> other predictions concerning the relationship between age and offending behavior. While we should see an aging out effect of all crime types for adolescent peaked offenders, increases in age only significantly reduce the odds of contact by the police for committing property and other offenses. Alternatively, increases in age are positively and significantly related to the odds of contact by the police for committing both violent and drug offenses. Other offenses are much more representative of those offenses that would be committed as a result of the maturity gap, so a negative relationship between age and other offenses is expected and supported by our findings. However, greater odds of contact by the police for committing violent and drug offenses as individuals get older is inconsistent with Moffitt’s predictions for the most limited offenders. Not only should these offenders be aging out of crime, but they should not have significant odds of engaging in violent crime. According to Moffitt, violent crime is characteristic of LCPs, while ALs are expected to commit lesser forms of crime that symbolize their adulthood, such as vandalism and public order offenses. Essentially, the findings demonstrate that ALs and LCPs are not as different as Moffitt proposed in terms of specialization/versatility and certain factors do not fit the profile of these two main types of offenders. While some factors may distinguish these two groups, the tendency to specialize within these broad categories of offenses among chronic offenders and the increased odds of contact by the police for committing violent and drug offenses at later ages for adolescent peaked offenders does not.</p>
<p>Because we find specialization across different types of offenders, we fail to find support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> contentions regarding the taxonomy. Taking this into consideration, we can speculate as to whether other theories of offending may be better suited to explaining specialized offending patterns. While strong findings of specialization seem to invalidate concerns regarding opportunity, we are not able to specifically test this potential effect. The tendency to commit an offense of the same type may be mediated by opportunity, a possibility suggested by both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990)</xref> self-control theory and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812474262">Farrington’s (2005)</xref> ICAP theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093854812474262">Thornberry’s (1987)</xref> interactional theory of delinquency also focuses on the interaction between individuals and the social structure. While we control for SES of the individual, we do not account for other social-structural aspects that may influence offending patterns and the tendency to specialize, such as social disorganization. In other words, it is possible that the odds of being cited for the same offense depend on additional factors, such as opportunity and social structure. Also following interactional theory, the tendency to specialize may be contingent on association with delinquent peers and the adoption of delinquent values. While we find evidence for specialization, the next step would be to consider some of the factors mentioned and whether or not they influence the tendency to specialize generally and to specialize in a particular type of offense.</p>
<p>Within the context of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt’s (1993)</xref> theoretical framework, we also address some of the methodological issues of prior research by applying random effects logistic regression. By using random effects logistic regression models, we are able to account for the unbalanced nature of most offense data, since individuals differ in the number of offenses committed and the waves in which they commit these offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>). These models also include a parameter (rho) to account for unobserved or unmeasured heterogeneity that may influence the likelihood of committing a violent, property, drug, or other offense. Since random effects logistic regression is a variant of ordinary least squares regression analyses designed to account for the nested structure of data, we are able to (a) use longitudinal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>), (b) measure specialization at the individual level, and (c) control for both time-varying and time-invariant factors related to criminal careers, such as age, age of onset, and intermittency, since “conditions in an individual’s life can fluctuate relatively frequently” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812474262">Horney, Osgood, &amp; Marshall, 1995</xref>, p. 658; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093854812474262">Sullivan et al., 2006</xref>). Also, because of the simple and clear interpretation of random effects models, we are able to consider specialization/versatility among four different types of crime, as opposed to a single comparison of violent and nonviolent offenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to these contributions, we also remedy issues with frequency of offending and offending patterns by creating offender trajectories and disaggregating by these trajectories in our analyses. While these trajectories are mainly designed to account for the propositions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt (1993)</xref>, they do extend the methodological merit of the current study. Since the trajectories are created based on police contact data, they approximate frequency of offending among individuals. An offender can either be a low-rate adolescent peaked, high-rate adolescent peaked, low-rate chronic, or high-rate chronic offender. Additionally, disaggregating by each trajectory in the random effects models considers offending patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood and Schreck (2007)</xref> emphasize the focus of specialization research on transitions between offenses, which often fails to capture the full pattern of offending by an individual. By creating offender trajectories, we also indirectly address what Osgood and Schreck refer to as the confounding between specialization and rate of offending by considering the tendency to offend. After addressing some of the limitations of previous methodologies, we find greater evidence of specialization, as has been the trend among studies using methodologies that account for the potential problems of early specialization research.</p>
<p>While our findings are generally supportive and consistent with the recent specialization literature, this study is not without limitations. While we acknowledge that our analyses resolve several of the methodological issues identified by the specialization/versatility literature, the methodology used does not resolve all measurement issues and we are still limited to the data we have available. For example, although we remedy the limitation of including controls for other variables within models predicting specialization, we are still unable to account for any psychological measures of the offenders, including self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>) and antisocial potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093854812474262">Farrington, 2005</xref>). The 1958 Philadelphia Birth Cohort Study does not contain such measures for large portions of the population, and so findings are limited to the extent that such variables would affect our results. In addition, we are unable to account for the effect that punishment, or lack thereof, may have on individuals’ choices of offenses. It is also possible that individual choices are impacted by peers and the involvement of peers in the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0093854812474262">Thornberry, 1987</xref>). These are factors to consider in future tests of specialization. Accounting for concepts like self-control and the maturity gap may provide further information about offending throughout the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson &amp; Hirschi, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093854812474262">Moffitt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Many of these limitations prevent us from being able to predict why individuals might be specializing in each of the particular categories of offenses. For instance, we do not know if violent specialization is a result of gang-related activity or if property specialization is the result of economic need or simply thrill. Additionally, the fact that drug offending had the highest odds of specialization may be due to biological factors such as addiction, but not all drug offenses are necessarily drug use and could be drug sales as well. While selling drugs may be a means for continued drug use, this is impossible to ascertain from the data available. We are limited in that we can only establish if there is evidence of specialization. Future research should explore the causal mechanisms behind why such specialization occurs. Any attempts to do so as a result of this analysis would be pure speculation.</p>
<p>It is important to note that our results demonstrate specialization in offending among transitions between police contacts, not as a description of the criminal career as a whole. The findings are unlike a diversity index, in which an entire criminal career is examined in aggregate to uncover a pattern of specialization. Rather, the findings in this analysis demonstrate the propensity to specialize between any two offenses. As such, the purpose of this study was not to label individuals as violent, property, drug, or other offenders, but instead to examine the odds that an individual’s subsequent offense would be the same (categorically) as their immediately prior offense. We were not attempting to describe individuals’ careers but rather to identify the likelihood that an individual would experience a police contact for a property offense after a property offense or a violent offense after a violent offense, and so on, throughout his or her life course. In addition, this approach provided the opportunity to examine characteristics of individuals that could have accounted for specialization/versatility in offending. This allowed us to move beyond simply describing specialization/versatility in offending and actually trying to predict and explain behavior among different types of offenders and offenses throughout the life course.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood and Schreck (2007)</xref> have also noted the need to separate specialization from offense base rates. This means gauging specialization through the contrast of an individual’s offenses in certain offense categories to the overall rate of those offenses in the population. For example, if half of all offenses in the data are property offenses, it is not specialization if half of the offenses by any particular individual are property offenses, which would be expected by chance alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093854812474262">Osgood &amp; Schreck, 2007</xref>). By the nature of correcting for some of the other limitations, we are unable to address this base rate issue using random logistic effects models. Because of this, it is unknown whether the lack of switching across offense categories is likely due to the commonality of property and other offenses in each of the four offender classifications, which could give an unfair advantage to finding specialization. However, the intent of the current analyses is to determine whether a subsequent offense is affected by the prior offense, whereby the subsequent offense is likely to be the same as the prior offense. The fact that there is a greater likelihood of committing the same offense and a decreased probability of committing a different offense lends evidence toward specialization, regardless of the base rate, since we are looking from one offense to the next throughout the life course, as opposed to specialization within a criminal career. Despite this, future research should consider incorporating this aspect of specialization/versatility in their models.</p>
<p>Additionally, the study only followed individuals to age 26. The results show no indication that specialization varies with age or chronicity of offending, but it may be the case that versatility increases past this point in the life course. The current study also uses police contact information and is reliant on official data sources. These sources may be unreliable as to the actual events that took place, the actual charges that were eventually levied against the offenders, or eventual convictions or acquittals of the charges. With the use of official data also comes the loss of additional crimes undoubtedly committed by each offender. This limitation is especially vital given the use of trajectories to identify offenders. If the full range and number of offenses is accounted for, it is certainly possible that offenders would be differentially distributed, though our findings indicate specialization regardless of trajectory. The use of life-event calendars for shorter more detailed periods of time may be useful in this regard (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093854812474262">Horney et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093854812474262">McGloin et al., 2007</xref>), as well as qualitative analysis (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093854812474262">Laub &amp; Sampson, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093854812474262">2003</xref>), that may be helpful in understanding the pathways and context that lead to specific types of offending among individuals. However, current self-report data do not allow for analyses of a longer time span of the life course, which is an added benefit of using official statistics. Additionally, even when using self-report data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093854812474262">Loeber et al., (2008)</xref> found that 55% of reported and 41% of arrested violent offenders in the youngest cohort were also theft offenders, and 54% of reported and 64% of arrested violent offenders in the oldest cohort were also theft offenders. This means that there were still a fairly large number of specialized offenders (45% reported and 59% arrested in the youngest cohort and 46% reported and 36% arrested in the oldest cohort), even when using self-report data.</p>
<p>Using official police contact data also increases the possibility that upon the commission of a particular crime, the police are contacting the “usual suspects,” as opposed to individuals for whom there is evidence of a criminal offense. While this is true of all the aforementioned offenses, it may be particularly true of the other offense category. There is little additional information about the miscellaneous classification of the other offense category, and finding specialization in this category of offenses should be viewed with some trepidation. While we feel that this category broadly represents the analogous behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093854812474262">Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990)</xref> describe, without further information about the offense individuals were contacted by the police for and the ultimate disposition of the contact, specialization within the “other” category may not accurately represent actual offending. To the extent that this is true, some evidence of specialization may in fact be an artifact of police practices, as opposed to actual criminal activity.</p>
<p>The results of this study can potentially inform future criminal justice policy. Given the increased probability that an offender specializes in a particular type of offense, specialized treatment programs or interventions may be beneficial in reducing recidivism. The findings may also indicate where resources should be allocated. Anger management or drug treatment may not be as beneficial for a career property offender as it would be for a career violent offender or drug offender, respectively. Similarly, for individuals who have criminal histories marked by specialization in a particular offense type, voluntary completion of certain programs may be a “signal” that the individual is reforming or desisting from crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093854812474262">Bushway &amp; Apel, 2012</xref>). That is, if a career drug offender voluntarily seeks drug rehabilitation, a career violent offender seeks treatment for anger management, or a property offender actively seeks out employment or educational training, this may be a signal for probation officers, correctional officers, and other criminal justice practitioners that this individual, given their criminal history, is reforming. Understanding individual specialization is important for elaborating on this signaling process. For example, voluntarily enlisting in drug rehabilitation programming for a career violent offender may not be a signal of desistance from violent crime, though alternative benefits are no doubt possible. This area of specialized treatment targeting is an important area for future research. To the extent that desistance signals are taken into consideration, understanding an individual’s offending propensity offers additional information about the seriousness and likelihood of desistance given the signal (i.e., a career drug offender voluntarily seeking drug treatment as opposed to a career violent offender voluntarily seeking drug treatment).</p>
<p>Ultimately, this study offers direction for future research in the area of specialization by serving as a contribution to the theoretical and methodological debate surrounding specialization/versatility. The findings have implications for both policy and a better understanding of individuals with specialized criminal careers.</p>
