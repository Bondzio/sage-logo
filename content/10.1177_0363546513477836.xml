<sec id="section1-0363546513477836">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>It is not known whether the human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is susceptible to fatigue failure as a result of repetitive loading or whether certain knee morphologic characteristics increase that risk.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513477836">
<title>Hypotheses:</title>
<p>The number of knee loading cycles required to fail an ACL by fatigue failure is unaffected by the magnitude of the external load delivered to the knee joint. Furthermore, sex, ACL cross-sectional area, and lateral tibial slope will not affect the number of loading cycles to ACL failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513477836">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513477836">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Knee pairs from 10 cadaveric donors (5 female) of similar age, height, and weight were imaged with 3-T magnetic resonance imaging to measure lateral tibial slope and ACL cross-sectional area. One knee from each pair was then subjected to repeated application of a load of 3 times body weight (3*BW), while the other knee was subjected to a 4*BW load, both involving impulsive compression force, knee flexion moment, and internal tibial torque combined with realistic trans-knee muscle forces. The resulting 3-dimensional tibiofemoral kinematics and kinetics were recorded, along with ACL relative strain and quadriceps, hamstring, and gastrocnemius muscle forces. The loading cycle was repeated until the ACL ruptured, a 3-mm increase in cumulative anterior tibial translation occurred, or a minimum of 50 trials was reached.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513477836">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Eight of 10 knees failed under the 4*BW load (mean ± SD cycles to failure, 21 ± 18), while 5 of 10 knees failed under the 3*BW load (mean ± SD cycles to failure, 52 ± 10). Four knees exhibited a 3-mm increase in anterior tibial translation, 7 knees developed partial or complete visible ACL tears, and 2 knees developed complete ACL tibial avulsions. A Cox regression showed that the number of cycles to ACL failure was influenced by the simulated landing force (<italic>P</italic> = .012) and ACL cross-sectional area (<italic>P</italic> = .022). Donor sex and lateral tibial slope did not influence the number of cycles to ACL failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546513477836">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The human ACL is susceptible to fatigue failure when pivot landings of 3*BW or more load the knee repeatedly within a short time span. An ACL with a smaller cross-sectional area is at greater risk for this type of failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546513477836">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The results show that the human knee can only withstand a certain number of 3*BW or greater jump loading cycles within a short time period before the ACL will fail. Therefore, limiting the increase in the number and severity of pivot landing maneuvers performed over a week of training would make sense from an injury prevention viewpoint.</p>

<body>
<p>Current research into anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury mechanisms fails to explain why an athlete can perform a jump and/or pivot maneuver many times without injury yet suddenly rupture his or her ACL while apparently performing a similar maneuver one more time. To date, ACL injury video analysis has concentrated on the circumstances at the time of injury as being the cause of an ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513477836">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513477836">28</xref></sup> However, the history of ACL loading could also be a major factor to consider. Presently, we do not know if the ACL will fail under repetitive loading as a result of ligament fatigue failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513477836">39</xref></sup> Tissue fatigue failures resulting from repetitive loading have been identified as the cause of tibial stress fractures in military recruits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513477836">14</xref></sup> and elbow ligament failures in Little League youth baseball pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513477836">21</xref></sup> Repetition of a maneuver is fundamental to skill acquisition, athletic training, and performance in competition. It is possible that repeated loading can cause an ACL to fail suddenly under routine landing conditions, especially when muscle fatigue occurs.</p>
<p>Athletes usually perform similar movements hundreds, if not thousands, of times before an ACL injury occurs. For example, professional soccer players in the Football Association Premier League average 727 turning or swerving maneuvers per match.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513477836">3</xref></sup> Moreover, similar movements can result in a wide variation of peak joint loads because of the many different combinations of muscle forces that counteract the external loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513477836">15</xref></sup> Our working hypothesis was that under peak knee joint loads known to induce large ACL strains, the ACL would fail after repeated application of a joint loading cycle that did not cause ACL failure in earlier loading cycles.</p>
<p>Animal and cadaveric tensile testing has shown that passive collagenous structures like ligaments are susceptible to fatigue failure: the larger the tensile stress applied repeatedly to the structure, the fewer the number of loading cycles before it will fail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513477836">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513477836">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477836">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513477836">45</xref></sup> The accumulation of damage over the course of a fatigue failure reduces a ligament’s modulus of elasticity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477836">41</xref></sup> thereby placing it in a susceptible state. This may be especially true for women, given their smaller ACL diameter,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477836">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513477836">10</xref></sup> ACL volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513477836">6</xref></sup> and modulus of elasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477836">5</xref></sup> Because a greater lateral tibial slope and a smaller ACL cross-sectional area are associated with increased peak ACL strain during a simulated pivot landing,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513477836">20</xref></sup> we also hypothesized that these factors would reduce the number of loading cycles until a dynamic maneuver failed the ACL.</p>
<p>The objective of this study, therefore, was to determine whether the ACL exhibits fatigue behavior under strenuous, repetitive simulated pivot landings. Demonstration of a fatigue failure injury mechanism could represent a paradigm shift in ACL injury mechanism research because it would explain why athletes who repeatedly perform the same maneuver without incident suddenly rupture an ACL. Using matched-paired knees, a knee from each pair was tested with a load of 4 times body weight (4*BW) or a 3*BW load to test the primary null hypothesis that the number of knee loading cycles before an ACL fails is unaffected by the magnitude of the externally applied load. We also tested the secondary null hypothesis that the number of knee loading cycles to ACL failure is unaffected by sex, ACL cross-sectional area, and lateral tibial slope.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ten pairs of human lower extremities from donors of a similar age, height, and weight (5 female pairs, 5 male pairs; mean ± standard deviation age, 53 ± 7 years; height, 174 ± 9 cm; weight, 69 ± 9 kg) were acquired from the University of Michigan Anatomical Donations Program and the Anatomy Gifts Registry (Hanover, Maryland). The specimens were screened to eliminate a history of lower extremity surgery, trauma, or degenerative changes, as evidenced by visual scars or deformities of the knee joint. The specimens were harvested and dissected, keeping the muscle tendons of the quadriceps, medial and lateral hamstrings, and medial and lateral gastrocnemius intact, as well as the ligamentous capsular structures. The distal femur and proximal tibia and fibula were cut 20 cm from the knee joint line. Specimens were stored frozen at −20°C and were thawed at room temperature before imaging and testing.</p>
<p>Before testing, all 20 knees were imaged with a 3-T T2-weighted magnetic resonance scanner (3-dimensional [3D] proton-density sequence; repetition time/echo time, 1000/35 ms; slice thickness, 0.7 mm; pixel spacing, 0.35 × 0.35 mm; field of view, 330 mm) (Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). The scans were viewed and measured in OsiriX (v3.9, open source, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.osirix-viewer.com">www.osirix-viewer.com</ext-link>). The cross-sectional area of the ACL was measured by outlining the circumference at 30% of the ligament length from the tibial origin with an oblique-axial view perpendicular to the ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513477836">20</xref></sup> This location along the ligament is where the differential variable reluctance transducer (DVRT) (3-mm stroke length; MicroStrain Inc, Burlington, Vermont) was placed on the ligament during testing. Lateral tibial slope was measured ad modum Hashemi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477836">16</xref></sup>: 2 anteroposterior lines were drawn 10 cm and 15 cm from the most proximal point on the central axis image, defined as the slice where the tibial attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament and the intercondylar eminence were visible. The midpoints of the anteroposterior lines were connected to define the tibial proximal anatomic axis. Lateral tibial slope was measured at the tibial center of articulation on the lateral tibial plateau and was defined as the angle between a line perpendicular to the tibial proximal anatomic axis and a line fit to the posterior-inferior subchondral bone surface.</p>
<p>After imaging, the distal femur and proximal tibia and fibula were potted in a 7.8-cm-diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinder filled with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The ends of the potted bones were placed into aluminum housing within an established testing apparatus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513477836">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513477836">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546513477836">43</xref></sup> capable of impulsively simulating a pivot landing with loads up to 5*BW compression force with an added flexion moment (up to 120 N·m) and internal tibial torque (up to 50 N·m). This combination of loading vectors induces larger ACL strains than other combinations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513477836">27</xref></sup> The experimental design randomly assigned 1 knee to a 3*BW simulated pivot landing and the paired knee to a 4*BW pivot landing. By testing the 2 knees from a given specimen at different landing intensities, this matched-pair design takes advantage of the fact that intrapatient variability is usually less than interpatient variability in detecting whether the number of cycles to ACL failure differs between the knees. The drop height and drop weight were adjusted to apply the desired magnitude of compressive force to the specimen. Each trial was initiated by dropping a weight (W) onto an impact rod in series with a torsional device (T) as the loads applied to the knee were monitored with load cells (L) on the distal femur and proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546513477836">Figure 1</xref>). The set angle of the struts within the torsional device controlled the gain between the applied impulsive compressive force and impulsive internal tibial torque.</p>

<p>The in vitro testing apparatus. A drop weight (W) resulted in an impulsive compressive force posterior to the knee joint that also induced a knee flexion moment. A torsional device (T) added an internal tibial torque component to the compound loading. Load cells (L) monitored the 3-dimensional input and reaction forces and moments at the proximal tibia and distal femur. The quadrictif (Q), hamstring (H), and gastrocnemius (G) were pretensioned before each trial, placing the knee initially at 20° of knee flexion. A differential variable reluctance transducer (inset) measured relative strain on the anteromedial bundle of the anterior cruciate ligament during the impact.

<p>Tibiofemoral kinematics were measured at 400 Hz using optoelectronic marker triads (Optotrak Certus; Northern Digital Inc, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) on the proximal tibia and distal femur. A 3D digitizing wand was used to define standard anatomic landmarks on the knee joint to measure relative and absolute changes in tibiofemoral 3D translations and rotations. Specifically, anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation were measured relative to the beginning of each trial (“relative measurement”) as well as the first pivot trial (“cumulative measurement”). Two 6-axis load cells (MC3A-1000; AMTI, Watertown, Massachusetts) were used to monitor the input and the reaction forces and moments applied to the proximal tibia and distal femur. Nylon string (stiffness: 250 N/mm for male knees and 200 N/mm for female knees, to account for sex difference in quadrictif tensile stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513477836">13</xref></sup>) served as a muscle equivalent for the pretensioned quadrictif (Q: 180 N), hamstring (H: 70 N each), and gastrocnemius (G: 70 N each) muscles.</p>
<p>The knee was placed at an initial knee flexion angle of 20° before each trial. Each muscle equivalent was located in series with a cryoclamp frozen onto its tendon with liquid nitrogen as well as a uniaxial load cell (TLL-1K and TLL-500, Transducer Techniques Inc, Temecula, California). Peak relative strain on the anteromedial (AM) bundle of the ACL was monitored with a DVRT installed at a location one third of the length of the ligament from its tibial insertion to prevent impingement on the femoral intercondylar notch. The initial DVRT length used to calculate strain was relative to the DVRT’s interbarb length at the beginning of each trial (peak AM-ACL relative strain) and the first pivot trial (peak AM-ACL cumulative strain). The tibiofemoral kinetics, muscle forces, and strain data were measured at 2 kHz.</p>
<p>The testing protocol began with 5 preconditioning nonpivot trials of compression + flexion moment. During the preconditioning trials, the drop height and drop weight were adjusted to the target compressive force of 3*BW or 4*BW by the final nonpivot trial. These trials also minimized hysteresis effects before the pivot trials. After 5 nonpivot trials, the drop height and drop weight remained constant to ensure the same energy was applied to the knee. The torsional device was activated to apply, on average, 30-N·m internal tibial torque for the 3*BW and 35-N·m internal tibial torque for the 4*BW test loads, in addition to compressive force and a knee flexion moment (78 and 97 N·m, respectively), simulating a pivot landing. Typically, there was a 1-minute break between loading trials to reset the muscle forces and initial knee flexion angle. However, every 20 to 30 trials, a 3- to 5-minute interval had to be taken to refreeze the rectus femoris tendon clamp using liquid nitrogen. The pivot landings were repeated until (1) gross ligament failure occurred, (2) a 3-mm increase in the cumulative anterior tibial translation occurred, or (3) a minimum of 50 trials was performed. After testing, the ACL was visually inspected for macroscopic failure of the AM as well as posterolateral (PL) bundles.</p>
<p>An ACL failure was confirmed if there was visual evidence of yielding on the real-time plot of ACL strain against time of a complete or partial ACL tear, an ACL avulsion occurred, or cumulative anterior tibial translation increased by 3 mm. The primary hypothesis that external loading would not affect the number of cycles to ACL failure was tested using 20 matched-paired knees: 1 knee from each pair was externally loaded at 3*BW or 4*BW. The hypothesis was tested statistically using a Cox regression model with shared frailty in Stata 12 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas) to predict the number of cycles to ACL failure using simulated landing force as a covariate. Sex, ACL cross-sectional area, and lateral tibial slope were included as covariates in the Cox regression to test the secondary hypothesis. A tertiary analysis longitudinally compared anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation throughout the experiment using a linear mixed model. The mixed model analyzed the first pivot trial and final pivot trial (using both the relative and cumulative measurements) and treated ligament status (coded as 0 = intact and 1 = failed) as a fixed factor. A random intercept was utilized for each specimen (coded by their donor identification) to account for differences in anterior tibial translation between donors. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered significant for the primary and secondary analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Eight of 10 knees tested under the 4*BW impact load failed, and the mean ± standard deviation number of cycles to ACL failure was 21 ± 18 cycles. Under the 3*BW impact load, however, 5 of 10 knees failed and did so in 52 ± 10 cycles. The mean landing force and internal tibial torque were 4.3 ± 0.4 BW and 34.5 ± 7.3 N·m for the higher impact landing and 3.5 ± 0.3 BW and 29.8 ± 5.4 N·m for the lower impact landing. Of the 13 failed knees, there were 1 complete ACL tear, 6 partial ACL tears, 2 ACL avulsions, and 4 permanent elongations of the ACL (ie, 3-mm increase in cumulative anterior tibial translation) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513477836">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The primary hypothesis was rejected because a greater simulated landing force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546513477836">Figure 2</xref>) was significantly associated with fewer loading cycles to ACL failure (Wald χ<sup>2</sup> = 10.06; <italic>P</italic> = .039) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513477836">Table 2</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The fact that athletes perform the same cutting or pivoting maneuver hundreds, if not thousands, of times a season means that the loading history of the ACL is potentially relevant in determining whether an injury occurs. We believe that this is the first study to test and provide support for the hypothesis that the human ACL is susceptible to low-cycle fatigue failure. Depending upon the magnitude of the load, the results show that the fatigue life of a human ACL can be less than 60 severe loading cycles. A larger landing force and a smaller ACL cross-sectional area were both predictive of fewer cycles to ACL failure. The finding that ACL cross-sectional area was predictive of the number of cycles to failure should not be surprising. For a given load, a higher ligament tensile stress (tensile force per unit area) should result in the earlier failure of an ACL with a smaller cross-sectional area because the number of cycles until failure is known to be inversely proportional to the repetitive tensile stress placed on that material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513477836">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Collagenous structures such as ligaments and tendons are known to be susceptible to fatigue failure under repetitive loading. For example, rabbit medial collateral ligaments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513477836">40</xref></sup> human Achilles tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546513477836">45</xref></sup> wallaby tail tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546513477836">42</xref></sup> and human extensor digitorum longus tendons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513477836">34</xref></sup> all demonstrate an inverse relationship between applied tensile stress and the number of cycles to failure. It is the accumulation of damage associated with cyclic loading that causes ligaments to fail because of fatigue rather than creep.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546513477836">40</xref></sup> Also, a positive feedback cycle has been noted: the higher the tensile cyclic stress applied to the ligament, the more rapidly microdamage accumulates because of a reduction in the modulus of elasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546513477836">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sex-based differences in structural and mechanical properties of the ACL could influence fatigue behavior because the human female ACL is 21% to 34% smaller in cross-sectional area,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477836">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513477836">10</xref></sup> is 17% to 27% smaller in ACL volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477836">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546513477836">6</xref></sup> and has a 22% lower tensile modulus of elasticity than the male ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513477836">4</xref></sup> Therefore, for a given external loading magnitude in size-matched patients, the female ACL will systematically experience greater stress than the male ACL. With a lower ultimate tensile stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513477836">5</xref></sup> the female ACL will likely experience a fatigue failure in fewer loading cycles than the male ACL. After ACL reconstruction, the sex difference in reinjury rates may be lessened by using similarly sized 10-mm patellar tendon grafts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513477836">36</xref></sup> eliminating the sex discrepancy in ACL size and stress. While sex was not a significant predictor in the present study, ACL cross-sectional area was a significant predictor of the cycles to ACL failure. Lateral tibial slope has been previously identified as a predictor of ACL strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513477836">20</xref></sup> and ACL injury risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513477836">16</xref></sup> because the greater the slope, the greater the tensile force as well as the tensile stress placed on the ACL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513477836">37</xref></sup> Tibial slope and sex were not significant predictors of the number of cycles until ACL failure in this study most likely because of the modest sample size.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrates that the ACL fails under repetitive simulated landings involving combined impulsive compression, flexion, and internal tibial torque loads with realistic muscle forces. A previous study reported that the ACL failed under dynamic internal tibial torque and quasistatically applied compressive force without muscle loads at 30° of flexion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513477836">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513477836">24</xref></sup> That study reported that the ACL failed with internal tibial torques ranging from 10 to 50 N·m, with 4 partial tears of the PL bundle near the femur and 3 tibial avulsions. The current study utilizes a more physiological loading scenario with muscle forces along with a focus on the effects of repetitive loading. Both the present results and those of Meyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513477836">23</xref></sup> strongly suggest that the PL bundle of the ACL may be compromised during a pivot landing with internal tibial torque.</p>
<p>The functional anatomy of the ACL can help explain why greater damage occurs to the PL bundle during pivot landings with the knee near full extension. The ACL is often described functionally as a 2-bundle ligament; the AM and PL bundles display independent tension patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513477836">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513477836">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513477836">30</xref></sup> The PL bundle carries greater loads near extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513477836">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513477836">12</xref></sup> and contributes more resistance to axial tibial rotation than anterior tibial translation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513477836">7</xref></sup> because of its anatomic location and orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513477836">1</xref></sup> An isolated tear of the PL bundle will not produce a detectable increase in anterior tibial translation under an anterior tibial load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546513477836">17</xref></sup> Anterior tibial translation will increase under an applied load of internal tibial torque and knee abduction moment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0363546513477836">47</xref></sup> Therefore, because the PL bundle resists rotational loads near full knee extension, it may be more vulnerable to injury during a pivot landing.</p>
<p>Our results show that knee loading magnitude affected ACL fatigue life with or without the knees that demonstrated a 3-mm increase in anterior tibial translation in the failure subset. Clinically, a 3-mm increase in anterior tibial translation is an accepted sign of ACL failure regardless of whether the ACL appears partially or completely torn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513477836">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513477836">9</xref></sup> There can be considerable disruption and disorganization of collagen fibrils in human ACLs at ultimate tensile failure without macroscopic tearing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513477836">19</xref></sup> For example, in rabbit medial collateral ligaments, a 10% strain will cause disruption of thin collagen fibers without macroscopic tearing; disruption of the thick collagen fibers will occur by 20% strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0363546513477836">46</xref></sup> The macroscopic appearance of an ACL does not necessarily reflect the functional capacity or the extent of elongation in the ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513477836">26</xref></sup> Submaximal failures of ligaments will affect viscoelastic properties, including a reduction in initial stiffness as well as viscosity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546513477836">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, the load-displacement behavior of the ligament’s toe region will be elongated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513477836">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477836">33</xref></sup> which may yield greater laxity during daily activities. There will be an overall reduction in the modulus of elasticity and ultimate stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513477836">33</xref></sup> placing the ligament at risk for failure. Because many submaximal elongation failures occurred at the lower simulated landing forces, partial or complete tears of these ligaments could occur when landing forces are increased, especially if more loading cycles are added.</p>
<p>The strengths of this study design were the use of matched-paired knees from donors of a similar age, height, and weight to investigate the potential of ligament fatigue failure. The realistic applied external and muscle forces during the simulated pivot landing, the realistic ACL strains and strain rates that were induced, and the blinded observer for measuring ACL cross-sectional area and lateral tibial slope from magnetic resonance imaging scans are all important factors to consider. Also, the matched-pair design reduced the role of interpatient variability.</p>
<p>Although the study has limitations, these should not affect the overall study findings. First, the insertion of the 2 DVRT barbs could potentially have initiated very minor failures in the AM bundle. This concern is mitigated by the fact that the majority of the macroscopic ACL damage occurred remotely to either DVRT barb location. Second, the macroscopic tearing and/or microstructural damage of the PL bundle combined with subfailure AM-ACL relative strain suggests that the PL bundle is loaded more than the AM bundle during pivot landings at 20° of knee flexion. This is contrary to the finding that AM bundle strain is indicative of ACL force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546513477836">22</xref></sup> Clinically, anterior tibial translation is the most reliable measurement of an ACL’s status. While some knees with a failed PL bundle showed no increase in peak AM-ACL strain, other knees showed a large increase in peak AM-ACL strain. We speculate that the AM bundle fibers were not tensioned by the loading to the same extent as the PL bundle fibers. However, strain on the PL bundle could not be measured because the DVRT would impinge on the medial notch wall of the lateral femoral condyle in an extended knee.</p>
<p>Because ACL stress could not be measured without physically altering the ligament or its insertions, we used the external load applied to the knee as a surrogate measurement of ACL stress. Furthermore, the limb donors were older than the adolescent and young adult populations that are most at risk for ACL injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513477836">35</xref></sup> Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the injury patterns observed in our in vitro testing apparatus may differ from those in younger donors. We would expect younger donors to withstand more cycles before reaching their fatigue limit because their ultimate tensile load should be 40% higher than older donors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546513477836">44</xref></sup> Furthermore, repeated in vivo landings can also induce muscle fatigue, an effect that was not considered in the present experiments but could be incorporated in future experiments with this experimental set-up.</p>
<p>Finally, changing the time interval between loading cycles might affect ACL fatigue life. As described in Materials and Methods, we typically performed 1 trial per minute, with an extended break of 3 to 5 minutes when refreezing the rectus femoris tendon. While a few knees showed ligament recovery in the measurements of anterior tibial translation after the refreezing interval, these same knees quickly reached and then exceeded the prefreezing level of anterior tibial translation once repeated loading was resumed. Similar recovery behavior has been reported in cyclically strained tendons during a rest interval of 30 minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513477836">18</xref></sup> However, future investigations are warranted to assess whether lengthening the time between loading cycles would positively affect ligament fatigue life. Furthermore, improvements to the testing set-up could be made to reduce the tendon refreezing time.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study provides new insight by demonstrating that the ACL is susceptible to fatigue failure in vitro. Our estimate of ACL fatigue life (ie, the number of loading cycles to failure) is likely conservative because the tissue adaptation and remodeling that occur in vivo over several months would extend ACL fatigue life beyond that measured here. The potential for an acute, in vivo ACL repair response to the damage is an unknown parameter. However, because the ACL has a poor blood supply,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513477836">25</xref></sup> it is unlikely that any meaningful repair can be accomplished if 60 severe loading cycles were to be applied within a time frame as short as an hour, a day, or even a week. Hence, the present in vitro results predict that the ACL will fail in vivo whenever enough severe loading cycles are applied within a relatively short time frame, especially if this represents a short-term increase in the severity or number of loading cycles beyond a status quo to which the ligament has adapted over a longer time period. Lengthening the rest interval between loading cycles could help decrease cumulative ACL strain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513477836">32</xref></sup> thereby increasing the fatigue life of the ACL. Yet, based on our findings, it would make sense to limit the increase in the number and severity of pivot landing maneuvers performed within a short time frame such as a week of training.</p>
<p>We note that the behavior of ACL fatigue failure encompasses the possibility of a “single event” injury because the traction force on the ACL only has to exceed its ultimate tensile strength for it to fail in the first loading cycle. However, reducing the magnitude of that force will allow the ACL to survive for additional loading cycles before failing. If the repeated ACL load lies below a certain threshold, such as that induced during walking and running, then ACL failure is not likely to occur during that activity. Clearly, further research is needed to understand the many factors affecting the fatigue life of the ACL both in vitro and in vivo.</p>
