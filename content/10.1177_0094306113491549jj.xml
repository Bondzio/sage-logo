<p>In <italic>The Slums of Aspen</italic>, Lisa Park and David Pellow examine the role of invisible and low-wage immigrant labor in luxury resort communities, the construction of environmental privilege, and the nativist underpinnings of much mainstream environmentalism. They do so through a case study of Aspen, Colorado, located in the heart of the Rocky Mountains. They take as their point of departure a 1999 resolution by the Aspen city council that petitioned the U.S. government to restrict radically authorized migration into the United States and increase policing of unauthorized immigrants within the country, which it passed partially on the grounds that doing so is necessary for protecting the nation’s ecosystems and natural resources. The book interrogates the underlying politics and assumptions in this symbolic decree, and in so doing takes on the following questions: What <italic>are</italic> the major environmental issues in Aspen? Who bears responsibility for them? How has the critical attention on immigrants emerged, and which ends and interests are served by framing Aspen’s environmental issues in this way? To answer these questions, Park and Pellow draw on qualitative research conducted in Aspen, mostly from 2000-2004, including in-depth interviews, archival research, and ethnographic observation.</p>
<p>Aspen is a fascinating case study full of unsettling contradictions. Perched high in the rugged Rocky Mountains, the town is surrounded by world-class outdoor adventure opportunities and promotes itself as a respite from crowded, polluted city life. Yet, like most resorts, Aspen’s tranquility is available only to the elite—this is a luxury resort town, where the average sale price of a single family home in 2000 was nearly $4 million. Park and Pellow illuminate a side of Aspen that most visitors will never see: the communities of low-wage, immigrant workers from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America whose labor makes such luxury possible. Some readers familiar with Aspen, Vail, and other resort towns might be surprised to learn that these immigrants scrape by on poverty-level incomes while doing the majority of the town’s cooking, cleaning, landscaping, construction, and child care. One of the strengths of this book is in showing that neither the invisibility of these workers nor their poverty is accidental. Rather, Aspen’s elite residents actively perpetuate poverty through paying low wages, and they push it out of sight by fighting any efforts to build affordable housing in the area. Thus, the immigrant workers who service the town live up to a hundred miles away in old trailer parks dangerously located in floodplains and spend one to two hours driving the windy roads to Aspen for work each day. Recent escalations in immigration policing throughout the United States by sanctioned state actors and nativist residents generate fear that compels immigrants—racially marked as Latino and presumed to be unauthorized—to keep a low profile and refrain from complaining about the terms of their work or housing. Park and Pellow demonstrate that immigrant workers’ poverty and invisibility help make Aspen what it is: opulent, tranquil, and white, unencumbered by disturbing inequalities in wealth, respect, rights, and opportunity.</p>
<p><italic>The Slums of Aspen</italic> constitutes an important and cutting-edge contribution to environmental justice studies not only for highlighting the ways in which “illegality” contributes to environmental injustices in ways that are distinct from race and class, but also for fixing the reader’s gaze on environmental <italic>privilege</italic>. Park and Pellow tell an unflinching account of the ways in which the elite have been able to acquire natural resources and scenic spaces, reap their rewards, and keep others out. While Aspen elites blame immigration for putting too much pressure on the nation’s ecosystems and natural resources, Park and Pellow highlight the unexamined environmental exploitations that uphold this resort community: the clear-cut ski slopes, gas-guzzling snowmaking machines and SUVs, strikingly large footprints of these seasonal homes, pools kept warm all winter, heated driveways, and heavily watered and chemically controlled lawns. Their stories also imply another set of environmental privileges that typically get little consideration in environmental justice studies: elites’ abilities to freely enjoy public space, reproduce without condemnation, define the wage rate, and obscure their own culpability in environmental decline.</p>
<p>The book’s most important contribution is showing that the rich elites have built, maintained, and stridently defended such privilege in part with a particularly <italic>nativist</italic> form of environmentalism. Aspen’s city council blamed Latino immigrants for environmental decline, and the authors show the long historical overlap between nativism and environmentalism. Park and Pellow demonstrate that nativist environmentalism is fundamentally racist, scapegoats the world’s poor, and detracts attention from industrial and military pollution and extraction, inadequate environmental regulations, and consumption practices of the relatively wealthy. <italic>The Slums of Aspen</italic> is a clear example of how seemingly humanist goals (in this case, protecting a nation’s natural resources and “wild” spaces) can be used to serve explicitly inegalitarian and racist ends. Park and Pellow show that popular concerns about population and immigration blame complex problems on the world’s poor, feed into racist scapegoating, obscure elites’ culpability in the environmental crisis, and reinforce environmental inequalities.</p>
<p>The authors showcase the work of real people and organizations who refuse to comply with nativism and who instead engage in anti-racist, pro-immigrant politics. Park and Pellow introduce us to specific individuals and local groups, show their connections to broader movements, and recognize that some environmental NGOs have actively grappled with and rejected the scapegoating politics of nativist environmentalism. Our students need to see that environmentalism can take other forms, that alternatives are possible, and that everyday people with busy schedules are intent on redressing social inequalities.</p>
<p>It is clear why the authors chose the Aspen case: like the racist histories that Park and Pellow rightly include in the book, contemporary Aspen is thrilling to read about because it is so shocking—so blatantly exploitative and nativist, so intent on securing its own privilege. It is a remarkable example of how certain groups maintain environmental privilege by simultaneously exploiting and blaming others. That said, what makes this book important is that Aspen is the exception that proves the rule. Nativist environmentalist narratives and practices employed in the name of “sustainability” and the protection of unrecognized environmental privileges are not unique to Aspen. Instead, this case simply throws them into sharp relief—the authors could have highlighted this point even more. How different is Aspen, really? To what extent are other actors in contemporary, mainstream environmental politics unwittingly complicit in racist, nativist environmental politics? The authors do note that Aspen elites tend to self-identify as left-leaning and environmentalist. How might the lifestyles of the rich and famous in Aspen reflect ideas and privileges, and thus responsibility, that are widespread rather than unique to those with such extraordinary wealth? This is a supremely important and disquieting question for all involved in the environmental movement.</p>
<p><italic>The Slums of Aspen</italic> is absolutely timely, provocative, engaging, and well written. I highly recommend it for students in sociology, environmental studies, geography, anthropology, and other related disciplines, as well as environmental activists, policy makers, and others engaged in issues relating to immigration and environmental politics—and plan to assign it in both my undergraduate and graduate-level environmental sociology courses.</p>
