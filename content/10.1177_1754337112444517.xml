<abstract>
<p>This paper presents an optimization methodology applicable to racing car chassis. The proposed procedure is sequentially structured, and starts with analysis of an existing vehicle, goes through an intermediate prototype and finishes with a final design. It is applied to a real case, the redesign of a steel tubular chassis for the ‘Copa de España de vehículos CM’, as part of a full vehicle development. The dynamic response of the existing chassis is modelled using finite element application techniques for structural design and validated with lab tests. In this way, through various modifications using basic static load cases for primary optimization, a completely new design (intermediate) is defined. Then a prototype is built, instrumented and tested in real field conditions (road and circuit). With acquired data from the dynamic behaviour of the car (suspension, steering, engine and transmission, etc.), using multi-body dynamic simulation software, an optimized load case is put forward in order to refine the first prototype. The ultimate goal is a chassis with much increased torsional and bending stiffness, with minimum weight gain, with regard to its interaction with the suspension and steering systems and to the manufacturing feasibility. It is shown that, with an adequate chassis elements configuration, stiffness can be increased by a 300% with just a 5% weight gain. The proposed methodology can be extended to other design (or re-engineering) procedures with rigid limitations in time and resources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In today’s competitive world, the need to develop a vehicle in the most efficient manner is of utmost importance. The role of computer-aided engineering (CAE) in the automotive industry is rapidly increasing. Functional performance attributes (noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), durability, etc.) are fine-tuned more and more on the basis of numerical predictions, so that the expensive physical prototyping phase can be shortened considerably. Traditionally, optimizing a vehicle body starts with improving the fundamental torsion and bending frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337112444517">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Car chassis optimization is a widely treated property. Many different optimization processes have been proposed, and many papers and works analyse the optimization of a specific part or system of the vehicle, for instance joints,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337112444517">2</xref></sup> suspension elements,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337112444517">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337112444517"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754337112444517"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337112444517"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337112444517"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754337112444517">8</xref></sup> wheels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337112444517">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337112444517">10</xref></sup> seats,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337112444517">11</xref></sup> crashworthiness and frame<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337112444517">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754337112444517">13</xref></sup> and so on.</p>
<p>The simplest dynamic models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754337112444517">14</xref></sup> such as mass point models and two wheel models, can be expressed in classical programming languages such as FORTRAN, C and C++. They can also be created with system simulation tools such as MATLAB/Simulink and Matrix/System Build. This model class does not need any appreciable computing time. This also applies to the three-dimensional functional models. In order to calculate the models, the automobile manufacturers and system suppliers usually rely on their own internal solutions. DaimlerChrysler for example, uses the Computer Aided Simulation of Car, Driver, and Environment CASCaDE. However, complete solutions are available on the market, such as Ve-Dyna or Carsim. Even for very extensive models, the typical computing time on a standard processor for a second of simulation ranges from about 0.1–1 s.</p>
<p>For component-oriented vehicle models a multiple of these time-scales is necessary. Designers most often use MBS-tools (multi-body systems) like ADAMS from MSC, DADS (actually VirtualLab) from LMS or Simpack from INTEC for such models. The method of multi-body systems (MBS) is based on the simulation of mechanical basic elements, such as mass, joints and springs, and is complemented by numerous component models. For component-oriented models the manufacturers also like to use internal solutions, which were developed from the desire to use frequently existing, well-developed and efficient simulation components. A computing time of about 20 s or more is needed for one second of simulation, whereas the detailed models created with MBS-tools and their incorporated component models, such as those for tyres, shock absorbers and others may require up to several hours of computing time for one second of simulation time.</p>
<p>Suspension configuration and optimization is a focus for many research and development groups around the world. Most of the studies are based on a simplified model of dynamic response,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754337112444517">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754337112444517"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754337112444517"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754337112444517"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754337112444517">19</xref></sup> but this methodology does not represent the real behaviour of the car. Some efforts have been applied to developing multi-body systems simulation software, such as ADAMS, for example,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754337112444517">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754337112444517">21</xref></sup> for mechanical model characterization.</p>
<p>In the paper of Els et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754337112444517">20</xref></sup> a recreational off-road vehicle is modelled in ADAMS and coupled to MATLAB for the execution of the optimization process. The full vehicle ADAMS model includes suspension kinematics and a load-dependent tyre model, as well as non-linear springs and dampers. Up to four design variables are considered in modelling the suspension characteristics. It is found that both algorithms perform well in optimizing handling. However, difficulties are encountered in obtaining improvements in the design process when ride comfort is considered, because the MBS software does not consider the dynamic behaviour of the structural elements (frame).</p>
<p>The frame can be analysed in general<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754337112444517">22</xref></sup> by focusing investigation on special aspects or modules by means of the finite element method. For example, the robustness of dynamic vehicle performance to spot weld failures has been analysed using the finite element method and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the effect of random spot weld failure on the dynamic vehicle performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337112444517">1</xref></sup> Vehicle front frame crash design optimization using different strategies has also been analysed in detail.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754337112444517">23</xref></sup> This research aimed to maximize the internal energy at the final time step using commercial software (PAM-CRASH) to analyse the dynamic response of the frame being studied.</p>
<p>Recently, the application of optimization for crashworthiness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754337112444517">24</xref></sup> is gaining momentum due to availability of higher computing power and software using the response surface method (RSM) combined with design of experiments (DOE), a statistical method for constructing smooth approximations to functions in multi-dimensional space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754337112444517">25</xref></sup> Various design optimization approaches, such as gradient based, DOE/penalty/gradient-based and DOE/penalty/RSM have been studied by Yang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754337112444517">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Modularization of automotive structures, such as the front end module, the cockpit module, the door module and so on, are becoming common in order to minimize the production cost, reduce the development time, improve the quality and enhance the performance. Hamid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754337112444517">27</xref></sup> presents a numerical optimization of the cross car beam of a modular cockpit. The optimization study was performed using LS-OPT code and LS-DYNA solver code. The optimization was based on component load level resulting from FMVSS214 dynamic side impact. The component load conditions were derived from a full vehicle simulation. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1754337112444517">28</xref></sup> uses the finite element method to analyse different crash conditions and design modification in order to improve the crashworthiness of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The design and optimization of active safety is very important at the present time. Initially, active control of vehicle dynamic systems is used to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. In current automotive technology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754337112444517">29</xref></sup> active control is also used to increase the safety and the reliability of the vehicle ride and handling. Special control systems are designed for different parts of the vehicle dynamics, such as anti-lock brake systems (ABS), traction control systems (TCS) and active yaw control systems. In available applications, kinematic steering (also known as Ackermann steering) is used to model the motion of the vehicle where the sideslip angles are small so that the wheel motion is assumed to be pure rolling. A single-track model (also known as the bicycle model) is used to simplify the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754337112444517">30</xref></sup> The wheels on an axle are represented by a single wheel with double the cornering stiffness. No complete models of systems using multi-body software simulation or parametric modelling have been put forward.</p>
<p>Only the largest automotive groups, such as Volvo,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1754337112444517">31</xref></sup> can adopt integrated methodologies in which the work on automated safety analysis is combined with multi-objective optimization techniques to assist the development of complex safety critical systems. The proposed process integrates design and first-principle safety analysis into a single thread that allows the consistent safety assessment of evolving designs from the early stages of the design.</p>
<p>Another development area in vehicle optimization is in the design and control of automated guided vehicle systems. The available methodologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1754337112444517">32</xref></sup> include simplified models of the dynamic response of vehicles to be introduced in control systems, and non-realistic mathematical models are put forward. Even the investigation of the vehicle–road interaction has been only studied with simplified models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1754337112444517">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>This work is about a methodology of optimization and its application to an existing vehicle, focussed in structural and dynamical response. The proposed tasks and steps are applied to a chassis design that attends to all the indicated basic aspects and is under current racing class (CM-class) regulations. The CM-class vehicles take part in the ‘Copa de España de Montaña para vehículos CM’, a Spanish Championship Hill Climb Class recently created. The vehicles usually cost about €25,000–€30,000, and they are very cheap to repair and maintain.</p>
<p>The original vehicle (CM02) has a tubular chassis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112444517">Figure 1</xref>) formed by square section tubes in the front and circular ones in the rear, reinforced by aluminium plates and weighting 70 kg alone and 150 kg with the engine and differential attached.</p>

<title>A new design and optimization conditions</title>
<p>Racing car engineering, outside of the F1 environment, has a minor role (including financially) in the automotive industry, and research and development groups, in general, have neither the time nor the resources to develop detailed theoretical optimization tasks in car design and set-up. In general we can say that the main design objective for a racing car frame is increasing structural stiffness, in order to improve the general dynamic response, knowing that a highly deformable frame will induce uncontrolled and unacceptable movements.</p>
<p>It is well known that the parts that ultimately define a racing car’s handling, acceleration and braking abilities are the tyres. The suspension system controls the way the tyres are in contact with the track to provide maximum grip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1754337112444517">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1754337112444517">35</xref></sup> However, a suspension system cannot work properly if it is not connected to a good frame, the element that supports the rest of the vehicle. An appropriate design means that the chassis properly interacts with all other systems in the car, but also achieves certain requirements relating to stiffness, strength, total weight and distribution, dimensions, construction feasibility, cost and regulations.</p>
<p>Beyond controlling the structure’s global stiffness, an adequate balance is needed between the front and the rear chassis areas to avoid dynamic weight transfer that would increase under-steer or over-steer behaviour. Total weight must remain low, in order to be as near as possible to the compulsory minimum weight. Chassis stiffness has the most important influence over the vehicle’s handling behaviour, so it is essential to reach an adequate compromise between stiffness and weight, it not being acceptable an excessive weight loss to improve straight-line performance through excessive weight loss at the expense of a sacrifice in suspension efficiency, which reduces cornering capability. Body weight distribution must also assure that the centre of gravity is low enough to minimize cornering inertia, and that its position is centred both longitudinally and transversely. Additionally, the proposed frame design has to be compatible with the other chassis systems and elements (suspension, steering, engine and transmission, brakes, seat etc.).</p>
<p>It is necessary to develop a design configuration that fulfils various performance requirements, such as strength, stiffness and cost, in most structural designs. Thus, it becomes important that the concept design considers a minimum-weight structure with maximum feasible performance based on the given constraints. Optimization techniques are useful design tools here. Structural optimization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1754337112444517">36</xref></sup> can be categorized into the following two classes. The first is referred to as the sizing optimization, which chooses the sizes of the structure as design variables (such as cross-sectional dimensions of members, thickness, width, height, moment of inertia, torsional constant) in the given domain. The next important factor is the shape optimization, in which the geometry of the structure is varied to obtain the optimal structural shape. In shape optimization, the boundary of the structure is variable, so parameterization of the geometry is the most important aspect. The integrated optimization procedure is only applicable to a part, element or subsystem, not to the whole vehicle chassis in real cases.</p>

<p>From a general point of view it is also possible to introduce both material choice variables and/or various cost variables. For the thoroughly developed industrial product optimization, two often-used measures are investigated. These are the performance measure, stiffness, and the cost measure, mass. To be able to quantify the stiffness and the mass measures the structures involved will, usually, be split into finite elements. The mass is easily estimated as a simple sum of all involved elements, and stiffness can be calculated from a small displacement linear elastic finite element analysis.</p>

<p>Only a very important research and development can develop (or use under contract) an integrated implementation of such algorithms. The methodology here presented is applicable to small-size teams with real limitation in time and resources. These groups, very normal in racing car engineering, usually have acquisition data devices and CAD software available.

<p>The application of this proposed methodology was put forward in a real case: the improvement of a CM-Class vehicle. The chassis of the original vehicle (CM02) was properly measured to build numerical models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337112444517">Figure 1</xref>) using the finite element method (FEM). To solve the numerical model commercial code ANSYS<sup>®</sup> was used, simulating structural behaviour with two-node linear beam and shell elements. Then, a series of laboratory tests were carried out to validate the models, using extensiometric gauges to compare deformations and stresses in nodes and elements.</p>
<p>With the validated numerical model different load case simulations were performed. Results analysis showed that the rear end was considerably stiffer than the front end, due to the structure configuration itself and the engine being rigidly attached to this area. Global deformations under the various tests seemed to be excessive, and could compromise the suspension. With these initial considerations about the existing vehicle, a new design was required, with solutions to the identified problems. The new design must also consider several restrictions related to suspension configuration, front and rear area sizes, safety cage special considerations, ergonomics of driving position, and so on. Other elements that influence body design include the battery, fuel tank, water tank, engine crankcase and braking system.</p>
<p>The new design will consider the following factors.</p>
<list id="list6-1754337112444517" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The safety cage is the base part from which the design starts (central part of the car).</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Under the above-mentioned considerations, first sketches of the new design were put forward using 3D CAD software with parametric modelling technology. Parametric modelling technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1754337112444517">39</xref></sup> provides designers with tremendous flexibility to explore feasible design alternatives. In order to support design decision-making for trade-offs between product performance and cost, engineers often depend on computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools to realize product performance. Kinematic and dynamic performance is one of the primary requirements for mechanical system design. A significant amount of work has been devoted to simulating dynamic performance of mechanical systems, including ground vehicles. However, the mapping between the physical geometry of the mechanical components to the simulation parameters of the motion models, such as mass properties and joint locations, are not available, since most simulation models are created in an analysis instead of a design form.</p>
<p>Initially, a structural definition is proposed and a mathematical model of dynamical response is developed to use finite element software in order to analyse dynamic behaviour. Then, the optimization procedure will be put forward. One of the new objectives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1754337112444517">38</xref></sup> in design optimization, in comparison to previous works, is to include the shape of the structure as an additional design variable. That is, the spatial positions for connection points joining different beam members can be used as design variables. This can be of great importance in the floor or in the ground plate of the car. The goal is to make size, shape and topology optimization of the 3D frame structures, simultaneously.</p>

<title>First optimization step</title>
<p>In chassis optimization of a racing car many variables are related. The experience-based knowledge of engineers is fundamental in defining the most important influencing parameters and their roles. The ratio of torsional stiffness to weight is one of the most important values in the final performance of the vehicle. The design process to get the proper equilibrium depends on so many factors that a classical optimization procedure (objective function, design variables, constraints, etc.) is not applicable for really short vehicle series. Other topics, such as manufacturability, process and products availability, regulations, reparability, costs and so on are very important in chassis design.</p>
<p>All of these variables and constraints can be mathematically defined and evaluated in multi-objective analysis from an academic point of view, but it is not possible to do this in real, small-industry situations. The design engineers need tools that can assist an experience-based procedure (traditional approach) without spending a great deal of time and resources. Even the software mentioned, such as finite element method and multi-body systems simulation, is expensive (and not easy to use properly) and, therefore, many designers choose to spend the limited resources available in laboratory or circuit tests. However, the authors consider that such virtual prototyping technologies provide enormous advantages and offer a well-balanced cost/benefit analysis. So the proposed methodology is based on the sequential combination of traditional tests with virtual prototyping.</p>
<p>The objectives of the first optimizing phase, to improve the first design, are:</p>
<list id="list7-1754337112444517" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>stiffness increment, which implies introducing more structural elements or modifying existent ones, improving triangulation without increasing weight by means of tube section optimizing;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>geometry optimization; keeping the centre of gravity as low as possible in coordination with suspension design;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>improvement of stresses transmission through frame;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>manufacturing and mounting processes simplification;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assurance of driver safety.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To evaluate the proposed first design (VAR = 0) and different variations, a set of load cases are put forward to identify structural response by means of computer simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337112444517">Figure 2</xref>). The main characteristic under consideration is the deformation different areas of the structure suffer, being measured as a displacement or as the angle the body is twisted. However, several other characteristics are also evaluated, such as strain and stresses values and distribution. Frequency tests are also carried out to examine the shape of the main vibration modes. Many different cases can be simulated, but in this work three of the identified conditions have been selected, as:</p>

</fig>
<p>Analysing the base design and the structural response under the load cases defined, some modifications are proposed by designers. This topological optimization is not computer assisted, but conceptually and experience based (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337112444517">Figure 3</xref>). The worth of every modification must be evaluated by means of dynamic analysis of structural response under load cases. Fourteen topological (A to N) modifications were proposed and, finally, only five variants (VAR1 to VAR5) were considered, including different modification sets.</p>

</fig>
<p>After the first step in the optimization procedure, the total weight of the car body is increased (VAR5), and that is non-acceptable. A second set of nine modifications (S1 to S9) and three new variants (VAR6 to VAR8) are proposed and evaluated, varying the sections of the tubes without geometric or topologic changes. The sizes of sections were chosen based on commercially-available tubes to minimize pricing or reparability issues.</p>
<p>According to a final and precise analysis of the proposed design (VAR8), some small modifications are required to facilitate manufacturing and mounting. These final modifications are adopted for intermediate design definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1754337112444517">
<title>Second optimization step</title>
<p>A prototype was built according to the intermediate design. The intermediate design provides a great increase in stiffness, while only being a few kilograms heavier. Nevertheless, after the whole vehicle is manufactured, the increase in total weight is greater than expected, due to the overall length gain, the bodywork, gear box lever and controls, suspension push-rods, and so on. While chassis stiffness is high enough to assure a much improved cornering behaviour, by having a high chassis/suspension stiffness ratio, the increase in weight, over the compulsory minimum could slightly decrease pure straight line performance. To make sure this doesn’t happen, a final weight reduction process is required, while trying to conserve bending and torsional stiffness.</p>
<p>In order to optimize the chassis, real solicitations are a very important data set. The optimization strategy developed is based on experimental determining of real solicitation by means of virtual prototyping (multi-body systems simulation) and circuit tests.</p>
<p>The torsional and bending effects in frame are generated in cornering, so it is necessary to determine the forces in these cases. From the point of view of optimization, the most important factor is characterizing the effort distribution between connection points (joints) between the suspension elements and the frame in cornering. The most interesting objective is determining the real load distribution to analyse the influence of chassis topology and sizing on the torsional behaviour of the frame and the dynamic response of the suspension. The mathematical formulation of this problem surpasses the capabilities of racing car engineers in real working conditions. It is important to note that there is not only a problem of ultimate stress calculation of structural elements that could be defined in the most unfavourable case (combined stresses). In this case a structural optimization process must be put forward.</p>
<p>The optimization process, as mentioned, requires an accurate load definition, and implies the application of new techniques in redesigning procedures. The available techniques are vehicle instrumentation, data processing and multi-body dynamic simulation software. The vehicle (intermediate prototype) was equipped with a wide variety of sensors (suspension, steering, lateral and longitudinal acceleration, speed, gear box, engine, accelerator position, temperature, pressure, time, etc.). The ‘A’ set of tests were put forward in real conditions on a closed rural road (AS-111, North Spain) and racing circuit (Calafat Circuit, Spain).</p>
<p>In real tests on the circuit a speed of 185 km/h was reached and values of longitudinal acceleration of 8 m/s<sup>2</sup> (traction) and 12 m/s<sup>2</sup> (braking) were usual. In lateral acceleration a maximum of 15 m/s<sup>2</sup> was obtained. For dynamic response a critical point was chosen with a maximum value in lateral acceleration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337112444517">Figure 4(b)</xref>). From suspension displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337112444517">Figure 4(a)</xref>) and differential speeds, the real loads in every wheel and suspension/steering element are obtained. In multi-body simulation software (MSC-ADAMS) these conditions are considered to generate forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1754337112444517">Figure 5</xref>) in connections (mounts) on the structure.</p>

</fig>
<p>With the forces obtained, a new structural analysis is performed, using the finite element model, with two load cases. The first includes the measured forces in the front suspension, with the rear part fixed, while the second case considers the forces in the rear part with the front-end fixed.</p>
<p>In this second optimization step, different design modifications are proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337112444517">Figure 6</xref>). The two measured load cases are used to determine if the variations are proper in relation to the frame dynamic response. To evaluate and compare, the torsion angle is determined where the forces are applied (front or rear). Some modifications will have a greater effect in one case rather than the other, so the final criteria will be the average of the torsion angle in the two cases.</p>

</fig>
<p>Several proposals are checked, individually and jointly, examining their influence on chassis stiffness values and balance. First of all it is noted that every change has its relevance in the final results because of the chassis global equilibrium, and it is difficult to choose different alternatives to reduce weight.</p>
<p>The final design was built and has been successfully tested in races since 2006. With the design achieved, approximately 30 vehicles are competing in mountain races in Spain, Portugal and France. A new version, for speed circuit application, is being development.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>A new methodology is proposed for racing car chassis optimization. The procedure requires interaction between 3D CAD parametric technologies, virtual prototyping (finite element and multi-body system computer simulations) and real-size (1:1) prototype construction and testing, and data acquisition devices in order to improve the intermediate design.</p>
<p>The proposed methodology is applied to a new tubular steel chassis designed under CM group (class) regulations, targeting a great stiffness increase with minimum weight gain, as part of a full vehicle development. An existing chassis is modelled and analysed using finite element simulation software and some shortcomings are examined. The new design strategy focuses on suspension interaction and global continuity, avoiding bending deformation mechanisms, and on manufacturing feasibility.</p>
<p>The optimization design process goes through several different stages, and the final design is modified to assure a correct symbiosis with the driver and the rest of the vehicle’s systems. In the first stage the different design variations are analysed using different tests, which simulate braking, accelerating and cornering, in order to check bending and torsional stresses and deformation values and distribution. Different simplified load cases are defined to simulate dynamic stresses in the vehicle in real driving conditions, and to evaluate diverse design modifications.</p>
<p>Due to the overall weight increase in the intermediate design of the vehicle, to try to keep the weight close to the compulsory minimum, a weight reduction analysis was carried out. By strategic removing and resizing of a small quantity of structural elements an even stiffer and lighter intermediate body design was developed.</p>
<p>With this modified design an intermediate configuration was proposed and a first prototype (1:1 size) was built, with significant improvements on the original design. This real prototype was tested on a closed road and racing circuit (Calafat, Spain) to determine real dynamic response.</p>
<p>A new methodology was proposed to refine the initial design definition by means of sensors and transducers, data acquisition and processing, multi-body dynamic simulation software and finite element method calculation. The use of these techniques is sequential and integrated to obtain real load cases applicable to structural calculations of the modelled frame.</p>
<p>Final design results show an increase of 300% in stiffness, with only 5% weight gain, with the same centre of gravity height and more balanced longitudinal position. The manufacturing process is easier due to the lack of bent tubes and aluminium plates.</p>
<p>In the optimization processes of racing cars, 3D CAD and finite element methods are considered adequate for the initial design phases. The combination of these technologies with low-cost data acquisition devices and the testing of prototypes opens up new possibilities for racing car engineers and designers.</p>
