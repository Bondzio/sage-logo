<abstract>
<p>Elections send ambiguous signals to the political system, particularly when interpreting the meaning of various “nonvotes” (e.g., abstention, ballot spoiling, and roll-off). While a “none of the above” (NOTA) option may allow voters to better signal discontent, how NOTA voting is used is not well understood. The authors’ analysis of all races in Nevada, which has allowed for NOTA voting since 1976, suggests that NOTA voting is consistent with protest voting and limited information. Thus, while NOTA voting can be a less ambiguous signal of discontent than other nonvotes, the practice of NOTA voting is less clear.</p>

<p>Abstention, roll-off, and spoiled ballots represent a class of “nonvotes” that composes part of the signal that elections send to the political system. Yet the exact signals that these nonvotes communicate are unclear because they may arise from motivations varying from alienation to boredom to confusion. Thus, while in a democracy participation in the electoral process is the primary means by which citizens’ preferences are injected into the political system, not all citizens choose to participate. Many opt to abstain from voting. Others who bear the costs of turning out roll-off by not registering a vote for all of the races on the ballot, while others either intentionally or not spoil their ballots and thus fail to cast a valid ballot.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that these behaviors, which we define as nonvotes, are consistent with multiple interpretations. Abstention can represent alienation from politics or apathy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911424286">Adams, Dow, and Merrill 2006</xref>). Abstention can also be driven by perceptions of competitiveness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1065912911424286">Pattie and Johnston 2001</xref>) or reflect a lack of information about the issues at stake (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911424286">Bowler, Donovan, and Happ 1992</xref>). Conceivably, too, roll-off may be an artifact of the ballot machinery in use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911424286">Nichols 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911424286">Knack and Kropf 2003</xref>). Many of these points can also apply to spoiled ballots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911424286">Uggla 2008</xref>). From the point of view of assessing the health of electoral democracy, some of these motivations may be more harmful than others. In particular, widespread and persistent alienation from electoral politics, however manifested, may indicate broader concerns about the legitimacy of existing political arrangements and citizens’ willingness to consent to these institutions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911424286">Harrop and Miller 1987</xref>, 258-59). For citizens, their views may be subject to misinterpretation: they can be seen to be either far less satisfied or far more satisfied than is actually the case.</p>
<p>The ambiguity surrounding nonvoting has led some reformers to advocate for the inclusion of a “none of the above” (NOTA) option on the ballot. By providing voters with such a ballot option, it is in principle possible for voters to send a clear signal of discontent or protest. Because of this, NOTA voting could be a more meaningful nonvote as compared to abstention, roll-off, or ballot spoiling.</p>
<p>Despite its potential utility, cross-nationally there are only a handful of countries that use versions of the NOTA option and with few exceptions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911424286">Weinberg, Linderman, and Kawar 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911424286">Zulfikarpasic 2001</xref>), there exist almost no systematic studies of its use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911424286">1</xref></sup> In the American context, numerous jurisdictions have proposed NOTA voting, but only Nevada, which implemented NOTA voting in 1976, presently utilizes the mechanism. Nevada thus presents us with an excellent instance of a laboratory of democracy for assessing this experiment in voting options and allows us to differentiate its use from other types of nonvotes that have received substantial attention in the literature.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is divided into four sections. In the following section we explore the meaning of NOTA voting by developing competing explanations for how voters may approach the option. From this discussion we next develop a series of hypotheses that will allow us to establish drivers of NOTA voting. In the empirical section of the article we present evidence using data from the entire history of the option’s use in Nevada that suggest that much of the conventional wisdom relating to the practice is incorrect. Specifically, our results suggest that NOTA voting neither correlates with increased voter turnout nor erodes support for minor party candidates. More generally, our results are consistent with the notion that NOTA voting results from limited information as we find that it is more prevalent for less salient races and correlates with roll-off. At the same time, our results do offer some support for the argument that NOTA voting is a form of purposeful protest as it increases when fewer options are put before voters and, more significantly, increases in general election races that receive the greatest level of voter interest. The article concludes by discussing how our effort informs the debate about the efficacy of NOTA voting.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911424286">
<title>NOTA on the Ballot</title>
<p>As we note above, abstention in the form of either not turning out or rolling off particular races or ballot spoiling sends an ambiguous message to the political system—a point supported by the various motivations attached to these behaviors in the literature. In contrast, voting NOTA may allow voter intent to be more clearly determined as compared to other types of nonvoting. However, because of the dearth of scholarship examining the use of NOTA voting in practice, there is little guidance for conceptualizing the meaning of the NOTA vote beyond news coverage or speculation surrounding proposals for implementing the option in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>For instance, proponents of California’s Proposition 23, which would have implemented NOTA voting in that state, claimed that “not voting does not get you heard, it just gets you labeled as apathetic” and that
<disp-quote>
<p>[i]f we had the option of voting for NOTA, we would have the opportunity to have our protest counted and our voices heard. More people like us would vote if they had a choice-to vote for a worthy candidate, or to vote for NOTA in an election where none of the candidates was worthy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911424286">California Secretary of State 2000</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One anecdotal example supporting the argument that NOTA voting sends a clear message can be gleaned from the words of one disgruntled voter:
<disp-quote>
<p>Just look at this year’s choices. If the candidates and their supporters are to be believed we could select:</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list1-1065912911424286" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Between a greedy, self-serving, incompetent liar and a slothful, ethically challenged, incompetent liar.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Between a liar we cannot trust because of his record and a person who lies about his record.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Between a tax cheating criminal abettor and a bribery advocator.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Among several vicious, unethical, self-serving liars and the control-obsessed backers of other equally vicious, incompetent liars. Negative campaigning is not new. However, with TV enhancement it seems more vicious. The net result is voter apathy. None of the Above is looking better every year. (Letter from William C. Stapp, <italic>Las Vegas Sun</italic>, November 6, 1998)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With the NOTA option, voters such as Mr. Stapp can unambiguously signal dissatisfaction with the alternatives put before them in a manner that other types of nonvoting fail to convey. At the same time, NOTA voting presents a puzzle to standard explanations of voting behavior. Unlike voters who abstain, but akin to voters who roll-off or spoil their ballots, NOTA voting requires voters to overcome registration and turnout costs. However, in contrast to voters who roll-off or produce spoiled ballots, NOTA voters cast a valid ballot, but not for any of the available options. Rather, choosing the NOTA option is a vote against all of the choices on offer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911424286">2</xref></sup> In sum, because NOTA voting implies that voters consent to the legitimacy of the electoral process, are willing to bear the costs of electoral participation, and then use the franchise to communicate displeasure, the presence of a NOTA option can allow elections to function as more informative signals from voters to the political system.</p>
<p>Proponents of NOTA voting also contend that allowing voters to use elections to signal disapproval may further democratic health in at least two ways. First, during the debate over implementation of NOTA voting in the Nevada Legislature, proponents framed the device as a panacea to low voter in light of voter apathy and decreasing turnout in the post-Watergate era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911424286">O’Connor 1994</xref>). Second, NOTA advocates argue that the presence of the option may improve the quality of campaigns. NOTA may cause candidate behavior to change because candidates, fearful of seeing too many “no one” votes, will respond by running less negative and more substantive campaigns that, all else equal, may be less likely to turn off marginal voters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911424286">3</xref></sup> As the editorial in the <italic>Las Vegas Sun</italic> read at the time of the proposal in Nevada,
<disp-quote>
<p>Surely every office seeker and office holder would be firmly inclined to conduct himself properly, in office and off-duty, in such a manner as to avoid a landslide of “none of these candidates” on Election Day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1065912911424286"><italic>Las Vegas Sun</italic> 1975</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not everyone, however, is persuaded of the benefits of NOTA. Foes of California’s NOTA proposal, for example, made two arguments in opposition. First, they suggested that the Nevada experiment had failed because “after a brief flurry of interest in NOTA, voters stop using the option and candidates continue behaving as before” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911424286">California Secretary of State 2000</xref>). Rather than mobilizing voters interested in sending a signal of dissatisfaction with their electoral choices, the introduction of the process was a fad, with voters quickly sinking back into their usual patterns.</p>
<p>Second, opponents argued that the option “would just draw votes away from candidates who are trying to provide credible alternatives to the major parties” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1065912911424286">California Secretary of State 2000</xref>). Minor parties, in particular, would receive less support as a consequence of NOTA voting, and this, in turn, would undermine or delay the chance of meaningful reform such as moving to proportional representation. Indeed, these arguments in opposition to Proposition 23 were advanced by Green Party supporters presumably concerned for their preferred party’s vote share.</p>
<p>At the same time, the absence of a NOTA option may cloud electoral interpretation for minor parties. Minor parties may infer from vote totals that they are popular. Yet if citizens vote for minor parties only as a form of protest—not because they agree with the party or its platform—then such an inference would be incorrect. The limited literature addressing protest voting, generally in multiparty systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911424286">Bergh 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911424286">Bowler and Lanoue 1992</xref>), suggests such a dynamic. Specifically, this research links protest voting to support for “protest parties,” often those at the far right of the ideological spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911424286">Iganazi 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911424286">Riedelsperger 1998</xref>) or that are perceived as unlikely to gain influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911424286">Anderson and Tverdova 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911424286">Bergh 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911424286">Bowler and Lanoue 1992</xref>). Because these parties are viewed as repositories of protest votes and thus lack true supporters, they can be and often are dismissed as less meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911424286">Bergh 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the two-party context, a protest vote requires either an ambiguous action (i.e., abstaining or ballot spoiling) or voting against one’s preferred party (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1065912911424286">Bowler and Lanoue 1992</xref>) by casting a negative vote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911424286">Kernell 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911424286">Fiorina 1981</xref>)—an action that has the perverse consequence of helping to facilitate the election of a lesser preferred outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911424286">4</xref></sup> If a minor party option is available and taken, then the intent of protest voters is further compromised as the message they are sending is both unclear <italic>and</italic> likely to siphon votes from their party of preference.</p>
<p>Muddying the waters further is a set of arguments that see NOTA voting as having much in common with low-information voting. That is, the preceding discussion stems from an interpretation of NOTA voting as a form of protest that should improve electoral interpretation and potentially stimulate turnout and lead to better campaigns. But we can also advance a rival explanation for the meaning of NOTA voting that is less sanguine. Rather than offering an opportunity for thoughtful protest, it may be that the voting NOTA provides a fig leaf for the more familiar behaviors associated with limited political information—abstention, roll-off, and apathy. Take, for example, the comment of a Nevada voter reported in the press in 2006:
<disp-quote>
<p>Gary Dykes of Gardnerville said he chose “none” in a few cases because he didn’t know enough about the candidates. “I didn’t want to vote for people I didn’t know. It’s kind of like a protest vote, rather than not voting at all,” added Dykes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912911424286">Riley 2006</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What this account suggests is that NOTA voting is a consequence of an information shortfall: voters will cast such a ballot instead of leaving the ballot blank when they are uninformed about the candidates. The act of choosing “none” may then be motivated by something other than an active sense of protest and is made easy by the voter already having borne the costs of turning out to vote in the first place, perhaps to register a preference for a top of the ticket race. Or put differently, NOTA voting may allow voters to fulfill other benefits associated with voting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911424286">Riker and Ordershook’s 1968</xref> “D” term), without having to make an informed vote. If this is the case, then we might expect NOTA voting to vary systematically in response to the saliency of the races on the ballot and correlate with voter roll-off.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1065912911424286">
<title>Hypotheses and Data</title>
<p>Taken together with existing arguments on the correlates of other forms of nonvotes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911424286">Uggla 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911424286">Adams, Dow, and Merrill 2006</xref>), the arguments for and against implementing a NOTA option suggest a set of hypotheses relating to the frequency with which we should observe NOTA voting. If NOTA voting facilitates the expression of voter discontent, then we should see specific patterns that relate to the choices on offer and vary both by election and by office.</p>
<list id="list2-1065912911424286" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of protest voting, then it will increase when there are fewer candidates competing for an office or a candidate runs unopposed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911424286">5</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of protest voting normally soaked up by minor (“protest”) parties, then there will be a negative relationship between the appearance of minor party candidates on the ballot and NOTA voting.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of protest voting, then it will increase in elections for more salient offices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: If NOTA voting fosters democratic health, then it will be positively correlated with turnout. While we cannot easily sort out the causal relationship between the presence of NOTA and voter turnout, the arguments of proponents suggest that it is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition, and thus there should be a positive correlation between turnout and NOTA.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Alternatively, NOTA voting may be consistent with other types of behavior that reflect limited information or apathy. If this is the case, then we expect the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1065912911424286" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of low information, then it will be positively correlated with ballot roll-off. As with the hypothesis regarding the effects of voter turnout, it is difficult to sort out causality between these variables. However, given that prior research suggests that roll-off is greater for races where information is less salient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911424286">Nichols 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911424286">Bowler, Donovan, and Happ 1992</xref>), a positive correlation between the variables would suggest similar processes at work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911424286">6</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of low information, then it will be more frequent in primary elections as compared to general elections.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of low information, then it will increase in races for lower-saliency offices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 8</italic>: If NOTA voting is indicative of low information, then it will increase in nonpartisan races.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As noted at the outset, while NOTA voting is used in a handful of countries (see note 1), in the United States only Nevada has implemented NOTA voting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911424286">7</xref></sup> Starting in 1976, voters in Nevada have had the choice to cast a ballot for NOTA in statewide federal and state contests during primaries and general elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911424286">8</xref></sup> Thus, Nevada’s experiment with NOTA voting presents a useful case for analyzing the above hypotheses for at least two reasons. First, because Nevada provides us with a data series over thirty years long, we are able to capture variation over time that may result from changes to the state’s political landscape. Second, because the data allow us to compare across offices and contexts (e.g., primary versus general elections), we are able to examine the relationship between NOTA voting and more well-established patterns of roll-off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911424286">9</xref></sup> In contrast, in other contexts where variations of NOTA voting exist, elections are less frequent and the ballot is often limited to a single office (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911424286">Zulfikarpasic 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The data used in the article’s analysis span the 1976 primary through the 2010 general election. The federal races included are the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives (until 1982, when Nevada gained a second House seat), and the state races are Nevada’s six constitutional offices (i.e., governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, treasurer, and controller) and the Supreme Court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911424286">10</xref></sup> The number of races in the data set is 219 (103 primary and 116 general election contests).</p>
<p>One point to underscore is that these data allow us to detect important sources of variation in NOTA—by election, by office, and by the number of choices competing for an office. This kind of variation is revealing in and of itself. For example, more salient offices may draw more NOTA votes if voters use the mechanism to direct their ire toward those who are perceived as most responsible for governmental decision making. Alternatively, if NOTA voting reflects a general, systemic dissatisfaction or reflects dissatisfaction among a subset of the population, then we are likely to see very little variation in NOTA voting from office to office and indeed from election to election.</p>
<p>For each race, data were collected for the percentage of the vote that NOTA received (the primary dependent variable), the percentage of the vote that minor party candidates received, turnout, roll-off, the number of candidates competing, and contest-specific characteristics such as office, primary or general election, and nonpartisan or partisan election.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911424286">11</xref></sup> We also collected data to control for changes in economic conditions and nonpartisan registrants and if the election took place during a midterm. The data come from <italic>Political History of Nevada</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1065912911424286">Parker and George 2006</xref>), the Nevada secretary of state’s webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nvsos.gov/">http://nvsos.gov/</ext-link>), and the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>

<sec id="section3-1065912911424286">
<title>NOTA Voting in Practice</title>
<p>We begin our analysis with a descriptive overview of patterns of use of NOTA voting in Nevada. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1065912911424286">Figure 1</xref> presents the average frequency of NOTA voting between 1976 and 2010. These data show quite clearly, and in contrast to the claims of Californian opponents to NOTA voting, that NOTA voting has not been a fad that began with a bang and then quickly dissipated in use over time. On average during the period under investigation, 10.98 percent (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.46, min = 0.45, max = 47.31) of votes cast in statewide race were NOTA votes, and, if anything, that percentage has increased slightly over time.</p>

</fig>
<p>Thus, the data suggest that the NOTA option has been consistently used since its implementation. However, because the over-time increase is slight, it might be that NOTA voting results from a stable cadre of voters giving expression to their frustration. Such patterns then may not reflect a carefully calibrated protest targeting specific political objects but rather could be interpreted as a sign of inchoate anger at the status quo more generally. The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911424286">Figure 2</xref>, which presents the densities of NOTA voting for the 219 races included in the data set, suggest that this is not the case as there is considerable variation in the frequency of voters opting to vote NOTA. Moreover, some of the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1065912911424286">Figure 2</xref> are politically consequential in that the percentage voting NOTA was greater than the margin between the winner and second place candidate in 45 of the 219 cases considered. Indeed, in the 1976 and 1978 House and 1978 secretary of state Republican primaries and the 1986 Democratic treasurer primary NOTA was the top vote getter. We return to this point below.</p>

<p>While these data are informative with respect to some of the arguments bandied about by proponents and opponents of NOTA voting, the descriptive patterns do not allow us to determine if variation in NOTA voting is a reflection of protest, limited information, or some combination of the two. We turn to disentangling these considerations by developing and presenting a series of multivariate regression models to assess the correlates of NOTA voting.</p>
<p>Specifically, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref> presents the results of four models: the results in the first column are for all races in the data set, the next column of results considers only general election races, and the final two columns do the same for primary elections. The dependent variable for all models is the percentage of the vote that NOTA received in each race. The measurements of the independent variables are straightforward, and the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1065912911424286">appendix</xref> provides a summary of these measures and their descriptive statistics. In addition to the primary independent variables of interest, we include control variables in all models for the percentage of registered nonpartisan voters, the change in the third quarter unemployment rate between election year and the year prior, and if the election took place during a midterm. The models are estimated with ordinary least squares regression and use robust standard errors.</p>

<p>The first column of results from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref>, which considers all races in the data set, indicates that the model performs quite well as the independent variables account for 61 percent of the variation in the dependent variable and, on average, the predicted values of the dependent variable are off by less than 5.5 percent. The coefficients suggest a process supportive of the notion that NOTA voting stems from limited information. This can be seen from the signs and significances for <italic>primary</italic> and <italic>roll-off</italic>. Specifically, on average NOTA voting is over 8 percent greater in primary elections as compared to general election races. We also find that NOTA voting correlates with the propensity of voters to roll off as each percentage increase in voter roll-off results in a roughly equivalent (0.85 percent) increase in the NOTA vote. At the same time, the analysis indicates that NOTA voting is unaffected by the partisan nature of a race or by the saliency of a contest as both <italic>nonpartisan race</italic> and <italic>high-saliency office</italic> are statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>As for our hypotheses regarding protest and democratic health, the results are unsupportive of the argument that NOTA voting provides a means for voters to articulate their discontent or that the NOTA option stimulates voter participation. Specifically and in contrast to claims made by NOTA proponents, there does not appear to be any relationship between NOTA voting and voter turnout as <italic>turnout</italic> is insignificant. NOTA also does not appear to be influenced by the number of alternatives put before voters as both <italic>unopposed</italic> and <italic>number of candidates</italic> fail to obtain conventional levels of statistical significance. The results suggest that changes in the state’s economic conditions, the number of registered nonpartisan voters, and if the election occurred during a midterm year, although included as controls, do not affect the level of NOTA voting as the coefficients for <italic>unemployment change, midterm</italic>, and <italic>nonpartisans</italic> are insignificant.</p>
<p>The pooling of general and primary elections into the same analysis, however, may obscure differences across election contexts. To assess if such differences exist, we present the model separately for general (column 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref>) and primary (column 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref>) elections. In so doing, <italic>primary</italic> is dropped from both models and <italic>unopposed</italic> is dropped from the primary-only analysis because there are no primary races in the data set featuring a single candidate. While these slight specification differences constrain our ability to make direct comparisons across the two models, inspection of the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and root mean square error statistics suggest that the model fit is much better for the general election analysis as compared to primary elections. Specifically and with due regard for the limitations associated with the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911424286">Kennedy 2003</xref>), the value of the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> statistic is nearly double for the general election model and the average prediction error is less than half of what it is for the primary-only analysis.</p>
<p>Comparison of the coefficients across the two models suggests a number of interesting differences with respect to the frequency of NOTA voting between primary and general election contests. Perhaps most significant, the results indicate that in both election contexts voters are much more likely to vote NOTA in nonpartisan races as indicated by the positive and statistically significant coefficient for <italic>nonpartisan race</italic>. This effect is nearly three times as large for primaries as compared to general elections. As we suggest above, these effects are likely an indicator of low-information voting. Also consistent with the low-information argument is the performance of <italic>roll-off</italic>. The coefficient is significant and positive in both models, suggesting that NOTA voting correlates with the propensity of voters to abstain from voting in races for which they may not have sufficient information. Comparison of the coefficients suggests stronger substantive effects for <italic>roll-off</italic> for primary races.</p>
<p>The results also indicate that while NOTA voting in primaries is unaffected by the number of choices put before voters, the sign and significance for <italic>number of candidates</italic> in the general election analysis suggest modest substantive effects for this variable. Specifically, each additional candidate competing in a general election race on average reduces the NOTA vote by over 1 percent—a result that is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911424286">Zulfikarpasic (2001)</xref> analysis of the French context. Across the analyses presented thus far, this is the first evidence consistent with the argument that NOTA voting stems from active protest. Substantively, this suggests that in general elections when voters have few alternatives from which to choose, they are more likely to vote NOTA. Also, and as was the case with the pooled model, NOTA voting in the primary and general election contexts is unaffected by the saliency of the contest as <italic>high-saliency office</italic> is insignificant in the primary and general election analyses.</p>
<p>Last, there are two differences between the pooled analysis presented in column 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref> as compared to when the model is run separately for primary and general elections. Although included as a control, <italic>nonpartisan voters</italic> is positive and significant for both the primary and general elections, suggesting that as the number of nonpartisan voters increases so does the share of the vote going to NOTA. This effect appears to be slightly stronger in the general election analysis. Also, whereas <italic>turnout</italic> did not factor into the pooled analysis, it is negative and significant when the analysis is broken down by election type. This result is unexpected given that one of the primary arguments made for implementing NOTA voting in Nevada was that it would lead to higher voter turnout. These results suggest the opposite: holding all else constant, as voter turnout increases, the rate of NOTA voting decreases. One reason why this may be is that the turnout of marginal voters may result from mobilization efforts by a party, campaign, or interest group and these voters may, in turn, vote in the manner prescribed by the mobilizing entity. Obviously, without access to appropriate individual-level data, this is speculative at best. Last, the other two control variables, <italic>midterm</italic> and <italic>unemployment change</italic>, are statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>While the results presented thus far suggest patterns consistent with many of our theoretical expectations and yield some interesting differences in NOTA use between primary and general elections, it might be useful to more finely parse NOTA voting in the primary context where it is more ubiquitous. In so doing, we can advance competing hypotheses consistent with the protest versus informational arguments outlined above. On one hand, if NOTA voting is a form of protest behavior, it may be more likely to occur in primaries featuring an incumbent. The underlying logic here is that because primary elections often attract more ideologically disposed voters (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911424286">Brady, Han, and Pope 2007</xref>) who, all else equal, may be less supportive of candidates, such as incumbents, who may be perceived as creatures of the status quo, we may observe heightened levels of NOTA voting in primaries where incumbents are on the ballot. The alternative hypothesis here would be that the name recognition that incumbents often enjoy may serve as a sufficient heuristic that, all else equal, may result in fewer NOTA votes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911424286">Weinberg, Linderman, and Kawar 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess these considerations we make two additions to the primary model: we include <italic>incumbent in primary</italic>, a dummy variable that is coded 1 if an incumbent was competing in the primary, and we include a dummy variable, <italic>Democratic primary</italic>, to control for any interparty differences given that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911424286">Weinberg, Linderman, and Kawar (1982)</xref> find that NOTA voting is less common in Democratic primaries. The results for this analysis are presented in the final column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>Overall, the results for this analysis are consistent with those for the primary-only model presented in the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref>. With respect to any interparty differences in NOTA voting, the insignificance of <italic>Democratic primary</italic> suggests that Democratic primary voters are no more or less likely to cast a vote for NOTA as compared to their Republican counterparts. The performance and significance of <italic>incumbent in primary</italic> are consistent with the information effects hypothesis as opposed to the protest hypothesis. Specifically, when an incumbent runs in a primary the NOTA vote decreases by 3.5 percent, suggesting that incumbent name recognition blunts the greater propensity of voters to choose NOTA in primary contests.</p>
<p>The results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref> help us to better differentiate NOTA voting that stems from limited information from NOTA voting that is protest oriented. Yet these analyses do not allow us to directly assess what might be the most significant issue that our research addresses: the implications that the NOTA option has for the support for minor party candidates. We can indirectly glean evidence for this from the performance for <italic>number of candidates</italic> from the general election analysis, which suggests that NOTA voting decreases as the number of candidates on the ballot increases. Further evidence for this point comes from the bivariate correlation between the percentage voting NOTA and the percentage vote for minor party candidates (<italic>M</italic> = 4.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.89, min = 0, max = 27.41) in the seventy-eight partisan general election races in the data set. As noted above, a negative relationship between the variables may suggest that NOTA voting is soaking up protest votes that would otherwise go to minor party candidates. However, this does not appear to be the case as the correlation is positive and strong (<italic>r</italic> = +.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that the two types of voting move in tandem.</p>
<p>To more rigorously evaluate the relationship between NOTA and minor party voting, we specify a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) analysis. Developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911424286">Zellner (1962)</xref>, SUR models offer two advantages. First, they improve the efficiency of parameter estimates when the error terms for two or more regression equations may be correlated—something that is likely to occur when outcomes of interest are predicted by similar covariates. However, these efficiency gains occur only when the models are estimated using different covariates—a condition not met by the analysis here. Second and pertinent to our analysis, SUR models facilitate joint hypothesis testing across equations. For the SUR model presented below, the dependent variables are the percentage of the vote received by minor party candidates and the percentage of the NOTA vote. The independent variables included in the equations are <italic>number of candidates, turnout, roll-off, high-saliency office</italic>, and the control variables <italic>midterm, nonpartisans</italic>, and <italic>unemployment change</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911424286">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a number of respects, the SUR analysis is the most informative and rigorous of the analyses presented here. It offers an improvement in model specification from the single equation models presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref> because it allows us to simultaneously analyze two potentially distinct but interrelated voting processes. The model also considers the races that “matter the most” as it excludes nonpartisan contests (e.g., Supreme Court races), which are the only instances of candidates running unopposed in the data set, and is restricted to general elections (thus, <italic>nonpartisan race, primary</italic>, and <italic>unopposed</italic> are dropped). The inclusion of the nonpartisan races in the general election model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1065912911424286">Table 1</xref> may obscure some of the effects of interest given that these races account for one-third of the observations for that analysis and stand apart from typical electoral contests.</p>
<p>The results of the SUR analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911424286">Table 2</xref>. Inspection of the statistics at the bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911424286">Table 2</xref> indicates that a SUR model is appropriate. The correlation between the errors from the two equations is +.40, and the Breusch–Pagan test of independence (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) indicates that this correlation is statistically significant. Comparisons of the <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> and root mean square error statistics for the two equations indicate that the model fit for both is quite strong, albeit somewhat better for the NOTA model.</p>

<p>Examination of the coefficients for the independent variables reveals some interesting similarities and differences with respect to the factors explaining variation in the aggregate minor party and NOTA vote. Both types of voting similarly correlate with <italic>roll-off</italic>, and we again see the unexpected effects for <italic>turnout</italic> reported above. It is not surprising that <italic>number of candidates</italic> exerts a positive and statistically significant effect on the vote that minor party candidates receive, while the variable has a negative and statistically significant effect on the share of votes going to NOTA. Substantively, the coefficients for <italic>number of candidates</italic> suggest that each additional candidate in a race increases the aggregate minor party vote by just over 1 percent, while decreasing the NOTA vote by two-fifths of 1 percent. The results also indicate that minor party candidates receive more support as the Nevada electorate has increasingly moved away from identifying with the two major political parties, as suggested by the sign and significance for <italic>nonpartisan voters. Nonpartisan voters</italic> exerts a positive but weaker effect on NOTA voting. Neither type of voting is affected by changes to the state’s economic conditions nor if the contest occurred during a midterm election as <italic>unemployment change</italic> and <italic>midterm</italic> are statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>In the SUR model the performance of <italic>nonpartisans</italic>, although included in the analysis as a control, is noteworthy. At first glance, the increase in nonpartisan voters in Nevada may be a function of limited information given the strong correlation between <italic>nonpartisans</italic> and two-year population change (<italic>r</italic> = +.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Indeed, since the implementation of NOTA voting, Nevada’s population increased nearly five and a half times and nonpartisan registration increased from 6 to nearly 16 percent. Thus, all else equal, new émigrés may be akin to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911424286">Dalton’s (2007)</xref> apoliticals in that they are less likely to inform themselves about the state’s politics or attach themselves to a political party. However, in light of the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911424286">Table 2</xref>, the rise in nonpartisans in Nevada also may reflect the behavior of apartisans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1065912911424286">Dalton 2007</xref>)—voters who are cognitively engaged but unattached to any political party and whose vote choices are less predictable given that their political decision making is not anchored by long-standing partisan predispositions. The bivariate correlation between <italic>nonpartisan voters</italic> and the percentage of the vote won by minor party candidates is +.34 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). At any rate, given that Nevada has fairly robust minor party activity and a large number of nonpartisan voters, the state’s elections provide two ways in which voters may channel their dissatisfaction: by choosing to support minor party candidates or opting to vote for NOTA. But are these behaviors distinguishable?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911424286">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest evidence indicating that these are in fact distinct behaviors, at least in the aggregate, comes from the performance of <italic>high-saliency office</italic>. The coefficient is statistically significant and positive for the NOTA equation but insignificant for the minor party vote model. Substantively, this suggests that support for minor party candidates in unaffected by the profile of an office. This finding is consistent with the argument that voters support minor party candidates because they agree with the party or its platform and not to signal dissatisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911424286">14</xref></sup> In contrast, general election races that attract the greatest voter interest and for which even disengaged voters are likely to possess a modicum of information receive significantly more NOTA votes. While the magnitude of the coefficient suggests a small effect on average (1.3 percent, holding all else constant), for two of the high saliency races in the data set—the 1996 presidential and 1998 Senate elections—the NOTA option received a larger vote share than the difference between the winner and second place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911424286">15</xref></sup> As we argue above, if voters use the NOTA option to send a message of dissatisfaction to the political system, this is more likely to occur for offices with the greatest governmental authority—a point supported by the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1065912911424286">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Taken together, ballot spoiling, abstention, in terms of either not turning out to vote or rolling off specific races, and NOTA voting compose a class of nonvotes that affect what and how we hear the voice of the electorate. To this end, the past decade has seen an enormous growth of interest in the study of these behaviors as well as the impact that voting and ballot technology exert on voting participation and electoral results. Of the various types of nonvotes, it is NOTA voting that is least understood and least studied. Yet it is NOTA voting that in principle offers a solution to the ambiguous signals that abstention and spoiled ballots send to the political system. NOTA voting could allow us to identify patterns of disaffection—and allow voters to express that disaffection—much more clearly than other types of nonvotes.</p>
<p>While NOTA voting shares some features of abstention, roll-off, and spoiled ballots, there are important differences both conceptually and empirically. Most significantly, among the different types of nonvotes, casting a NOTA vote is the most costly as it requires voters to register, turn out, and successfully complete their ballots. Moreover, instead of registering an ambiguous protest vote by casting a negative vote or supporting a minor or “protest party,” choosing the NOTA option can provide voters with an unambiguous means to signal dissatisfaction with the status quo. The clearest evidence for this claim comes from our results suggesting that NOTA voting increases when voters have fewer candidates from which to choose and in partisan general election races that attract the most voter interest.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also find evidence suggesting that NOTA voting is consistent with a reaction to low-information elections. With respect to our low-information hypotheses, the results support the arguments that NOTA voting positively correlates with patterns of voter roll-off, that NOTA voting increases in primary races, and that nonpartisan offices tend to attract more NOTA votes. Other findings, particularly those pertaining to nonpartisan voters, are potentially supportive of both perspectives, depending if, for instance, we view nonpartisans as apoliticals or apartisans.</p>
<p>Our study then has made progress in terms of developing our understanding of patterns of NOTA voting. Indeed, because NOTA voting has been proposed in a number of other states, our research may inform policy makers as they weigh the costs and benefits and causes and consequences of allowing their electorates to cast votes for none of the candidates on the ballot.</p>
<p>A particular contribution of our effort has been to provide empirical evidence that in many instances is inconsistent with the claims made by proponents and opponents of NOTA voting. For example, in contrast to the proponents of NOTA voting in Nevada who claimed that the NOTA option would lead to higher levels of voter turnout, we find no evidence of a positive relationship between NOTA voting and voter turnout.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911424286">16</xref></sup> In terms of the arguments made by opponents of California’s NOTA ballot initiative, we find that the option has not fallen out of favor with Nevada voters but instead has increased slightly in use since its implementation. More significant, we find that the presence of the option does not hinder support for minor party candidates.</p>
<p>As we note above, NOTA voting is a form of voting that speaks to the question of voter consent in the democratic process. On one hand, this might seem to be an overstatement. Because the process in Nevada does not require a runoff election in cases where none of the candidates is the top vote getter but instead awards victory to the candidate receiving the most votes, choosing the NOTA option could be construed as either harmless or a “wasted vote.” Review of the legislative debate over the implementation of NOTA voting suggests that this aspect of the law was criticized for neutering the provision but was a necessary compromise to gain passage.</p>
<p>Still, there is room for NOTA voting in the form used in Nevada to have subtle effects on outcomes. In their analysis of the 1976 and 1978 Nevada elections, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911424286">Weinberg, Linderman, and Kawar (1982)</xref> find that candidates who emerge from primaries where there are significant amounts of NOTA voting tend to do poorly in the ensuing general election. Similarly, the consistent and frequent use of the NOTA option by Nevada voters means that most statewide office holders obtain their positions without receiving the support of a majority of votes. Indeed, many state or federal election winners of significance in Nevada take office knowing that more of the state’s voters did not want them in power than did. As a consequence, any claims of a mandate by these winners must necessarily differ from those that election winners may make in the absence of a NOTA option. Of course, this kind of discussion does not sit easily in a political science literature that focuses on more concrete expressions of the electoral connection.</p>

<p>In her analysis of blanc voting in France, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911424286">Zulfikarpasic (2001)</xref> finds evidence consistent with this notion. Specifically, she notes that the characteristics of some blanc voters are distinct from those of abstainers. In urban areas, blanc voters tend to be older, better educated, active in their communities, and more politically engaged. For these voters, the blanc option provides a means to express dissatisfaction with the choices on offer. In contrast, rural voters who cast blanc ballots tend to do so as a type of hidden abstention.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if uninformed voters randomly choose between NOTA and rolling off, then the relationship between the two could be negative.

<p>Attempts to locate appropriate individual-level data proved fruitless. For instance, exit surveys from Nevada elections typically do not include the NOTA option. Moreover, the validity of exit polling in Nevada is unknown because of the popularity of the state’s early voting program that typically results in well over half of all votes being cast prior to Election Day, when exit polling is done. Survey data sources such as the American National Election Survey are problematic as well because of small state samples, which do not yield significant numbers of NOTA voters, even if the option was included in the survey instrument, to allow for meaningful analysis. Moreover, some of our hypotheses relate to office properties, meaning that an appropriate estimator using individual-level data would be conditional logit. While fine in principle, this would require opinion data not just on NOTA voting but on NOTA by office. Our approach here, then, is similar to established practice in aggregate-level studies of ballot roll-off (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1065912911424286">Bowler, Donovan, and Happ 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911424286">Knack and Kropf 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>In 1976 both Democrats and Republicans and in 1996 Republicans used primaries to select their party’s delegates to the national party conventions. For all other years, caucuses were used as Nevada’s presidential selection events. Because Nevada received a second seat in the House of Representatives after the 1980 census, data for House races are for 1976–80 only. Nevada does not require primaries for partisan offices when a candidate is running unopposed. This, however, is not the case for state Supreme Court seats, where candidates who are unopposed must appear on the ballot.</p>

<p>In addition, we also estimated (not reported) a model of minor party voting where the dependent variable was the minor party share of the vote and the percentage voting NOTA was included as a predictor along with the controls included in the other analyses to further assess if NOTA voting was absorbing some of the minor party vote. If this was the case, then the coefficient for the NOTA vote should be negative. Consistent with the bivariate correlation reported above, the coefficient for NOTA voting is positive and significant, suggesting that the two types of voting are related but distinct.</p>
