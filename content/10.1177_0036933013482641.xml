<p>The administration of healthcare necessitates the collection of information for planning, monitoring and management. Administrative databases typically capture clinical information such as patients' demographic characteristics, diagnoses and the codes for procedures performed. In Scotland (with the exception of psychiatric and obstetric cases) patient-specific information detailing admission to Scottish hospitals as in-patients or day-cases has been recorded on the Scottish Morbidity Record 1 (SMR1) form since 1961.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482641">1</xref></sup> These data have been computerised since 1968<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482641">2</xref></sup> and constitute one of the oldest and most complete national health datasets in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0036933013482641">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The need for strabismus re-operation, defined as subsequent strabismus surgery in the same meridian as the original procedure, may indicate an unsatisfactory surgical outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0036933013482641">3</xref></sup> and can serve as a long-term index of the quality of surgical management. Schutte et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0036933013482641">4</xref></sup> estimated that more than half of all re-operations are due to inaccuracy in the measurement of the angle of strabismus, variability in surgical strategy and imprecise surgery. However, there are few reports concerning the long-term rates and nature of strabismus re-operation on a population level. The SMR1 data may provide a potential source of data for this purpose. Previous studies have, however, highlighted the inaccuracies of SMR1 data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482641">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482641"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482641"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482641">8</xref></sup> attributable to the attempted retrospective interpretation of clinical data by non-medical staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0036933013482641">9</xref></sup> One way to assess the accuracy of SMR1 data is through the hospital information system (HISS), an internal hospital database where diagnoses and details of procedures are entered as free text by medical or nursing staff on wards or in theatres, from which the SMR1 system derives its data. Using the corresponding HISS data as a reference, we aimed to evaluate the utility of the Scottish morbidity records in establishing the rates and nature of re-operation at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (RHSC), Glasgow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0036933013482641" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-0036933013482641"><title>Definitions</title>
<p>A SMR1 episode is defined as a single-consultant in-patient episode. For HISS and SMR1 data on surgical patients, not only is a diagnostic coding applied according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD10), but also at least one operative code is accorded for any operation performed according to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures 4th revision (OPCS4), 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0036933013482641">2</xref></sup> The type of strabismus operation is classified according to the OPCS4, into six three-digit categories, each with fourth digit subdivisions according to the muscle operated on. These six categories comprise C31, combined operations on eye muscles; C32, recession of eye muscle; C33, resection of eye muscle; C34, partial division of tendon of eye muscle; C35, other adjustment to eye muscle and C37, other operations on eye muscle. For our analysis, we grouped the operations according to their four-digit OPCS-4 codes (e.g. C310). Some codes overlap in description and were grouped together e.g. C312, ‘bilateral recession of medial recti muscles of eyes' and C321, ‘recession of medial rectus muscle of eye’.</p>
<p>The presumed reason for a subsequent procedure was deduced by comparing an initial procedure with the subsequent one. A subsequent procedure on muscles acting in the same direction was deemed to constitute an under-correction or recurrence, while one in the opposite direction was deemed an overcorrection. A subsequent procedure in a different meridian to the initial procedure was presumed to constitute a pre-existing/secondary or new strabismus problem. A ‘re-operation′ was thus defined as a subsequent strabismus procedure in the same meridian.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0036933013482641" sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title>
<p>Data on strabismus surgery at the RHSC, Glasgow between January 2000 and March 2009 were collected. The data were derived from the HISS and the SMR1 databases and were matched according to the operative procedure(s). Any unmatched or repeated data were excluded. Details included date of birth, gender, type of operation and date of operation. Patients were anonymised according to their hospital health record number. The operations had been carried out by five paediatric ophthalmology consultants and a number of specialist registrars.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were carried out using Minitab® 15.1.0.0 software. The rates of re-operation were quantified using Kaplan–Meier analysis.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0036933013482641" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Based on matched entries between the HISS and SMR1 databases, 1376 procedures on 1274 individuals were recorded between January 2000 and March 2009. The respective OPCS-4 codes ranged from C310 to C339. About 21 unmatched entries were excluded, accounting for 0.02% of all entries.</p>
<p>The median age of the patients at the time of initial surgery was 5.2 years and the median time interval leading up to a second procedure was 19 months (Range: 4.6–98.3 months) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0036933013482641">Figure 1</xref>). The commonest procedures were bilateral medial rectus recessions (59.5%), bilateral lateral rectus recessions (14.5%), medial rectus recessions combined with lateral rectus resections (8.7%) and inferior oblique weakening procedures (8.2%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0036933013482641">Table 1</xref>). Of the 1376 procedures, 1274 were initial procedures. The remaining 102 were subsequent strabismus procedures on 89 individuals; all of these patients underwent either two (<italic>n</italic> = 76) or three (<italic>n</italic> = 13) operations.

<p>The commonest presumed reason for a subsequent procedure was under-correction or recurrence (44.1%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0036933013482641">Table 2</xref>). Of those subsequent procedures due to presumed pre-existing/secondary or new strabismus problems (results not shown), the commonest scenario, accounting for 29.2% of cases in this category, was an inferior oblique weakening procedure for inferior oblique overaction following medial rectus recession. Using Kaplan–Meier analysis, the cumulative probability of undergoing a re-operation (a subsequent procedure in the same meridian) was 7.6% after 9 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.4–9.9%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0036933013482641">Figure 2</xref>).

<p>In his editorial, Repka<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0036933013482641">10</xref></sup> identified a lack of reliable evidence for the long-term treatment benefit of strabismus surgery despite it being the most commonly performed ophthalmic procedure in children. The main reasons cited were the lack of prospective studies, which are expensive to perform and the limitations of retrospective data, which limit the validity and generalisability of such data. A potential approach to address these issues is to perform a retrospective population‐based study, such as through the use of administrative databases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0036933013482641">11</xref></sup> Data from these databases are readily available, inexpensive to obtain and usually computerised. Many such datasets are population-based, allowing any derived data to be generalised. As the data are usually recorded independently, the issues of non-response and selection biases are minimised.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0036933013482641">12</xref></sup> Despite the limitations of the data captured, these databases offer a cost-effective and efficient means of studying diseases, especially those with a low prevalence or with rare outcomes. The SMR1, an administrative episode-based record, represents a unique avenue for hospital-based and population data due to the widespread coverage of the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0036933013482641">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the compilation of SMR1 data is often delegated to clerical staff unsupervised by clinicians, which can call into question the accuracy of the dataset. Although we excluded only 0.02% of cases according to the operative procedures in our analysis, the exact diagnoses for the conditions undergoing surgical correction, coded according to the ICD and the fourth digit subdivision in the OPCS-4 codes are missing in the majority of cases. This reflects the inaccuracy of coding diagnoses and operative procedures in SMR1 data highlighted by previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0036933013482641">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0036933013482641"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0036933013482641"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0036933013482641">8</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the overall low number of unmatched cases may represent an improvement in the quality of SMR1 data from previous studies due to the Information Services Division (ISD), Scotland performing continuous detailed quality assessments of the SMR1 data using full medical records.</p>
<p>Specific limitations in using the SMR1 database to assess strabismus surgery include not knowing if the re-operations are planned or unplanned due to errors in initial surgery or new problems that have subsequently arisen. The SMR1 database also does not capture important clinical parameters such as pre- and post-operative ocular alignment and binocular visual function.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we have succeeded in obtaining information to set an initial benchmark for assessing the outcome of strabismus surgery at the RHSC. The average time interval and presumed reasons for subsequent surgery as well as the rates of re-operation were determined. Notwithstanding the deficiencies of the dataset, the overall headline figure that 7.4% of children require repeat strabismus surgery within 9 years of follow-up is very helpful in informing the parents in the consent process and in any discussion concerning the complications of the procedure. As most of the subjects in this study had convergent strabismus, this figure is comparable with the 9.8% re-operation rate in convergent strabismus with an average of 9.2 years follow-up obtained by Vereecken and Vereecken,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0036933013482641">14</xref></sup> although it is much lower than the re-operation rates obtained in studies specific for congenital esotropia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0036933013482641">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0036933013482641"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0036933013482641"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0036933013482641">18</xref></sup> which is known to have a high rate of re-operation. In subsequent support of the validity of our analysis, our finding that there was an overall tendency, which was more marked in exotropes, for under-correction or recurrence in cases of subsequent strabismus surgery is in broad agreement with previous studies on post-operative alignment drift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482641">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0036933013482641">20</xref></sup> These studies demonstrated a mean under-correction drift, which was more significant in exotropes regardless of using fixed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0036933013482641">19</xref></sup> or adjustable sutures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0036933013482641">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The use of free text in HISS allows the inclusion of other relevant information in this data system, which can then be used to supplement the information derived from SMR1. With modifications to such routine hospital databases, we will be able to obtain better quality data on strabismus surgery to better inform patients, parents and clinicians.</p>
