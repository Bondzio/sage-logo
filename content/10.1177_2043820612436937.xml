<body>
<p>When I read Kojin’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612436937">Karatani’s (2003)</xref> <italic>Transcritique: On Kant and Marx</italic>, I knew I had stumbled on something special. But it was difficult then (and now) to grasp the text in its entirety – Karatani’s thought is so alive with a variety of themes, it is difficult to ever settle on a single idea. Perhaps that is the point of transcritique: it is mobile and restless, transforming viewpoints as it races along at the speed of ‘X’. The Japanese philosopher should rightly be praised for his originality and accessibility, breathlessly conversing with Kant and Marx. Indeed, I cannot remember taking so many notes for a single work. The focus on consumers as active participants in capitalist circulation – and therefore vital to forging a more just society – was perhaps my most pronounced parallax. So too was seeing Kant, the godfather of Enlightenment thought, in a Marxist uniform.</p>
<p>Joel Wainwright’s interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436937">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>) offers a successful and intriguing set of questions and responses, which both elaborate and extend the issues raised in Karatani’s <italic>Transcritique</italic> and beyond. The interview will be interesting for many geographers, especially given Wainwright’s repeated attempts to elicit the ‘spatiality’ of Karatani’s thought. The loose focus of my response is to engage Karatani’s ‘aporetical challenge’. Karatani’s alternative to the unholy triad of capital-nation-state is called ‘X’. This is the necessary but impossible alternative to the present order of things. The Kantian aporia smacks us in the face – there <italic>is</italic> an alternative, but through a noumenal sleight of hand, it is ungraspable. Addressing this point directly, Wainwright asks:<disp-quote>
<p>I find the conclusion of <italic>Transcritique</italic> to be profoundly aporetical. On one hand, you offer a powerful analysis of the Borromean ring capital-nation-state and the need to transcend it through the creation of practices that support X, which is social life based upon free and reciprocal exchange relations. Yet then it seems like you argue that we cannot achieve X, that X is impossible. And you contend that associations of associations – Marx’s expression for communism – have not yet existed. Thus, could we say that the ultimate antinomy of <italic>Transcritique</italic> is: ‘X must exist; X cannot exist’? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436937">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
How do we respond to this antinomy? The initial response, I would argue, is frustration, and that is perhaps understandable. After a riveting and prolonged investigation into the intricacies and metaphysics of capitalism, Karatani’s response feels inadequate. Perhaps Wainwright’s friend, who suggested that Karatani proposes ‘no real strategy of resistance to capitalism’, is correct. But X is supposedly much <italic>more</italic> than a political alternative, ‘TBA’. We should not simply view X negatively, as the leftover surplus of a ruthless form of economic organization. Rather, X is active. It is an <italic>Idea</italic> that interrupts the world, much like the specter Marx and Engels conjured in their famous <italic>Communist Manifesto</italic>. In Karatani’s words:<disp-quote>
<p>For me communism is a regulative idea and not a constructive idea. This regulative idea, which would never be realized, keeps compelling us to supersede capital-nation-state. This regulative idea is not derived from our wishes, discontent or idealization. It compels us rather against our own will. This will not cease until it is fully realized. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436937">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
There are tentative questions and comments I have in response. First, what is not immediately clear is why X, as a regulative idea, should be equal to communism. If X is an impossible transcendental, on what grounds can we properly call it communism – or indeed anything? Additionally, Karatani argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>Modes of exchange A, B, and C remain persistently … We cannot clear them out. But we need not be pessimistic, because as long as these modes persist, the mode of exchange D will also persist. It will keep coming back no matter how much it is repressed and concealed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612436937">Karatani, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
Does this therefore inevitably entail that X (D) only exists because of modes exchange A, B, and C, and not in spite of them? If so, would this give us a definition of X that was unavoidably negative – with X becoming an outside ‘Other’ unable to speak for itself? Finally, on what grounds can we be sure that X is an alternative that we would welcome?</p>
<p>These questions are not demands for specificity – I am not asking for ‘constructive ideas’ to follow. Instead, I am asking <italic>on what grounds is X even</italic> <italic>possible</italic> – a transcendental question. This would lead directly to the second question, the old Leninist question, of ‘what is to be done?’</p>
<p>The French philosopher Alain Badiou is helpful here, and his resonance with Karatani is immediate. In an essay for the <italic>New Left Review</italic> titled ‘The Communist hypothesis’, Badiou writes that communism is also a Kantian ‘idea’:<disp-quote>
<p>‘Communism’ as such denotes only this very general set of intellectual representations. It is what Kant called an Idea, with a regulatory function, rather than a programme. It is foolish to call such communist principles utopian; in the sense that I have defined them here they are intellectual patterns, always actualized in a different fashion. As a pure Idea of equality, the communist hypothesis has no doubt existed since the beginnings of the state. As soon as mass action opposes state coercion in the name of egalitarian justice, rudiments or fragments of the hypothesis start to appear. Popular revolts – the slaves led by Spartacus, the peasants led by Müntzer – might be identified as practical examples of this ‘communist invariant’. With the French Revolution, the communist hypothesis then inaugurates the epoch of political modernity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612436937">Badiou, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
Badiou gives a generic blueprint of what such an idea is:<disp-quote>
<p>What is the communist hypothesis? In its generic sense, given in its canonic Manifesto, ‘communist’ means, first, that the logic of class – the fundamental subordination of labour to a dominant class, the arrangement that has persisted since Antiquity – is not inevitable; it can be overcome. The communist hypothesis is that a different collective organization is practicable, one that will eliminate the inequality of wealth and even the division of labour. The private appropriation of massive fortunes and their transmission by inheritance will disappear. The existence of a coercive state, separate from civil society, will no longer appear a necessity: a long process of reorganization based on a free association of producers will see it withering away. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612436937">Badiou, 2008</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
The similarities between the two Marxists are perhaps unsurprising. Both passionately rally behind the communist idea. Yet they emerge from different philosophical corners. Karatani’s transcritique shuttles between Marx and Kant. Badiou’s materialist dialectic bounces between Plato and mathematics. The result is a philosophy founded on the disruptive relationship between ‘being’ and ‘event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612436937">Badiou, 2005</xref>), which he later calls a materialist dialectic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612436937">Badiou, 2009</xref>). More precisely, Badiou argues that every world is the finite manifestation of being, and these worlds are unable to express the infinite complexity they are drawn from. This leads to the constant threat of excess in a world. It is this excess, variously called an ‘event’, ‘site’, ‘truth’, or ‘idea’ that is the hallmark of political contingency in Badiou’s writings. Indeed, Badiou’s X is this event – the fleeting interruption of infinity.</p>
<p>To think of X not as an aberration, but as the ontological possibility of any world, helps frame my first question – ‘on what grounds is X possible?’ It also prevents X being read either negatively or theologically. The following question was ‘what is to be done?’ – a question tied to how subjectivity and subjects are deployed. For Badiou, X is a wager. A decision has to be made – is X is worth fighting for? Indeed, Badiou thinks we are only alive when we live for ideas: ‘We must therefore accept that for the materialist dialectic, “to live” and “to live for an Idea” are one and the same thing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612436937">Badiou, 2009</xref>: 510). This militant struggle for ideas encapsulates Badiou’s system of ethics.</p>
<p>I respect Badiou’s stance, but feel it can exclude the everyday banality of being-with others. This is where I think Karatani’s ethical comments shine. Karatani argues that we should treat each other as ends, rather than means. This leads Wainwright to ask ‘Could we say therefore that communism is a metaphysics of dignity? That each person, singular in universality, is above all price and has no equivalent?’, with which Karatani agrees, adding that Kant called such a society a ‘kingdom of ends’. Of course, such a society is only possible with the free association of people, which is to say, communism. This would not happen overnight, however:<disp-quote>
<p>For even when accumulation of capital becomes impossible, capitalism will not end naturally. The state and capital will resort to any means to survive. To counter this, we need the strength to counter the state and capital and we need to prepare a system where we need not rely on the state and capital. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436937">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
For Karatani then, X is not simply the impossibility of thought, but a challenge. It is a wager that another world is possible, and is only possible if we start treating each other as ends. As such, we do not need to grasp X. We need to act <italic>as if</italic> we have grasped X.</p>
<p>I want to now finish by pushing the spatiality of Karatani’s thought. Wainwright’s instinct here is correct – that <italic>Transcritique</italic> was ‘missing’ a spatial component. But I still find Karatani’s response lacking: ‘The concept ‘transcritique’ implies being transcendental and transversal at the same time. It means crossing spatial differences and different exchanges’. I am looking not for a theory about space, or even one coupled to space. I am looking for a spatial ontology. So too, it seems, is Wainwright, who writes:<disp-quote>
<p>I agree with you that a Marxist analysis should examine capital-nation-state as a triadic structure – a Borromean ring, to use your metaphor. Yet, this still raises the analytic question of the relation of the Borromean ring structure to the world … It seems to me that something like the concept of territory is needed here … Taking your analysis of Borromean ring structure, could we define ‘territory’ as the spatial-ontological condition that binds capital-nation-state in the world? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612436937">Karatani and Wainwright, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
It is not that his discussion of world-economy fails logically – but rather it fails to secure an ontological definition of spatiality. In <italic>Decolonizing Development</italic>, Wainwright addresses this: ‘In my view the key trinity is (nation-state)-capital-territory. It is the spatial, especially territorial relations of power that makes particular nation-state-capital couplings possible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612436937">Wainwright, 2008</xref>: 35). I am in agreement with Wainwright here. I would only add it is (nation-state)-capital-territory that constitutes ‘world’, a term undertheorized in geography today. We still have a lot to learn from the likes of Alain Badiou and Martin Heidegger when it comes to this important concept.</p>
