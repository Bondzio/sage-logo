As one of our leading medical politicians, Nigel Watson has ensured a voice for GPs at local and national level as Chief Executive of his Local Medical Committee (LMC), a representative on the General Practitioners Committee (GPC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) and GP advisor to the Centre for Workforce Development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1755738013476282"><title>How did you get to where you are today?</title>
<p>After 3 years as a partner I joined the district GP committee (which later became the LMC) which combined GPs, hospital doctors, public health consultants and health service managers. After 3 years I became Chairman, gaining greater understanding and influence and served for 8 years in total.</p>
<p>I then joined the GPC of the BMA, which discusses all aspects of general practice. One of the major benefits is enhancing your knowledge about many issues that affect all GPs and practices and contributing, using your local knowledge. I also gained a lot from networking. I served on a number of the GPC sub-committees and for the last 5 years as Chairman of the Commissioning and Service Development (CSD) Committee.</p>
<p>As a result of my work I was asked to be a GP advisor to the Centre for Workforce Intelligence. This is a private organisation that advises the Government on workforce planning issues in health and social care as well as other public sector areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1755738013476282"><title>What are the best bits about your role?</title>
<p>I feel very privileged to have three separate but linked roles which I enjoy and are very rewarding in their own right. The roles allow variety, discussion of interesting issues, significant influence, respect and trust from one's colleagues, NHS managers and organisations and the ability to find solutions to problems rather than enter into conflict. I work with some really outstanding people who make effective teams.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1755738013476282"><title>What are the most challenging parts?</title>
<p>Trying to represent very diverse views of GPs and trying to help GPs who find themselves in difficulty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1755738013476282"><title>What is your greatest achievement?</title>
<p>Earning the respect of clinical and managerial colleagues and maintaining that over a prolonged period of time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1755738013476282"><title>What do you do in a typical week?</title>
<p>Monday and Fridays are clinical days. Everything else is fitted into Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. These days are very varied and could involve meeting with diverse groups such as the head of the deanery, a GP in difficulty, community pharmacists and social workers, talking at an LMC education event, and so on. I also have to fit in BMA meetings which with significant levels of associated emails take up about 2-3 days per month. I might also have a meeting with a commissioning board. I receive over 100 emails a day from a variety of sources, of which about 20% need some sort of action.</p>
<p>It is the variety that keeps the role so interesting: lots of people want to meet you, talk to you, ask for your opinion or even believe that your contribution to the work they are doing would make a difference. It is therefore a great honour and privilege and hard to say no.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1755738013476282"><title>What advice would you give a trainee who is contemplating a similar career?</title>
<p>Don't plan too much and get involved. Opportunities are not always predictable; most roles will build in terms of knowledge, experience, reputation and contacts, which often have the effect of opening doors.</p>
<p>In the past medical politics was the preserve of the older male GPs, who took unpaid time out of their practice for the sake of the profession. Things have changed significantly. To get strong leadership for the future we must nurture GPs at an earlier stage in their careers. Therefore LMCs are looking for a better balance of representation, so do not feel you are too young or inexperienced.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1755738013476282"><title>What aspirations do you have?</title>
<p>To continue to work with enthusiasm and energy and lead and contribute to making my practice and LMC the best it can be. My role as Chairman of the CSD Sub-committee has ended, but new opportunities are already surfacing!</p>
