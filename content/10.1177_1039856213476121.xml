<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of the article is to describe the current standards for psychology registration and pathways to training that operate in Australia today, to compare these with international requirements, and to discuss how they relate to the work and training of psychiatrists.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The standards and training for practice in psychology involve multiple pathways that are not straightforward for the public or other health practitioners to understand. Most developed nations other than Australia require higher entry requirements into the profession. New national standards set by the Psychology Board of Australia, such as endorsed areas of practice, will lead to greater consistency in standards and make the task of referring to psychologists with the appropriate competencies more straightforward, allowing for greater collaboration between clinical psychology and psychiatry practitioners.</p>

<title>Psychology in Australia</title>
<p>Since the inclusion of psychologists in the Medicare system, psychiatrists and GPs have been referring patients for psychological treatment in increasing numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213476121">1</xref></sup> However, the task of finding a psychologist with the appropriate competencies to treat their patients with mental illness is not straightforward. Australia has the largest but least trained workforce of psychologists in the developed world.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213476121">2</xref> The Australian per capita ratio of registered psychologists to population of 1:782 is higher than the next two highest ratios of New Zealand (1:1200) and Canada (1:2007 in 2006).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213476121">3</xref></sup> Yet, many psychologists registered in Australia could not practice as psychologists in any other comparative jurisdiction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213476121">2</xref></sup> as Australia permits the registration of psychologists who gain their professional training solely through a supervision rogram.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213476121">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Entry level requirements for registration as a psychologist in Australia consist of a four-year undergraduate program in the scientific discipline of psychology followed by a two-year program of supervised practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213476121">4</xref></sup> This is known as the 4+2 model. Currently there is very little professional training within the undergraduate degree but this is presently under review. Since the implementation of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law (2009), the Psychology Board of Australia (PsyBA) has reviewed the requirements for the program of supervised practice in the light of what is essential for the protection of the public. The requirements are now standardized and more onerous than they were previously, and thus present significant obstacles for people undertaking this pathway. As a result, the standards are again under review. More recently, a 5+1 model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213476121">4</xref></sup> representing increased accredited training has been implemented by some universities. This consists of the same undergraduate degree in the discipline of psychology followed by a year of postgraduate professional training and a year of supervised practice, leading to general registration.</p>
<p>All psychologists in Australia are registered with the PsyBA, but those who undertake a professional two-year masters or three-year doctoral degree, followed by a registrar program of supervision to bring their postgraduate training to a total of four years, are eligible for endorsement by the PsyBA in the area of standardized in which they trained. Clinical psychologists undertake the entirety of their four-year postgraduate training in the assessment, diagnosis, formulation, treatment, outcome measurement and research of mental health problems. It is of interest to compare this training to the undergraduate medical degree, followed by two years of prevocational medical training, plus the five-year Royal Australian and New College of Psychiatrists training program that is required to be completed by psychiatrists. Whereas practitioners in psychiatry train via a paid registrar program of integrated academic learning, research and supervised practice, those in clinical psychology train via a two- or three-year postgraduate accredited degree commencing with academic learning, integrating research and supervised practice, followed by a one- (for doctoral graduates) or two- (for masters graduates) year paid supervised registrar program. A significant challenge facing the psychology profession in Australia is the inadequate Government funding of accredited training places in postgraduate professional psychology programs which leaves universities who offer this training operating at a loss averaging $8,000 per student.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213476121">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The areas of endorsement are: clinical psychology, clinical neuropsychology, forensic psychology, health psychology, educational and developmental psychology, counseling psychology, community psychology, sport and exercise psychology, and organizational psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213476121">5</xref></sup> On its website the PsyBA states that endorsement ‘indicates that a psychologist has additional training in an advanced area of practice’, in addition to the minimum level of psychological training required for general registration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213476121">5</xref></sup> and falls short of specialist recognition. The gaining of endorsement for psychology has enabled health practitioners and the public with some capacity to identify those psychologists with accredited postgraduate specialist training.</p>
<p>However, there have been two serious side-effects from the development of endorsed area of practice. Firstly, in Western Australia, specialist recognition that had been in place for 30 years, based on the exact same standards as current endorsement, has been lost; although those who had previously been registered as specialists are entitled to call themselves ‘specialist’ psychologists until July 2013.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213476121">6</xref></sup> The second issue arose in the grandparenting into endorsement for clinical psychology, the area of practice that incorporates the training and supervision in the assessment, diagnosis, formulation, treatment and evaluation of mental health problems across the lifespan.</p>
<p>To understand the difficulty, it is important to briefly review the recent history of the impact on the profession of psychology of Medicare inclusion. In November 2006, psychologists were included in the Medicare system under a two tier system in which clinical psychology services attracted a higher rebate and were permitted greater flexibility of practice than that for other psychologists. As psychology was state regulated at the time and there was no other national body that differentiated between generalist and clinical psychologists, the Australian Psychological Society (APS) was given Government authority to determine which psychologists met the criteria for classification as a clinical psychologist based on the entry requirements to the College of Clinical Psychologists. These requirements consisted of a masters or doctoral degree in clinical psychology followed by 40 hours of supervision.</p>
<p>However, the APS determined that there were insufficient clinical psychologists in Australia to meet the need. The ‘alternate route’ of entry to the College, established to recognize psychologists who had substantially contributed to clinical psychology, was expanded and a Medicare Assessment Team (MAT) established to review applications for the College from psychologists without accredited postgraduate clinical qualifications. The MAT ‘bridging plans’ recognized continuing professional development as equivalent to accredited postgraduate university training. However, in establishing standards for endorsement, the PsyBA wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>The Board proposes to not recognise individualised non-accredited bridging courses. The Board’s view is these do not provide the sustained education, training and supervision that characterises the integrated experience in a specific postgraduate degree plus supervision program required for endorsement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213476121">7</xref></sup> (p.2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite such concerns, with the advent of endorsement, a substantial number of psychologists who had gained or were working towards gaining entry to the College via the ‘alternate route’ were grandparented into endorsement as clinical psychologists, leaving the public, health practitioners, and employers unable to differentiate those psychologists who have undertaken accredited training in clinical psychology.</p>
<p>These events have cleaved schisms in the profession. Qualified clinical psychologists fought against what they saw as the lowering of standards; those who gained entry to the College via the ‘alternate route’ demanded equality with their qualified peers, and those who were not successful in gaining membership of the College demanded equal status and recognition. It will take some years of implementation of current standards under the National Law (2009/2010)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213476121">8</xref></sup> for the schisms to heal.</p>

<sec id="section4-1039856213476121">
<title>International standards for psychology</title>
<p>No other Western jurisdiction uses an unaccredited supervision pathway to professional registration in psychology. The European Federation of Psychologists Association has developed a European Certificate in Psychology (EuroPsy)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213476121">9</xref></sup> that allows a psychologist to practice across Europe with a three-year undergraduate program in psychology, a two-year professional masters program, and a year of supervised practice. EuroPsy recognizes a number of areas of practice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213476121">10</xref></sup> and specialisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213476121">11</xref></sup> in psychotherapy and organizational psychology, although there are no set standards for these areas.</p>
<p>In New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213476121">12</xref></sup> a three-year undergraduate program followed by a two-year professional masters degree, plus a concurrent diploma for a specific specialized domain of practice that extends for an additional year and includes 1500 hours of supervised practice, is required for registration. The vocational scopes (equivalent to Australian endorsements) of practice are in clinical, counseling, and educational psychology. Professional training in other areas of specialization (‘specialisms’) lead to a general psychologist scope of practice, including areas of, but not limited to, health, child and family, industrial/ organizational, although all use the same title of registered psychologist without the specialism being specified or controlled. Universities are increasingly moving towards a doctoral program in clinical psychology following an honors degree.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213476121">13</xref></sup> does not have generalist registration. Professional doctorates are required for clinical, counseling, and educational psychologist registration; professional masters degrees for forensic, health, occupational and sport and exercise psychologist registration. These programs follow an undergraduate honors program in the discipline of psychology of three or four years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213476121">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both Canada and the USA require a four-year undergraduate honors degree prior to postgraduate training (Hall JE, e-mail communication, 26 August 2012). In the USA, this is not required to have a psychology major, although it is becoming increasingly necessary to do so (Hall JE, e-mail communication, 26 August 2012). To obtain a license to practice as a psychologist in Canada,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213476121">14</xref></sup> a masters (in Alberta) or doctoral degree (all other provinces) is essential. Common specialties or sub-specialties include industrial-organizational psychology, experimental psychology, clinical psychology, counseling psychology, neuropsychology, forensic or correctional psychology, developmental or child psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213476121">15</xref></sup> In the USA only a doctoral degree is accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213476121">16</xref></sup> The doctoral degree in both countries is of four years duration, followed by a full-time internship year, a year of postgraduate supervision, and most frequently a state-based examination for licensure as a psychologist, leading to recognition as a clinical, counseling, school or organizational psychologist (Hall JE, e-mail communication, 13 September 2012). Some states in the USA have registration for a ‘psychology assistant/ associate’ or ‘psychological practitioner’ at the masters level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213476121">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implications for psychiatry</title>
<p>Psychiatrists and psychologists have a long history of working alongside each other in mental health settings. The capacity for clinical psychologists and psychiatrists to work together for the benefit of those seeking help for psychiatric disorders is considerable, particularly given the overlapping and complementary competencies of each profession and the level of training that both undertake. Psychiatry is grounded in the fundamental clinical sciences that underpin medicine, while clinical psychology is grounded in the scientific discipline of psychology. Both professions require training specifically in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders. Psychiatry brings specific expertise in the understanding of the biological basis of disorders, differential diagnosis, especially of organic etiologies, and pharmacological treatments. Clinical psychologists bring specific expertise in the provision of psychological therapies, and also rigorous training in research methods.</p>
<p>Productive collaborative relationships between psychology and psychiatry will depend on the ability of both professions to understand and value the specific expertise of the other. As such, it is vital that psychiatrists understand the different areas of psychology practice, particularly given the plethora of psychology training pathways. While the communality of clinical psychology as outlined above is clear, it is also of value to recognize the particular expertise embedded in other areas of practice endorsement, such as clinical neuropsychology and forensic psychology. The specific competencies of the psychology area of practice endorsements can be found on the website of the Psychology Board of Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213476121">5</xref></sup> More importantly, it is imperative to recognize the postgraduate training requirements for each of these endorsed areas of practice, particularly since so many practitioners who are currently practicing have been grandparented into the scheme.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The psychology profession is beset by a complex series of training pathways leading to various levels of expertise. How does a psychiatrist or other medical practitioner find their way to make an appropriate referral to the psychologist with the most suitable competencies for the person for whom they are caring? In mental health, how can they select a psychologist who has undertaken the rigorous postgraduate mental health training required by the PsyBA?</p>
<p>The only sure option is to turn to professional bodies, such as the Australian Clinical Psychology Association that represents clinical psychologists with accredited postgraduate training in clinical psychology, or other similar bodies representing those with advanced training and expertise in mental health, or in other areas of psychology that may be required.</p>
<p>The capacity to differentiate those clinical, or other, psychologists with advanced accredited professional training is critical for psychiatrists, other mental health professionals, employers and the public. The solution may well lie in the granting of specialist recognition only to those psychologists in each area of psychology who have accredited postgraduate training in their specific areas of current endorsement. This would enable easy recognition and selection of appropriate expertise.</p></sec>
