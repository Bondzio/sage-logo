<body>
<p>In this issue of JPEN a research summary by Carpentier and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112441625">1</xref></sup> highlights a decade’s worth of their carefully conducted research that examines a combination lipid emulsion of middle-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and ω-3 long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). Carpentier and colleagues, from Brussels, are to be recognized for their pivotal applied research using this innovative preparation. One has come to expect high-caliber output from the Carpentier group, as they are the world’s foremost pundits of lipid emulsion therapy. Their work, published in part elsewhere but nicely collated in this issue of <italic>JPEN</italic>, is poised to reach across medical specialties and applications. Their preparation of MCTs and an enriched ω-3 emulsion is a potential pharmaconutrient poised to occupy a place in the armamentarium of nutritionists, intensivists, and transplant specialists.</p>
<p>The Carpentier group had a 2-fold agenda across the investigations that comprise their research summary. First, Carpentier and colleagues conducted an in-depth investigation into the disposition and pharmacological effects of a combination product of MCTs and enriched ω-3. Second, they attempted to determine the safety parameters of a rapid intravenous (IV) bolus dose. The latter point is an important consideration as there is considerable literature to date about the safety of MCTs and ω-3 substrates when infused as part of a continuous or cycled regimen but a paucity of information for this combination when given as a rapid bolus.</p>
<p>The studies within the research summary by Carpentier et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112441625">1</xref></sup> highlight preclinical work by addressing the principal disposition and pharmacological effects of ω-3 fatty acids on the liver, parametrial and epiploic fat, soleus muscle, brain, cardiomyocytes, and the submandibular gland. The last of the preclinical work included a cardiac-focused investigation that honed in on functional changes that included the recovery of cardiac function after ex vivo ischemia. Clinical investigations were conducted in 12 healthy adults receiving a bolus injection with blood collection taken and processed to determine, among other parameters, the reactivity of platelets as part of the overall hematological safety. The data yielded the conclusion that the bolus injection of MCTs and enriched ω-3 product did not cause any untoward effects and was well tolerated; thus, the authors asserted that it was effective for reversing preexisting deficiency of ω-3 fatty acids in healthy adults.</p>
<sec id="section1-0148607112441625">
<title>Infusion Rate–Related Adverse Effects of Lipid Emulsions</title>
<p>This administration technique is a somewhat bold about-face, returning to the decades-old original use of lipid emulsion in patient care. At that time, lipid emulsion was regarded as lacking rate-associated side effects, and the literature demonstrates that many investigations incorporated a methodology whereby patients received 500 mL of 20% lipids over a span as little as 3 hours, which corresponded both to home and in-hospital parenteral nutrition (PN) practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112441625">2</xref></sup> The current rapid administration technique for lipid emulsion described by Carpentier and his group represents a shift from the consensus of the prevailing literature on moderating the rate infusion of IV lipid emulsions below threshold rates to avoid adverse effects. For example, the pulmonary effects of bolus ω-6 infusion on arterial oxygenation are well known, and clinicians are cognizant of selecting patients carefully if only to infuse it rapidly as part of an adult home PN regimen that otherwise comprises a stable and functional patient group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112441625">3</xref></sup> There are usually few compelling reasons to have to administer the dose in this manner, but the expanding applications of lipid emulsion to include toxicity emergencies have changed this. For the longest time, the subtle effects of rapid ω-6 infusion, such as congestion of the reticuloendothelial system, even when administered at appropriate doses, had remained obscured until determined investigators were able to model the data and determine that it would be ill-advised to exceed an infusion rate of 50 mg/kg/h,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112441625">4</xref></sup> which is generally the rate promulgated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112441625">5</xref></sup> At a rate beyond 110 mg/kg/h, Venus et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112441625">3</xref></sup> reported the potential for marginal arterial oxygenation, which poses a problem in the population of patients with pulmonary compromise or lung disease.</p>
<p>Given the above-mentioned toxicity scenarios, the adverse effect profile of lipid emulsion at high infusion rates draws practitioners into revisiting the risk vs benefit ratio of bolusing lipids as a onetime-only infusion in emergent settings. Using similar thinking about the subtle effects lipid emulsion exerts on the reticuloendothelial system, it would be of similar benefit to practitioners to know the pulmonary profile of the novel combination of MCTs and enriched ω-3 in the exact proportions of 80% MCTs and 20% fish oil used by Carpentier et al. This track of inquiry was pursued using a comparable product by Sabater et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112441625">6</xref></sup> who infused an emulsion of 50% MCTs, 40% LCTs, and 10% fish oil in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and determined there were no hemodynamic or gas exchange parameter changes. Although the proportions of the components are slightly different, these results would appear to bode well for Carpentier’s combined 80% MCT and 20% fish oil product. However, prior data from Carpentier’s group showed that ω-3 in combination with MCTs and LCTs tended to slow clearance from the circulation by the liver, making more lipids available to extrahepatic tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112441625">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112441625">8</xref></sup> Lekka and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112441625">9</xref></sup> raised the question about clearance from circulation in their investigation, which resulted with the observation of aggravation of lung inflammation and deterioration of pulmonary function in populations with preexisting lung injury. Lekka et al reported this occurring with combined MCTs and ω-6 rapid infusion at 210 mg/kg/h and questioned if the untoward effects may have in part been related to the clearance from circulation in addition to the quality of the lipids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112441625">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given a body of research, it needs to be pointed out that MCTs have an emerging profile of not only being solely a fuel substrate but also having an immune profile whereby leukocytes can be activated by MCTs in healthy adults in a dose-dependent manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112441625">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112441625"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112441625">12</xref></sup> Neutrophils, in addition to alveolar macrophages, release leukotriene B4, which may play a crucial role in the development of ARDS after initial cell injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112441625">13</xref></sup> As such, the pulmonary effects profile of combined MCTs and ω-3, with a higher proportion of MCTs, needs be delineated to clarify if patients with preexisting lung injury are good candidates to receive 80% MCTs combined with 20% fish oil.</p>

<title>Refining Rapid Administration of Lipids: MCTs With LCTs in Rescue Situations—Value Added?</title>
<p>In 2006, Rosenblatt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112441625">14</xref></sup> reported the first case of adjunct management of bupivacaine overdose using a 20% LCT emulsion as a snare and/or reservoir that served to impede the drug from binding to receptors. Although successful outcomes in emergent settings have been reported with this technique, the removal mechanism of the bound complex remains to be clearly understood. There is an expressed need for the evolution and understanding of lipid emulsions for use in overdose and toxicity scenarios, which the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112441625">15</xref></sup> mentions in its guidelines. It may be revealed that novel combinations and proportions in lipid emulsions such as the enriched ω-3 product as investigated by Carpentier et al may meet this need.</p>
<p>The context for the application of emergent lipid rescue arose from interventionalists administering nerve blocks with long-acting local anesthetics. During landmarking, an inadvertent transection of the blood vessels by the needle can result in intravascular delivery of local anesthetic; this poses considerable risk of cardiac and central nervous system toxicity. The lipophilic properties of these agents lend themselves to sequestration by lipid emulsion, particularly for the agents bupivacaine, levobupivacaine, and ropivicaine. There have been a plethora of case reports recommending that a lipid emulsion product should be on hand in the procedure suite, and currently this is a class IIA recommendation by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112441625">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, 2 groups of investigators explored the use of an MCT vs LCT emulsion for this purpose in animals; they concluded that conventional LCTs performed adequately for rescue, with a slight value conferred by the addition of MCTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112441625">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112441625">17</xref></sup> However, an enriched ω-3 emulsion may have theoretical merit in overdoses given its slower intravascular clearance; it may be of particular benefit for extensive systemic delivery/overdose of amide anesthetic in which there is a risk of recurrent toxicity after initial lipid administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112441625">18</xref></sup> Nonetheless, progress in developing a recommendation for an enriched ω-3 emulsion will be slow, as synthesis of the literature in this field is challenging given that the research consists primarily of case reports in humans and studies of animal populations.</p>
<sec id="section3-0148607112441625">
<title>New Horizons: Dampening of Systemic Inflammation Postcardiac Procedures</title>
<p>A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112441625">19</xref></sup> looking at lipid emulsion’s effect on inflammatory markers post–cardiac surgery has shown benefit for a comparable novel MCT and enriched ω-3 emulsion as used by Carpentier et al. Larsen and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112441625">19</xref></sup> studied infants who were infused continuously in the perioperative period with an MCT and enriched ω-3 emulsion. The infants displayed a trend of lower concentrations of inflammatory markers. This work has expanded the conceptual benefit of using MCTs in combination with LCTs in pediatric surgery. This had been originally been put forth by Fiaccodori et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112441625">20</xref></sup> with a view to reducing the load of LCTs. In a comparison trial by Fiaccodori et al, the combination of MCTs and conventional LCTs was found not to exert any negative cardiopulmonary effects, unlike conventional LCT doses.</p>
<p>The combination of MCTs and enriched ω-3 emulsion represents a potent combination that should be further investigated in adults undergoing cardiac procedures. The data generated in pediatric groups need to be researched and extended to adult populations because the current therapeutic armamentarium and supporting evidence for adults is mixed and available for only steroids, tranexamic acid, and aprotinin. However, the side effects limit the use of the former, and the safety profiles of tranexamic acid and aprotinin limit their use (aprotinin has been removed from the U.S. market).</p>
<p>A related track of cardiac research was pursued by the Carpentier group,1 whereby they examined the application of MCTs and enriched ω-3 in rats with cardiac ischemia. They developed a model to explore the effect of a single IV injection of the lipid preparation on the recovery of cardiac function. Results of the study conducted in rats revealed an improvement in cardiac function over the first 20 minutes of reperfusion after a bolus of the emulsion. This work needs to be expanded on in a human model.</p>

<title>Revisiting of a Forgotten Prospect: Liver Graft Survival After Transplant</title>
<p>Rejection of a liver graft occurs commonly in patients, usually in the first 2 weeks after transplantation; in addition, there may be a high rate of general decline of the graft associated with this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112441625">21</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that deterioration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis in the graft and/or high plasma endotoxin levels are contributors to the decline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112441625">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112441625">23</xref></sup> In addition, research conducted in rats undergoing liver transplant explored using intraoperative lipid emulsion as an adjunctive therapy to increase the survival of the grafts in animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112441625">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112441625">25</xref></sup> In animal model research not specific to the transplant setting, Carpentier and his group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112441625">26</xref></sup> investigated the effects of a bolus IV lipid emulsion on partially reversing liver steatosis. This maneuver has utility for transplantation in that steatotic graft livers fare very poorly in the posttransplant period and may very well have to be subsequently removed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112441625">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112441625">28</xref></sup> ω-3-enriched lipid emulsion holds the potential to change the local triglyceride milieu of a steatotic liver and improve outcomes.</p>
<p>In the animal studies, the underlying mechanism responsible for favorable outcomes involving LCT emulsion was thought to be 2-fold and consisted of lowering plasma endotoxin levels, likely by a binding action, as well as recovery of ATP synthesis by the graft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112441625">24</xref></sup> In a study by Ma et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112441625">25</xref></sup> which compared LCTs vs MCTs + LCTs vs a structured triglyceride preparation of LCTs + MCTs, the latter proved to afford the least amount of subsequent hepatic abnormalities. It is asserted here that the Carpentier’s group novel combination of MCTs and enriched ω-3 emulsion used in their model is strategically positioned for study in human liver transplantation by virtue of improved intracellular energetics of the graft and possibly less circulating endotoxin, which in combination may very well produce similar outcomes as the structured triglyceride preparation.</p>
<p>The added benefit of the ω-3 LCT source would be to overcome poor tolerance of a failing graft to the proinflammatory mediators associated with ω-6 fatty acids should the patient already be receiving PN. The empirical literature affords a case report of deleterious tolerance to conventional LCT in a patient receiving PN while undergoing rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112441625">29</xref></sup> This patient went on to experience acute lung injury. In this scenario, a more tolerable lipid emulsion with the more favorable immune profile of ω-3 lipids could yield survival gains when used adjunctively with immunosuppression regimes, even in patients not requiring PN. This area of transplantation merits revisiting with investigation of the latest combination lipid emulsions in humans such as the product that Carpentier and his group are mainstreaming.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Until a few years ago, mention of IV lipid emulsion would rarely if ever be seen in nonnutrition/gastroenterology and non–critical care journals; indeed, one thinks back to such rare occurrences as when the Messing group from France published their data on lipid emulsion and PN-induced liver disease in the <italic>Annals of Internal Medicine</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0148607112441625">30</xref></sup> Today, the broadening application of existing and novel lipid emulsions has contributed to a cornucopia of papers in diverse publications with an equally diverse readership.</p>
<p>Currently, the state of safety data in the nutrition literature surrounding the rapid IV bolus technique could be considered robust on many fronts. As previously noted, some missing pieces on the use of MCTs combined with enriched ω-3 emulsion and potential for pulmonary effects would complete the safety profile. Once addressed in depth, it would complete the safety profile of this emulsion, insofar as knowing whether all-comer patients are candidates for lipid emulsion by IV bolus. After that, the road is paved to several applications—drug toxicity and dampening of inflammation by lipid emulsion are just some of the areas of current focus. Liver transplantation is another area meriting reconsideration with intraoperative use of lipid. With these advancements on the horizon, one anticipates the upcoming and mainstreaming works on lipid emulsion by the Carpentier group.</p>
