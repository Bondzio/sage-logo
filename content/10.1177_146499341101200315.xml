<p>Both the editors of this latest volume in the Claiming Citizenship series have a keen interest and background in participatory governance and civil society and therefore, their insights into attempts at engaged citizenship in this unprecedented age are valuable. They provide their own analysis of the situation while framing experiences from countries including the Gambia, South Africa and India provided by other authors. This mercifully readable tome is of use to anyone wishing to access a wide range of case studies from the South about local citizen struggles with globalization and inclusion, and delivers what it promises in terms of a more thorough exploration of global and international links (p. xi) for securing inclusive global citizenship.</p>
<p>In their examination of this minefield, Gaventa and Tandon seek equilibrium between faith in the existence of citizen participation opportunities in an increasingly globalized world and cynicism about global forces arrayed against the victimized poor. And so it is that persons from every developing nation on the planet strive on a daily basis to circumvent the seemingly endless local and global structures that stand between them and full citizenship rights or perhaps even try to use said global structures to enforce previously elusive rights. These citizens suppress thoughts of North–South communication being ‘contrived’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-146499341101200315">Best, 2001</xref>: 11–12). However, as we read the case studies in the volume, it is no surprise to ‘discover’ that many of the powerful international government and private entities encountered still appear to have, ‘little or no downwards accountability to the people affected [by their policies and actions]’ (p. 6). This may be intentional or unintentional. Indeed, the editors suggest that global actors have trouble functioning at the local level just as local actors have challenges reaching through the many global layers. They suggest that for citizens to reach successfully through these layers, mobilization, mediation and knowledge are the three make-or-break skills (p. 25).</p>
<p>Problematic case studies presented highlight that uniform global policies land in specific cultural, labour and knowledge contexts: In the Gambia, Global Fund efforts collided with local politics and may have sparked the President’s curious alternative HIV/AIDS treatments; in South Africa, organizations such as <italic>Médecins Sans Frontières</italic> continually encounter hinterlands resistance to their modern biomedical practices; in India, Julie Thekkudan sees Project Shakti’s attempts to empower women through local projects funded by multilateral corporations as creating ‘vulnerable sales girls’ rather than the desired tigresses (p. 92). The attempts of the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology (IAASTD) to reconcile global and local knowledge are still at the lessons learned stage, when one would really hope that by this point in 2011 things would have moved a bit beyond that. Further, in Mehta and Napier-Moore’s discussion on displaced persons, aspersions are cast on the ability of the nation-state to deal with the problem of persons stuck between jurisdictions. The authors are forced to acknowledge that global citizenship and upholding of rights through global governance are still merely normative dreams that have not become a reality.</p>
<p>More forward-looking studies, such as Icaza, Newell and Saguier’s, examine citizenship and trade governance, but still conclude that citizens and social movements need to work on a type of citizenship that promotes the definition of fairer and more feasible types of globalization (p. 180). This is essentially the call to action that says that even if neoliberalism has triumphed, voices can still be raised for reform. This is hardly a victory lap for global citizenship rights in the new millennium.</p>
<p>Going forward, an interesting and meaty issue raised that could actually be the subject of a separate volume is that of the changing role of the developing country state. Although this volume is focusing on things from a citizen perspective, it would be useful from the viewpoints raised to see how pressured nation-state governments in the developing world are navigating what the authors see as the heightened complexity of types and levels of authority in international fora (p. 7). It must be remembered that while citizens are grappling with this international environment and the chance to express themselves globally, perhaps in the hope of finding a more effective voice than was previously their lot locally, developing country governments are also world ‘citizens’ that must function in this multi-layered international community where they may be competing against local and international non-governmental entities in a shared resource pool. In light of these considerations, the editors’ assertion that nation states must be mindful of their citizens’ needs and rights while juggling the often conflicting demands of global entities and mediating the global and local to serve the interests of their local citizens (p. 8) is critical and merits further consideration in a citizen rights context. Let us hope that volume 8 or 9 of this series will give additional thought to this thorny issue.</p>
