<p>To meet the constantly changing demands of modern work settings, organizations frequently must train operators. For example, a physician may require training on the implant procedure of a new pacemaker, a newly hired employee in a multinational corporation must receive training about the product development process, and a firefighter needs to know how to respond to a novel, high-stress situation. In this Research Digest, I address techniques that organizations can employ to effectively train their workforces.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804611434710">Rosen, Salas, Pavlas, Jensen, Fu, and Lampton (2010)</xref> discussed how demonstration-based training can be employed to maximize skill acquisition and subsequent performance. This technique involves demonstrations of task performance using appropriate instructional features that would help trainees acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes required for the task. Below are some of the types of instructional features the authors describe that can be employed to prepare trainees to exhibit superior performance in complex work environments:</p>
<list id="list1-1064804611434710" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Passive guidance</italic>: Information that supplements the demonstration, such as instructional narratives and behavior summaries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Preparatory activities</italic>: Tasks that are performed prior to viewing the demonstration, such as goal-setting and self-efficacy exercises.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Concurrent activities</italic>: Tasks that are performed while viewing the demonstration, such as note-taking and perspective-taking exercises.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Retrospective activities</italic>: Tasks that are performed after viewing the demonstration, such as mental rehearsal and guided discussion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Prospective activities</italic>: Tasks that are performed after viewing the demonstration that focus on transferring the learned skills to novel situations, such as learner-generated practice scenarios and setting goals on how the training content can be applied to the learner’s job.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another training technique that can be adopted to enhance performance - especially in safety-critical domains - is simulator-based stress training. This technique has been shown to improve pilot performance in a stressful real-world flying task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804611434710">McClernon, McCauley, O’Connor, &amp; Warm, 2011</xref>). Stress training involves three phases: teaching the necessary skills until a desired proficiency level is attained, teaching stress-coping mechanisms in isolation from the training task, and practicing the task in the presence of the stressor.</p>
<p>Although the aforementioned techniques can be used to enhance individual performance, modern work environments seldom involve individuals performing tasks in isolation. Health care, military, aviation, and corporate settings - to name just a few - require individuals with different skills and expertise levels to collaborate to accomplish various tasks.</p>
<p>For example, during a defibrillator implantation, an electrophysiologist is assisted by nurses, a technician, and a device industry representative - all of whom have distinct roles to perform before, during, and after the implant procedure. Similarly, business environments require employees representing different functions (e.g., software, firmware, marketing, human factors) to work together to make critical decisions and execute them for a project. Therefore, it is important not only that teams comprise individuals who are highly skilled but also that these individuals are able to work together effectively. Further, these teams must be able to exhibit superior performance in both routine tasks and novel situations. This is especially important for teams that work in environments that involve a high degree of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Perturbation training is a technique that can help teams adapt to novel situations. Perturbation training is based on the premise that performance in new, unexpected situations can be improved by varying practice conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804611434710">Gorman, Cooke, &amp; Amazeen, 2010</xref>). It provides teams with a variety of task situations in which they are forced to interact and coordinate in new ways, which helps them develop flexible interaction processes that are needed to respond to novel events.</p>
<p>Critical thinking training is another method that can help teams adapt to novel scenarios. Using a military command and control task, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804611434710">Helsdingen, van den Bosch, van Gog, and van Merri‘nboer (2010)</xref> showed that critical thinking training benefited complex decision making in novel tasks by focusing on strategies such as story building, self-explanation, and reflection. By having trainees reflect on their decision-making process, acknowledge incorrect assessments, and take corrective actions, this training technique helped improve decision outcomes in untrained situations compared with traditional scenario-based training.</p>
<p>In summary, the training techniques discussed here can be employed by organizations to train a highly skilled workforce to ensure they are competent to work effectively in routine as well as highly dynamic, high-stake situations, both at the individual level and at the team level.</p>
