<p>Fluid within the uterine cavity provides the microenvironment for preimplantation blastocyst development and early implantation. Analysis of uterine fluid sampled by aspiration or lavage provides a view of this microenvironment but the similarity or otherwise of the sample components is not known. This study compared proteins in aspirates versus lavage samples taken sequentially from the same women, using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS), multiplex cytokine assays, and an activity assay for proprotein convertase 6. Both lavage and aspiration enabled analysis of uterine fluid components, but they provided substantially different protein profiles. Although there were many similarities in overall protein profiles and most specific proteins examined were detected in both fluids, these were neither qualitatively nor quantitatively comparable within each participant. A likely explanation is that lavage samples the entire uterine cavity including washing the endometrial surface (glycocalyx), whereas aspiration sampling is very local.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A small amount of a complex biological fluid is present within the uterine cavity. It contains proteins, sugars, and lipid factors secreted from the endometrial glands and luminal epithelium, along with others transudated from serum or translocated from tubal secretions, from the peritoneal cavity or the ovarian surface. Recent advances in proteomic, glycomic, lipidomic, and other analyses now enable assessment of biologically active mediators at very low concentrations. It is thus feasible to analyze previously unknown components of human uterine fluid and their relationship to cycle phase, fertility and infertility, uterine cancer, and endometriosis. The timely minimally invasive sampling of uterine fluid presents many advantages over the much more invasive endometrial biopsy. The samples obtained could be analyzed and used to inform uterine physiology or applied to detect receptive endometrium or aid in diagnosis of endometrial disorders.</p>
<p>While analyses of both uterine lavage fluid (collected by slow infusion of 2-5 mL of saline into the uterine cavity and its withdrawal) or aspirate (5-10 µL, generally collected through an embryo transfer catheter) have been published,<sup>

</sup> it is not known whether these provide equivalent data or whether the protein cohort or relative concentrations are different with the 2 sampling techniques. It could be anticipated that the glycocalyx (consisting of highly glysocosylated mucins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112443879">10</xref>
</sup>) or other cell surface-binding molecules, including heparin sulfate proteoglycans ([HSPGs]; such as syndecan)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112443879">11</xref>
</sup>on the endometrial surface, may entrap or loosely bind certain secreted proteins, cleaved proteins, soluble receptors, or other bioactive molecules. These may be retrieved by lavage but not by simple aspiration. Lavage also samples the entire uterine cavity while aspirates provide a fingerprint of the fluid composition specifically at the site of sampling.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to compare protein profiles of aspirate and uterine lavage, taken sequentially from the same women. While it was acknowledged that a proportion of each soluble protein would be removed in the aspirate and hence reduced in concentration in the subsequent lavage sample, we anticipated that their relative concentrations in both aspirate and lavage from a single woman would be similar, unless lavage sampled both soluble and “trapped” proteins. In the latter case, there would be disparity between the 2 sampling techniques. This information would be of considerable value to others considering sampling the uterine cavity and may also provide a clue as to whether any analyte is fully soluble within uterine fluid or whether it is contained primarily within the glycocalyx.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Sample collection was approved by the Human Ethics Committees at Monash Surgical Private Hospital and at Southern Health and informed consent was obtained from all women.</p>
<p>Importantly, since comparisons were to be made within each participant, the women were not specifically selected according to their clinical characteristics. They thus presented with a range of disorders (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112443879">Table 1</xref>). An aspirate (∼5-10 µL) was first obtained from each woman (n = 16) using an embryo transfer catheter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112443879">2</xref>
</sup> The outside of the catheter containing the sample was wiped to remove any cervical mucus, the tip was cutoff, dropped into an Eppendorf tube, and snap frozen. Immediately following the aspiration, uterine lavage was performed by infusion of 5 mL of sterile saline into the uterine cavity through a fine flexible catheter<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112443879">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443879">12</xref>
</sup>: this was then aspirated, centrifuged at 900<italic>g</italic> to remove cellular debris, and aliquots were snap frozen.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443879">12</xref>
</sup> Samples were stored at −80<sup>°</sup>C until use. Immediately prior to assay, the aspirates were solubilized in 90 µL of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged to remove any debris (12 000<italic>g</italic>) for 5 minutes. Four-fold concentration of lavage was performed using Microsep UF spin filter columns (3 kDa molecular weight cutoff; PALL Life Sciences, New York) as previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112443879">13</xref>
</sup> Three pairs of aspirate and lavage fluid were analyzed for total protein content (Bradford Assay kit; Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) to guide subsequent dilution of aspirate. Since the aspirates were very small, it was not possible to use the same pairs of samples for all analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112443879">Table 1</xref>). For all analyses, comparisons were made within each participant.</p>

<title>SELDI-TOF-MS</title>
<p>surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) is a powerful tool to compare overall protein profiles of aspirate and lavage samples. Aliquots of paired uterine aspirate and lavage from 3 women were bound to Q10 (strong anion exchange) or CM10 (weak cation exchange) ProteinChip Arrays (BioRad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample was then overlaid twice with 1 µL of saturated sinapinic acid matrix in 50% acetonitrile 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), with the spot allowed to air-dry completely between applications. Protein arrays were analyzed using a ProteinChip Reader Series 4000 Personal Edition (BioRad) in positive ion mode. Spectra were acquired in the range 1500 to 25 000 Da using an average of 2150 laser shots with a laser intensity of 1800 nJ and a sampling rate of 800 MHz. External calibration of the ProteinChip Reader was performed using the all-in protein/peptide standard (Biorad). SELDI TOF mass spectra were analyzed using Ciphergen Express Client version 3.0.6 software. Baseline subtraction and normalization on total ion current were performed for all spectra within a single experiment prior to comparative analyses.</p>

<title>Multiplex Analysis</title>
<p>A range of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors have previously been demonstrated in both uterine aspirate<sup>

</sup> Here, 8 such factors (GCSF, GMCSF, FGF2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VEGFA, IL1β, and CXCL8) were assayed simultaneously in paired aspirates and lavage fluid (n = 10 women) using a quantitative Milliplex Luminex (MilliPlex MAP Human Cytokine Panel 8-plex, Millipore, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lavage samples were concentrated 4-fold prior to assay and aspirate samples diluted 10-fold (as described above). All samples were assayed in duplicate on the same plate. The lower detection limit was 3.2 pg/mL for all analytes. Data were analyzed using a BioPlex 200 instrument equipped with BioManager analysis software (BioRad). Test runs were performed on test samples, before analyses of the full set of samples, to optimize sample dilution such that each factor was analyzed within the functional range of its standard curve. Within each woman and each sampling technique, the relative concentrations of each factor were assigned a rank order, with the most abundant analyte scoring 10 and the least abundant scoring 1. The data were then plotted in pairs (aspirate and lavage): if rank orders were similar, the paired histograms would have the same value.</p>

<title>Proprotein Convertase 6 Assay</title>
<p>Ten pairs of samples were assayed for proprotein convertase 6 (PC6) activity by a fluorescence assay as previously described with minimal modifications. The assay is based on the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate pERTKR-AMC (Bachem, Torrance, California).<sup>

</sup> Purified active recombinant human PC6 (1-5 U; Pheno-Switch BioSciences Inc, Quebec, Canada) or appropriately diluted sample was incubated at 37°C with the peptide substrate (final concentration 100 μmol/L) in saline in half the area of 96-well plates (total volume 50 μL), and the real-time kinetic progression of substrate hydrolysis (release of fluorescent AMC) was monitored every 3.5 minutes at excitation/emission of 355/460 nm (Wallac, Victor 2 spectrophotometer; PerkinElmer, Massachusetts). Test samples of both lavage fluid and aspirate were initially analyzed to ensure dilutions that would provide parallelism with the standard. To determine PC activity in uterine fluid, 49 µL of neat lavage or diluted aspirate were incubated with 1 μL peptide substrate as for the purified PC6 and substrate hydrolysis was monitored. The aspirates (diluted for cytokine analysis) were further diluted 1:9 with Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium/F12 to provide equivalent activities. To compare PC6 activity among samples, the rate of substrate hydrolysis (AMC increase/min) was calculated from the linear phase of each kinetic progression curve and used as the activity unit.</p>

<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>The characteristics of the participants and the analyses applied to each pair of samples are detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112443879">Table 1</xref>. The clinical characteristics were not a factor in this study which was designed for comparisons to be made within each woman. To remove any bias, the patients were not specifically selected but were taken by the same clinician as they reported within a single clinic. The most common disorder was endometriosis and the most common phase of the cycle was early secretory. Most of the aspirates contained blood and in 2 cases, this was sufficient to interfere in the enzyme assays.</p>
<p>Protein concentration was measured in 3 pairs of samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1933719112443879">Table 1</xref>). It was 34.4, 27.9, and 20.9 µg/aspirate and 209, 317 and 430 µg/lavage, respectively. The latter amounts are consistent with those measured previously in similar samples<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443879">12</xref>
</sup> and demonstrate that approximately 10-fold more protein is retrieved from the uterine cavity by lavage than by aspiration.</p>

<title>SELDI-TOF-MS Analysis</title>
<p>To determine if the paired samples did indeed show any gross difference before proceeding with cytokine/chemokine and PC6 analysis, SELDI-TOF-MS was used. A qualitative one-dimensional survey of the paired aspirate and uterine lavage samples was performed using standard strong anion exchange (Q10) and weak cation exchange (CM10) arrays. While SELDI-TOF-MS does not provide identities of the proteins, it was clear that some major protein peaks were common to all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">Figure 1A</xref>), although differences in protein concentration are apparent based upon differing signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">D</xref>). Similarities were observed when a wider mass range of proteins with an m/z of 1500 to 20 000 were visualized, with a representative spectrum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>

<p>However, when narrower ranges of proteins were examined from an m/z of approximately 3500 to 8000 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112443879">D</xref>), heterogeneity was seen. There was a limited conformity between aspirate and uterine lavage from the same woman, as well as between women. These data show that that the protein fingerprints of uterine flushing and aspirates from each woman are considerably different. Many of these proteins are likely to be abundant serum proteins, as previously identified in lavage samples.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443879">12</xref>
</sup> However, a much more comprehensive analysis would be required to substantiate this and was not one of our aims. Indeed, defined clinical cohorts were not specifically selected as would be appropriate for a study designed to seek identities.</p>

One factor, IL1 β, which was detected previously in aspirates at concentrations of 3 to 14 pg/mg protein<sup>

Of all the analytes, only 1 (CXCL10: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112443879">Figure 2G</xref>) was detected in every sample; other factors were below the level of detection in some lavage samples, suggesting that they may have been considerably depleted by the preceding aspiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112443879">Figure 2</xref>). Most importantly, the rank order of concentration for each analyte but GM-CSF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112443879">Figure 2D</xref>) was different and without correlation in aspirate and lavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1933719112443879">Figure 2</xref>), demonstrating that sampling by one method does not generally provide the same rank order result as sampling by the other method.</p>

Activities ranged from 0 to 5016 activity units. Two of the aspirate samples had no detectable PC6 activity, although activity was present in their lavage partners. Two lavage samples had particularly high levels of PC6 activity while the related aspirates had relatively low activities. No significant correlation was found on analysis of the data. Thus, it is clear that as seen for the multiplex data, there is little correlation between the relative activities of PC6 in aspirates and those in lavage samples.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Uterine fluid is a valuable biological fluid for analysis and can be obtained by relatively noninvasive means. Both uterine lavage and aspiration from the uterine cavity have recently been analyzed by multiplex and proteomics techniques.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112443879">1</xref>

</sup> These identified a very wide range of proteins including cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and antiproteases, along with transudated serum proteins and many proteins with currently unknown actions. However, it has not been known whether the 2 sampling techniques provide the same or different protein cohorts or whether the relative concentrations of analytes are comparable. The major outcome from this study is the demonstration that while both lavage and aspirate are satisfactory sampling techniques enabling subsequent analysis of uterine fluid components, they are not interchangeable since they provide substantially different protein profiles. This has been confirmed using 3 different assay techniques. Thus, it is important that for meaningful comparative analyses, consistency in sampling technique is maintained across all participants. This will be important in subsequent development of diagnostic tests based on one or more components of uterine fluid.</p>
<p>The uterine luminal and glandular epithelial apical surfaces, like other mucosal surfaces, have a substantial glycocalyx comprising mucins<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112443879">10</xref>
</sup> and other heavily glycosylated proteins such as HSPGs. Indeed, the HSPG syndecan 1 has been clearly demonstrated in a thick layer at the apical surface of endometrial epithelial cells, particularly in the mid-secretory phase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112443879">11</xref>
</sup> The HSPGs have a strong binding capacity for both soluble ligands (such as interleukin 8 and fibroblast-like growth factors) and insoluble ligands (such as fibronectin and laminin). The major functions of these HSPGs are in storing and stabilizing chemokines and growth factors and subsequently presenting them in more active configurations to their receptors thus regulating their activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112443879">17</xref>
</sup> The mucin MUC1 can exist as both cell surface and soluble components of endometrial epithelium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112443879">18</xref>
</sup> Both Muc5B and MUC 16 have been detected in uterine cavity aspirate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112443879">3</xref>
</sup> suggesting that these also exist not only within the glycocalyx but also in soluble forms. This is consistent with the highly glycosylated glandular secretions immunostained both in the pregnant and in late secretory phase nonpregnant endometrium.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112443879">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112443879">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, many surface-bound factors can also be cleaved into soluble forms by specific proteases. PC6, itself a protease can that can perform such actions, exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms and as shown here, its bioactivity is detected both in aspirates and in lavage although there was little relationship in relative activities between the Importantly, PC6 activity was at very low levels in many aspirates and at elevated levels in 2 of the lavage samples, suggesting that the soluble active form can be washed from the glycocalyx. The presence of soluble mucins in aspirates<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112443879">3</xref>
</sup> indicates that their specific sheddases (ADAM17 and MT1-MMP)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112443879">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112443879">22</xref>
</sup> were also present and active in the endometrial microenvironment.</p>
<p>Many studies have demonstrated individual factors that change with the endometrial cycle in timed biopsies. Recently Van der Gaast et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112443879">8</xref>
</sup> compared endometrial maturation parameters in secretions obtained by transcervical aspiration with those assessed in endometrial biopsies. The time of cycle did not correlate with the protein content of endometrial fluid aspirates in many instances,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112443879">8</xref>
</sup> confirming older studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112443879">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112443879"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112443879">25</xref>
</sup> For example, glycodelin A but not LIF levels in aspirates were positively correlated with endometrial dating. This emphasizes either that whole tissue analysis does not necessarily demonstrate secretion or that factors may be rapidly degraded following secretion. In some instances, apical immunostaining on epithelium and immunostaining of secretions within glands suggest secretion<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112443879">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112443879">27</xref>
</sup> and this has be confirmed using cultured primary endometrial epithelial cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112443879">14</xref>
</sup> Importantly, in the latter study, the cytokines and chemokines measured in culture medium correlated both in identity and in relative abundance with those measured in uterine lavage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112443879">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While such considerations provide possible explanations for differences between aspirates and lavage samples, other factors are also relevant to decision making regarding which sampling method to employ. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the 2 procedures are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1933719112443879">Table 2</xref>. Both sampling techniques will harvest leukocytes; these are removed from lavage by gentle centrifugation before freezing but will remain in aspirates unless these are diluted and centrifuged immediately following collection. Furthermore, our protein analyses clearly demonstrate that more protein is recovered by lavage but concentration may be required before analysis, whereas aspirates (5-10 µL) need diluting but may be insufficient for some analyses, particularly since &gt;90% of the total soluble protein in the uterine cavity is major serum proteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112443879">12</xref>
</sup> Both techniques suffer disadvantages. While not all lavage fluid is recoverable, it is more difficult to obtain aspirate free of blood, since the endometrial surfaces are closely apposed. The very flexible tube used for lavage makes tissue damage less likely. However, lavage fluid sometimes contains fragments of uterine tissue, particularly during the late secretory phase when the tissue is starting to destabilize with the initiation of menstruation. It is possible that there is some absorption of proteins to the spin filters used for concentration, although these were selected for their low absorptive capacity. Finally, lavage fluid often enters the fallopian tubes and some backflow into the peritoneal cavity is likely. In our hands, 3 mL of saline is now used rather than 5 mL to minimize this effect.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is clear that both aspiration and lavage of the uterine cavity provide fluid for analysis and that each has advantages and disadvantages. However, since lavage can wash soluble factors from the glycocalyx, consistency in the sampling technique used is essential if results from the analyses are to be meaningful.</p>
