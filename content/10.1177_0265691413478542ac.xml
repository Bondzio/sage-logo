<p>The former German Democratic Republic triggers a specific range of images – the Berlin Wall, authoritarianism and deprivation, funny little cars, athletic prowess. Recently, through the work of Mary Fulbrook and others, we have also been treated to a more personal view of the Republic, its citizens, and their social realities. But we rarely think of love, or sex. Our conception of the GDR, to borrow a term oft-repeated in East German sexual education literature, is ‘clean’. That makes Josie McLellan’s brilliantly readable study of sex and sexuality all the more remarkable – it offers us perhaps the first truly intimate account of life in East Germany.</p>
<p>The book begins by offering two competing narratives of love behind the Berlin wall. The first argues that the regime was prudish, upholding highly traditional moral standards, shutting down any potential for a sexual revolution as experienced in the West, and interfering in the most private of realms. The lack of a free public sphere and the destruction of a free private sphere through Stasi espionage and the fear of it, rendered the authoritarian GDR wholly repressive with regard to sexual matters. The second narrative offers a far more romantic, even nostalgic, view of East Germany’s private realms. Far from repressive, the GDR was indulgent when it came to sex. The absence of capitalism enabled sex to become freer and more egalitarian, less sullied by either pornography or consumerism, and more filled with love. Nakedness lost its shame; both nudity and erotica could be enjoyed without the objectification of either women or men. Families could be constructed without resorting to old-fashioned or capitalist traditions of ownership through marriage.</p>
<p>So which is it then? McLellan shows to great effect how both narratives of repression and indulgence have a place within the history of sexuality in East Germany, despite their seeming incompatibility. State interference and repression did not eliminate possibilities for agency and autonomy in individuals’ sex lives. While the realities of life within East Germany may have made a western-style sexual revolution impossible, McLellan argues that a sexual evolution did in fact occur, one which went further than the West in areas including abortion rights, maternity leave, the focus on female sexual pleasure, and support for those seeking gender-reassignment surgery.</p>
<p>But there were limits. Where McLellan finds those limits to lie offers us many new insights for histories of the East German state, histories of authoritarian regimes, and the history of sexuality more generally. Across six thematic chapters – which focus on youthful sexual discovery and sex education, relationships and partnerships, the relationship between the state and love, the realities of gay and lesbian sexual cultures, nudism, and erotica – McLellan deftly traces an intertwined history of concomitant permissiveness and denial, equality and patriarchy, acceptance and prejudice.</p>
<p>The most striking aspects of the book were, for me, those which focused on ‘marginalized’ sexual relationships – amongst gay and lesbians and between East Germans and foreigners. It was a topsy-turvy world indeed when the LGBT community looked to the church for acceptance and activism. McLellan’s insights into the degree to which the Church was not simply an ‘enemy of liberalization’ (123) would be fascinating to apply to studies of religion in post-war Europe more generally. But while the ‘communist’ Church may surprise us with its open-mindedness, the state can still shock us with the extent of its heartless discrimination.</p>
<p>The limits of East Germany’s sexual liberation are most starkly seen in McLellan’s discussion of relationships between East Germans and foreigners, in which the state’s utter disregard for personal autonomy was sometimes horrifying. The racial aspect of the government’s sexual policies raises uncomfortable continuities across 1945. So too does the government’s obsession with sexual ‘cleanliness’. This idea of cleanliness is particularly provocative and problematic given the Stasi’s very dubious, and certainly ‘unclean’, interference with sexual matters – including through the use of prostitutes.</p>
<p>It is a fine book indeed that leaves you thinking long after turning the last page. One particular issue that has remained with me is what McLellan reveals to be the highly unreliable nature of government statistics and questionnaires, in which citizens were primed to answer questions in the ways the regime wished. This certainly demonstrates the limits of freedom – sexual or otherwise – in the GDR.</p>
<p>But what is particularly chilling about this statistical manipulation, and what makes McLellan’s book important for all scholars of modern states, authoritarian or not, is the extent to which democratic societies engage in the same practices, whether in market research or government surveys. As we continue to engage with questions of how to make societies and sexualities more free and egalitarian, it is surely worth reflecting on alternative histories. Doing so not only increases our knowledge of other spaces, it also reveals the discomforting realities of our own.</p>
