<title>Not just an Ordinary Joe</title>
<p>Back in the 1970s, while training as a perfusion student, a case was put on the schedule that had been lingering for many months. I will refer to the patient as “Joe”. Joe presented with a dilated ascending aorta with minor aortic regurgitation which, by itself, was adequately managed by the medicine service. What made his history a bit more complicated was the two vessel saphenous vein bypass graft operation for coronary artery disease that had been performed a few years previously. Joe was scheduled to have his ascending aortic arch replaced along with re-implantation of his two coronary grafts.</p>
<p>Today, such a case is considered relatively routine; the sternum would be re-opened while viewing the transesophageal echo; an internal mammary artery would be taken down and the grafts replaced along with the ascending aorta and the hemi arch. A question might relate to whether a valve-sparing procedure would be used and the length of the circulatory arrest period. Additional discussion might involve the amount of pre-operative blood donation, the degree of autologous blood priming of the circuit, the use of an anti-fibrinolytic agent and the anticipated changes in cerebral oximetry. The circuit would be heparin coated and the extracorporeal devices sized adequately so that the overall extracorporeal priming volume would be less than one liter.</p>
<p>As one might guess, Joe had none of this in his armamentarium. All this patient had was a basic cath report, an old midline scar and a lot of apprehension. The fateful day finally came and Joe was transported to Room 322 at 7a.m. for one of the wildest pathophysiologic experiences a perfusion student could experience. The bypass circuit shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659112444254">Figure 1</xref> was the creation of a genius or a madman, both terms being quite fitting. The direct gas-contact or bubble oxygenator was king at the time and there were several good models to choose from, but the bypass time was anticipated to go much longer than 6 hours, so one of those newfangled membrane gas exchangers was the device of choice. However, this membrane lung required two pumps and two different sized reservoir bags to operate. There was a large volume cardiotomy reservoir attached, along with a novel 40 micron filter which was placed in the arterial line. Since the patient would be cooled down to sub-iceberg levels (approximately 20°C), a stainless steel re-usable heat exchanger was used to control the patient’s temperature. These were referred to as “torpedoes” at the time and if one was good, two would be better. One would control the core rectal temperature and the second would cool blood that would perfuse the old saphenous vein coronary grafts by two additional low-flow roller pumps. Add a left ventricular apical vent, two coronary suction pumps and the resultant apparatus was more like a graduate student’s dissertation than a life support machine. The circuit required over 3 liters of solution to prime. There was no cardioplegia; the coronary arteries would be perfused directly with cold blood through the vein grafts. Heparin was supplemented on a timed sequence instead of by a measurement. Blood conservation was a myth, for it was anticipated that donor blood consumption would be minimally 10-20 units if all went well. The case would be a war. There was no way to train or rehearse; practice would be in combat.</p>

<p>Joe’s case points out that, even before the first issue of <italic>Perfusion</italic> was published, the technology and understanding of complex extracorporeal bypass procedures was limited. The tools available today overshadow what existed even 10-15 years ago. Many of the traditional approaches to routine and complex procedures are now being challenged by new innovations.</p>
<p>This issue of <italic>Perfusion</italic> (27:3) brings to light some of the changes and advancements in the state-of-the-art that continue to benefit patients such as Joe and others who undergo routine or complex cardiovascular procedures. For instance, perfusion simulation would allow the possibility of reproducing a clinical scenario which could be practiced in a safe training environment (Chan). The large circuit volumes found with traditional circuits have been lowered with smaller devices and techniques such as autologous priming, but have also been challenged by the use of mini circuits that have found a niche and have challenged the need to define safe and optimal operational aspects (Ganushchak). Modern circuits have integrated filters into the gas exchange unit (Lin). Heparin levels and protamine titration heparin management strategy have been re-evaluated (Noui). The changes in thromboelastograph (TEG) profiles are examined in patients with or without cell salvage (Campbell). Renal function as a function of age and arterial perfusion pressure are described (Sirvinskas). Simplified methods of measuring myocardial oxygen have been described (Ansari). Markers to measure the quality of perfusion pressure and oxygen delivery are conceptualized as a concept which, in theory, may relate to outcome (Poullis). Pulsatile support resulted in shorter hospital stays in more critical patients (Baraki). Microembolization and cognitive decline following valve surgery and are explained and are related to different cerebral arteries (Zanatta). A rare red cell disorder is also described (Ramadass). Finally, blood transfusion was not required when using warm perfusion and warm microplegia in lieu of traditional circulatory arrest in a special congenital application (Rubatti). Many of the subjects included in this issue of <italic>Perfusion</italic> brought back memories of a unique patient cared for several decades back.</p>
<p>So, what became of Joe? Around midnight, following an eight and a half hour bypass run with a period of circulatory arrest, some 50+ units of donor blood cells, plasma and platelets, Joe was admitted to the intensive care unit with a new aorta. Post pump, he had nearly bled to death, but the chief perfusionist recommended fresh drawn donor blood might reduce the bleeding. It took 2 fresh units of whole blood drawn from hospital workers to validate the hypothesis. Remarkably, Joe survived in spite of us all and eventually got a ticket home.</p>
