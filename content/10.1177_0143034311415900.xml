<abstract>
<p>Internationally, educators have proposed a shift from a narrow diagnostic view to a holistic and salutogenic perspective on pupils’ school-related difficulties. There is, however, little evidence to suggest that such a shift has taken place, despite being talked about by school administrators. In Sweden such a shift is proposed through a new organization of school services (‘pupil health’) with the distinct aim of psychosocial and physical health promotion in schools. The aim of the present study was to explore the meaning attributed to the new concept of ‘pupil health’ by school psychologists and different school-based professionals (i.e. their social representations of the concept and the services provided). Questions investigated include: What meanings do school-based multi-professional teams attribute to ‘pupil health’? What patterns of meaning can be distinguished between different professional groups and across professional groups? A mainly inductive qualitative content analysis adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311415900">Graneheim and Lundman (2003)</xref> was used. The result is a model, a matrix, which illuminates diversity in ‘pupil health’ as a new concept. The matrix describes four different perspectives on pupil health. The practical implications of those perspectives are discussed with reference to research on multi-professional teams, social representation theory and salutogenic perspectives.</p>

<body>
<p>Internationally, educators have suggested a shift from a narrow diagnostic to a holistic view on pupils’ school-related difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311415900">Engelbrecht, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311415900">Truscott, Catanese, &amp; Abrams, 2005</xref>). In Sweden this shift is emphasized by a new organization of school services with a distinct aim of promoting psychosocial and physical well-being. Shifts of perspectives, however, seldom develop on command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>). Thus, it was of interest to explore the social representations of this new service from the perspectives of the school psychologists and other professionals in the Swedish multi-professional school-based teams.</p>
<p>A pathological and medical approach dominates school psychology throughout the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311415900">Carlson, Benson, &amp; Oakland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311415900">Wnek, Klein, &amp; Bracken, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311415900">Woods &amp; Farrell, 2006</xref>). However, a change to a health promoting and ecological perspective is also discussed worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311415900">Bartolo, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311415900">De Jong &amp; Griffiths, 2008</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311415900">Farrell, 2010</xref>). In a recent study about student problem behaviours in ten different countries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311415900">Gu, Lai, and Ye (2011)</xref> concluded that ‘fostering of interests in learning and developing meaningful and vivid lectures and activities in classes are basic strategies for reducing student problem behaviours’ (p.31). In line with this, a major task for school psychologists in regard to student problem behaviours must be to support and promote teachers’ class-room activities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan and Gutkin (2000)</xref> proposed a shift of paradigm in US schools and suggested that an ecological and contextual framework ought to replace the traditional medical model. They presented a conceptual model for school psychology in which an ecological perspective contrasted with a pathological perspective. They argue that in taking a pathological perspective, school psychologists tend both to ask and answer the wrong questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The approach and perspectives of school psychologists also depends on what is accepted and asked for by administrators, teachers, and other school care providers. However, little is known about goals and perspectives of school-based multi-professional teams although multi-professional teamwork has rapidly become a common way to organize care services all over the world, both in schools and healthcare services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311415900">Annan, Bowler, Mentis, &amp; Phillipson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415900">Blomqvist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311415900">Engelbrecht, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311415900">Freeman, Miller, &amp; Ross, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311415900">Thornberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311415900">Thylefors, Persson, &amp; Hellström, 2005</xref>). In spite of numerous articles highlighting positive features of multi-professional teams, there is only a small body of research providing evidence of the effectiveness of multi-professional intervention teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311415900">Burns &amp; Symington, 2002</xref>). Single studies show effects of school-based team interventions on academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311415900">Brown &amp; Bolen, 2008</xref>) number of referral cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311415900">Anthun &amp; Manger, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311415900">Jennings, Pearson, &amp; Harris, 2000</xref>) and reduced school absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311415900">Gall, Pagano, Desmond, Perrin, &amp; Murphy, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311415900">Annan et al. (2008)</xref> emphasized the energy created in balancing diverse perspectives and devised a matrix for contextualizing different perspectives to be used as a basis for reflection in multi-professional school-based teams. Difficulties in multi-professional teams range from a strong professional identification that might interfere with teamwork identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415900">Blomqvist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311415900">Brewer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311415900">Turner &amp; Haslam, 2001</xref>), role conflicts, and lack of clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311415900">Annan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311415900">Boone, Minore, Katt, &amp; Kinch, 1997</xref>), to minimizing diverse perspectives in order to reach consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415900">Blomqvist, 2009</xref>). Instead of a deeper understanding based on different specialist perspectives, communication based on common and everyday understanding may develop, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311415900">Knotek (2003)</xref> labelled ‘folk discourse’.</p>
<p>Attribution of within-child aetiology is also reported as a factor reducing team effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311415900">Eidle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311415900">Hjörne &amp; Säljö, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311415900">Klingner &amp; Harry, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311415900">Rubinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311415900">Thornberg, 2008</xref>). Teams tend to jump prematurely to a discussion of intervention factors outside the classroom, placing the problem within the child or the family, instead of making a holistic and ecological analysis on a new and higher level. Thus, the pupils are pushed towards testing instead of pre-referral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311415900">Klingner &amp; Harry, 2006</xref>). Instead of a contextualization of the problem, there is rather a decontextualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311415900">Hjörne &amp; Säljö, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Even when there is an emphasis on system change, direct diagnostic services seem to take over. When teachers in urban high schools were provided with access to interdisciplinary problem-solving teams, most teams developed a pupil-centred approach, while typically ignoring teacher-centred consultation, in spite of the fact that direct intervention teams did not enhance teachers’ capacity to work with these pupils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311415900">Rubinson, 2002</xref>). The conclusion was that the implementation period for system-oriented and teacher-oriented interventions, is longer than for pupil-centred interventions, which is supported by research on instructional consultation teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311415900">Rosenfield &amp; Gravois, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Multi-professional school-based teamwork is given different names, and appears mainly in two categories. Firstly, there are teams focusing on pupil placements or interventions in the classroom such as teacher assistance teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311415900">Burns &amp; Symington, 2002</xref>), student study teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311415900">Klingner &amp; Harry, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311415900">Lane, Mahdavi, &amp; Borthwick-Duffy, 2003</xref>), pre-referral teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311415900">Eidle, Boyd, Truscott, &amp; Meyers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311415900">Knotek, 2003</xref>), and instructional consultation teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311415900">Gravois &amp; Rosenfield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311415900">Knotek, Rosenfield, Gravois, &amp; Babinski, 2003</xref>). Secondly, there are teams focusing on children's physical or mental health, such as school-based healthcare teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311415900">Brown &amp; Bolen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311415900">Meyers &amp; Swerdlik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311415900">Reuterswärd &amp; Lagerström, 2009</xref>). As teams are given different names, team goals are unclear and team members’ unspecified results are difficult to analyse, so there is an urgent need for more research in this field.</p>
<p>Multi-professional teams have a long history in Swedish schools but the teams recently proposed by the Swedish government integrate two existing parallel services (school health care and psychosocial care) with special education into one system, <italic>Elevhälsa</italic>, literally meaning ‘pupil health’. <italic>Elevhälsa</italic> means the promotion of health, learning, and well-being in schools. This concept not only stands for a new perspective, a holistic view on pupils’ school-related problems, but also new tasks for the multi-professional teams including the school psychologists, as well as being the label for the team and its services. Health promotion represents a salutogenic perspective in contrast to a pathological perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311415900">Antonovsky, 1996</xref>) and preventive orientations, which focus on risk factors instead of health-promoting factors. ‘Pupil health’ does not have exactly the same connotations as the Swedish concept <italic>Elevhälsa</italic>, but will be used here to simplify the text. The term multi-professional team will be used, as the degree of collaboration is an unexplored question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311415900">Thylefors et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Social representation theory (SRT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311415900">Moscovici, 1963</xref>) is used as a framework in this article to explain how meaning is attributed to ‘pupil health’ and how such meanings may change. SRT is a social psychological framework of concepts and ideas for studying psychosocial phenomena. These phenomena and processes are embedded in historical, cultural, and macro social conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311415900">Moscovici, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311415900">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>). When a new phenomenon such as ‘pupil health’ appears, a <italic>break</italic> occurs according to SRT, which instigates different types of collective coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311415900">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>). It was an opportune time to explore the school psychologists’ and the other professional team members’ representations of ‘pupil health’, as the concept was introduced ten years ago, but the new organization has only just been enacted. Some schools use the new concept and organization, whereas others adhere to the traditional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311415900">Guvå, 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec1-0143034311415900"><title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to explore the meaning which school psychologists and other members of the school-based multi-professional teams attributed to the new concept of ‘pupil health’ (i.e. their social representations). The questions investigated were: (1) What meanings do professionals in the school-based multi-professional teams attribute to ‘pupil health’? (2) What patterns of meaning can be distinguished between different professional groups and across professional groups?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0143034311415900" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>A qualitative and mainly inductive content analysis, taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311415900">Graneheim and Lundman (2003)</xref>, was used. It resembles interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311415900">Smith &amp; Osborn, 2008</xref>), as both descriptions and interpretations were used, but in contrast to IPA, our focus was not limited to individual representations but to social representations.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0143034311415900" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>In order to explore the perspective of all professions in the pupil health teams, the six professional groups mentioned in the new Swedish school law were interviewed in addition to teachers. In accordance with our research interest in exploring different professionals’ social representation of ‘pupil health’, data were collected from professionally homogeneous focus groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311415900">Morgan, 1997</xref>). In a homogeneous focus group social representations within a professional group are most likely to be presented.</p>
<p>In total, seven professional groups from Grades 1 to 9, school paediatricians, school nurses, school psychologists, school social workers, special education teachers and principals were interviewed, adding up to 82 interviewees. There is a female dominance in all focus groups except for the groups with principals which is in accordance with the distribution of gender in Swedish primary schools. The focus groups varied from three to ten members, depending on the method of recruitment. Four groups were recruited at national professional conferences, which guaranteed a spread throughout the country. Five groups were recruited in connection with continuing professional training and came from different municipalities in one geographical region. Four groups were locally recruited and thus came from the same municipality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311415900"><title>Collection of data</title>
<p>Fourteen focus groups, homogeneous with regard to profession, were held from autumn 2007 to autumn 2008. A semi-structured topic guide covering questions such as the meaning of ‘pupil health’, their own professional contribution to ‘pupil health’, expectations of other professionals, and other professionals’ expectations was used. This article focuses on the first question, the meaning of ‘pupil health’. The focus groups lasted for 90 minutes, were moderated by different members of the research team, audiotaped and transcribed verbatim immediately after the interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311415900"><title>Analyses</title>
<p>Four members of the research team participated in the analysis of data, which was performed according to the following steps:
<list id="list1-0143034311415900" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Data from each professional group were analysed separately, by one member of the research team who read the text to familiarize him- or herself, separated units of analysis, gave a short description of each unit of analysis, described the content of each unit of analysis on a reflexive level, and categorized the unit of analysis into themes according to the reflexive interpretation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The research group collectively analysed the themes from the different professional groups to find general themes applicable to the whole of the material. The general themes were analysed according to their units of analysis to find subcategories. Each theme for each professional group and for the whole of the material was described according to its subcategories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The themes were shared. Each member of the team analysed one or more of the themes across all professional groups, read the text again with a focus on the subcategories, added units of analysis that were missed or had been interpreted in a different way, and finally wrote the text.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Thus the procedure could be described as first synthesizing and then analysing the data, i.e. first simplifying and then complicating the simplifications. Quotes translated from Swedish to English have been adjusted by omitting repetitions of words, sounds, laughter, etc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143034311415900"><title>Ethics</title>
<p>The Ethics Committee of Linköping University approved the study. All participants gave written informed consent, were guaranteed confidentiality, and were informed that participation was voluntary and that they were free to leave at any time.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143034311415900" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<sec id="sec8-0143034311415900"><title>Perspectives on ‘pupil health’ and level of intervention</title>
<p>In the analysis of the interviews two major aspects of ‘pupil health’ emerged. The two aspects were <italic>type of perspective</italic> (pathologic/salutogenic) and <italic>level of intervention</italic> (general/individual). These two aspects formed a matrix, with four different meanings given to ‘pupil health’ by the members of the focus groups. These different meanings are elaborated below. Typically, members from all professions described a change from one pole to another, i.e. from a pathologic to a salutogenic perspective and from interventions on individual level to interventions on group and organizational level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143034311415900"><title>Type of perspective</title>
<p>‘Pupil health’ was described as a change in approach from focusing on disease to focusing on health promotion in all professional groups. It was exemplified by school health <italic>care</italic> and psychosocial <italic>care</italic> being turned into health <italic>promotion</italic>. School psychologists emphasized that the total school environment should be health promoting. One social worker said: ‘This salutogenic perspective guides our thinking. We are supposed to focus on health and well-being instead of caring about what's already bad and wrecked’. A school nurse expressed it the following way: ‘It is not just about physical and mental well-being, but a larger concept, which is about the environment and everything the children are into every day in school<italic>’</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec10-0143034311415900"><title>Level of intervention</title>
<p>‘Pupil health’ was described as a change from interventions on an individual level to general preventative interventions on group and organizational level. A school social worker said:
<disp-quote>
<p>We don't focus on just a few pupils. We try to be much more preventative to get all grown-ups to change attitude and values and take part in ‘pupil health’. On the whole, it is all about the pupils’ health and well-being, all pupils, not only those who are referred to us, because of a problematic situation.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus there are four possible meanings given to ‘pupil health’ as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref> and described below.
<fig id="fig1-0143034311415900" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Meaning of pupil health as experienced by professionals in the focus groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0143034311415900-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-0143034311415900"><title>A. General prevention</title>
<p>General prevention means that ‘pupil health’ is described as interventions focused on preventing risk behaviours, for example by the school anti-drug programmes or suicide prevention programmes. Thus, interventions are focused on problems and risk groups found by screening programmes, as expressed by a school social worker: ‘“Pupil health” is about prevention, that all pupils may feel good enough. And not just interfering when there is a catastrophe. I have the ambition of shifting focus a little’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0143034311415900"><title>B. General promotion</title>
<p>General promotion means that ‘pupil health’ is described as general interventions directed at all pupils or focused on the school as a learning environment in order to promote health, learning, and well-being in school. It is about empowerment and covers a broad perspective on health. According to one principal it runs through everything and must include physical exercises, food, well-being and self-esteem, while one teacher expressed it like this: ‘Pupil health means that pupils feel well in all perspectives. I seldom think of medical aspects, which influence classwork, such as using a wheelchair or being allergic, but how you feel psychologically if you are happy, sad or feel good’. School psychologists emphasized that teachers’ classroom work was the most important part of ‘pupil health’ and that's what the pupil health team must support. One school nurse gave the following examples of general promotion: ‘Health weeks when we talk about balanced diets, physical exercise, hygienic and sleeping habits with all pupils. Project days devoted to specific attitudes or behaviours—everybody says hello to everyone else’.</p>
<sec id="sec13-0143034311415900"><title>C. Treatment or assessments directed at individual pupils</title>
<p>Interventions on an individual level from a pathological perspective means that ‘pupil health’ is described as interventions and assessments directed at individual pupils, who are regarded as difficult to teach, unhappy, or badly behaved. Assessments are focused on finding the fault within the child and typically result in medical or neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Difficulties are thus regarded as deficiencies within the pupil or within the family, which must be treated outside the classroom or the school, that is decontexualizing. This perspective is exemplified in the following quote from a school doctor: ‘When we have finished the assessments we send them to the child clinic in X, because that's where they give diagnoses or to the Child Psychiatric Clinics. Then it is a task for the County Council Health Care<italic>’</italic>. Typically, excerpts giving this meaning to ‘pupil health’ were turned up in the context of how it should <italic>not</italic> be, like the school psychologist who said: ‘It is the school, which needs a diagnosis, not the child’ or the special education teacher who said: ‘It's the children, who are supposed to be fixed not the structures’. A school nurse worried about too many assessments and follow-up of children with disabilities taking almost all the time from the doctor. When this meaning was given to ‘pupil health’ there was no consensus about it in any professional group and it was a basis for debate. According to one teacher it represents an old teacher perspective: ‘What you don't want to have in your classroom you want to get rid of. I try to see what we can do where we are. There are different views on this among the professional groups, that's evident!’.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034311415900"><title>D. Health promotion directed at individual pupils</title>
<p>Individual interventions from a salutogenic perspective mean that ‘pupil health’ is described as interventions directed at those individual pupils defined as pupils in need of special support in school. The purpose is to find out what the school must do to help and create a basis for learning and well-being. It is about how to organize the work around the child who is in need of any type of special support. The issue is how to approach the pupils in their classrooms and in the whole school environment. Focus is on the pupils’ resources instead of their deficiencies as expressed by one special education teacher: ‘It is the perspective on children and learning. I believe a useful approach is to first consider how I could change my way of working with this child’. The pupils’ difficulties are contextualized and seen as complex problems from an interactional point of view, where both causes and solutions are related to the environment.
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Pupil health’ is a change of perspective on children, a health-promoting perspective, not only regarding the individual as a problem, as an individual, who should be assessed, but as an individual in a group. You have to consider the whole context. (school psychologist)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The teacher is regarded as the main agent for supporting the pupil and as one teacher said: ‘The aim is not to assess children but the aim is to help them find means to progress’. Thus interventions from the ‘pupil health’ professionals within this perspective include all types of support programmes for the teachers such as supervision, consultation, collaboration, and individual training courses, expressed by a school social worker as: ‘Actually I think that the teacher is the principal care person and we create a support process for that role’.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0143034311415900"><title>Different perspectives in theory and in practice</title>
<p>There is consensus among the professionals that the concept of ‘pupil health’ means a change from a pathologic to a salutogenic perspective and from an individual approach to a general approach. It is not possible to discern any differences among the professions in respect of this perspective. Where differences in perspectives were discerned they were not talked about as different professional perspectives but rather as individual differences owing to personal issues as this teacher expressed it: ‘It depends very much on the individuals in the teams. You have to adjust the task to the people in each team. That's how I see it’.</p>
<p>The interviews indicated that school psychologists as well as the other members of the multi-professional teams defined ‘pupil health’ as general prevention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref>, Box A) or promotion in order to stimulate physical and mental health, learning and development in schools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref>, Box B). When describing their work in practice, however, the interviewed professionals described interventions directed at individual pupils in order to make assessments or referrals for diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref>, Box C). Therefore, they acted as if problems could be solved by individual interventions outside the school although they understood ‘pupil health’ as a concept of health promotion. The results thus indicated a paradox, a vast difference between a rhetorical view of ‘pupil health’ and work in practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0143034311415900"><title>‘Pupil health’ in practice—individual assessments and treatment</title>
<p>The professionals seemed to think that ‘pupil health’ resulted in a new way of thinking but not in a new way of working and they could not see much of a change resulting from the proposal of ‘pupil health’. ‘Not much has happened, when it comes to changing the way of working with the children. We assess our children as usual’, a school psychologist stated. A school social worker said that they mostly talk about individual pupils ‘same thing as always’. A principal stated that there was nothing revolutionary: ‘We talk mostly about single pupils. Same thing as always. No news or anything new that has started’.</p>
<p>Also, there was a high consciousness of this gap between the rhetoric view and work in practice among the professionals. That is, they clearly reported an awareness of the situation that ‘pupil health’ is supposed to have the intention of promotion but is more focused on care, assessment, and diagnosis. This gap was a dilemma for school psychologists and the other professionals in the ‘pupil health’ teams as expressed by a school psychologist: ‘Pupil health sounds good but we actually think very much in terms of care, we really do!’.</p>
<p>The main reason the ‘pupil health’ professionals cited for the difficulties of working according to an ecological perspective was the teachers’ failure to share their point of view. Among teachers, however, diverse perspectives on this issue were evident, but some teachers expressed an opinion different from the general perspective of the teams. ‘We want help with this child and I want someone to come and take care of him or her, and help me with the child. Don't help me, help the child!’, one teacher said.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0143034311415900"><title>‘Pupil health’ in theory—general interventions and health promotion</title>
<p>Even if pupils, in practice, are discussed and treated according to a medical or pathologic perspective, all professionals argued for another way of thinking. Psychologists and school social workers argued against a medical perspective and pointed to the importance of a learning atmosphere in school. Special education teachers pointed to the importance of helping the pupil in school by focusing on the educational or instructional work instead of seeing the child as a problem and said that one should focus on learning instead of teaching. School physicians talked about normalizing the pupils instead of ‘problematizing’ them and adjusting the school to the pupils instead of the opposite—adjusting the pupils to the school. Principals also argued against the idea of the pupil as the problem, wanting to focus on the pupils’ resources instead, but in doing so regarded the teacher as constituting the problem. Thus there was a shift from a pupil diagnostic view to a teacher diagnostic view as exemplified by a quote from a principal: ‘It is so easy to problematize around the pupil instead of analysing what is going on in the classroom because then a person may become criticized, whom everyone is aware of, but no one dares to talk about’.</p>
<p>To summarize, there is a gap between a rhetoric view and work in practice, that is believing in <italic>general interventions</italic> but practising <italic>individual interventions</italic>. There is also a gap regarding perspectives on the individual level, between a rhetorical way of talking about <italic>health promotion</italic> and a practice of <italic>individual assessments</italic>. Even though there is a high degree of agreement among all professionals on a rhetorical level that their interventions should be grounded in a contextual and ecological framework and focus on the pupils’ resources instead of their deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref>, Box D), that is not the way it is, according to the interviewees. On the contrary, the interventions in practice are described as focused on individual pupils’ disabilities and difficulties in school, putting the blame on the child.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0143034311415900" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main outcome of the study is a model, which illuminates the diversity in ‘pupil health’ as a new concept. The matrix describes four different perspectives of pupil health, creating a tension: Firstly between a pathologic perspective focused on medical aspects and a salutogenic perspective focused on health and well-being; secondly between interventions focused on a general level and interventions on an individual level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan and Gutkin (2000)</xref> described two different paradigms, one individual and medical pole and one ecological and general pole. The medical model was described as a traditional way of thinking, relevant for clinical work. In contrast, an ecological model was described as a conceptual base for understanding learning disabilities as a dysfunction between the individual child and the educational context and the interactions among and across different systems. In this study we have identified four different poles. Similarly to Sheridan and Gutkin, we recognize the importance of the differences between the individual and general level. In addition, we also recognize that the individual level may be either diagnostic or health-promoting and the general level may be either preventative or health-promoting.</p>
<p>The study analyses indicated consensus among the different professions regarding ‘pupil health’ as health promotion focusing on a general level in contrast to traditional individual interventions from a pathological perspective. The interviewees did not seem to be aware of the distinction between prevention and promotion on a general level, however, although they described both promotional and preventative interventions. Promoting health and preventing illnesses on the general level were talked about as exchangeable concepts and preventative interventions were regarded as health promotion. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311415900">Antonovsky (1996)</xref>, a theory of promotion is crucial in order to avoid being trapped in a traditional view of pathologic prevention. A preventative orientation differs from a health promotion orientation in terms of different views on risk factors. There are risk factors in every situation and people cope with them in different ways. Thus, the focus should be on coping instead of limiting risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311415900">Antonovsky, 1996</xref>). A salutogenic perspective focuses on what promotes health and not what prevents illness, <italic>ease</italic> instead of <italic>dis-ease</italic>. If these differences are not acknowledged health promotion may not be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311415900">Antonovsky, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One explanation of the fact, accentuated by this study, that there is such a difference between what is said and what is done may be that traditional explanations are used because of the lack of theories for holistic and ecological analysis of pupils’ school problems. Therefore school problems still seem to be tackled as problems of the child or the family, which accords with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311415900">Hjörne &amp; Säljö, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311415900">Woods &amp; Farrell, 2006</xref>). In spite of the high degree of agreement on the salutogenic meaning of ‘pupil health’ and in spite of the awareness of the gap between this meaning and what happens in practice, the professionals do not seem to have enough theories or tools to change this. This may seem surprising since most Swedish school psychologists do have training in interactional and ecological theories on child development and organizational development. There seems to be a need for school psychologists to better use this knowledge when defining their main tasks. The matrix from this study may be a tool for such negotiation and differentiating between different perspectives in the ‘pupil health teams’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311415900">Annan et al. (2008)</xref> pointed to the need for diverse perspectives for constructive dialogue and effective teamwork. If different perspectives are attributed to individual differences and not recognized as theoretical perspectives, differences might be a source of personal conflict in multi-professional teams instead of a source of constructive dialogue. Without joint reflections one profession might attribute a traditional view to another profession, or the team might conclude that the teacher is to blame because of a traditional view on teaching, while attributing a new way of thinking to the team. For such a reflection to be productive, the leader of the team is crucial, as team members typically hesitate to confront each other with different perspectives in favour of consensus, making constructive dialogue difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415900">Blomqvist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311415900">Hjörne &amp; Säljö, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311415900">Blomqvist (2009)</xref> has described this phenomenon in a multi-professional psychiatric team and concluded that efforts to enhance cohesion could lead to limitations when it came to the team making full use of its professional diversity during treatment conferences. As the gap between theory and practice seems to be a true professional dilemma for the ‘pupil health’ team members, the matrix presented in this article may help to elucidate different perspectives and enhance collaborative reflections on practice. School psychologists have a specific role in instigating such reflections in the multi-professional teams due to their background training.</p>
<p>The interviewees indicated that preventing and promoting interventions were described as desirable but impossible as individual assessments took up all their time, which echoes school psychology studies from all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311415900">Farrell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311415900">Woods &amp; Farrell, 2006</xref>). The four boxes in the matrix were seen as exclusive and not interdependent. An ecological view, however, would imply that the school is a social system, of which the pupil is a part. The individual, the group and the organization are seen as different but interacting systems. In this perspective all boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143034311415900">Figure 1</xref> have to be considered in each case and not regarded as different and exclusive perspectives but instead included in an interactionistic theoretical perspective of learning and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311415900">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The gap between what is said and what is done can also be understood by referring to SRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311415900">Moscovici, 1969</xref>), which states that the sociogenesis of a new social representation starts with the occurrence of a new and unfamiliar phenomenon or event, <italic>a break</italic>, which instigates different types of collective coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311415900">Wagner et al., 1999</xref>): firstly, we understand it and translate it into well-known activities and symbols, then through further discourse it turns into a new objectified representation in the form of an image, metaphor or symbol. ‘Pupil health’ is in the process of becoming a new social representation. Some professionals still translate the concept into traditional representations, although most accord a new symbolic meaning to the concept. Even when a new symbolic meaning is given to the concept, this is still not based on a common practice or joint interaction and thus the collectiveness of the social representation is shallow. Even if ‘pupil health’ is understood in accordance with the health-promoting intentions, it is still translated into traditional activities. Current practice will not provide a basis for a true new social representation and there is an impending risk that ‘pupil health’ will be just a new name for a new organization with the same old content. There is a large body of international literature, which is critical of the medical model used by many school psychologists but still this model persists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311415900">Farrell, 2010</xref>; Forlin, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311415900">Sheridan &amp; Gutkin, 2000</xref>; Woods &amp; Farrell, 2006). What this article adds is that not only school psychologists but also other members of school-based multi-professional teams seem to be trapped in a medical model, which is contradictory to their perspectives on ‘pupil health’. Joint reflection on the different perspectives recognized in this study could be one way to start a process of change in practice.</p>
<p>The uniprofessional focus groups gave authentic data with great depth and allowed the members to discuss their professional perspectives freely. A number of presentations of the matrix to pupil health professionals have given support to its relevance. To obtain more in-depth data about the causes of the gap between rhetoric and practice, heterogenic focus groups could be an extension of this research. Also, observations of authentic team discussions would further add to our knowledge. This is a study in a Swedish setting with a limited number of participants. However, as the same type of paradigm shift is under discussion in many other countries, this study may have theoretical relevance and add to the international knowledgebase of approaches to services from school psychologists and multi-professional school-based teams.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0143034311415900" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The main outcome of this study is a matrix differentiating between four different perspectives on pupil health, which may be used as a basis for constructive dialogues within school-based multi-professional teams. Although the different members of the multi-professional teams all agreed on a health-promoting and well-being perspective, they also agreed that ‘pupil health’ in practice means individual interventions from a medical stance. Thus, there is a huge gap between rhetoric and practice and more research is needed to determine which factors and processes account for this difference.<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311415900"/>
