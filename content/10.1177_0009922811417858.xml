<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 15-year-old girl developed a papulovesicular, pustular rash involving her hands and feet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811417858">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811417858">2</xref>). She was in her usual state of good health until 10 days prior to admission when she developed fever and sore throat. The fever lasted for 2 days and the sore throat for 4 days. The following day, she noticed some blistering lesions on her hands and later that day, on her feet. The lesions became increasingly painful over time, to the point that she was unable to bear weight on her feet. She came to the emergency department with swelling, redness, pain, and inability to walk and was admitted for evaluation and treatment with cefazolin initially and then clindamycin and ceftriaxone.</p>

<p>Physical examination revealed a well-appearing female adolescent, in no acute distress, with a temperature of 100°F and blood pressure of 99/51 mm Hg. Her hands and feet were slightly edematous and covered with pustulovesicular lesions in various stages, some scabbed and crusted, with minimal surrounding erythema. There was some tenderness of the soft tissues of her hands and feet. These lesions were neither purpuric nor ulcerative. The remainder of her physical examination was unremarkable.</p>
<p>Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell count of 16 700/mm<sup>3</sup> with 76% neutrophils, 14% lymphocytes, 9% monocytes, 1% eosinophils, hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit 28.7%, and a platelet count of 388 000/mm<sup>3</sup>. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 61 and C-reactive protein 51 mg/L (normal = 0-10 mg/L). Blood cultures were negative. Throat culture was negative for group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic>. Evaluation for Epstein–Barr virus and parvovirus B19 was consistent with remote infection. <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> serology, rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibody screen, anti-double-stranded DNA screen, and viral culture of a lesion were negative. Gram stain of a lesion from the right foot demonstrated moderate white blood cells, few gram-positive cocci in pairs, and rare gram-positive cocci in clusters. Culture of the lesion grew <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>. Gram stain of a lesion from the right hand demonstrated no white blood cells and no organisms were seen. Culture of the lesion grew <italic>S pyogenes</italic>, coagulase-negative <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, and pan-sensitive <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This adolescent had a very unusual pustulovesicular rash with a distinctive distribution. The initial differential diagnosis included papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (which is usually caused by parvovirus B19 infection),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811417858">1</xref></sup> hand, foot, and mouth disease due to coxsackievirus infection, syphilis, disseminated gonococcal infection, Epstein–Barr virus infection, or noninfectious rash. Laboratory evaluation, culture results, and clinical course suggested a novel group A streptococcal skin infection (streptococcal acropustulosis) as the most likely diagnosis.</p>
<p>Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS) is a common human pathogen, with protean clinical manifestations, including tonsillopharyngitis, parapharyngeal and other abscesses, otitis, sinusitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, empyema, endocarditis, pericarditis, phlebitis, osteoarticular infection, pyomyositis, lymphadenitis, meningitis, brain abscess, septicemia, toxin-mediated disease (toxic shock syndrome, scarlet fever, and bullous impetigo, for example), and immune-mediated disease (acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis) among many others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811417858">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811417858">3</xref></sup> In addition to causing common or well-recognized cutaneous diseases such as impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, and scarlet fever, less common or less-well-recognized skin conditions, including erysipelas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811417858">4</xref></sup> perianal dermatitis (anusitis),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811417858">5</xref></sup> and blistering distal dactylitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811417858">6</xref></sup> can result from GAS infection. Postinfectious cutaneous manifestations of GAS infection include erythema nodosum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811417858">7</xref></sup> guttate pattern psoriasis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811417858">8</xref></sup> cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811417858">9</xref></sup> and pustulosis acuta generalisata,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811417858">10</xref></sup> among others. This case illustrates yet another distinct cutaneous manifestation of GAS infection.</p>
<p>Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection involving the upper dermis and lymphatics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811417858">4</xref></sup> This infection affects the very young and the elderly and is typically seen during the summer months. The infection presents as bright red, tender, edematous, indurated plaques. The involved area is sharply demarcated and expands peripherally. It is most commonly found on the face, scalp, extremities, and genitalia; patients may have constitutional symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise. Bacteremia can occasionally be seen. Prompt, aggressive treatment is indicated for erysipelas and parenteral antibiotics are generally preferred for initial management.</p>
<p>Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is an infection of the perianal skin and mucosa, predominantly affecting younger children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811417858">5</xref></sup> The incidence is unknown, but the infection is relatively common, has a male preponderance, and a peak incidence between 3 and 4 years of age. The signs and symptoms include rectal irritation, pruritis ani, painful defecation, rectal bleeding, and encopresis. Findings include patchy or plaque-like moist erythema in a uniform, circumferential, perianal distribution extending 2 to 4 cm from the anal verge. Bacterial cultures confirm the diagnosis. The differential diagnosis includes candidiasis, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, pinworms, sexual abuse, and inflammatory bowel disease. Oral therapy with penicillin is the treatment of choice; concomitant topical therapy with mupirocin decreases the risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Blistering distal dactylitis is characterized by tense superficial bullae, usually less than 2 cm in size, occurring on a tender, erythematous base over the volar fat pad of the distal phalanx of a finger or thumb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811417858">6</xref></sup> School-age children are most commonly affected, but it may occur in infants, teenagers, and adults. The diagnosis is confirmed by culture of the blister fluid. The differential diagnosis includes herpetic whitlow, paronychia, and friction blisters. Treatment consists of incision and drainage of the bullae and oral penicillin.</p>
<p>Erythema nodosum, an acute erythematous panniculitis, presents as tender, raised, red nodules that usually are limited to the extensor aspects of the lower extremities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811417858">7</xref></sup> Other symptoms include fever, generalized aching, and arthralgia. The most common cause in children is prior streptococcal infection. Presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction, it may occur in association with several systemic diseases or drug therapies. The diagnosis is based on the clinical picture, but throat culture should be done to exclude infection with GAS. The differential diagnosis includes erysipelas, erythema induratum, insect bites, urticaria, and papular urticaria. Symptomatic relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cool compresses, elevation, and bed rest are all part of the management. This condition is self-limited.</p>
<p>Guttate psoriasis is an erythematous, papulosquamous, guttate, psoriasiform lesion that occurs most often in children, appearing abruptly a week after a streptococcal pharyngitis or perianal streptococcal dermatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811417858">8</xref></sup> Small, papular lesions, round to slightly oval, with overlying, silvery scales are characteristic. The lesions are unusual on the palms and soles. The differential diagnosis includes nummular eczema, pityriasis rosea, and tinea corporis. The condition usually resolves spontaneously after 3 to 4 months but a recurrence of psoriasis is common. Simple reassurance and emollients are all that may be needed in most of the cases.</p>
<p>Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a panarteritis of the subcutaneous and deep dermal arterioles and post capillary venules without systemic vascular involvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811417858">9</xref></sup> It may present as livido reticularis, tender subcutaneous nodules that are more easily palpated than visualized, petechiae, purpura, cutaneous necrosis, or ulcerations. Extracutaneous manifestations include constitutional symptoms, myalgias, arthralgias, and neuropathy. It is believed to be an immune complex-mediated disease, with GAS being the most common inciting agent. Diagnosis is usually based on the clinical picture. Anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are commonly seen. The differential diagnosis includes erythema nodosum, systemic polyarteritis nodosa, microscopic polyangitis, Churg–Strauss syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and erythema induratum. Treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and/or corticosteroids therapy, depending on the disease severity.</p>
<p>Another rare postinfectious complication seen following GAS infection is pustulosis acuta generalisata, which is characterized by an eruption of isolated, small pustules on normal skin, predominantly in acral regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811417858">10</xref></sup> It can be associated with fever, arthropathy, leukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The differential diagnosis includes papulopustular acne, infantile acropustulosis, pustulosis palmaris et plantaris, and generalized pustular psoriasis. This is a self-limited eruption, but a 1- to 2-week course of antibiotic therapy is often recommended.</p>
<p>The cutaneous manifestations of GAS infection in the adolescent described were reminiscent of several of these unusual infectious and postinfectious entities but did not fit any of them completely. It seems that the spectrum of clinical disease caused by GAS continues to expand.</p>
