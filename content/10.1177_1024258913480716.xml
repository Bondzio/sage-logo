<abstract>
<p>This article assesses the effects of the recent economic crisis on industrial relations in the central and eastern European EU Member States. The analysis is based on the theoretical framework of three types of central and eastern European capitalism: neoliberal, embedded neoliberal and neocorporatist (Bohle and Greskovits, 2012). The article introduces the individual articles of this issue, arguing that the impact of the crisis on collective bargaining processes and institutions is shaped by economic and political factors and, above all, by the institutional setting of industrial relations. Trade union responses are explained by the varying use of two strategic sources of power: participation in formal collective bargaining (institutional power) and a strengthening of the membership base (membership power). Despite considerable differences between countries with regard to these factors, recent developments in collective bargaining have tended to be path-dependent and have resulted in a further shift of the region’s industrial relations towards neoliberalism.</p>

<p>Cet article évalue les effets de la récente crise économique sur les relations professionnelles dans les pays d’Europe centrale et orientale (PECO) membres de l'UE. L'analyse se base sur le cadre théorique de trois types de capitalisme des PECO: le néo-libéral, le néo-libéral encastré et le néo-corporatiste (Bohle et Greskovits, 2012). On y présente les différents articles de ce numéro, en soulignant que l'impact de la crise sur les organes et les processus de la négociation collective est déterminé par des facteurs économiques et politiques et surtout par le cadre institutionnel des relations professionnelles. Les réponses apportées par les syndicats s'expliquent par l'utilisation variant de deux sources stratégiques de pouvoir: la participation à la négociation collective formelle (pouvoir institutionnel) et un renforcement de la base (pouvoir des affiliés). En dépit des différences considérables entre les pays en ce qui concerne ces facteurs, les évolutions récentes en matière de négociation collective ont eu tendance à dépendre de leurs choix historiques et ont abouti à un glissement ultérieur des relations professionnelles de la région vers le néo-libéralisme.</p>

<p>Dieser Beitrag untersucht die Folgen der jüngsten Wirtschaftskrise auf die Arbeitsbeziehungen in den mittel- und osteuropäischen Mitgliedstaaten (MOEL) der EU. Für die Analyse wird der theoretische Rahmen herangezogen, der drei Arten von Kapitalismus in den MOEL unterscheidet: Neoliberalismus, “eingebetteter” Neoliberalismus und Neokorporatismus (Bohle und Greskovits, 2012). Als Einführung in die Einzelbeiträge dieser Ausgabe wird argumentiert, dass die Auswirkungen der Krise auf die Tarifverhandlungsprozesse und -einrichtungen durch wirtschaftliche und politische Faktoren und – ganz besonders – durch die institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen der Arbeitsbeziehungen beeinflusst werden. Die Reaktionen der Gewerkschaften werden durch Unterschiede beim Einsatz von zwei strategischen Machtressourcen erklärt: einerseits die Teilnahme an formalen Tarifverhandlungen (institutionelle Macht) und andererseits die Stärkung der Mitgliederbasis (Mitgliedschaftsmacht). Trotz erheblicher Unterschiede zwischen den Ländern in Bezug auf diese Faktoren sind während der Wirtschaftskrise pfadabhängige Tarifentwicklungen zu beobachten, die in dieser Region zu einer weiteren Verlagerung der Arbeitsbeziehungen hin zum Neoliberalismus geführt haben.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The global economic and financial crisis that hit Europe in autumn 2008 and is currently bringing the euro area to the brink of collapse has affected industrial relations in EU Member States to different extents. Social partner and government responses to the downturn have varied widely. At the onset of the crisis, faced by plummeting industrial output and soaring unemployment, governments responded by implementing a mix of different measures in the fields of industry, employment, labour markets and fiscal policy. Social partners played a crucial role in drafting and implementing measures to maintain and promote employment and to mitigate the negative social consequences of redundancies. Instruments such as short-time working aimed at maintaining employment by flexibly reducing working time, subsidized wages to maintain purchasing power, and additional vocational training were implemented via collective bargaining in a number of EU countries.</p>
<p>In those countries where collective bargaining is centralized at inter-sectoral or sectoral level and effectively coordinated between levels, social partners were better able to respond to the crisis, having available a broader set of instruments and measures. The crisis thus increased the use of collective bargaining as an instrument to tackle the economic downturn. By contrast, in countries where collective bargaining takes place exclusively or primarily at company level, social partner organizations did not play a prominent role in finding solutions to the crisis, with individual and management-led, company-specific measures prevailing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1024258913480716">Glassner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480716">European Commission, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1024258913480716">Glassner and Keune, 2012</xref>). This is particularly true for the central and eastern European (CEE) countries where collective bargaining was, in some cases, further weakened during the recent downturn. While the bulk of research has focused on western European countries (hereafter EU-15), the changing power constellations between social partners and state actors underlying collective bargaining and social dialogue in CEE countries (hereafter EU-10) have been much less systematically considered. This issue aims to contribute to the closing of this research gap by presenting developments in industrial relations in the EU-10 against the background of E(M)U accession and the current financial crisis, using both single country case studies and comparative multi-country (or -sector) studies</p>
<p>This article aims to develop a common theoretical framework, providing the context for the individual contributions found in this issue. By drawing on the typology of CEE capitalism defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1024258913480716">Bohle and Greskovits (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480716">2012</xref>), industrial relations regimes in the EU-10 are classified and assumptions made on developments in collective bargaining and social dialogue under current economic conditions. As an important caveat, it should be borne in mind that Bohle and Greskovits’ typology of ‘neoliberal’, ‘embedded neoliberal’ and ‘neocorporatist’ capitalism is conceived as a macro-framework of central and eastern European political economies that has to be <italic>extended</italic> to allow the classification of industrial relations regimes.</p>
<p>Social partner responses addressing the labour market effects of the crisis were shaped by three main factors: (i) the depth of the economic crisis, (ii) the institutional set-up of industrial relations, and (iii) government decisions. Based on a conceptual framework that allows these three factors to be correlated with a particular type of industrial relations regime and the empirical findings gained in the single and multiple country (and/or sector) studies, this article aims to shed light on the following research questions.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>How did socio-economic change resulting from the current financial crisis affect industrial relations in the EU-10? Of what nature were changes in the procedural terms of bargaining, in particular with regard to decentralization and disorganization of collective bargaining?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>How did differences in the set-up of industrial relations between the EU-10 countries affect trade union responses to the socio-economic challenges?</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The article is structured as follows. The first section describes the most important characteristics of industrial relations in the EU-10, making use of a heuristic typology of labour relations in central and eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1024258913480716">Bohle and Greskovits, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480716">2012</xref>). Section 2 looks at the different national forms of industrial relations in the CEE countries. Differences in access to institutional and membership resources are sought in explanation of unions’ strategic responses to the economic downturn (Section 3). The impact of the current crisis on industrial relations is addressed in Section 4, considering country- and/or sector-specific characteristics in terms of exposure to the global economic crisis and industrial relations institutions. In addition, the section looks at the responses of social partners and policy actors to the crisis, highlighting the differences between the three types of CEE industrial relations models. Section 5 offers a conclusion.</p>

<title>Three types of CEE industrial relations regimes</title>
<p>Industrial relations in Europe are characterized by growing diversity. The EU enlargements of 2004 and 2007 resulted in a further increase in the heterogeneity in labour relations and welfare regimes. In the central western European Member States, multi-employer bargaining, with the sectoral level being most important, is predominant. In most central western and northern European countries, collective bargaining is effectively coordinated between bargaining levels, while in southern Europe bargaining coordination is less effective (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1024258913480716">Traxler et al., 2001</xref>). Social partner involvement in public policy-making is highly institutionalized and regularized. Compared to EU-15 countries (with the exception of the UK, and Ireland), industrial relations in the EU-10 (with the exception of Slovenia) are characterized by weaker organized employers and unions, more fragmented and decentralized bargaining, limited bargaining autonomy of employer associations and trade unions, and a strong role of the state in wage policies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1024258913480716">Marginson and Traxler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480716">European Commission, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although industrial relations regimes differ greatly within the CEE region, mirroring the situation found in the EU-15, attempts to differentiate between variants of the ‘transitional model’ of CEE industrial relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1024258913480716">Kohl and Platzer, 2007</xref>) have only rarely been made. Among the attempts to analyse and understand capitalist diversity in eastern Europe, the three types of CEE capitalism defined by Bohle and Greskovits (2007) seem to be a worthwhile concept. In contrast to standard ‘Varieties of Capitalism’ approaches (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1024258913480716">Hall and Soskice, 2001</xref>), the authors highlight first the crucial role of the state in creating welfare and industrial relations institutions, and secondly the international integration of the region’s institutions and their exposure to pressures from international markets, the EU and multinational companies (MNCs). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480716">Bohle and Greskovits (2012)</xref> distinguish between three types of political economy in the EU-10 countries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480716">Table 1</xref>): (i) the neoliberal form of capitalism found in Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania, characterized by a minimalist fiscal policy regime and a residual welfare state, a non-accommodating monetary policy approach, strong dependence on foreign direct investment (FDI), and MNCs in low-tech and low-skilled manufacturing and services sectors; (ii) the embedded neoliberal model found in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia and featuring a segmented welfare regime that provides for targeted welfare services, fiscal austerity and monetary stability (with the exception of Hungary), and considerable dependence on FDI and foreign MNCs, in particular in higher-skilled manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry; and (iii) the neocorporatist type of a coordinated market economy represented by Slovenia and characterized by monetary stability and fiscal austerity (however to a lesser degree than in the other EU-10 countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1024258913480716">Stanojevíc and Klarič, 2013</xref>) and limited dependence on FDI and MNCs. Since Bohle and Greskovits’ typology represents a macro-framework defining the various forms of CEE capitalism, it has to be adapted to allow the classification of industrial relations in the EU-10. Three dimensions are key in this respect: first, the principal bargaining level(s) and coordination between levels; secondly, the role of government in wage bargaining; and thirdly, trade union strength. Although the three dimensions sometimes vary considerably within country clusters, specific patterns in the configuration of industrial relations between clusters are discernible.</p>

<p>Within the neoliberal cluster of countries collective bargaining is fragmented, taking place predominantly at company level in the Baltic countries. This contrasts to the situation in Romania and Bulgaria where a mixture of sectoral and company-level bargaining (with sectoral bargaining being particularly widespread in Romania) predominates. Another difference concerns trade union strength; while unions in Bulgaria and, even more so, in Romania are able to make use of membership power (both in terms of union density and mobilization for industrial action), union density rates in the Baltic countries are the lowest in the EU (see Section 2).</p>
<p>Internal differences within the embedded neoliberal cluster of countries are considerable in terms of principal bargaining levels and coordination; while a mixture of sectoral and company-level bargaining prevails in the Czech Republic and Hungary, sectoral bargaining is more widespread in Slovakia, where company bargaining freedom is limited. By contrast, bargaining takes place almost exclusively at company level in Poland. However, in all countries of the embedded neoliberal type, trade unions tend to be weak both in terms of union density and mobilization power (see Sections 2 and 3).</p>
<p>Differences within and between country clusters are less striking with regard to the degree of government intervention in wage bargaining (European Commission, 2012). In both the neoliberal and the embedded neoliberal groups of countries state intervention is limited. For instance, the government may define price ceilings, tax measures, minimum wages and/or public sector wages (setting the pattern for wages in other sectors), or provide a framework for the information and consultation of social partners in wage policies. This contrasts to the strong and direct role of the state in wage bargaining in Slovenia where the government and the social partners negotiate central agreements.</p>
<p>A general trend seen in all three clusters is the decentralization of collective bargaining (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1024258913480716">European Commission, 2011</xref>). Bargaining decentralization was most striking in Slovenia’s neocorporatist industrial relations model, where collective bargaining was previously for the most part centralized. What we are now seeing is a shift away from economy-wide negotiations to sectoral, and, increasingly, company-level bargaining.</p>

<sec id="section3-1024258913480716">
<title>Differences in industrial relations between the EU-10 countries</title>
<p>This section aims to shed some light on differences in collective bargaining systems within the CEE region, looking at such features as trade union and employer organization density, the predominant bargaining level, the degree of bargaining coordination, legal provisions for the extension of collective agreements and their use, and bargaining coverage rates. In addition, strike activity is considered as an indicator of union mobilization power.</p>
<p>Net union density (measuring membership as a proportion of wage earners in employment) in the western European countries is on average higher than in the CEE countries, with Slovenia being the one exception (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1024258913480716">Figure 1</xref>). Since 2000, trade union density has declined throughout the EU (with the exception of Belgium). However, the trend towards dwindling employee unionization has been more pronounced in the CEE countries where average union density shrunk from around 30 per cent to below 20 per cent between 2000 and 2008, with the decline largest in Lithuania and Slovakia. The causes are manifold. In addition to the general trend towards de-industrialization, growing unemployment and extensive migration to western Europe, legal obstacles to the recognition of trade unions, lack of institutional support of unions in key policy fields such as collective bargaining and the marginalization of unions in political decision-making all contribute to unions’ waning organizational power.</p>

</fig>
<p>Likewise, employers are more strongly organized in the EU-15 than in the EU-10 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1024258913480716">Figure 2</xref>). On average, almost two-thirds of all employees in the western EU countries were working in companies affiliated to an employer organization, while the respective figure was below 40 per cent in the EU-10 in 2008. Organizational strength was most limited in Poland, Lithuania and Estonia in 2008 at around 20 per cent, while Romania, Bulgaria and Slovenia featured density rates of 55–60 per cent. Employer organization density shrunk most in Slovenia, following abolition of obligatory membership in the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in 2006. Factors such as weakly established (bipartite) collective bargaining at sectoral and national level and the politicized role of social partner organizations in public policy-making have contributed to the withdrawal of employers from collective interest representation in the CEE region.</p>

</fig>
<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1024258913480716">Figure 3</xref> indicates, collective bargaining coverage is on average lower in the EU-10 than in the EU-15. While in the latter, 70 per cent of workers were on average covered by at least one collective agreement in 2008, the respective proportion among employees in the EU-10 was around 30 per cent. Bargaining coverage is however remarkably high in Slovenia (90 per cent) and Romania (70 per cent), where collective bargaining is conducted primarily at industry level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480716">Table 1</xref>). Within the EU-10, bargaining coverage shrunk most in Slovakia, Bulgaria and Slovenia, i.e. by around 10 percentage points, between 2000 and 2008.</p>

</fig>
<p>Trade union organizational strength (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1024258913480716">Figure 1</xref>) and mobilizing power also vary widely within the EU-10. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1024258913480716">Figure 4</xref> indicates, strike activity, measured as the ‘days not worked’ (DNW) rate, tended on average to be lower in the EU-10 countries than in the other EU countries in the period between 2000 and 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1024258913480716">Vandaele, 2011</xref>). The ‘adjusted’ average (substituting the statistical outliner year by the average over the entire period) provides a more levelled measure. Despite the lack of data for a number of countries (i.e. Bulgaria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic), differences in trade union organizational strength can be related to the adapted typology of CEE industrial relations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480716">Table 1</xref>). Accordingly, within the EU-10, the strike rate was highest in Romania, the country featuring the highest union density and mobilization power among all countries in both the neoliberal and the embedded neoliberal clusters. By contrast, in Latvia, no day was lost due to strikes, and for Estonia and Slovakia the respective average figures were one and two. In the years of the economic crisis, i.e. 2009 to 2011, no clear pattern of strike activity was observable. On average (in the countries for which data are available), it receded in Spain and dropped sharply in Denmark, remained stable in Belgium and the UK, and soared in Sweden, Ireland and Finland. Within the EU-10, the average DNW rate in the 2009–2011 period was five days in Hungary and just one day in Poland. Despite the lack of (recent) data, it is estimated that strike activity was very limited in countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovakia in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1024258913480716">Myant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1024258913480716">Meardi, 2012</xref>).

<title>Factors driving trade union responses to the crisis in central and eastern Europe</title>
<p>With the aim of providing a more differentiated and substantiated account of responses to the current recession by CEE trade unions, this issue analyses developments in collective bargaining and social dialogue in the EU-10 by considering key factors in the socio-economic sphere (i.e. the internationalization of product and labour markets, E(M)U accession), characteristics of and changes in the political system, the institutional set-up of industrial relations and, dependent on these macro-level factors, interaction between the state, employer associations and trade unions to address the effects of the crisis. In a process-oriented analysis, procedural and substantial changes in collective bargaining processes and outcomes are investigated. Departing from the central assumption that trade unions – as intermediary organizations – are dependent on two main types of power, institutional and membership power, to ensure effective collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1024258913480716">Schmitter and Streeck, 1999</xref>), different power configurations can be perceived within the EU-10, and thus varying capabilities for trade union action (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1024258913480716">Table 2</xref>). Institutional power is derived from a supportive institutional setting allowing such concepts as multi-employer bargaining (MEB) and the legal enforceability and extension of collective agreements. In addition, trade unions’ organizational strength and their capacity to mobilize members, workers and citizens (membership power) determine their ability to pursue collective action based on solidarity.</p>

<p>Differences in union power can be linked to the extended types of CEE industrial relations (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1024258913480716">Table 1</xref>). While in the Visegrad countries (CZ, PL, HU and SK) with their ‘embedded neoliberal’ type of industrial relations, institutional power is comparably high due to the existence, at least in some sectors, of industry-level bargaining, legal provisions to extend collective agreements (with the exception of Poland), and to a certain extent the regularized participation of the social partners in public policy-making, their membership power, measured as union density and strike rates, is low. This contrasts to power constellations in Bulgaria and Romania, two countries characterized by neoliberal industrial relations regimes, where institutional power is limited due to the highly politicized participation of the social partners in political decision-making and the lack of legal mechanisms to extend collective agreements, or, as is the case in Bulgaria, the rare use of such provisions. However, union density and the power to mobilize workers are traditionally high in these countries. In Romania, union membership even increased between the mid-2000s and 2008 due to the comparable importance of industry-level bargaining and union strength at the shop floor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1024258913480716">Trif, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1024258913480716">Eurofound, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1024258913480716">Meardi, 2012</xref>). By contrast, trade unions in the Baltic countries have to cope with a lack of both institutional (the most decentralized collective bargaining within the EU-10, low bargaining coverage and a strikingly weak position of trade unions vis-à-vis the state and employers) and membership power. Only in Slovenia, where neocorporatist industrial relations prevail, are unions able to draw on sufficient resources both in terms of institutional and membership power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1024258913480716">Stanojević, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the specific configuration of power within national industrial relations, the following <italic>assumptions</italic> on trade unions’ capacity to respond to the crisis are made. First, the more institutional power derives from supportive industrial relations, the higher the probability is that unions will make use of collective bargaining as a crisis-management instrument. Thus, unions from countries belonging to the ‘embedded neoliberal’ cluster can be expected to enter more frequently into negotiations with employers on labour market challenges in the current downturn than trade unions from countries featuring neoliberal industrial relations. In Poland, where collective bargaining is decentralized and rules for the extension of collective agreements are lacking, unions may instead resort to tripartite discussions with the state and employers at national level, using collective bargaining only in those sectors where such institutions exist. Secondly, the lower institutional power and the higher trade union membership power are (as is the case with unions in Romania and Bulgaria), the higher is the probability that trade unions will attempt to mobilize workers and campaign against austerity measures implemented unilaterally by the state. The Baltic unions’ capacity to respond to the crisis is severely limited due to their weak position in terms of both institutional and membership power. By contrast, both strategies, i.e. collective bargaining and the mobilization of workers, can be expected to be deployed by unions in Slovenia.</p>

<title>Impacts of the crisis on industrial relations and responses by trade unions</title>
<p>Trade union ability to cope with the effects of the crisis is assumed to vary within the EU-10 according to their ability to leverage institutional and membership power (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1024258913480716">Table 2</xref>). In the following sub-sections trade union responses to the crisis, as presented in this issue, are briefly summarized. In addition, some of the preliminary effects of crisis-induced change on industrial relations and bargaining practices are outlined.</p>
<sec id="section6-1024258913480716">
<title>Crisis effects and social partner responses in the ‘embedded neoliberal’ type of industrial relations</title>
<p>Among the Visegrad countries, characterized by comparably favourable industrial relations systems, responses based on collective bargaining were most far-reaching in Slovakia (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1024258913480716">Kahancová, 2013</xref>). In reaction to the crisis, the social partners in the automotive sector introduced flexible working time accounts (‘Flexikonten’), a measure later included in the 2009 national anti-crisis package. In addition, an agreement on short-time working was reached in the metalworking sector. Even in the public health care sector, already hit by budget constraints before the crisis, social partners continued their practice of collective bargaining, and in some cases even agreed on wage increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1024258913480716">Kaminska and Kahancová, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1024258913480716">Kahancová and Szabó, 2012</xref>) and new provisions such as training measures. Strikingly, a stark difference was observed between tripartite concertation at national level and bargaining at sector level. Despite the conclusion of the anti-crisis pact, the crisis has further undermined the effective participation of the social partners in policy-making, and access to institutional resources has become highly politicized (e.g. the introduction of <italic>erga omnes</italic> procedures was revoked by the new conservative government in 2010). In the Czech Republic where bargaining is more decentralized, a marked increase in agreements ensuring the implementation of flexible working time accounts was observed in the foreign-dominated electronics and automotive industry (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1024258913480716">Myant, 2013</xref>). Unions were more sceptical towards flexible working time accounts than their counterparts in Slovakia, and bargaining was more conflictual at both national and company levels. However, as in the neighbouring country, labour protests and mobilization were limited, with unions preferring to pursue a strategy protecting highly skilled core workforces while non-standard workers such as agency workers remained excluded.</p>
<p>In Poland, hardly affected at all by the global recession, national-level negotiations resulted in the most comprehensive bilateral social partner agreement since the early years of transition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1024258913480716">Meardi and Trappmann (2013)</xref> and Bernaciak’s comparison of social dialogue in Poland and Bulgaria (2013)). However, when only parts of the agreement were adopted as law, unions voiced their discontent without however mobilizing their members for industrial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1024258913480716">Meardi and Trappmann, 2013</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1024258913480716">Bernaciak, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1024258913480716">Gardawski et al., 2012</xref>). In manufacturing, the sector most severely affected by the crisis, provisions on the flexibilization of working time were included in company agreements, in particular in the heavily organized automotive industry, often in exchange for job guarantees. In the short term, the crisis promoted cooperation between unions and employers in the sector, with both parties lobbying the government to rescue ailing companies. However, the crisis did not lead to any revival of sectoral collective bargaining. Even in the steel industry, where collective bargaining is firmly established, ongoing privatization was stepped up during the recession, resulting in a further flexibilization of working conditions and job cuts. In the retail sector, where bargaining structures are lacking at sectoral level and low-paid and temporary employment is widespread, unions resorted to mass media campaigns. In some cases these helped to achieve pay increases and restrict temporary employment (see Mrozowicki et al.’s comparative analysis of trade union responses to precarious employment in Estonia, Slovenia and Poland, 2013). It seems that unions in sectors with the most fragmented or even lacking collective bargaining institutions, such as the retail sector, are – with increasing success – resorting to organizing initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1024258913480716">Meardi, 2012</xref>: 140).</p>
<p>In Hungary, political change in the wake of the 2010 general election resulted in the dismantlement of tripartite bargaining, restrictions on the right to industrial action and fundamental changes in the Labour Code promoting the decentralization and flexibilization of collective bargaining (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1024258913480716">Szabó, 2013</xref>). At sectoral level, two main trends were observed. First, in the private sector, where fragmented single-employer bargaining prevails, trade unions resorted to concession bargaining, accepting wage restraint in exchange for the protection of the jobs of mostly highly skilled, unionized workers, whereas temporary and unskilled workers were excluded from negotiated responses. Secondly, in the public sector, subject to strict governmental austerity, a centralization of bargaining was observed, accompanied by direct state intervention in wage setting and resulting in an increase of minimum wages while the salaries of higher qualified staff were frozen.</p>

<title>Disruption of collective bargaining and social dialogue in the neoliberal industrial relations regimes</title>
<p>In Romania, the deterioration of public finances and the country’s dependence on international financial institutions at the onset of the European debt crisis in 2010 resulted in the implementation of far-reaching austerity measures, including cuts in public sector pay. The government’s austerity policies, often implemented unilaterally, had a deep impact on industrial relations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1024258913480716">Trif, 2013</xref>). Reforms of the Labour Code and the collective bargaining system increased uncertainty among social partners and led to the disruption of industry-level bargaining. Even in the construction sector where collective bargaining was firmly established, uncertainty with regard to changes in the legal basis for industry-level bargaining brought collective bargaining to a halt and hampered company-level negotiations. Furthermore, trade unions were weakened by changes in the legal requirements for representativeness. In response to the government’s austerity drive, unions were able to organize public sector strikes, though these were unsuccessful in reversing wage and employment cuts. A different pattern of crisis responses was seen in Bulgaria, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1024258913480716">Bernaciak (2013</xref>). At the onset of the crisis a revival of tripartite consultation and bipartite social dialogue between organized business and labour was observed, resulting in the conclusion of a crisis pact in early 2010. However, measures promoted by trade unions and employer organizations such as temporary wage subsidies for companies hit by declines in turnover and provisions to enhance training were poorly implemented. The crisis resulted in a shift of power to the government, and further weakened the position of organized labour and business in Bulgarian tripartism. Rather than being an instrument to deal with labour market and economic challenges, social dialogue was used by a contested government to prevent social discontent. In the Baltic countries, where formal structures for social dialogue are in place but effective social partner involvement in public policy-making is limited (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1024258913480716">Woolfson et al., 2011</xref>), the crisis resulted in a further weakening of unions. Tripartite agreements concluded in all three countries mainly targeted wage restraint, the liberalization of industrial relations, cuts in social welfare spending and a further flexibilization of labour markets. However, measures to support redundant workers and companies suffering declines in turnover were absent, for the most part due to the lack of bargaining structures at sector level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1024258913480716">Kallaste and Woolfson, 2013</xref>). In Latvia, bailed out by the IMF and the EU in 2008, the public sector was the main target of unilateral wage cuts. The main trade union federations in Estonia and Lithuania mobilized workers for industrial action, without however succeeding in averting the government’s austerity measures, in many cases implemented unilaterally. Tripartite negotiations have since been practically abandoned, leading to the conclusion that social dialogue, previously illusory, has now completely disappeared. </p>

<title>Social partner responses to the crisis in Slovenia’s neocorporatist industrial relations regime</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1024258913480716">Stanojević and Klarič (2013</xref>), the crisis accelerated already existing trends. Neocorporatist industrial relations were endangered by continued and significant bargaining decentralization (in particular due to the abolition of the mandatory company membership in the Chamber of Industry and Commerce), the government’s withdrawal of organizational support and of social partner involvement in political decision-making, and initiatives targeting market liberalization, privatization and deregulation. During the recent economic downturn, reforms were often implemented unilaterally by the government. In response to government unilateralism, trade union militancy and radicalization have heightened. Tripartite negotiations were recently accompanied by a large public sector strike. In spite of the conflictual bargaining climate, the social partners and the government were able to conclude a national agreement, that however included pay cuts in the public sector. Accordingly, the authors are observing a gradual – though not all-encompassing – transformation of Slovenia’s neocorporatist industrial relations regime into a neoliberal one.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Social partner responses to the labour market effects of the crisis were shaped by three main factors: the depth of the economic crisis, the institutional set-up of industrial relations, and government decisions. It can therefore be assumed that social partner responses would vary dependent on the type of industrial relations regime, as derived from the typology of CEE capitalism defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1024258913480716">Bohle and Greskovits (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480716">2012</xref>). However, while the framework covers different trajectories of economic development and crisis, i.e. a production crisis in the embedded neoliberal and a financial crisis in the neoliberal Baltic countries and Bulgaria, it has to be adapted in two respects to allow for a classification of EU-10 industrial relations regimes and to explain change and crisis-related developments. First, specific industrial relations features accounting for differences within country clusters, and secondly, different sources of trade union institutional power have to be considered. </p>
<p>Empirical findings on recent developments in the EU-10 indicate that the triple typology of neoliberal, embedded neoliberal and neocorporatist industrial relations wields a certain amount of predictive and explanatory power. In line with Bohle and Greskovits, ‘both the persistence of diversity, and a clear shift of all new regimes ... in the neoliberal direction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1024258913480716">Bohle and Greskovits, 2012</xref>: 267) are found. For instance, in the Visegrad countries featuring the ‘embedded neoliberal’ type of industrial relations, the crisis resulted in a significant short-term change in the substantive outcomes of negotiated social partner responses, without bringing about procedural change in collective bargaining. Instead a difference was observed between sectors where collective bargaining is firmly established and trade unions are strong and those where union representation is fragmented and industry-level collective bargaining is lacking. Likewise, in the Baltic countries with their neoliberal type of industrial relations, the crisis did not significantly alter established development trajectories, with continuing fragmented and highly politicized social dialogue and a further marginalization of the weak Baltic unions.</p>
<p>However, specific features of industrial relations, often varying at national level, account for path-dependent developments and are crucial in explaining crisis-induced change in collective bargaining and social dialogue in the EU-10. In Bulgaria, in contrast to the Baltic countries, a facade of tripartism was maintained, though largely precluding social partner influence in crisis management. Recent developments in Romania, where industry-level bargaining was widespread and union power considerable, might possibly indicate ‘path-breaking’ change, with government intervention in industrial relations far-reaching and impeding collective bargaining at all levels. In Slovenia with its increasingly fragile neocorporatist industrial relations, the crisis has accelerated ongoing trends towards a decentralization of collective bargaining and the gradual weakening of social partners vis-à-vis the state. Despite this development, social partners were however able to address the effects of the crisis by both collective bargaining and the mobilization of workers and citizens against public austerity and government unilateralism.</p>
