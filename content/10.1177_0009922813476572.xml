PCPs preparedness to care for various conditions ranged from 96% for asthma to 53% for spina bifida. Familiarity with programs ranged from 89% for Early Intervention to 4% to 22% for the state’s waiver programs. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Most PCPs did not want additional CYSHCN in their practices. Variation exists in PCP preparation to care for varying conditions and in familiarity with supportive programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN) are defined by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau as “those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, development, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children generally.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813476572">1</xref> (p138)</sup> They are a vulnerable population with many needs and many unmet needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813476572">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813476572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813476572">9</xref></sup> Conceptual models of health care delivery for CYSHCN must be able to supply all their health needs and control the burden to families, both financially and emotionally. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has provided the concept of a medical home, which is familiar to most of us by now. The most recent AAP initiative defines the medical home as a system of health care supports and services where the family and child are comfortable, welcomed, and recognized as partners in the health care process. This “place” provides care that is accessible, comprehensive, coordinated, compassionate, family-centered, community-based, and culturally effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813476572">10</xref></sup> The medical home model, when it has been implemented, has been shown to help children meet unmet needs, decrease utilization, and improve outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813476572">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813476572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813476572">15</xref></sup> Only half of CYSHCN, however, receive care that meets all 5 components established for the medical home, with most having a personal doctor or nurse but lacking care coordination. Of all CYSHCN who required care coordination, only about 40% reported it as adequate. Furthermore, among those who received care coordination, only half of families considered communication among their physicians to be good or excellent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813476572">13</xref></sup></p> <p>The cornerstone of the medical home concept has always been the patient’s primary care physician (PCP). Ideally, the PCP is well placed to be the focal point of all the child’s care. PCPs are knowledgeable about all the different aspects of the child’s health, have a personal relationship with the family, are more accessible than many of the child’s subspecialists, and can incorporate unique family situations into their decisions.</p> <p>There has been little attempt to both measure the willingness of primary care pediatricians (PCPs) to care for such children and determine which factors are associated with doing so. Moreover, there has not been an attempt to determine for which conditions PCPs feel more or less comfortable providing primary care and the state and federal programs with which they are most familiar.</p> <p>Therefore, in this study we assessed the capacities and attitudes of PCPs in caring for CYSHCN. Specific objectives were to measure the willingness of PCPs to accept CYSHCN into their practices, assess their comfort with certain conditions among CYSHCN, and determine with which programs for CSHCN they had familiarity.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was approved and exempted by the institutional review board at Children’s Memorial Hospital. A survey was mailed to all pediatricians listed as primary care physicians (PCPs) in the Illinois Chapter of American Academy of Pediatrics membership database during the period May 2008-June 2008. The survey drew in part from existing surveys, specifically New England SERVE and the Illinois Medical Home Project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813476572">16</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813476572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813476572">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The survey consisted of multipart questions, including provider characteristics and practice characteristics. Respondents were also asked to estimate the number of children, number of CYSHCN, and percentages of various racial and payer classes served by their practices. Participants were asked, “Would you like to increase the number of CYSHCN in your practice?” The 3 response choices, “Yes,” “Yes, with additional supports,” and “No” were replicated, with permission, from the New England SERVE survey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813476572">18</xref></sup> Participants also rated their preparation to care for children with 9 diagnoses and familiarity with 10 programs for CYSHCN on 4 Likert scales. The final survey took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete. Details of the methods and distribution can be found in previously published results using the same data set.</p>
<p>Personal and practice characteristics were recoded into categories meaningful for analysis. Stata 9.0 (College Station, TX) was used to derive basic descriptive data for Likert scale questions. χ<sup>2</sup> Analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to assess for statistical differences between responses for various subgroups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 1441 surveys sent, 501 surveys (35%) were returned and 376 of these were eligible for analyses. The characteristics of the final sample are shown, with comparison to available state and national data, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813476572">Table 1</xref>. We found that 13.6% of our sample were Illinois Title V medical home certified providers, compared with 4% of all Illinois pediatricians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813476572">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory assessment raises several issues relevant to providing high-quality care for CYSHCN. A majority of respondents stated that they do not want more CYSHCN in their practices. This sentiment is concerning, given the already high levels of unmet needs of this patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813476572">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813476572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813476572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813476572">9</xref></sup> Previous research has cited the most salient barriers as inadequate time, reimbursement, support services, knowledge of services available, and knowledge of billing and coding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813476572">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The finding that PCPs closer to residency are more receptive to taking CYSHCN may have several potential explanations. It may also be that pediatricians who have been in practice longer lack training with certain types of CYSHCN who are surviving with the help of newer technologies not widely in use when they were in residency. Perhaps existing continuing medical education is not adequately addressing the knowledge requirements for PCPs to care for these children effectively. In addition, the financial realities of caring for CYSHCN may be more apparent to those in practice longer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the finding that PCPs caring for intermediate numbers of CYSHCN were more willing to care for additional patients compared with those PCPs with fewer or more in their practices also has several potential explanations. Some PCPs who have few CYSHCN in their practices and do not want more might avoid caring for this population for various reasons. Providers caring for many CYSHCN but who do not want more may have saturated practices.</p>
<p>Another important finding of this study is that PCPs do not feel prepared to care for all types of CYSHCN equally. Perhaps this finding is simply because some conditions such as asthma are more prevalent in community practice than others such as spina bifida. Another possible explanation is that pediatric tertiary centers take on much of the responsibility of care coordination for children with certain diagnoses because of dedicated disease-specific programs and centers. Perhaps children with cystic fibrosis and spina bifida tend to be enrolled in center-based, specialist-run comprehensive care programs, leaving a diminished role—and level of perceived preparation—for the community PCP.</p>
<p>Similarly, the variation in familiarity between various state and federal programs for CYSHCN was vast. Only Early Intervention and the state Medicaid program were familiar to a majority of respondents, whereas the state’s Title V CYSHCN program, Supplemental Security Insurance, and a variety of Home and Community Based Waiver programs providing home-based services to children with disabilities at risk of institutionalization were mostly unfamiliar to respondents. Whether this unfamiliarity leads to patients not getting access to needed services is an important question for further investigation.</p>
<sec id="section5-0009922813476572">
<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>This study is exploratory and has several limitations. The limitations related to the data set and the distribution have been published in the previous article and are repeated here because of relevance. The sample was derived from 1 state, and responses may not be generalizable to different parts of the country. The response rate was 26%, similar to that in other studies that attempt to catch a large population of providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813476572">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813476572">26</xref></sup> However, we did not have comparison data for nonresponders. Whereas the racial mix of responders’ patients was similar to the state as a whole and the gender mix of responders was similar to pediatricians nationally, the payer mix of responder practices included more private insurance than national averages. Dues-paying AAP members and Title V program participants are oversampled; however, this may suggest that the unwillingness to care for additional CYSHCN may be underestimated by our sample. The study is subjective in nature and relies on PCP perceptions, and there was no formal validation process for the survey. Finally, the data rely on self-report of key variables like payer mix, number of CYSHCN, and so on and, thus, are subject to recall bias.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922813476572">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>This exploration raises questions about the willingness and abilities of PCPs to implement the medical home for all types of CYSHCN. Residency training, continuing medical education, and maintenance of certification requirements should emphasize the care of CYSHCN to ensure that PCPs can feel comfortable providing primary care to these children years after they leave residency. Further research should confirm that CYSHCN are distributed unevenly among PCPs and determine whether an unwillingness to care for them among some providers and a saturation of willing providers leads to diminished access. They should also investigate whether discomfort with providing care to children with certain conditions or unfamiliarity with certain programs for CYSHCN affects their quality of care.</p>
