  <body>
    <p>In December 2012 Narendra Modi joined a very selective club of non-Congress Chief Ministers:
      along with Jyoti Basu and, more recently, Navin Patnaik, he’s one of the few who have been
      re-elected twice. If we believe him, his success has to be attributed to his
      achievements—especially those in terms of development—whereas his detractors highlight more
      his authoritarian methods and his marketing techniques that the financial support of the
      corporate sector allows.</p>
    <p>Certainly, the BJP is winning the Gujarat elections since 1995—a record—by default, for
      political and social reasons: the Congress does not offer a very convincing alternative in the
      state and the low caste as well as Dalit parties<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2321023013482789">2</xref></sup>—which have played the role of game changers in
      the Hindi belt since the 1990s—are conspicuous by their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2321023013482789">Jaffrelot, 2012c</xref>). However, Narendra Modi’s last
      election campaign shows that he has also capitalized on a rather new and effective populist
      style and that he knows how to address issues that are causes for concern to the middle class,
      an expanding group that definitely is his constituency.</p>
    <p>This article, while it will pay attention to the opposition parties—the Congress and the
      GPP—intends, in its first part, to scrutinize the mainstays of Modi’s election campaign in
      technical terms, with special references to high tech populism, as well as in thematic terms
      with special references to his banalization of Hindutva, his notion of Gujarati patriotism and
      his defence of what he calls the ‘neo-middle class’. The second part, that is dealing with the
      electoral results and the citizens’ voting behaviour, will indeed show that Modi’s
      constituency is a by-product of a very polarized pattern of economic growth, the BJP receiving
      an increasingly important support from urban dwellers, whatever their caste, gender and level
      of education may be.</p>
    <sec id="section1-2321023013482789">
      <title>The Electoral Campaign: High Tech Populism Takes Over</title>
      <p>The BJP has inherited from the RSS a collective ethos that reflects the motto of the Sangh:
        organization first (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2321023013482789">Jaffrelot,
          1999</xref>). This emphasis on the organization (the ‘sangathan spirit’) explains the
        resilience of the Sangh Parivar and the way it has contained factionalism, in contrast to
        the situation prevailing in the Shiv Sena (whose division was largely due to the
        personalization and patrimonialization orchestrated by Bal Thackeray). But Narendra Modi, in
        spite of his past records as an RSS pracharak, has turned his back on the team spirit and
        has personalized politics within the BJP as early as 2002 at the expense of the old organic
        relations between the party and the RSS.</p>
      <sec id="section2-2321023013482789">
        <title>Modi vs the Sangh Parivar?</title>
        <p>In 2007 already, the Swayamasevaks had not been asked by Nagpur to canvass systematically
          in favour of Modi in Gujarat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2321023013482789">Jaffrelot, 2009</xref>). Five years later, the gap between him and the RSS had widened.
          The Sangh parivar local leaders resent the way their movements have been sidelined by the
          Chief Minister. In ten years or so the number of Shakhas has diminished from 1,500 to one
          thousand and attendance is ‘down by an estimated 50 per cent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2321023013482789">Umat, 2012a</xref>). In the early years of the last
          decade, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had 94,000 members—it has retained
          half of them only. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS)—which had 22.5 lakh members in 2003—is
          only 6 lakh large today. This trend is sometimes due to issue-based conflicts (for
          instance Modi has fought against the BKS after the organization mobilized farmers on the
          electricity issue—we’ll return to the problem that Modi has with the rural part of
          Gujarat). But it reflects also his will to emancipate himself from the BJP’s
          fellow-travellers (Pravin Togadia, the VHP leader was, for instance, totally
          marginalized).</p>
        <p>Not a team player within his own Hindutva family, Modi has antagonized former colleagues
          like Sanjay Joshi, his main rival in the Sangh Parivar of Gujarat, whom he has had
          expelled from the BJP National Executive in 2012. His non-accommodative attitude is also
          one of the reasons why former Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel—Modi’s predecessor—started a
          new political party, the Gujarat Parivartan Party (GPP) with other dissidents in spite of
          his age (he was 84).</p>
        <p>But the RSS is clearly facing a dilemma. On the one hand the Sangh which works
          collegially and insists on the merger of egos in the organization resents Modi’s style and
          on the other hand he’s one of their best winning cards. Therefore the doors were, and
          still are, apparently wide open for talks. On October 21, 2012 Modi argued his case in
          Nagpur for three hours to contain the influence of his detractors (Joshi, Togadia and
          Keshubhai Patel). We do not know what has been the outcome of these in-camera meetings,
          but in Gujarat, Modi could not fully rely on the support of the RSS volunteers who either
          abstained from taking part in the campaign or supported Keshubhai—they often did it as old
          colleagues of the veteran politician.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2321023013482789">3</xref></sup> Incidentally, Keshubhai Patel left the BJP precisely because of the
          ‘self-centred’ style of functioning of Modi. Talking to VHP members he said: <disp-quote>
            <p>When he [Modi] took over the state BJP, I told him that this race is altogether
              different. It’s called a ‘relay race’, in which the baton is handed over from one
              participant to the other. Each one uses his strength and ultimately the team wins, not
              an individual. But since Modi took the baton in this relay race, he has never passed
              it on. He refuses to loosen his grasp over the party. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482789"><italic>Ahmedabad Mirror</italic>, October 24,

      <sec id="section3-2321023013482789">
        <title>Modi’s Populism</title>
        <p>Narendra Modi is probably the only electorally successful BJP Chief Minister who
          canvasses without a large RSS support. As mentioned above, he had already been largely
          deprived of the RSS network in 2007. In fact, he had then voluntarily emancipated himself
          from the Sangh parivar. These push and pull factors—the RSS distancing and his own sense
          of independence—have had cumulative effects and resulted in the making of a new brand of
          populism: In 2012 again, he personalized his election campaign, so much so that the party
          was hardly mentioned and no other state leader was on stage. He projected himself as the
          embodiment of Gujarat and—like any populist—tried to establish a direct contact with each
          and every Gujarati.</p>
        <sec id="section4-2321023013482789">
          <title>High Tech Image Building: From Yatra Politics to Holograms</title>
          <p>Like in 2007, Modi started his electoral campaign weeks—if not months—before the others
            by resorting to Yatra politics. By October 9, his Swami Vivekananda Yuva Vikas Yatra was
            over—he had held 135 rallies in this framework. But touring the state was physically
            demanding and time consuming. Modi, therefore turned again to what I called ‘high tech
            populism’ in 2007. During the previous state elections, he had resorted to internet and
            mobile phones networks;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2321023013482789">4</xref></sup> five years later he made one step further while initiating a TV
            channel, NaMo channel—that replaced the ‘Vande Mataram’ he had started in 2007—and a
            series of virtual meetings: Modi’s hologram appeared on stage in 3D simultaneously in
            different locations (26 on December 2, for instance) to deliver his speeches to massive
            audiences which were mesmerized (some of his supporters even wondered: ‘Is this real?’).
            A hyper image-conscious Modi was capitalizing on the exceptional power of images in the
            Indian (Hindu?) civilization. According to an estimate, Modi intended to hold 132
            holographic shows during the election campaign in order to communicate directly with a
            larger number of citizens, at the cost of 150 crores of rupees, according to some
            estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2321023013482789">Nair, 2012</xref>).</p>
          <p>But Modi continued with more standard practices too—so much so that he addressed 125
            rallies in the first 15 days of December, that is ten meetings a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482789">Dave, K., 2012b</xref>). Even more than
            in 2007, Modi saturated the public space as a marketing genius—well advised by an
            American, APCO Worldwide firm which had already worked for him during the previous
            election. At that time, APCO, which had already tried to refurbish the image of the
            Nigerian dictator, Sani Abacha, of the life-president of Kazakhstan, Nazarbaiev and of
            the former Russian oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, had reshaped the image of Modi for
            25000 dollars a month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2321023013482789"><italic>The
                Times of India</italic>, October 17, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2321023013482789">5</xref></sup> We do not know what the budget of the 2012
            elections was but Modi has obviously spent more money than his rivals, probably thanks
            to the financial support of the corporate sector. The largest Indian companies have all
            invested in Gujarat more than before under Modi and their CEOs have been all praise for
            him during the recent meetings of ‘Vibrant Gujarat’, an annual function he had
            initiated.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="section5-2321023013482789">
          <title>The Father-like Protector of Gujarat Against the Centre</title>
          <p>Modi used these channels of communication to project the same messages as in 2007.
            Among them his attempt at epitomizing Gujarat—and more especially the ‘Gujarati asmita’
            (identity, soul)—against the Centre was a constant. He presented himself as the
            protector of Gujarat against the Union government. He claimed that he was ‘the
            chowkidaar’ of the Gujarat treasury, guarding it from the appetite of the Congress:
            ‘Earlier, this money used to get swallowed. <italic>Maaru koi Vhalu-dahalu
              nathi</italic> (I don’t have near and dear ones). The six crore Gujaratis are my
            family and their happiness is mine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2321023013482789"><italic>The Indian Express</italic>, November 30, 2012b</xref>). His dedication to
            his task of chief ministership and the sacrifices it implied, is one of his favourite
            themes. In another electoral speech he’ll say: ‘I am a labourer who has not taken a
            break for an hour in the past 11 years in order to work for the development of Gujarat’
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2321023013482789"><italic>The Indian
                Express</italic>, December 2, 2012d</xref>).</p>
          <p>During his campaign, he concentrated his attacks in this vein against the Congress-led
            government in New Delhi—as if the congressmen of Gujarat were not worth targeting, as if
            there was no other Gujarati leader except him and as if New Delhi was his final
            destination. He arraigned the inaction of Manmohan Singh—whom he called ‘Maun (silent)
            Mohan Singh’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2321023013482789"><italic>The Indian
                Express</italic>, October 30, 2012a</xref>). He accused him and Sonia of keeping mum
            about issues like inflation and poverty.</p>
          <p>He tried to cash in on the anti-corruption movement launched by Anna Hazare against the
            federal government in order to project himself as ‘Mr Clean’. In his speech concluding
            his Yatra he said: ‘Friends, in the last eight years, have you heard any good news
            coming out of Delhi? All that you get to hear about is corruption, scams and favouritism
              (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2321023013482789"><italic>The Indian
                Express</italic>, October 9, 2012c</xref>). In the same speech he claimed that he
            has been victimized by the Centre ‘Of all the Chief Ministers that the country has seen
            in the last 60 years, I have suffered the maximum injustice at the hands of the
            centre’.</p>

          <title>The Banalization of Hindutva</title>
          <p>Another aspect of Modi’s campaign which pertained as much to his style as to his
            message has to do with the Hindu/Muslim relations. He highlighted his record regarding
            law and order and communal harmony and even connected both in the speech he made in
            Ahmedabad in conclusion of his first Yatra in the most paradoxical way. Arguing that in
            the past ‘Ahmedabad’s identity was curfew’, he claimed that he has been the one who
            re-established peace. He conveniently forgot that he was at the helm of the state
            government when occurred the most bloody post-independence wave of communal violence
            that Ahmedabad had experienced and asked the audience: ‘It has been 11 years … has the
            curfew gone or not? Have the riots disappeared or not? …. Today we have embraced the
            road of peace and brotherhood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2321023013482789"><italic>The Indian Express</italic>, October 9, 2012</xref>). In order to project
            him as a friend of the Muslims too he launched another Yatra, the Sadbhavana Yatra. But
            in practice Modi’s election campaign was tainted with communal references—but not to the
            extent to the previous one, when he had tried to capitalize on the assassination of
            Sohrabuddin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2321023013482789">Jaffrelot, 2009</xref>)
            (one of Gujarat’s ‘fake encounters’—see below).</p>
          <p>In addition to Modi’s body language—and his propensity to wear saffron kurtas—his
            speeches were imbued with elements of the Hindutva rhetoric. Speaking before the Jain
            International Trade Organization (JITO), he accused the Centre for heavily subsidizing
            the opening of slaughter houses—a formula that was immediately translated as an attack
            against the cow in the media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482789"><italic>Ahmedabad Mirror</italic>, October 29, 2012</xref>). One of his supporters,
            the BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, went one step further by accusing Keshubhai Patel to eat
            gaumans (beef).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2321023013482789">6</xref></sup> The
            GPP leader retorted that the BJP was itself the ‘biggest killer of cows and the largest
            seller of gauchar’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2321023013482789">Dave,
              2012c</xref>).</p>
          <p>Modi, who received the support of another media savvy mass communicator, Swami
            Ramdev—who is closely related to the Sangh Parivar<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2321023013482789">7</xref></sup>—referred to the Hindu mythology during his
            meetings to counter Congressmen: ‘A Congress leader recently called me a monkey.
            Probably he hasn’t read the Ramayana or he would have known about the power of monkeys.
            I am Hanuman and six crores Gujarat is are my Ram whom I serve’ (<italic>The Times of
              India</italic>, November 19, 2012b). In a more communal vein, Modi attacked Ahmed
            Patel with some communal overtone after Sonia Gandhi’s right hand man, hailing from
            Gujarat, canvassed in his home state. He called him ‘Ahmedmian’ (Ahmed the Muslim) and
            tried to make people believe that the Congress had decided to project him as the party’s
            candidate for the post of Chief Minister: ‘Ahmedmian Patel says he does not want to be
            chief minister. But the Congress has already set the stage to make him the chief
            minister’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2321023013482789">Jha, 2012</xref>).
            Naturally, the Congress had no intention to project a Muslim leader in a state where, as
            Ganesh Devy says it is ‘natural’ to be anti-Muslim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2321023013482789">Devy, 2006</xref>)—an assessment that may be exaggerated
            so far as the countryside is concerned.</p>
          <p>In fact, the Congress nominated an unprecedented small number of Muslim candidates in
            2012—and the BJP, none (again), in spite of Modi’s Sadbhavna Yatra. The Muslim president
            of the party’s minority wing in Gujarat resigned in protest. Last but not least, the
            only mention of the Muslims in the BJP’s manifesto—and the first one in an election
            manifesto of the Gujarat BJP under Modi—referred to the modernization of the madrassahs
            and to financial support to artisanal specialities (like making of kites, incenses
            sticks, rakhi and fire crackers), two items that reinforced the stereotype of the Muslim
            as a backward community—nothing was said about the spending of the scholarship received
            by Gandhinagar from the Centre for the minorities and that the state government refused
            to disburse.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2321023013482789">8</xref></sup></p>
          <p>During the election campaign, the banalization of Hindutva in Gujarat was particularly
            evident from the fact that Amit Shah’s return to the state as Modi’s right hand man was
            hardly noticed. Amit Shah—a close associate of Modi, he was in charge of Home in his
            government till 2010—has been arrested, as a Minister of state, in 2010 because of his
            role in three allegedly fake encounters regarding Sohrabuddin Shaikh, his wife Kauserbi
            and their friend Tulsiram Prajapati. He spent three months in jail in Ahmedabad. On bail
            since then, he had not been allowed to return to Gujarat till November 2012. Then, he
            was re-elected in December last in one of Ahmedabad constituencies. But the Supreme
            Court has decided that his trial, along with those of a dozen of senior police officers
            who are implicated in several similar fake encounters cases, will take place in Mumbai
            because of pressures over the witnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2321023013482789">Samervel, 2010</xref>). Interestingly, nobody—neither
            among the media, nor among Modi’s political opponents—made an issue of the company he
            keeps to contest his ‘Mr. Clean’ image, probably because any defence of the minorities
            is self-defeating in Gujarat politics.</p>

          <title>Development for Who?—The Making of the ‘neo-middle class’</title>
          <p>The key word of Modi’s election campaign was ‘development’, like in 2007 when he
            projected himself as the ‘Vikas Purush’. But this time, he focussed more on the emerging
            urban middle class, a group that was called the ‘neo middle class’ in the BJP election
            manifesto which read: <disp-quote>
              <p>Due to development in Gujarat in the last 10 years, there has been substantial rise
                in this neo-middle class. We want to address their issues. We will form a committee
                to define this neo-middle class. We will try to give them benefits of government
                schemes. (<italic>The Times of India</italic>, December 4, 2012e)</p>
            </disp-quote></p>
          <p>Generally speaking, the BJP manifesto was more oriented towards the urban dwellers than
            before. Among the relevant items one can cite the promise to construct 50 lakh houses,
            the increase of the age limit for entry into government jobs from 25 to 28, English
            medium schools, ₹ 2000 crores for flyover and underpass in cities, the building of mono
            rails and BRTs (Bus Rapid Transfer System of Ahmedabad, also known as
              <italic>Janmarg</italic>) in places other than Ahmedabad (where these projects are
            already on) and insurance schemes. These are typically promises aiming at wooing the
            urban middle class. To the peasantry, the BJP had much less concrete things to say this
            time: a nutrition mission would be set up, the minimum wages of labourers would rise
            (but to what extent?), tapped water supply would be extended to villages and—that was
            more precise—₹ 1000 crore Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation (SAUNI) project would be
            implemented for filling up dams and water bodies of Saurashtra.</p>
          <p>To focus more on his urban support-base made a lot of sense for Modi. First the
            re-delimitation of the constituencies had increased the number of urban seats, in a
            state where the proportion of rural dwellers was declining anyway. Second, Modi’s
            policy, over the last 10 years, has benefited urban middle class more than anybody else.
            Gujarat ranks only tenth out of 21 states in terms of Human Development Index because
            some groups of rural Gujarat continue to lag behind (<italic>India, Human Development
              Report 2011: Towards Social Inclusion</italic>, 2011, p. 24). Indeed, Gujarat is a
            case of social polarization with new rich in the cities and most of the groups which are
            at the receiving end concentrated in the villages. The number of families below the
            poverty line has jumped from 23.39 lakhs in 2000 to 30.49 lakhs in July 2012 according
            to the Rural Development Commissioner (<italic>The Times of India</italic>, November 19,
            2012c). Unsurprisingly, 9 of the 11 lakh houses without electricity according to the
            Gujarat 2011 census are in rural areas. In terms of education, the excellent report of
            Pratham shows that rural Gujarat was lagging behind states like Haryana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-2321023013482789">9</xref></sup></p>
          <p>Dalits and Adivasis (respectively 11.3 and 16.5 per cent of the state population) are
            even more specifically affected. For instance, the percentage of tribal underweight
            children (0 to 5 years old) is much higher in Gujarat than the tribal average at the
            national level (64.5 per cent compared to 54.5 per cent). The under five mortality rate
            of tribal children is also much higher. Similarly, the percentage of Dalit participation
            in the NREGA programme is three times less in Gujarat (7.83 per cent) than in India at
            large (22.67 per cent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2321023013482789"><italic>Outlook</italic>, December 10, 2012</xref>, p. 38). In fact, development
            has meant socio-economic polarization, because Gujarat is a typical case of growth
            without development for all. The Gujarat chapter of the <italic>India Human Development
              Report 2011</italic> concluded ‘the high growth rate achieved by the state over the
            years has not percolated to the marginalized sections of society, particularly STs and
            SCs, to help improve their human development outcomes’ (p. 50).</p>

      <title>What Opponents?</title>
      <p>Opposition to Modi has been weak over the last ten years because of the inability of the
        Congress to put its house in order. First, there is an old contradiction between the
        discourse of the national leaders and that of the state leaders regarding the communal
        issue. In 2007, Sonia Gandhi had come to canvass in Gujarat and had lambasted Modi as a
        ‘merchant of death’ because of the 2002 pogrom, a formula that the Congress state leaders
        had found embarrassing because they feared it would alienate the Hindu voters. In 2012
        national leaders came again with a similar discourse, but they diluted it. Sonia Gandhi, who
        was the first national Congress leader to visit Gujarat, addressed peasant issues and did
        not attack Modi frontally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482789">Dave, H.
          2012a</xref>, p.1). The Delhi MP Sandeep Dixit described Modi as ‘a blot on the nation’
        and mentioned riots as well as fake encounters, but to the relief of the state leaders, he
        focussed more on the child mortality rate—saying that he would vote Modi the day this
        indicator improves significantly in Gujarat.</p>
      <p>Second, the Congress of Gujarat has a problem of leadership. Not only the self-proclaimed
        ‘captain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2321023013482789"><italic>The DNA</italic>,
          December 6, 2012a</xref>, p. 3) of the team, Shankar Sinh Vaghela comes from the RSS, but
        he’s locked in a competition with other—equally weak—state leaders like Arjun Modhwadia and
        Shaktisinh Gohil who, incidentally, lost their seats this time. None of these leaders have
        been projected as a contender for the post of CM because they all lack the needed charisma
        as well as authority and because that would have created an uproar from the other factions.
        Lastly, the Congress has been affected by badly managed ticket distribution that resulted in
        mini-riots at the party headquarters in Ahmedabad and in the defection of major Congress
        leaders who had been denied a ticket, like N. Amin (see below).</p>
      <p>In fact, the main opponent to Modi has been the octogenarian GPP leader, Keshubhai Patel
        who dared to attack the Chief Minister like no other politician had done so far—which made
        the campaign more lively and persuaded the media to do their job less complacently this
        time. Giving an ever more pronounced communal overtone to the campaign, Keshubhai said that
        Modi was ‘like Mohammed Ghaznavi’ because he had 200 Hindu temples demolished in Gandhinagar
        in the name of city beautification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2321023013482789"><italic>Ahmedabad Mirror</italic> October 24, 2012b</xref>, p. 8). He also compared
        Modi to General Dyer, the British officer who had been responsible for the massacre of
        Jallianwallah Bagh in 1919: ‘General Dyer killed 1,000 people, but Modi is responsible for
        the deaths of more than 39,000 people who have committed suicide due to unemployment and
        debt’ (<italic>The Times of India</italic>, November 19, 2012d). Last but not least,
        Keshubhai Patel also compared Modi and his clique to a ‘bunch of Dawoods’ (a reference to
        the mafia don Dawood Ibrahim) because of the ‘donations’ they extorted from the people
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2321023013482789"><italic>The DNA</italic> December 6,
          2012b</xref>, p. 3).</p>
      <p>Keshubhai Patel was that aggressive not only because he got the support of some Sangh
        parivar leaders as mentioned above, but also because he now represented something relevant
        in socio-economic terms: the rural sector that Modi had not treated as well as the cities,
        especially in Patel’s region, Saurashtra, where water had become an acute problem and where
        industry was lagging behind (<italic>The Times of India</italic>, November 6, 2012a). While
        the Narmada dam is providing drinking water to the cities, hundreds of villages have been
        ignored and, regarding irrigation, many of the minor and sub-minor canals which were
        supposed to be completed quickly according to Modi’s poll promises, are still to be
        built.</p>
      <p>To sum up, the 2012 state elections in Gujarat did not only represent a contrast between
        Modi’s personalized style of high tech populism and a less effective and united Congress and
        a former BJP veteran relying on less modern techniques, but also between different
        socio-political agendas. While Modi’s BJP represented the urban middle (and ‘neo-middle’)
        class, the Congress was relying more on the rural poor and Keshubhai on the farmers. The
        newcomer—Keshubhai Patel—was clearly a cause of concern for Modi who, in sharp contrast with
        what he did in 2007, retained most of the outgoing MLAs in order to play it safe and tried
        hard (rather successfully) to woo GPP and Congress dissidents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-2321023013482789">10</xref></sup></p>

          is partly due to the slightly better performance of the Congress and its ally, the NCP
          (the latter won 1 per cent of the valid votes which may be added to the Congress’ 39 per
          cent), but probably also to the competition of the GPP.</p>

          made inroads in the Congress support base is consistent with the fact that both parties
          were more rural than the BJP.</p>

        <title>The Plebeianization of the BJP in Terms of Castes—not Beyond the OBCs</title>
        <p>In terms of caste groups, the BJP has diversified its electoral base in a very
          significant manner—up to a point. In Gujarat, caste identities are more fluid and fuzzy
          than in the Hindi belt, but social hierarchies along those lines continue to prevail. At
          the top of the status-related pyramid Brahmins represent 3 per cent and the Vaishyas
          (including Jains), 3 per cent. Rajputs (known as Darbars), 6.52 per cent according to the
          2011 caste census,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2321023013482789">13</xref></sup> are
          less prestigious and more rustic—hence their alliance with some low caste groups to form
          the well-known caste federation called the ‘Kshatriyas’ in the 1950s–1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2321023013482789">14</xref></sup> This alliance categorized as
          made of OBCs was intended to contain the rise of the Patels, a dominant caste which
          represents about 15 per cent of the state population, but which is divided into, at least,
          two sub-groups, the Leuva Patels (a ‘superior’ category concentrated in Saurashtra) that
          represents 8.11 per cent of the state population and the Kadva Patels (6.42 per cent)
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2321023013482789">Yagnik, 2012</xref>). Then come
          other OBCs, of whom the Kolis who were not part of the Kshatriya coalition represent 7.79
          per cent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2321023013482789">15</xref></sup> Another OBC
          caste is made of the Thakors (7.67 per cent). Other OBCs form 12.4 per cent of the state
          population.</p>
        <p>While OBCs have the numbers, the Patels—who represent 21 to 46 per cent of the voters in
          12 constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2321023013482789">Umat, 2012b</xref>,
          p. 1)—have become powerful because of their economic achievements and their sense of
          organization. The Leuva Patels are particularly well structured under the banner of the
          Khodhaldham Trust Samaj which organized a massive Maha Arti in the presence of Keshubhai
          Patel, in October 2012, to celebrate the first day of Navratri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2321023013482789">Dave, H., 2012b</xref>, p. 2). Its president, Naresh Patel,
          was pressed to take side during the campaign but refrained from doing so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2321023013482789"><italic>The DNA</italic>, December 6,
            2012c</xref>, p. 1) and therefore the most frequently asked question during the campaign
          was: will the Leuva Patels support their veteran leader, Keshubhai or will they remain
          loyal to the BJP?</p>
        <p>The BJP has traditionally been associated with the upper castes and the Patels. Under
          Modi, it has remained identified with the Patels (in 2007 33 per cent of the party MLAs
          were Patels—against 29 per cent in 1998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2321023013482789">Desai and Shah, 2009</xref>, p. 199). In 2012, the BJP
          nominated a large number of Patel candidates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2321023013482789">Table 3</xref>).</p>
        <p>The BJP retained by and large the share of votes it had obtained in 2007 among the
          Patels, but the GPP’s gains on the Leuva Patel side (+ 32) have been the Congress’s loss
          (– 22) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2321023013482789">Table 4</xref>). After
          the elections, Kushabhai Patel claimed responsibility for having deprived the BJP from
          winning 15 seats more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2321023013482789">Patel,
            2012</xref>). But in fact, one may consider that the GPP, as a true opposition party,
          has taken away as many seats from the Congress since in 14 constituencies, its candidates’
          number of votes is larger than the margin of the BJP’s successful MLAs. Among these seats,
          those where Leuva Patels have shifted in large numbers from the Congress to the GPP figure
          prominently.</p>
        <p>Under Modi the BJP has plebeianized itself to a certain extent. The role of the upper
          caste declined (the proportion of upper caste MLAs decreased from 27 per cent in 1998 to
          19 per cent in 2007) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2321023013482789">Desai and Shah,
            2009</xref>). The OBCs have been among the beneficiaries of this evolution. In 2012,
          Modi, himself an OBC, showed that he was aware of the fact that since the departure of
          Shankarsinh Vaghela, the BJP had no Kshatriya leader of the calibre of Congressmen like
          Vaghela, Shaktisinh Gohil or Bharatsinh Solanki. He decided to woo the OBCs, including the
          Kshatriyas, personally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2321023013482789">Dave and
            Kateshiya, 2012</xref>, p. 4) and, more importantly, to give them a larger number of
          tickets (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2321023013482789">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>This move was one of the explanations of the voting patterns of the different caste
          groups. The proportion of upper caste and Patel voters supporting the party remains
          massive with, respectively, 60 and 61 per cent. But the BJP has lost 9 and 10 percentage
          points among these upper and dominant castes. Symmetrically, its main achievement comes
          from the inroads it has made in traditional vote banks of the Congress, the Kshatriyas
          and, even more, the Kolis. In the 1980s Madav Singh Solanki had solidly included these low
          caste groups into his KHAM coalition where ‘K’ stood for Kshatriyas, ‘H’ for Harijans
          (Scheduled Castes), ‘A’ for Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) and ‘M’ for Muslims. The HAM’
          groups are still supporting the Congress, and even more in 2012 than in 2007, but the OBCs
          are shifting towards the BJP. Among them the Kolis have on a large scale left the Congress
          (–16 percentage points) and rallied around the BJP (+ 12). As a result, Modi’s party is
          today almost as popular among the OBCs (54 to 56 per cent) as among the dominant and upper
          castes (60 to 61 per cent) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2321023013482789">Table

        <title>The Urban/Rural Divide and Class Polarization</title>
        <p>Castes and communities do not form homogenous entities any more in Gujarat because of
          class differentiation and the urbanization process. They need to be disaggregated
          according to criteria such as the urban/rural divide, a proxy for measuring class as well
          as the impact of the village vs. city cultures.</p>
        <p>The Kolis are a case in point. While the Kolis living in villages are still supporting
          the Congress massively, those who stay in semi-urban and urban contexts have moved towards
          the BJP. More generally speaking, all the castes and communities (except the Patels) tend
          to be more Congress oriented when we consider their village dwellers.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-2321023013482789">Table 6</xref> shows that the only
          constituencies in which the Congress prevails upon the BJP are the rural ones. And the
          more urban the voters are, the weaker the Congress is, as evident from its performances
          from 45.7 per cent of the valid votes in the rural seats to 32.2 per cent in the
          semi-urban ones and only 27.5 in towns and cities. The relation is equally linear on the
          BJP side, but in the reverse order from 43.3 to 50.8 and 57.7 per cent. This linear
          relation works in the case of all the OBC groups, including the Kolis in which case the
          gap between the rural and the semi urban voters is dramatic: 53.2 per cent of the rural
          Kolis voted for the Congress, but only 18.5 per cent of the semi-urban members of the
          caste. Symmetrically (almost), only 44 per cent of the rural Kolis voted for the BJP but
          65.2 per cent of the semi-urban ones did the same. Similarly, the more urbanized the
          Adivasi voters are, the less Congress-oriented (47.3, 41.1 and 20 per cent) and the more
          BJP oriented (29.6, 35.6 and 66.7 per cent) they are. The relation is not that linear in
          the case of the Dalits and the Muslims, but the rural components of these two groups are
          still the most supportive of the Congress.</p>

        <p>The rural/urban variable seems to be more discriminatory than caste and community in
          several cases. The (partial) exception may be the Patels. In their case, the degree of
          urbanization hardly makes any difference. That can probably be explained by the fact that
          the Patels are both, urban and rural for a long time and form, therefore, a kind of
          straddling group. As early as the first half of the twentieth century, Patels have
          migrated to the cities for developing their business and joined colleges. Sardar Patel, an
          advocate, was elected mayor of Ahmedabad, while, as a child, he was working in the field
          with his father—an indication of the one-century old transition of the Patels to urban
          life. After independence, these agrarian capitalists who were so good at commercial
          agriculture invested in industrial ventures such as diamond cutting in Surat. They were
          clearly the main beneficiaries of the state policy supporting the small scale
          enterprises—and resisting the licence Raj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2321023013482789">Sinha, 2005</xref>).</p>
        <p>The discriminatory character of the urban/rural variable is reconfirmed from the way it
          prevailed upon two other parameters, gender and education (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2321023013482789">Table 7</xref>).</p>

        <p>While male and female villagers are more inclined to vote for the Congress than for the
          BJP, the more they get urbanized, the more they vote for Modi’s party. This trend is
          particularly marked in the case of women: village based women support the Congress more
          than male villagers, but urban women are more favourable to the BJP than urban males. The
          attraction for the BJP among urban women is truly remarkable, which suggests that in their
          case, the gender variable continues to play an important role along
              urbanization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-2321023013482789">17</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Some linear correlations are again noticeable in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2321023013482789">Table 8</xref>. The more educated voters are the less
          likely ones to vote for Congress and more likely to vote for the BJP. This trend is
          strongly reinforced by urbanization. Rural voters who have not been educated beyond the
          primary level vote more for Congress than for the BJP, but the villagers who have got
          their matriculation and above will vote more for the BJP. However, the gap is the maximum
          among the educated urban citizens: only 19.4 per cent of the urban dwellers who had gone
          to college vote for Congress when 64.1 per cent of them will support the BJP. Education,
          and to a lesser extent urbanization and caste, are proxies for class. In 2012, the richer
          they were, the more likely the Gujarati voters were to support the BJP and the less likely
          they were to vote for the Congress—except for the poorest category which is the only one
          to contradict this linear relation.</p>
        <p>To sum up, the typical BJP voter is not only, as it used to be the case, a man from the
          dominant/upper castes. Urbanization and education have made an impact on the social
          profile of the BJP electorate: a majority of the OBCs, mostly among those who have
          migrated to the cities, got some education and have become richer are now supporting the
          party, women as much as men, if not more. This change suggests that the BJP has
          diversified it, but to a limited extent only, since it has lost some of its supporters
          among the (mostly rural or semi urban) Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims. Indeed, the BJP—as is
          evident from its declining percentage of valid votes—has not broadened its base, but as
          diversified it in terms of caste. This is due to the polarization of society in terms of
          class that is reflected in the state’s voting pattern: in addition to the upper
          caste-dominated middle class, the mostly OBC-dominated ‘neo-middle class’ is now rallying
          around Modi while the rural voters, especially Dalits, Adivasis, Muslims and OBCs continue
          to extend their full support to the Congress.</p>

      <title>Conclusion: The Resistible Rise of Narendra Modi</title>
      <p>Narendra Modi’s third electoral success in Gujarat is in part different from his previous
        victories. Certainly, his style has remained the same: Modi simply keeps updating his brand
        of high tech populism based on his claim to embody Gujarat while protecting the state from
        the Centre, and he still relies on a discourse that combines Hindu nationalism (slightly
        de-emphasized) and ‘development’ (considerably over-emphasized). But it seems that he is now
        in tune with a constituency that goes beyond his traditional base (that is somewhat eroding)
        and comprises of an expanding urban ‘neo-middle class’ benefitting from years of economic
        growth. The rallying of a larger number of OBC voters belonging to this class suggests that
        the BJP is getting more plebeian in Gujarat in caste terms—up to a point. In fact, this
        diversification reflects a polarization in terms of caste and community since the party is
        losing out among the underprivileged groups, including Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims. Hence
        its erosion in terms of valid votes and the polarization of Gujarat politics since these
        groups are supporting the Congress in larger numbers, which explains the party’s (limited)
        electoral gains.</p>

      <p>However, Narendra Modi may benefit more than the Congress of the state’s socio-economic
        changes in the future. After all, Gujaratis are getting more and more urbanized and
        educated, and richer in the cities. In fact, Gujarat has registered the highest rate of
        urbanization over the last decade, jumping from 37 per cent of urban dwellers to 43 per cent
        between 2001 and 2011. The state may have a majority of its population living in towns and
        cities by 2030. Similarly, the literacy rate has increased from 69.14 per cent in 2001 to
        79.31 per cent in 2011. These two variables, urbanization and education may seal the fate of
        the Congress if the party does not project a political alternative in the state, all the
        more so as, in contrast to other very urbanized states like Delhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2321023013482789">Jaffrelot, 2008</xref>), the Gujaratis living in towns and
        cities do vote a lot. During the December 2012 state elections, the turn out in urban
        constituencies was 68.1 per cent, not much less than the turn out of the semi urban (71.1
        per cent) and urban (74.1 per cent) constituencies.</p>
      <p>Already, the Congress has lost five elections in a row, the BJP’s successes in Gujarat
        being only matched by the CPI(M) in West Bengal—where, under Jyoti Basu the communists had
        established a form of domination that resulted also partly from their ability to identify
        with the state against the Centre, when the Congress was in office. Modi’s BJP is
        establishing a similar kind of hegemony. This notion, as Suhas Palshikar convincingly
        argues, is also due to the general political mindset. Indeed, ‘both the Congress and the
        general public in Gujarat operate within the ideological and policy paradigm set by the BJP.
        It is not just about electoral success; it is about a near-hegemony’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2321023013482789">Palshikar, 2012</xref>). Comparing the CPI(M) in West Bengal
        and the BJP in Gujarat, Palshikar highlights a major difference.</p>

        <p>With all the aberrations the CPM was accused of, it never targeted any one section to
          construct its hegemony, nor was a personality cult perpetrated by it in West Bengal in
          spite of the towering image of Jyoti Basu. In contrast, the BJP is a majoritarian project
          in Gujarat and is also in bondage to Modi’s personal control. Modi’s distinction has been
          the ability to project a larger-than-life image of himself as personifying all the three
          elements listed above—thus, he becomes the expression of Gujarati asmita, Hindu
          nationalism and an untiring (his word in the victory speech) search for
            development’.(<italic>ibid</italic>.)</p>

      <p>While Jyoti Basu could never come to the Centre, one may wonder whether Narendra Modi could
        become more than a state politician. Certainly, Hindu nationalism and class polarization are
        more pronounced in Gujarat than in the rest of India, but he may attract supporters from the
        rest of the Indian (neo-) middle class by capitalizing on his clean image and the growth
        records of Gujarat at a time when the Congress party is facing a leadership crisis at the
        centre, is affected by corruption scams and seems unable to relaunch the economy and
        maintain law and order. The resistible rise of Narendra Modi may only be just
            beginning,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-2321023013482789">18</xref></sup> provided
        he gets the support of his own ‘family’—which he may get by default<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-2321023013482789">19</xref></sup> and for financial reasons (Narendra Modi is
        probably the main fund raiser on the BJP side since the demise of Pramod Mahajan). Then Modi
        may have to convince his NDA partners, including Nitish Kumar—who did not even let him
        canvass in Bihar in favour of the JD (U)—that he’s a good choice for the 2014
            elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-2321023013482789">20</xref></sup></p>

          <p>I am most grateful to Rita Kothari, Sanjay Kumar and Suhas Palshikar for their help and
            comments. The field-research for this article, in December 2012, has been made
            financially possible by the ANR, the ESRC and the ICSSR in the framework of the project
            ‘Explaining Change in Urban and Rural India’ (EECURI). As a work in progress, this text
            has been presented in March 2013 during the first meeting of the EECURI project at the
            King’s India Institute (KCL). I am grateful to the participants for their comments.</p>

          <p>The octogenarian General Secretary of the Gujarat branch of the RSS, Pravin Maniar,
            took part in the Saurashtra convention of the GPP in November 2012 at Rajkot and was all
            praise for Keshubhai. But on this occasion a VHP leader, on condition of anonymity told
            journalists: ‘Not all of us are ready to openly work against Modi. But a section is
            quietly conducting a campaign’ (<italic>The Indian Express</italic>, Ahmedabad edition,

          <p>In the aftermath of the Sachar report, the Central Government has developed a pre
            matriculation scholarship scheme for Muslims: any Muslim student securing 50 per cent
            marks in annual exams, and with family annual income of less then 1 lakh ₹, was entitled
            to it. The amounts were between 800 and 1000 ₹ per year. Originally 55,000 students were
            selected . The Central contribution was about 3.75 crores. The State contribution was
            supposed to amount to about 1.25 crores. The Modi Government refused to implement it on
            grounds that it was discriminatory against other poor students. The matter went to the
            Gujarat High Court , wherein a division bench of three judges ruled in favour of the
            scheme. Later another division bench ruled against the scheme. Finally it went to a full
            bench of five judges. The noted Supreme Court advocate Dushyant Dave fought the case in
            favour of the Muslims free of charge. He won before the full bench, which directed the
            Government to implement the scheme immediately. In response, the Modi government turned
            to the Supreme Court, which has upheld the decision of the High Court in May 2013, five
            years after the scheme has been initiated. I am grateful to J. Bandukwala and Cedric
            Prakash for these pieces of information.</p>

          <p>Pratham is an NGO which promotes education in India on the basis of annual surveys
            measuring the skills of the school-going children. Their last Annual Status of Education
            Report (Rural) 2011 showed that Gujarat was lagging behind Haryana in terms of
            percentage of village children (6 to 14 years old) going to school—public and
            private—who could read letters and who could recognize figures (Std I-II) and who could
            read texts and who could do subtractions (Std. III-V).

            fielded another Sindhi, gynaecologist, Nirmala Vadhvani; in the Ellisbridge seat the GPP
            had nominated the widow of another former Home secretary of state of Modi, Haren Pandya
            (the former sitting MLA), who had been mysteriously assassinated; against Modi himself,
