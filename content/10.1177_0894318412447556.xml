            <p>Environment has long been a primary concern in nursing, beginning with Nightingale’s attention to the power of the environment to heal. Policy is a dimension of the practice environment with great potential to influence patients’ health. In this column, a practice vignette illustrates some of the barriers to nurses’ awareness of policy-as-environment. Characteristics of conceptualizations of environment, arising from nursing science, that have potential to surmount barriers and increase awareness are identified. Creative attention to conceptualizing policy-as-environment is urged as a way to encourage nurses to consider policy activity as a satisfying aspect of practice.</p>

      <disp-quote>
         <p>“I got this,” Leila, a woman in recovery from alcohol use and bi-polar illness, said, laughing, “You know I’ll be fine.”Peg, a mental health nurse on an acute care in-patient unit, looked at Leila, affection and exasperation in her voice as she repeated the discharge instructions that Leila needed to follow-up with Dr. Grant, her nurse practitioner, take her medications, and avoid settings that include alcohol. Peg thinks about the many times Leila has stood here at the exit from the acute care unit, bags and discharge papers in hand, ready to go back to her life at home. She thinks about all the times Leila has been admitted to the unit, manic and intoxicated, or depressed almost to the point of catatonia, or simply disheveled, disorganized, and distraught. No matter how Leila arrived, she always had a good response to medication. Once her bipolar disorder is controlled with medication and she is not using alcohol, she clears rapidly, her sunny and warm personality emerging and her coping skills in evidence. She connects with staff, has sincerity and considerable strengths, and works hard toward recovery.</p>
         <p>Why then does she return to this setting at least twice a year in an acute phase of illness? Peg has long felt that part of the problem is that Leila is discharged too soon, before she can really feel strong emotionally, at least strong enough to get a good start at remaining sober and strong enough to remember that her medication will help if she continues to take it. But when Peg talked with Leila’s nurse practitioner the day before, she was reminded of the institution’s treatment philosophy that once acuity has decreased, treatment is just as effective on an outpatient basis. Still, as the door to the unit slams shut and Peg watches through the little window as Leila walks away, carting her clear plastic hospital-issued belongings bag, she wonders if this is the best that can be done for Leila. After a moment, Peg moves away from the window, focusing her mind on the next round of medications to pass. She thinks about Leila on and off through the day, and wonders how long it will be until Leila is back on the unit.</p>

      <p>Nurses everywhere, in many different settings, have had the experience of watching a client leave the treatment setting, knowing that the situation to which the client is going is not optimal for continued healing or well-being. For many reasons, including healthcare coverage limits, institutional policies, and availability of providers and services, at that moment, there is no identifiable action that can be taken to change the situation or prevent the discharge. Policy decisions are often central in these situations, at organizational, sociopolitical, and economic levels. Organizational policy determines who makes decisions regarding discharge and on what criteria those decisions are based. Social and economic policies dictate what services are available in the community for people needing assistance or support following acute episodes of illness. And often, policy determines which services will be covered by the client’s insurance and thus which treatments are available or not available to a client. In moments such as these, the nurse experiences the impact of multiple policy decisions on clients’ well being. Yet, while the relationship between policy and healthcare in both treatment and community settings has been delineated with fair clarity in the nursing literature, the literature is also clear in pointing out that the majority of nurses do not become involved in the work of institutional or broader healthcare policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447556">Ennen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447556">Malone, 2005</xref>).</p>
      <p>The reasons for nurses’ lack of policy involvement are multiple. Nurses sometimes do not recognize the policy dimensions of their care-giving experiences, or perceive the relevance of policy to their day-to-day experience of nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447556">Spencely, Reutter, &amp; Allan, 2006</xref>). In addition, policy involvement is perceived by some to fall outside the professional purview and responsibility of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447556">Long, 2005</xref>). Nurses, staff nurses and advanced-practice nurses, are on the front-lines of client care and often experience the impact of policy decisions without the awareness of the relationship of policy to practice, and specifically of the major idea forwarded by this column: the idea of policy-as-environment.</p>
      <p>The notion of policy-as-environment shines a light on the interconnectedness of policy with environment and policy as an intrinsic dimension of environment. Environment has been a primary concern in nursing much longer than has policy. Beginning with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447556">Nightingale’s (1860/2010)</xref> exhortation to nurses to study “those laws which God has assigned to the relation of our bodies with the world in which he has put them” (p. 8), nurses have looked at the surroundings of the client as essential to healing (p. 8). As nursing theory developed, nurse scholars generated greatly differing conceptualizations of environment. Roy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447556">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>), for example, emphasized internal and external dimensions of human environment as stimulus for adaptation, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447556">Leininger (1995)</xref> embraced the all-encompassing nature of environment and its potential for making cultural meaning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447556">Rogers (1994)</xref> stated that human and environment are energy fields simultaneously and continuously exchanging and evolving. In each theoretical conceptualization, environment holds great potential to shape nurses’ ideas about human health and experience. Policy does not hold the same weight as nursing theory but is an increasingly important factor, influencing how humans experience health and healthcare.</p>
      <p>Particularly during the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, healthcare has grown in complexity, with systems becoming larger, communication more instantaneous, and at the same time more obfuscated with multiple options for treatments, treatment settings, and provider choices becoming more varied and complicated. There has been increased reliance on policy to structure and regulate this complexity. In addition, as healthcare has become a larger social and economic concern, those with political agendas have the ability to strongly shape healthcare policy. Thus, policy has become an increasingly important aspect of practice environments, albeit one that is less visible, both in experience and in its conceptual representations. Conceptualizations of environment within the discipline have not kept pace with these developments and policy is not consistently considered as part of the environment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447556">Malone (2005)</xref> noted that after a flurry of dialogue and conceptualizing in the discipline, beginning in the late 1980s, environment in the main continues to refer to individual and local systems levels, leaving out consistent attention to systemic, community, and societal levels where the policies that influence the individual and local levels often originates.</p>
      <p>The author in this column posits that <italic>policy-as-environment</italic> is a conceptualization that more accurately reflects practice realities and suggests that policy is a dimension of the environment with great potential to change clients’ health. The discussion encourages nurse leaders, scholars, and practitioners to look critically at how theories of environment currently make visible, or do not make visible, connections between practice experiences, policy, and environment. Creativity is needed to provide theoretical lenses through which nurses can see the environment connection between their practice experiences and the policies that shape them. Nurses may then be better able to see the benefits of adding their voices and experiences to policy dialogues.</p>
      <p>Ideas for highlighting the policy-as-environment notion are generated here by examining three aspects emerging from the vignette above. The vignette illustrates some of the barriers to nurses’ awareness of policy-as-environment, <italic>first</italic> by looking at how initial experiences with organizational policy can turn nurses away from the desire to learn more about policy. A <italic>second</italic> aspect looks at the invisibility of policy implications through some theoretical lenses, highlighting the importance of having a theoretical framework to help understand the experiential aspects of policy-environment-practice. The <italic>third</italic> aspect of analysis suggests types of theoretical frameworks or conceptualizations of environment, with primary emphasis on the concept of policy-as-environment, which can encourage nurses to see policy work as a potentially satisfying dimension of their professional practice.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447556">
         <title>First Encounters: Organizational Policy as Turn-Off</title>
         <p>The first contact a nurse has with the results of policy decisions often occurs at the organizational level. How nurses make sense of these experiences can set the stage for further awareness, willingness, or openness to policy involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447556">Spencely et al., 2006</xref>). Conceptualizations of environment that nurses have been exposed to or have available to them can influence this process. In the vignette at the beginning of this discussion, a salient piece of Peg’s experience was her perceived inability to exert influence over what she believed to be Leila’s premature discharge. She had spoken with the nurse practitioner prior to Leila’s discharge and questioned that decision. The response she received was couched in treatment philosophy, specifically that short-stays are better for patients. It can be argued that treatment philosophy is shaped by policy that arises from economic considerations, especially with clients who rely on public funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447556">Hoover et al., 2008</xref>). Peg may not realize that there are strands of connection between healthcare policy and the decision to discharge Leila. She may not have had an opportunity to entertain those thoughts because she was not able to engage in full discussion regarding Leila’s discharge due to a gap in her nursing education or understanding of how to operate within the power hierarchy of the treatment setting. Discussion could have been a step toward making visible the policy influences on treatment philosophy and subsequent decisions that may have given Peg the opportunity to provide a thoughtful response. In addition, the experience of not having resolution itself can shape Peg’s ideas about her future ability and desire to become involved in dialogue around difficult client-care issues.</p>
         <p>Peg’s experience is typical of what many nurses experience in different areas of practice, namely difficult, conflictive, or unproductive interactions in the healthcare setting around care issues. When practice experience consists of constraint or inability to practice in congruence with one’s values, there is the potential for an outcome that moves the nurse away from a desire to learn about or become involved with policy. Guilt or other negative emotions associated with the experience may encourage the nurse to focus inward to relieve distress or resolve incongruity. What is needed, though, is an outward focus on addressing and resolving the situation, analyzing the systems and the policies that gave rise to her experience of feeling ineffectual.</p>
         <p>At issue within this scenario are the possible theories or concepts that might be available to Peg, either from previous exposure or through discussions with peers or supervisors, which could assist her with productively making sense of this experience. Numerous concepts have been developed to describe these experiences: institutional constraint, moral distress, moral uncertainty, and moral residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447556">Hardingham, 2004</xref>). These notions reflect aspects of situations in which nurses perceive organizational environmental characteristics to negatively influence their ability to keep clients safe or provide quality care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447556">Hall &amp; Kiesners, 2005</xref>). As Hardingham noted, these concepts give names to nurses’ experiences or the factor(s) behind them, so that experiences are validated as real and as having contributing factors that can be identified and addressed. Nurses such as Peg, then, can move past an initial response of uncertainty or guilt and focus outward, toward the environment and resolution of a difficult situation.</p>
         <p>If Peg is to come away from her experience poised to learn more about policy, she might also benefit from a conceptual perspective that directs her gaze beyond the immediate situation and perceived contributing factors to a broader perspective that locates her and her actions in relation to others and their actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447556">Austin’s (2007)</xref> discussion of healthcare environments as moral communities provided this perspective. Austin drew from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447556">Walker’s (1998)</xref> feminist ethical perspective and advocated for an expanded focus for bioethics, urging professionals to learn about the factors in care-environments that shape, make clear, or distort their moral responsibilities. By asking what makes a healthcare community morally habitable, she directed attention beyond individual problems, toward a broader perspective that puts the spotlight on a vision of a better environment, one that includes the recognition that sharing perspectives and values is as important as sharing clinical information. Sharing is central. Instead of solely targeting practices and policies that contribute to moral distress, the concept of moral community more broadly includes them as issues that everyone needs to address. The responsibility for creating and maintaining the work environment is shared. For Peg, looking at her work environment in this way may encourage her to look beyond herself and the immediate situation to the broader and deeper implications of a shared setting. She may feel less alone and that there are more possibilities available to explore. These could conceivably provide Peg with a more favorable perspective of the possibilities for actively addressing practice problems from a policy-as-environment perspective, which may lead to openness to talking about and working on policy issues in the future.</p>

         <title>Sharpening the Focus: The Use of Theoretical Frameworks</title>
         <p>In the vignette above, Peg is left to wonder if the plan of care is the best that can be done for Leila. The question Peg poses is common: asking why some persons with mental illnesses return again and again to acute care treatment settings, seemingly failing to thrive with prescribed treatment, or not fully adhering to the prescribed treatment. Exploring her concern demonstrates the need for conceptualizations of environment that sharpen the focus on all of the forces operating in the environment, and in particular, policy. There is no one satisfactory answer to Peg’s question, but in the United States it is generally agreed that economic policy can shape treatment philosophy that encourages providers to quickly stabilize persons and discharge them from the acute care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447556">Hoover et al., 2008</xref>). Treatments and services in many communities may be lacking, particularly in certain geographical areas and for persons of minority ethnicity, and social class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447556">Stahler, Mennis, Cotlar, &amp; Baron, 2009</xref>). This combination is clearly a one-two punch for some individuals with mental illness, such as Leila who is of lower socioeconomic class and whose home is located in an impoverished community. Add to this the current financial struggles many states and municipalities are experiencing and the resulting service cuts, and it is apparent why some individuals such as Leila may not stay well in the community.</p>
         <p>A theoretical perspective might assist nurses to more clearly see the links between economic policy and the realities of community mental health environments. It might seem obvious that lack of funding means lack of service and lack of service means lack of support to stay healthy. If Peg perceives the severity of Leila’s illness to be the main reason that she does not remain stable after discharge, she may not clearly discern the connection between current policy and Leila’s situation. She may believe that Leila simply needs more time in the hospital to regain stability. This would not be unusual given the current centrality of biomedical explanatory models of psychiatric illness: the problem resides in the intricate and invisible world of chemical messengers, receptor sites, and neural pathways in people’s heads, not in the world outside the doors of the hospital. What is visible to Peg through her current theoretical lens is that the severity of Leila’s illness prevents her from staying well. What may be less visible to Peg is how recent funding cuts have slashed the number of providers at Leila’s community clinic and how much the wait time for appointments has lengthened as a result. What may also not be seen is that Leila’s 12-step group has lost many members due to location changes in the past year because host organizations have lost funding. Peg may not know that Leila will now know fewer people in the group, or that it is not functioning well because of a lack of committed consistent members. Without an expanded and explicit theoretical framework for analysis, Peg may have limited ability to respond.</p>
         <p>Clearly, there may be no stimulus or motivation for Peg to look for answers beyond the biomedical perspective that looms large in her metaphorical line of sight. Being immersed in the hospital setting, Peg may assume that the aftercare plans made for Leila will unfold as planned. There are numerous factors that operate in community mental health environments, many mediated by policy, which contribute to lack of utilization of aftercare plans or raise the risk of readmission to an acute care setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447556">Zhang, Harvey, &amp; Andrew, 2011</xref>). Conceptualizations of environment need to greatly magnify these in order to counter the dominance of the biomedical understanding of Leila’s difficulties.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447556">Kulig (2000)</xref> called for theory that further develops the domain of environment in order to determine the effectiveness of care on individuals, families, and communities, noting that there is little specific attention to community at the level of grand theory. The lack of attention to a broader conceptualization of environment may be reflective of the time in which some of the grand theories were developed. Today it can leave significant areas of practice experience unnamed and unmapped for practitioners. Unnamed and unmapped can mean unknown and unhelpful to nurses. There is a need for conceptualizations that map out the environment so that factors influencing the patient at multiple levels can be identified and then linked to the policies that shape them. This is especially needed as healthcare environments continue to grow in complexity. In addition, just as the practice environment is exceedingly complex, so are the numbers and types of environments that one patient moves through during a single illness episode. Conceptualizations of environment need to reflect this multiple-settings reality as well. At the minimum, if Leila follows her after-care plan, she will go to an outpatient clinic for psychiatric follow-up, a pharmacy to fill her prescriptions, and another agency that hosts her 12-step group. Each agency has its own policies and each is subject to different policies originating from different entities, depending upon the agency’s function, financial structure, and other variables. Being aware of and tracking these multiple policy influences would be an important but challenging task for Peg.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447556">Malone’s (2005)</xref> conceptualization of policy-environment and policy assessment framework could provide structure and direction for this task. The conceptualization of policy environment is a direct response to Malone’s identification of the lack of connection between nurses’ attention to environment and policy activity. The conceptualization locates policy within the client’s environment, defining policy environment specifically as those policies or effects of policies, especially at community or societal levels around the client that may have, “preventive, etiological, or therapeutic significance” (p. 136). Malone noted that while nurses have long seen the individual client as the center of a network of family and social relationships, the perspective needs to be broadened to accommodate the reality that those relationships are shaped by policy at all levels. She offered a framework that consists of a set of questions that can be used as a guide to fully assess the policy environment that includes, among other things, the problem, the process, ethical dimensions of the problem, the different levels of policy that may be operating, as well as identification of decision-makers and potential paths for nursing action. This framework may enable Peg to look at Leila’s community for what might be missing and then to trace her findings back to the policies that shape them. Conceptualizations that can structure and organize analysis of policy-impact will be helpful, especially for nurses like Peg who are still seeking the right lens through which to locate and understand all that is affecting their patients.</p>

      <sec id="section3-0894318412447556">
         <title>Policy as Environment: Awareness, Action, and Satisfaction</title>
         <p>Recognition of policy influences alone will likely not increase Peg’s desire to become involved in policy processes. The challenge for the use of the concept of policy-as-environment is to provide a perspective that stimulates interest in or desire to become involved in policy work. In her theory of critical caring for public health nursing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447556">Falk-Rafael (2005)</xref> asserted that for a nurse to choose to effect policy change requires ethical knowing, or a sense of responsibility to act on the knowledge one gains: to know that for the best care to be given, political action must occur. Falk-Rafael’s theory is derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447556">Watson’s (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447556">2007)</xref> carative processes and as such, invokes Watson’s moral imperative to preserve and enhance human dignity as the intention behind professional caring. If a moral imperative is not to be explicitly referenced as the motivation for policy work, then conceptualizations of policy-as-environment must stimulate interest in policy work in other ways, perhaps by raising awareness of the potential of policy work to be a satisfying dimension of actual clinical practice.</p>
         <p>Raising awareness of policy work as a potentially satisfying dimension of practice might be achieved by sharpening the focus on the connection between individual client care and policy work as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447556">Banfield (2011)</xref> does in her examination of the concept of environment in Orem’s self care deficit nursing theory (SCDNT). She focused on the set of environmental factors in the SCDNT that influence nurse agency: basic conditioning factors. While basic conditioning factors operate on both client self-care agency and nursing agency, Banfield noted that the influence of conditioning factors on nursing agency has not yet been determined, and she urged the discipline to do so if nurses are to be effective in meeting client needs in the complex environments of healthcare today. The notion of conditioning factors on nursing agency does, however, makes explicit the link between environmental factors and client care. In addition, this notion posits that the nurse is the link between the two. If policy is conceptualized as a basic conditioning factor, nurses can more closely examine how policy influences client outcomes through nursing actions. Nurses may think about reversing the flow of influence so that they utilize information and experience from the individual client care situation to inform policy formation. Using one client care experience as the starting point for nursing action that benefits a group of patients or entire systems through policy work can be a satisfying dimension of practice. Looking at the vignette, Peg may find a sense of satisfaction, if not a full solution to Leila’s problem, by using her experience with Leila as a starting point for an exploration of the institutional factors that anchor the treatment philosophy used to justify Leila’s premature discharge. While not addressing Peg’s concern for Leila at the current point in time, the process holds potential for a more comprehensive solutions at a future time.</p>
         <p>Other theories that strengthen the sense of what is possible in policy work include theoretical works within nursing paradigms for which the idea of simultaneous process is inherent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447556">Parse’s (2011)</xref> theory of humanbecoming, moves beyond the notion of simple connection, conceptualizing humanuniverse as everchanging. From this perspective, nurses like Peg can see themselves in a context of an ongoing relationship with clients, environment, and policy and, therefore, always in a position to be influenced by or to influence policy. This perspective, while not illuminating specific possibilities or directions for action, promotes the view that the possibility for satisfying action in the policy dimension always exists.</p>
         <p>Consideration of nursing theoretical perspectives directs attention to policy work as a satisfying dimension of practice by increasing the sense of what is possible, influencing nursing agency, and may minimize the conceptual distance between client, nurse, and policy. Nurses’ increased awareness of the potential to extend the reach of nursing intervention to include policy analysis as integral with environmental analysis is a desirable action outcome. The possibility of extending the reach of nursing intervention from the client care situation to the level of policy, as Peg might choose to do with her experience with Leila, is crucial to promoting systemic, philosophical, and practical change. The perspective of ongoing, mutual interchange may be the one most important addressed in this paper as the ongoing presence of possibility may sustain nurses as they move forward on their journeys of raising their awareness of policy-as-environment and exploring ways to embrace policy work in practice.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>The starting point for this exploration of policy as a dimension of environment in nursing was the experience of a single nurse and her client. This nurse’s experience illuminated several aspects of practice where barriers such as organizational policy and the dominance of biomedical explanatory models can foster limited awareness of, and receptivity to, policy work in practice and to the idea of policy-as-environment. Connecting nursing theory to practice highlighted the potential for nurses to surmount barriers through increased awareness of policy-as-environment. Particular attention to how the concept of policy-as-environment may illuminate ways for nurses to use an individual client care experience as a satisfying foundation for policy work was emphasized. Theoretical works were identified as providing a hopeful view of the ongoing, mutual interchange among client, nurse, and policy, strengthening the sense of what is possible in policy work. Nursing theoretical perspectives provide frameworks through which nurses can more clearly visualize the influence of policy on client well-being and professional practice. Nurse leaders, scholars, and practitioners will need to increase their awareness of policy work as an essential and satisfying dimension of practice, while continuing to develop, teach, and utilize creative conceptualizations of <italic>policy-as-environment</italic>.</p>
