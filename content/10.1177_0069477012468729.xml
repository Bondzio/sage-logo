<title>Photosensitivity</title>
<p>Two case reports of voriconazole-associated photosensitivity were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 4-year-old boy treated with voriconazole (8 mg/kg, twice daily) for a pulmonary-related fungal disease developed a macropapular rash. He was undergoing treatment for stage 4 neuroblastoma, and megatherapy with stem-cell rescue was performed 3 weeks after starting voriconazole therapy. Due to drug interactions, liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg, once daily) was used in place of voriconazole, but pulmonary disease worsened. Voriconazole was restarted and changed to 3 times daily dosing. After 5 months of voriconazole therapy, he developed a macropapular rash and erythema on his cheeks and hands. An increase in the voriconazole dose (43.8 mg/kg/d) was given because of subtherapeutic trough levels, but it led to the worsening of the rash. Concomitant use of retinoic acid also worsened the rash. After more than 6 months of voriconazole therapy, a repeat pulmonary imaging revealed improvement, and voriconazole was discontinued.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 5-year-old boy was treated with voriconazole (6.65 mg/kg, twice daily) for an invasive fungal disease on his scalp and left cheek, and he developed a severe photosensitivity rash. He presented with pre-B acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and was being treated according to COG A5971. Potential photosensitizing medications were discontinued, but the rash continued. He developed the rash after the voriconazole dose was increased (41 mg/kg/d, 3 times daily), 2 months after starting therapy. Treatment included topical methylprednisolone, emollients, and minimal sun exposure. His skin improved but still had mild erythema. After a 6-month course of therapy, the fungal disease was resolved and voriconazole was ceased.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that voriconazole-associated photosensitivity is related to therapy length of exposure, sunlight exposure, and concurrent use of photosensitizing drugs rather than voriconazole trough concentrations.</p>

<title>Severe Bladder Hypotonia (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012468729">*</xref>)</title>
<p>An 81-year-old male patient developed acute urinary retention 3 days after increasing the ranolazine dose from 375 mg to 500 mg twice daily for treatment of exertional angina. Concurrent medications included clopidogrel, diltiazem, isosorbide mononitrate, carvedilol, rosuvastatin, enoxaparin, pentoxifylline, pantoprazole, enalapril, furosemide, and spironolactone. While hospitalized for surgical resection of a colon adenocarcinoma, ranolazine dose was increased and acute urinary retention developed. Abnormal serum laboratory values included gamma-glutamyltransferase (119 U/L), urea (46 mg/dL), and creatinine (1.5 mg/dL) Treatment included catheterization, alfuzosin (5 mg daily), and dutasteride (0.5 mg daily) without improvement. After attempts to withdraw the catheter failed, urodynamic studies were performed and revealed that urinary retention was due to severe hypocontractility of the detrusor muscle and ranolazine was discontinued. Two days after discontinuation, bladder dysfunction resolved and spontaneous voiding was achieved. Follow-up urodynamic studies confirmed detrusor activity improvement. A cytochrome P450 phenotyping test revealed low activity of isoenzyme CYP3A4 and intermediate CYP2D6 activity, both of which are responsible for ranolazine metabolism.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that ranolazine was the probable cause of the bladder hypotonia experienced by this patient. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this reaction was considered “probable.” The proposed mechanism was blockade of late sodium current in the bladder detrusor muscle. They also proposed that low CYP3A4 activity augmented by coadministration of diltiazem may have contributed to increased plasma concentrations of ranolazine.</p>

<title>Incidence and Preventability in Cardiac Transplant Recipients</title>
<p>A prospective study was conducted to determine the incidence and preventability of drug-related problems resulting in hospital admission for 48 adult patients in a single cardiac transplant center. Nineteen of 48 postcardiac transplant admissions (40%) were assessed as drug related. Of these, 11 (58%) were determined to be preventable. Adverse drug reactions (32%) and supratherapeutic doses (32%) were the most frequent drug-related problems identified. Subtherapeutic doses (16%) and nonadherence (11%) occurred less frequently. The remaining drug-related problems were due to untreated indication (5%) and drug interactions (5%). Immunosuppressant agents were implicated most frequently for drug-related admissions (63%) followed by drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (53%). The percentage of patients readmitted within 30 days was 47%.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that hospital admissions following cardiac transplantation are often drug related and preventable. They also stated that pharmacists had the opportunity to prevent many of these drug-related problems and improve outcomes when acting as a member of a multidisciplinary transplant team.</p>

<title>Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion</title>
<p>A 69-year-old woman developed vomiting, drowsiness, and headache 2 days after receiving 1 dose of oral cyclophosphamide (500 mg) for treatment of multiple myeloma. Concurrent medications included dexamethasone (40 mg daily), thalidomide (100 mg daily), olmesartan, aspirin, omeprazole, temazepam, and sertraline. Significant laboratory values included serum sodium 113 mEq/L, serum osmolality 240 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality 701 mOsm/kg, serum urate 1.85 mg/dL, and urinary sodium &lt;10 mEq/L, which when repeated was 91 mEq/L. Thyroid and adrenal function were normal. A diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was confirmed by an endocrinologist. Treatment included fluid restriction, furosemide, and discontinuation of cyclophosphamide and sertraline. Six days later, serum sodium increased to 132 mEq/L and sertraline was reinitiated. Discharge occurred with instructions to maintain fluid restriction. Nonadherence to fluid restriction led to readmission and serum sodium was again low at 119 mEq/L. Fluid restriction was reinstated and serum sodium increased to 130 mEq/L after 4 days. The chemotherapeutic regimen was adjusted to exclude cyclophosphamide and serum sodium then remained within normal limits.</p>
<p>The authors concluded this patient’s syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was due to administration of a single dose of cyclophosphamide. The proposed mechanism of action was a direct toxic effect of cyclophosphamide or its metabolites on renal collecting tubules or antidiuretic hormone-like activity by its metabolites.</p>

<title>Dizziness and Palpitations</title>
<p>A 63-year-old female patient developed dizziness and palpitations 1 hour after chlorpromazine (2 mL of 25 mg/mL) was injected with a retrobulbar needle to reduce her ocular pain. Use of concurrent medications was unknown. She presented with unremarkable vital signs, but her right infraorbital area showed moderate swelling without erythema. Visual acuity was unchanged, and she had an intraocular pressure of 11 mm Hg. A serum phenothiazine level was drawn 3 hours after injection and chlorpromazine concentration was 20 ng/mL (minimum reporting level was 10 ng/mL). Symptoms resolved without any intervention, and the patient was placed on electrocardiographic monitoring. She was followed-up in clinic and her periorbital swelling resolved and her eye pain decreased.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that systemic symptoms were related to retrobulbar chlorpromazine injections. The mechanism of systemic delivery could be due to infiltration of the drug into smaller arterioles of the retrobulbar compartment or extravasation through the dural sheath.</p>

<title>Photosensitivity (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012468729">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 65-year-old man developed excoriated cutaneous eruption confined to forearms and hands in a photodistribution 2 weeks after initiating sitagliptin therapy for diabetes mellitus. No concurrent medications were reported. The eruption was accompanied by severe pruritus and recurred throughout the winter months. Intermittent sunlight exposure occurred throughout times of recurrence. Physical examination revealed excoriated plaques along the forearm that possessed a spongy, edematous sensation on palpation. Histopathology was consistent with cutaneous drug sensitivity. Treatment included discontinuation of sitagliptin and use of sunscreen and protective clothing. Compliance to sunscreen and protective clothing was poor, leading to recurrent episodes over a 2-year period. Daily application of sunscreen and use of protective clothing was emphasized and the eruption was cleared 2 years after initial onset.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient developed persistent photosensitivity related to sitagliptin use. The proposed mechanism was induction of ultraviolet A–dependent covalent binding between sitagliptin and endogenous proteins followed by chronic light sensitivity persisting after sitagliptin discontinuation.</p>

<title>Potentially Prolactin-Related Adverse Events</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of all randomized clinical trials where participants received paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection was conducted to assess the frequency of symptomatic potentially prolactin-related adverse events in adults. A total of 3713 subjects from 10 trials were evaluated. Potentially prolactin-related adverse events were identified based on potential signs and symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. Elevated prolactin levels occurred in 38.8% of patients receiving paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection. No relationship was found between monthly paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection dose and hyperprolactinemia; however, a higher dose was associated with an increase in potentially prolactin-related adverse events (<italic>P</italic> = .004). There was a higher mean increase in prolactin levels in females as compared with males. Elevated prolactin levels occurred in 17.5% of patients receiving placebo and 35.4% of patients receiving risperidone long-acting injection. A total of 115 (3.4%) events occurred in patients receiving paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection. However, the number of clinically symptomatic potentially prolactin-related adverse events was 64, affecting 2.0% of the exposed patients. Significantly fewer events occurred in patients treated with placebo (1.1%, <italic>P</italic> = .002). There was no significant difference in potentially prolactin-related adverse event rate between paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection and risperidone long-acting injection. Thirteen patients required medical treatment for a potentially prolactin-related adverse event.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that while hyperprolactinemia occurs in approximately 38.8% of patients receiving paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection, the incidence of reported symptoms in clinical trials was low. They recommended assessing patients for these adverse effects and weighing risks to benefits of therapy.</p>

<title>Panuveitis</title>
<p>A 68-year-old female patient developed painless bilateral palmar macules and pustules, followed by blurred vision and floaters in both eyes, 4 days after starting prophylactic levofloxacin for a dog bite. Concurrent medications included atenolol, amlodipine besylate, rabeprazole sodium, diphenhydramine hydrochloride, and low-dose aspirin. She presented to the uveitis clinic complaining of decreased vision and bilateral floaters for 5 days, and she discontinued levofloxacin. Her visual acuity was 20/500 OU and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg OU. Biomicroscopic examination showed small precipitates, 1+ to 2+ vitreous cells, 1+ anterior chamber cell and flare, and multiple lesions in the foveae of both eyes. Treatment included an extended prednisone taper, starting at 60 mg/d. After 2 months of therapy, visual acuity was back at baseline (20/40 OU) and symptoms improved.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s panuveitis was associated with levofloxacin therapy. Increased use of antibiotics has led to resistance, and fluoroquinolone use continues to increase.</p>

<title>Paradoxical Raynaud Phenomenon</title>
<p>A 40-year-old male patient developed paradoxical Raynaud phenomenon in the hand after starting treatment with intravenous iloprost 0.5 to 1 ng/kg/min (6 hours per day, for 5 days every 6-8 weeks) to treat cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Concurrent medications included omeprazole (40 mg/d), nifedipine (30 mg/d), bosentan (125 mg twice daily), prednisone tapered dosing (60 mg/d to 5 mg/d), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (800/160 mg on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays), oral cyclophosphamide (100 mg per 24 hours) from September 2006 to December 2008, calcium and vitamin D supplements, diazepam, and sertraline. Nifedipine was discontinued and the patient started iloprost, tolerating it well for the first 9 cycles. On the fourth day of cycle 10, after infusion was increased to 1 ng/kg/min, the patient’s hand turned white and cold. Infusion was discontinued and local heating was initiated. The reaction was reversible and his hand returned to normal temperature within 30 minutes, and infusion was restarted at 0.5 ng/kg/min for cycle 11. Infusion was increased to 1 ng/kg/min again on the fourth day and the patient experienced Raynaud phenomenon in the hand. The infusion was stopped and recovery occurred with the application of local heating. Cycles 12 and 13 were continued at a rate of 0.5 ng/kg/min and were tolerated well, although cold sensation in the hand occurred when infusion was increased on the second day.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that repeated administration of intravenous iloprost was associated with paradoxical Raynaud phenomenon in the hand. Iloprost is a vasodilator that has antiplatelet, immunomodulating, and cytoprotective properties, which reflect its common adverse reactions of headaches, flushing, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The calculated Naranjo score was within 5 to 8 points, indicating that paradoxical Raynaud phenomenon was a probable adverse reaction to intravenous iloprost.</p>

<title>Photolocalized Purpura (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012468729">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 75-year-old female patient developed a purpuric eruption approximately 10 days after starting levofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) for hemorrhagic cystitis and being exposed to the sun. Although the patient had been instructed to avoid sun exposure, it was discovered that she had spent several hours reading in her garden. The erythematous regions aligned with where her pant legs and sandals would show exposed skin. The patient first noticed the pruriginous eruptions after 10 days of a 15-day course of therapy. Concurrent medications were not reported. Clinical findings include a white blood cell count of 11 000/µL, with 60% neutrophils, 6% eosinophils, 30% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes. Other workups and antibodies were negative and no vasculitis was observed. The lesions cleared up after completion of therapy and the use of clobetasol and heparinoid gel.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that photo-exposed purpuric eruptions with pruritis are another side effect of levofloxacin in addition to photosensitivity rashes. Although rare with unknown incidence, sun exposure should be avoided and precaution is advised. The authors noted that this is the first case of photosensitivity rash with purpuric lesions associated with levofloxacin therapy.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old male patient experienced red eyes and blurry vision after receiving the varicella-zoster vaccine. The patient had received the vaccine 1 month prior and had been experiencing these symptoms for 3 weeks. Concurrent medications were not reported other than multiple immonosuppressants to treat inflammatory bowel disease, protein-losing enteropathy, hypogammaglobulinemia, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Visual acuity was 20/40 in the right eye and 20/50 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was similar between eyes at 46 mm Hg and 44 mm Hg, respectively. There were 2+ cells and 2+ vitreous haze in the right eye and 3+ cells and occlusive retinal vasculitis in the left eye. An aspiration from eye was taken and specimens were positive for DNA of the varicella-zoster virus. Management included injecting foscarnet (2.4 mg) into the vitreous of both eyes. The patient developed retinal detachment in the right eye.</p>
<p>The authors suggested that the presence of the varicella-zoster virus in the vitreous body indicates a cause for the patient’s retinitis. Advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend avoiding the use of live attenuated vaccines in an immunocompromised host.

<title>Drowsiness</title>
<p>A 1-year-old male patient developed drowsiness after ingesting an unknown amount of amitriptyline 5% cream. It was estimated that the child ingested about 50 mg of amitriptyline after biting into the tube container since ingestion was not observed. There is no knowledge of other ingested medications. In the emergency department, the child’s amitriptyline and nortriptyline serum level was 239 µg/L, approximately 7 hours after incident occurred. This is the upper normal end for adults. He also had decreased arousal with his drowsiness but was responsive. His pulse ranged from 110 to 120 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 91/52, and otherwise normal. While monitored, the patient had an irregular heart rate lasting only minutes and was back to baseline activity the following morning with no lasting effects.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the child’s serum level of amitriptyline explains the child’s drowsiness. The levels were likely due to oral ingestion as amitriptyline is minimally absorbed through the skin from a cream. This case supports the potential toxicity of tricyclic antipressant toxicity.</p>

<title>Acute Psychosis</title>
<p>A multicenter, retrospective study was performed evaluating hospitalized patients from July 2009 to May 2011 who were being treated for <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for the incidence of acute psychosis. A total of 135 patients at least 18 years old from 6 major hospitals in the Taipei region were included for analysis. Diagnosis was determined by <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria. Patients were included if they received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole greater than 5 mg/kg/d. Sixteen patients (11.9%) developed acute psychosis following drug administration with a median onset time of 5 days (range = 3-11 days) and all patients received the parenteral form of the medication. Symptoms included visual hallucinations, auditory hallucinations, agitation, and irrational behaviors. Fifteen of the 16 patients recovered from the symptoms. Strategies to correct the psychosis included switching the antibiotic, reducing the daily dose, and switching from the parenteral to the oral form. The other patient that developed acute psychosis died on the day of diagnosis. No clinically significant laboratory levels or imaging were found among these patients. Among the patients who developed psychosis, 87.5% were receiving doses 15 mg/kg/d as compared to 45.4% in the group negative for psychosis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .003).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that 11.9% of the patients evaluated developed acute psychosis after being treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> pneumonia. Considering the retrospective design, there was an increasing risk with increased daily dose.</p>

<title>Bleeding</title>
<p>A retrospective study of 1977 spontaneous reports was collected over a 3-year period, and the risk of bleeding was identified in patients exposed to serotonin reuptake inhibitors plus antiplatelet agents versus antiplatelet drugs alone. The French Pharmacovigilance Database was used, which included all adverse drug reactions that were reported to the 31 French Regional Pharmacovigilance Centers. Patients were identified as those over the age of 50 years, and exposure to antiplatelet agents alone versus serotonin reuptake inhibitors plus antiplatelet agents was identified in 1881 and 96 cases, respectively. All serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors marketed in France were included, such as fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and milnacipran. Antiplatelet agents included low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, flurbiprofen, dipyridamole, and dipyridamole plus low-dose aspirin. Of the 1977 reports, bleeding adverse drug reactions were identified in 1269 cases (67.5%) of the antiplatelet agents and 62 cases (64.6%) for serotonin reuptake inhibitors plus antiplatelet agents. Gastrointestinal bleeding was identified in 508 of 534 (95.1%) antiplatelet alone cases versus 26 of 534 (4.9%) serotonin reuptake inhibitors plus antiplatelet cases.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the database failed to show any significant difference with increased bleeding risks when serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with antiplatelet agents. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to increase gastrointestinal and cerebral bleedings without any association with the affinity for the serotonin transporter or receptors.</p>

<title>Anaphylaxis</title>
<p>A 62-year-old female patient developed erythematous plaques throughout the body, with an increased heart rate (145 beats per minute), blood pressure (80/60 mm Hg), and O<sub>2</sub> saturation of 89% under 100% ventilation after being administered intravenous rocuronium (45 mg). No allergies or home medications were reported. The patient’s vital signs were within normal limits prior to administration of rocuronium. Concurrent medications included propofol (70 mg) and fentanyl (200 µg). When anaphylaxis first occurred, the patient was treated with epinephrine (1:10 000) 0.30 mg repeated every 5 minutes and then received adrenaline 2.5 mg with no clinical improvement. Intravenous sugammadex (700 mg) was administered with time to response as 2 minutes. Vitals returned to normal limits except for tachycardia (101 beats per minute). The patient was transitioned to atracurium for the rest of the procedure with no incidence.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction related to rocuronium with a successful reversal after the administration of sugammadex.</p>
