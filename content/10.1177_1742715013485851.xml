<abstract>
<p>This paper proposes that leadership is an embodied process which occurs among those who are in community together. This implies that the dualities between the leader and the follower morph into a set of relationships where bodies move and gesture to one another by inviting and responding to each other in open co-creative spaces. To work through our ideas, we offer an exemplar of Richard Strauss’s song <italic>Morgen!</italic> as it is rendered in performance. We locate our study within the theory of relational leadership and suggest that effective leadership draws on the abilities of organisational members to offer and respond to gestures as they occur moment-by-moment.</p>

<p>My neighbour is a retired rock musician. It is his personalized car number plate that gives him away (OLROKR)! Also revealing this self-identification are the lead guitar riffs that echo through the valley on still summer evenings; tunes that revisit the glory days of bands like Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. So when I moved into the neighbourhood several years ago I was delighted to find that there was someone nearby who was like-minded. Although I cannot claim the venerable status of ‘old rocker’ I am a musician (violist) and musicians have some common bonds regardless of their preferred genres.</p>
<p>Early one morning the Old Rocker and I happened to meet spontaneously as we were out walking and our casual conversation turned to our common interest. I said to him that I was thinking of learning to play the ukulele. He replied, ‘I’ve got a couple of those at home and it’s piss-easy!’ After a short pause he continued, ‘It’s all in the right hand you know – and it’s the same thing with the guitar’. A few steps further up the hill I replied, ‘I guess you’re right, because playing the viola is similar – it’s all in your bowing arm. If your right arm is solid and stable it is much easier to play well.’ We parted; me to catch the bus for my commute to work, him to buy the morning newspaper, but the conversation stayed with me for a number of days. In particular I reflected on how our discussion turned to the body. Rather than talking about erudite musical matters, our dialogue was situated at the very locus of music-making – its physicality.</p></disp-quote>
<p>We begin this paper with an experiential account of one of the authors in order to orientate our paper around musical performance and its embodiment. Music provides an analogue to explore leadership in its enactment on a day-by-day and moment-by-moment practice because both are process-oriented, temporal and ephemeral. In making this connection, we are aware that music is often considered more of an emotional art form rather than an embodied activity. Similarly, discussions of leadership often focus on notions of ‘headship’ which implies a disembodied activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715013485851">Louw, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715013485851">Sinclair, 2004</xref>). Our discussion locates both musical performance and leadership as gestural acts that invite bodies to be in relationship and conversation together in order for music and leadership to be realised in practice.</p>
<p>We consider that musical performances by artists and their reception by audiences are both cognitive and emotional activities which are embodied in performance through gestural acts. In a way, musical instruments are extensions of the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715013485851">Ihde and Selinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 1962: 165</xref>), offering performers gestural tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715013485851">Schmicking, 2006</xref>) that enable them to incorporate audiences into expressive moments. This concretisation in time and space makes music an apt exemplar because it embraces elements that are in concert with leadership behaviours, which also rely on gestures that occur in time and space. In much the same way as a musical performance is embodied, we consider leadership as an embodied practice that occurs in community and is exercised through gestures.</p>
<p>Such gesturing is intentional in that they occur as deliberate acts, prompted by a reflexive stance, and interactional by inviting continual response. For, ‘meaningful material interaction is achieved by a blend of perception – reading the signs of the material world – and gesture – intentional action in and on that material world that changes it and its meaning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715013485851">Dant, 2008</xref>: 19). Gestures are thus expressed and responded to within community thereby maintaining a dynamic space from which leadership occurs. We term this ‘embodied reflexivity’ to account for the centrality of the body both in musical performance and organisational life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715013485851">Del Busso, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715013485851">Mascia-Lees, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715013485851">Myers and Dumit, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to explore this interactional intentionality, we discuss the performance of a piece of music – Richard Strauss’s composition <italic>Morgen!</italic> Before proceeding any further, we urge you the reader to pause and watch the YouTube (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVHHpagS_g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNVHHpagS_g</ext-link>) performance by violinist Joshua Bell, soprano Renée Fleming and their piano accompanist (Bell and Fleming, 2010). This particular rendering of the Strauss composition will provide the basis for our analysis of the music and will be followed by an exploration of the aesthetics of gesture and its relationship to leadership practice, hence the importance of engaging with the on-line performance before proceeding any further. Once having viewed the performance and then returned to this paper, we will move on to examine aesthetics and its recent incorporation into organisational studies and leadership in particular. After examining recent literature on aesthetics and leadership, we turn our attention to embodiment and Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology. We then explore music as an embodied activity and how that might be realised in performance in order to develop understandings of materiality and ways in which leadership might be enacted within this frame.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742715013485851"><title>Aesthetics and leadership</title>
<p>The rise of aesthetics within organisational studies has been met with enthusiasm by a coterie of scholars (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715013485851">Guillet de Monthoux, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715013485851">Linstead and Höpfl, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715013485851">Strati, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1742715013485851">Taylor and Hansen, 2005</xref>). Aesthetics, it is claimed, offers a dimension that has been missing in a discipline that has been dominated by instrumental approaches. It is not surprising, then, that Pierre Guillet de Monthoux, one of the field’s champions, asserts that ‘if the German artist Joseph Beuys … was right in claiming that art is tomorrow’s capital, it seems reasonable to consider aesthetics its new organisation theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715013485851">Guillet de Monthoux, 2000</xref>: 35).</p>
<p>Aesthetics opens dialogic spaces that may facilitate learning and development within organisations. For instance, in less formalised contexts, corridors and staff rooms may offer sites for the kinds of open conversations that mitigate the deleterious effects of hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715013485851">Dixon, 1997</xref>), thereby opening space for dialogue to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715013485851">Gurevitch, 2000</xref>). Expanding on these ideas, there is a growing body of work that is situated at the intersection of music and leadership. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715013485851">Ladkin (2008)</xref> demonstrates how Bobby McFerrin conducted the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra at a Proms concert in 2003 communicating both with the musicians and a large audience, simply through his physical presence. Ladkin contrasts this event with traditional practice which positions leaders as disembodied and even distant from their followers. She notes, however, the physicality of McFerrin’s style and that ‘he communicated through gestures, vocal inflections, and the way he used his body. His body language was inclusive, there was an openness and a lack of guardedness in the way he loped around the stage’ (p. 32).</p>
<p>This ability to create a physical presence and then to gesture openness demonstrates an aesthetic quality about leading that is gaining more currency in organisational studies. The aesthetic turn has embraced the notion of embodiment as fundamental to leadership practice in that it focuses on the ‘felt sense’ of leaders and followers as they seek to make sense of their ever-changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715013485851">Hansen, Ropo, and Sauer, 2007</xref>). Indeed, aesthetic enquiry has assisted in addressing the problem of people’s inability to adequately describe what is occurring for them in their bodies moment-by-moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742715013485851">Taylor, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The roots of these developments have grown out of disquiet among scholars about the deleterious effects of disembodiment and a concomitant orientation towards instrumentality by leaders. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715013485851">Gagliardi (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715013485851">Strati (1999)</xref> offer a richer view of organisational life that is informed by people’s ability to become aware of and responsive to their sensate experiences. Furthermore, aesthetic awareness opens spaces for ‘chance, surprise and flashes of insight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715013485851">Linstead, 1999</xref>: 72) which in turn enrich the repertoire of skills and knowledge that leaders can deploy.</p>
<p>Our paper examines the aesthetics of leadership by focusing more particularly on gesture as a way of creating opportunities for organisational members to participate in the co-creation of their enterprise. Our orientation towards social constructionism is informed by recent scholarship that discusses how organisational members are embraced into the organisation as active participants. For instance, the ways in which concerns are framed and discussed within organisations can become the way in which these ideas are embodied (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715013485851">Bathurst et al., 2010</xref>). Within a music performance context, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715013485851">Castañer (1999)</xref> explores the notion of competing discourses among symphony orchestra musicans, managers and conductors, and draws a link between environments where people work constructively together and the quality of their performances. He notes that ‘a collaborative and stimulating atmosphere results in better concert performances than a climate in which the conductor and the musicians are adversaries’ (p. 394). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715013485851">Grint (2005)</xref> claims that problems and how they are addressed lie at the heart of leadership activity. Grint argues that leadership occurs when organisations are confronted with complex problems that have not yet been encountered. This lack of a working solution necessitates that all members of the organisation contribute to finding solutions and the most appropriate function is for designated leaders to ask questions. Thus, the questions themselves are invitational gestures in that they call for active investment in problem-finding; for, ‘problems are cause for rejoicing because they are necessary for [the] creative process to happen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson, 2003</xref>: 120). Problem identification, then, creates spaces for dialogue and discovery, elements which underpin the <italic>process</italic> of leadership.</p>
<p>This kind of openness creates an active community of people who generate meaning<disp-quote>
<p>in the ‘spaces between’ [them] rather than in the acts of individuals <italic>per se</italic> … Accordingly, leadership events are not constructed by the actions of single individuals; rather, they emerge through the interactions between agents over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715013485851">Lichtenstein et al., 2006</xref>: 4).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Openness, however, does not lead to free-for-all anarchy. Rather, it implies responsiveness to the moment that enables ‘actors’ to make aesthetic judgements about the value and importance of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715013485851">Strati, 2002</xref>). Gesturing openness and invitation, therefore, provides an ability for leaders to move from results-driven functionalism towards a more open and adaptive role which facilitates innovation, adaptability and inclusion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1742715013485851">Uhl-Bien and Marion, 2011</xref>: 474).</p>
<p>Indeed, openness and invitation may imply ways of being that move beyond ‘amiability and cooperation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson, 2003</xref>: 118) towards the co-construction of something that has hitherto not been considered by the group. This inevitably creates a climate of anxiety where future success cannot be either known or assured, and sees the diminishing of the role of the individual leader. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson (2003)</xref>, in her discussion of dramaturgical collaboration claims,<disp-quote>
<p>A prevalent anxiety about true collaboration is that it eradicates individuality or requires an absence of leadership. Yet, collaboration does not diminish, but rather releases and expands what is unique to any artist … dramaturgical collaboration is an expansive landscape that includes dialogue not only between artists, but also between artists and their materials (texts, research, settings, clothes), and between makers and audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson, 2003</xref>: 119).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Rather than chaos and anarchy, gesturing openness results in individuals and structures within which they work, morphing into an environment that values the entire group, a collective approach that shifts the focus from the self to the other; from the competencies of a leader who directs and controls, to responses that support and encourage participation and exploration. For instance, in learning collaborative leadership through theatrical improvisation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715013485851">Gagnon et al. (2012)</xref> maintain that ‘participants … learn to subvert their own personal fears and self-consciousness because they must take care of their partner to keep the story going’ (p. 311). Here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715013485851">Gagnon et al. (2012)</xref> reveal the salience of gestural leadership in their insistence of caring for and supporting others in the team in order to realise ongoing improvisation. Strangely, resistance to this collaborative process can occur by leaders themselves being unwilling to let go of their status within an enterprise.</p><disp-quote>
<p>True collaboration is non-hierarchical. The skilled collaborator, seeking absence of hierarchy, is sensitive to status and understands how to alter it, in order to remove blocks to communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson, 2003</xref>: 126).</p></disp-quote>
<p>Our focus on the relational dynamic of leadership seeks for ways of mitigating the dysfunctional elements of the leader–follower polarity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715013485851">Gemmill and Oakley, 1992</xref>) and to locate dialogic elements that invite engagement that is fluid, open and polyphonic. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485851">Cunliffe and Eriksen (2011)</xref> maintain,<disp-quote>
<p>Dialogism … embodies relationally-responsive living conversation and the understanding that conversations are never final; the need for ongoing dialogue; to be care-ful in bringing different views, values and meanings into the open; of respecting differences and shaping new meanings and possibilities for action from those differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485851">Cunliffe and Eriksen, 2011</xref>).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In our consideration of dialogue as an embodied activity, we think that open, dialogic gestures embrace social poesis; a state that implies that there is never a completion but that there is always more to come. This way of gesturing is foundational to the process of leadership as we are conceiving of it and can be observed in its more nuanced form in the art of music making. For instance, orchestral performances are based in the main on the gestures of the conductor that are able to be read and understood by all the musicians on stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715013485851">Koivunen and Wennes, 2011</xref>). Similarly, small music groups, whether jazz combos or chamber ensembles, rely on gestures that are both tacitly understood and explicitly demonstrated in order to create a coherent performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715013485851">Murnighan and Conlon, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, our approach to the materiality of leadership is to explore gesture in its multiple forms: as written text, in performance and as a set of relationships that can be examined cognitively and emotionally. Indeed, marks on a page, whether placed by a writer, drawer or composer are intentional gestures that invite people to respond and engage with that text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715013485851">Hatten, 2004</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715013485851">Schneckloth (2008)</xref> claims in relation to the art of sketching:<disp-quote>
<p>In the gesture of a drawing, there abides the question of how human beings hold memory. A trace of the body, the projection of an emotion, a record of the experience of seeing are woven into the gestured mark, a kinetically vitalized inscription that can serve as a site of empathy and invitation as much as a line of mimetic description (p. 278).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>To discuss the gestures of text, their invitations and responses in performance, we first explore the written form of Richard Strauss’s (1894) setting of J. H. Mackay’s poem <italic>Morgen!</italic> and then draw our discussion of music into the leadership literature by focusing on the gestures of embodied reflexivity in performance. To work through this process, we discuss the same text as it is realised in performance by violinist Joshua Bell, soprano Renée Fleming and their piano accompanist (Bell and Fleming, 2010). These illustrations generate fertile space for considering leadership practices in relation to cognitive and affective experiences and their translation into leadership performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1742715013485851"><title>Music and embodiment</title>
<p>The act of making music is inherently physical and communal. In his discussion on the place of the body in spatial perception, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty (1962: 79)</xref> draws on the image of an organist in rehearsal prior to a concert. The organist does not commit to memory the exact locations of the stops, keys and pedals but rather ‘settles into the organ’ (p. 168), as the organ and organist become one. His illustration is a poignant guide for leadership scholars as we seek to understand the place of the body and embodiment in the practice of leading – of ‘settling into’ an embodied relational dynamic. Merleau-Ponty’s agenda was to seek ways of understanding how people engage with the world, determining that it is ‘our <italic>experience</italic> [that is the] ultimate court of appeal’ (p. 27, emphasis in the original). Thus for Merleau-Ponty, ‘to understand is to experience the harmony between what we aim at and what is given, between the intention and the performance’ (p. 167). Our moment-by-moment experiences of our life-world shape our behaviours, as we gradually build a repertoire of responses to events as they occur and it is the body that is the centre of activity – or as Merleau-Ponty claims, it ‘anchors’ us (p. 167) – as we seek to make sense of the complexities of our life-world.</p>
<p>The body, then, is the site for cognitive and emotional encounters with the world, and for Merleau-Ponty’s organist ‘his movements during rehearsal are consecratory gestures: they draw affective vectors, discover emotional sources, and create a space of expressiveness as the movements of the augur delimit the <italic>templum</italic>’ (p. 168). Here with mixed metaphors, Merleau-Ponty is searching for a language to articulate the notion that perception is an integrative phenomenon that has its source in human bodies. Cognitions and emotions, for Merleau-Ponty, are forces which attract and cluster around perceptions. Gestures create the dedicated space (the sacred templum) within which perceptions are realised into conversations and actions that are sometimes bold and deliberate, while at others are more subtle and nuanced. In adopting Merleau-Ponty’s exemplar, and in relating it to the performative elements of leading, we claim that the traditional polarities of leader and follower collapse. However, one is not subsumed by the other, for following Merleau-Ponty’s illustration, the organ and organist are one and yet distinctly different at the same time.</p>
<p>By attending to the situation as it unfolds in all of its fluid dynamism, leaders and followers together become sensitised to the demands of each moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715013485851">Monin and Bathurst, 2008</xref>) and are embraced by the ‘affective vectors’ of which Merleau-Ponty writes. Rather than being neutral and passive, these vectors are experienced as ‘pushes and pulls of varying affective tone’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715013485851">Keeping, 2006</xref>: 181), enabling agents to respond intuitively and reflexively as the situation develops.<sup>∓</sup></p>
<p>However, privileging our subjective experience may be problematic if we merely focus on the sensate. Embodiment refers to the subjective experience of one’s own material body and it provides a way of understanding the body as simultaneously both subject and object. The body can be interpreted as an ‘object’ that may be looked upon, not only by others but also by the self; it has an external physical materiality that cannot be denied. This objective understanding of the body is captured by the German notion of <italic>körper</italic> to denote the ‘structural objectified aspects of physical being’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715013485851">Shilling, 1993</xref>: 129). Yet, the body is also subject, or <italic>lieb</italic>, which refers to the ‘living, feeling, sensing and emotional aspects of bodily experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715013485851">Shilling, 1993</xref>: 129). This is a useful linguistic distinction for understanding the processes of embodiment as it captures the reciprocal duality of actually living in a body; the body as an object cannot be divorced from the body as a subject, as one effectively emerges from the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1742715013485851">Waskul and Vannini, 2006</xref>). It is also helpful for cutting through dichotomous understandings of the self that privilege mind/body, or, subject/object. Instead, the experience of living in a body is brought to the fore and space is created for the multi-dimensional and multi-sensorial aspects of everyday life and, indeed, leadership.</p>
<p>The articulation of this kind of experience is found most poignantly in works of art; for, as we read a novel, look at a painting or listen to a piece of music, we are challenged to both cognitively analyse and subjectively feel in order to synthesise our own encounters. The artist, whether that be a poet, sculptor, composer or painter ‘takes hold of a fragment of nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 2004</xref>: 96) and in the act of composing makes sense of the implications of that fragment and provides openings for the audience to embody that within themselves. It is our experience, then, in all its multifarious elements, that is the ground for our engagement in the world.</p>
<p>All the elements of our daily experience gesture to us in a variety of ways. Our physical, social and emotional responses evoke ways of being and behaving in the world. For, as Merleau-Ponty notes, all the elements of our physical world and our bodily relationship to those objects are connected by intentional, symbolic gestures.<disp-quote>
<p>The things of the world are not simply neutral <italic>objects</italic> which stand before us for our contemplation. Each one of them symbolises or recalls a particular way of behaving, provoking in us reactions which are either favourable or unfavourable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 2004</xref>: 63).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, artistic expressions are intentional acts that invite an audience of readers and listeners to concretise them. With this in mind, we turn to the poem which provided the reason for Strauss to compose his song. In the following, we use the language of music in order to articulate some of the harmonic intentions of the Strauss song which allows us to closely analyse the nuances of the performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742715013485851"><title>Morgen! <italic>the written text</italic></title>
<p>The J. H. Mackay poem <italic>Morgen!</italic> provides the lyrics for the fourth and final song of Strauss’s Opus 27 cycle. As with the other Opus 27 songs, ‘Strauss did not so much need poems of high literary quality as texts with striking expressive images or situations that could ignite his imagination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715013485851">Gilliam and Youmans, 2001</xref>: 510), and <italic>Morgen!</italic> is a typical example. It is a love poem, full of optimism for a future that will be filled with a serene passion, like the stillness of the ocean on a warm summer’s day (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742715013485851">Figure 1</xref>). The two stanzas begin with the conjunction ‘and’, implying openness and anticipation for what might follow. While this openness presents Strauss with an opportunity, the poem also poses compositional dilemmas. For instance, how might music (which implies sound) represent ‘speechless <italic>silence</italic>’? Furthermore, how might a composer articulate the elliptical open-endedness of the poem within a tonal construct that relies on a musical set of relationships that begin and end definitively?
<fig id="fig1-1742715013485851" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><italic>Morgen!</italic> John Henry Mackay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715013485851">Fischer-Dieskau, 1991</xref>: 301).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715013485851-fig1.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>As a composer known for his large-scale and programmatic tone poems and operas, Strauss was familiar with the compositional problems of working with evocative images. His turn to tone poems released him from formal symphonic constraints, but imposed other less fixed boundaries on him, the constrictions of the narrative. Adorno maintained that Strauss dealt with these complications through ‘embodying the contradictions, pure and uncompromised, in its innermost structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715013485851">Adorno 1981</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715013485851">Hepokoski, 1992</xref>: 135).</p>
<p>Although Adorno considered the use of programmatic impulses limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715013485851">Adorno, 1953/2000: 285</xref>), Strauss himself declared that, ‘I consider it a legitimate artistic method to create a correspondingly new form for every new subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715013485851">Adorno, 1981</xref> cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715013485851">Hepokoski, 1992</xref>: 139). The use of narratives liberated Strauss from traditional formal constraints and provided a facility to continually explore unique problems as they arose within individual stories. For instance, rather than presenting irresolvable problems, the elliptical opening and ending, as well as the phrase ‘speechless silence’ in the Mackay poem, became for Strauss a problem to relish rather than reject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715013485851">Petersen, 1996: 261</xref>). Hence, by eschewing predictable concordant tonal relationships, he opens the composition by deferring and delaying resolutions, enabling him to deal with the problem of how to begin and end, while at the same time implying a <italic>before</italic> and <italic>after</italic> of the narrative.</p>
<p>He deals with this aesthetic challenge by first establishing the emotional environment, at the same time offering the vocalist a solid tonal platform from which to sing; all done with a sense of uncertainty implied in the poem’s opening and close. Strauss achieves this by considering the relationships between the piano accompaniment, the melodic line and the vocal solo, as almost three separate entities that, although different, come together as a unified whole. Similarly, he ends the song with the same sense of uncertainty, which he accomplishes by offering a final chord that is high in the piano’s register without a bass note grounding the chord firmly in the home key.</p>
<p>Strauss adopts a very simple structure for <italic>Morgen!</italic> The first phrase is repeated, followed by a third section in a different style and tonality. The song finishes with fragments of the opening section (the structure can be summarised as AAB-Coda). This form anchors the song while at the same time liberating the vocal line so that it operates ‘completely independent of the accompanist [by beginning] in mid-thought’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715013485851">Gorrell, 1993</xref>: 332). Strauss establishes this separation by beginning the vocal line on the second half of the second beat of the measure, what is known in musical terms as a weak pulse (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1742715013485851">Figure 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig2-1742715013485851" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The vocal entry of Morgen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742715013485851">Strauss, 1894</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715013485851-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>By establishing two independent parts where the accompanist’s melodic line rises and falls in a symmetrically expressive line, contrasted by the more angular asymmetrical vocal solo, Strauss frees himself from the constraints of the poem in order to create an open-ended composition that continually resists closure. The first A Section fails to return to the home chord (G) opening the possibility of more to come. What does come is a repeat of the accompaniment which provides stability for the vocal soloist to explore the emotional intent of the poem and to attend to the expressive demands of the vocal melody.</p>
<p>The B Section opens new creative possibilities for Strauss. Approaching it, he resists the certainty of full harmonious and expected closure. Rhythmic momentum is disrupted by the long sustained chords in the piano accompaniment replacing the broken chords of the A Sections. The vocalist meanwhile sings repeated notes, almost as monotones, thereby achieving a sense of stillness and silence. The bass line of long-held chords initially descends stepwise via unrelated chords. By moving away from tonal predictability, these chords disrupt certainty and by this ambiguity, open for the listener unexpected possibilities.</p>
<p>The tempo and stylistic instruction which Strauss gives is ‘Langsam’ – to perform slowly. The absence of a metronome marking to indicate the speed requires the performers to understand and realise the expressive and tonal implications of the score moment-by-moment. Strauss reinforces his instruction by adding <italic>sehrgetragen</italic> (very slowly like ‘being carried’), noting that the performers need to take this slowness into account. When the vocalist enters, Strauss adds a further instruction <italic>sehrruhig</italic> – that they should proceed very quietly. His insistence on these instructions seems almost redundant as he has already indicated from the outset that they should perform softly. Clearly, his desire is that the performers evoke an atmosphere of open-ended calm and serenity, performed in a spirit of mutual support, as if each is carrying the other.</p>
<p>The vocal line ends on the leading note which propels the song into the final Coda and the accompanist’s return to the original broken chords of Section A. Strauss again resists closure by notating a final chord that is harmonically weak, clustered in the upper frequencies of the piano and violin and played very silently.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715013485851"><title>Morgen! <italic>in performance</italic></title>
<p>The issues highlighted in the <italic>Morgen!</italic> composition offer a rich resource for performers to enact the written and implied emotionality within it. Our intention in analysing the composition has been to show the gestural prompts within the text which enable performers to render this composition with the same openness that Strauss leaves on the printed page. Musicians, then, are challenged to bring together textual narratives with sounds which are fleeting and ineffable. Thus, there is in performance an ‘ideal point at which, when words are sung, the thought and the sound meet; the point at which two otherwise irreconcilable worlds find common ground’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715013485851">Spillman, 1996</xref>: 313). Indeed the work of the performer is to find ways of communicating paradoxes, contradictions, complexities and even irreconcilable differences, artfully.</p>
<p>For the song <italic>Morgen!</italic> the goal of any performance is to achieve ‘intimacy, vulnerability, and connection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715013485851">Spillman, 1996</xref>: 313) and these ideals may be achieved as the soloists and the accompanist enter into a collaborative and co-constitutive relationship. To explore this, we turn to the performance of <italic>Morgen!</italic> by soprano Renée Fleming, violinist Joshua Bell and their unidentified accompanist. As mentioned earlier, the version that we discuss can be viewed on the social networking website YouTube (Bell and Fleming, 2010) and is part of a concert which Joshua Bell performed in the informal and intimate setting of the Penthouse at the Lincoln Centre in New York (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715013485851">Bell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this rendering of the song, it can be observed that the Penthouse has been decorated by Bell to replicate the lounge room at his home. There are photos of family members and famous artists decorating the wall. Given such personable items potentially serve as expressions of who we are in the world and our relationship to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1742715013485851">Turan, 2010</xref>), the presence of these material objects anchor the forthcoming performance within a space of intimate reciprocity. Furthermore, the construction of a home-like space captures the human desire for refuge in familiar places and spaces, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715013485851">Bachelard (1969)</xref> has referred to as the ‘ultimate poetic depth of the space of the house … [that] shelters day-dreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace’ (p. 6). In addition, the audience is seated very close to the small stage on which Bell stands as he invites artists to perform with him, contributing further to the generation of an intimate space of shared experience and reciprocity. Because of its relaxed setting, the performance of <italic>Morgen!</italic> does not have the refinement nor deliberate gestures that occur in more formal concert environments. This lack of self-consciousness makes for a more spontaneous performance as well as rich data for analytic purposes.</p>
<p>The YouTube rendering begins with the camera focusing on the guest artist Renée Fleming who will join Joshua Bell on stage. The accompanist slips in almost unnoticed, while Fleming, dressed in black, walks through the audience acknowledging people as she approaches the stage. She kisses and clasps the violinist’s right hand, looks back to the accompanist to ensure his readiness, rubs her hands (as if to say, ‘I’m working now’), turns to the audience and nods several times, mouthing ‘hello’ and stands waiting for Bell to begin his solo line. These preparatory gestures allow the performers to claim the space from which they will perform (<italic>their</italic> templum if you will), and then to invite the audience to create their own affective space within which they will respond to the music. Even though the audience is in darkness, these arrival gestures establish a co-creative space where the trio <italic>plus</italic> the audience become present in the moment.</p>
<p>It is salient to pause here and note how much has occurred before the performers begin the song. These preparatory arrival actions have taken only 16 seconds and yet the musicians have established their presence as active participants in the performance that is to follow, and have invited the audience into their space.</p>
<p>Joshua Bell begins the performance with a nod, placing his bow at its heel on the violin, and draws out the first note. His preparatory gesture has signalled the tempo and mood of the piece to the pianist and his first note allows him to ease into the melodic line without any sudden crunch or scrape. This sense of unending line continues with a sliding (glissando) second sustained note, moderating the tempo with the use of <italic>rubato</italic>, a technique of managing and even suspending the regular beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715013485851">Kravitt, 1973</xref>). Meanwhile the pianist has finished his first broken chord and must wait until Bell signals the beginning of the next chord, with the change in bow direction and a full sway of his body, again in tempo. Bell continues this habit of signalling to the pianist for the next chord by moving his body throughout the entire first section. We see occasional glances from the pianist, who checks to observe the position of Bell’s bow as a guide to the beginning of each new broken chord. It is not until the trio come close to the end of the first A Section that they play more strictly in tempo, allowing the piano and violin to deal with the complication of the syncopated rising bass line and to set a steady tempo for the soprano entry.</p>
<p>Just prior to her beginning to sing, Fleming looks to her left to connect with Bell and then commences without any obvious inward breath. This allows her to capture the essence of the ellipsis which begins the Mackay text. At the end of her first phrase, Fleming glances over to Bell to check when his next down bow will begin, as her phrase starts slightly after him. Fleming leads into the descending phrase ‘<italic>lang-samnie-der-stei-gen</italic>’ (‘slowly descending’) by drawing her hands close to her breast, leaving Bell to finish the accompanying violin line. Meanwhile she opens her gesture in readiness for the final B Section.</p>
<p>Bell completes his melodic phrase at the A Section moving from the leading note to the unexpected flattened note of the next chord in order to achieve the gradual quietening down to the very soft playing that Strauss requires. This softening of the dynamic plus the dissonance resolving onto another dissonance establishes the platform for Fleming to begin the recitative-like B Section. Here it is important to note that in musical language the word ‘harmony’ does not imply order or even an absence of conflict. As a concept, harmony relies on the relationship between consonance and dissonance. Composers like Strauss stretch listeners’ tolerance for dissonance and often delay resolutions thereby creating further tension. Indeed, it is this ability to work with harmonic and rhythmic dissonance that makes music open and artful.</p>
<p>For the first statement in the B Section, Fleming opens her left hand; then for the second she lowers her hands, looks down and then moves her eyes gradually up and over the audience, closing her lips over the final consonant of ‘<italic>Schwei-gen</italic>’ (‘silence’) humming the final note. Her final unresolved leading note opens the tonality for the solo violin to complete the final melodic fragment.</p>
<p>In the Coda, Bell sustains the notes and signals with a swaying body when each pairing of notes should begin. He begins the final note on an up-bow which gives him the opportunity to sustain the line. This is a high-risk strategy because he disrupts the chord with his bow change. However, in making this judgement to play the final note using two bow strokes, he is able to sustain intensity while allowing for a natural diminuendo as he draws the bow towards its point. The performance ends with Bell and Fleming looking into each others’ eyes, embodying the mute silence of the Mackay poem. They kiss, Fleming then turns to the pianist, kisses him, acknowledges the audience with several bows and then quickly leaves the stage. Throughout the performance there has been minimal direct eye contact among the trio. Furthermore, Fleming has her back to the pianist. Nonetheless, they are all inter-connected: the pianist is able to observe Bell by looking up and through his peripheral vision; Bell and Fleming are in constant contact through their peripheral vision; and this triangular communicative configuration provides a mechanism for the accompanist to anticipate the length of Fleming’s sustained notes while continually checking with Bell both directly and indirectly. Along with this is a dynamic and intuitive relationship among the trio; a tacit knowing, lodged in their bodies, that is difficult to describe explicitly, but nonetheless observable and effective.</p>
<p>Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau discusses this intuitive way of knowing-in-performance in an interview with Jens Malte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715013485851">Fischer (2005)</xref>. Describing his working relationship with his piano accompanist Wolfgang Sawallisch in the 1970s, Fischer-Dieskau articulates the phenomena we observed in the Fleming-Bell performance: that musicians have an acute awareness of each other’s living embodiment and the emotional intent of their gestures. These are both deliberate acts as well as spontaneous intuitive responses.<disp-quote>
<p>J M F: How was Wolfgang Sawallisch as an accompanist?</p>
<p>D F-D: He does it amazingly well. He always knew in advance when you would breathe. And when a degree of exhaustion was evident after an hour and a half on the concert platform, then he knew it, <italic>he had a sense for it</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715013485851">Fischer, 2005</xref>, n. p. emphasis added).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here we pause and recapitulate our narrative. We have offered a summary analysis of the text of the Strauss song <italic>Morgen!</italic> and described how it has been represented in performance. Before addressing more directly the notion of embodiment and leadership, it is also important to note that our description is limited in its scope. By this we mean that even though our eyes have been guided by the camera shots of the performance that the director has chosen to reveal, we still struggle to craft into a fully comprehensive narrative all the dynamics of the short four minute event. Along with these limitations, there is also the audience, silent in their attendance but nonetheless co-constitutive of the performance. We have no way of narrating or even knowing about the band in the background that has performed for other pieces but remain mute for this song. Nor are we privy to the gentleman’s story at the fringe of the audience as he straightens his tie and repositions his spectacles. All these elements remain unaddressed because they are, through the use of stage lights and camera angles, deliberately set in the background. And yet they remain present as gestures, which enable the performances to unfold. All these elements are ‘consciously putting into motion a set of hopeful potential relationships between artist and audience, <italic>a gesture toward community</italic> [and create] a mindful sense of how participatory creative relationships may develop and thrive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715013485851">Schneckloth, 2008</xref>: 278, emphasis in the original).</p>
<p>Using these analyses as an exemplar, we turn to the embodiment of leadership and propose that through gesture and the use of time and space, we can articulate and assist in developing our collective understandings of leadership as a process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742715013485851"><title>Towards a materiality of leadership</title>
<p>Thus far we have discussed a poem set to music by Richard Strauss and performed by violinist Joshua Bell, soprano Renée Fleming and their piano accompanist. In considering this work, our purpose has been to explore the gestural environment within which leadership occurs. In the process, we have gone beyond music’s emotional nature and explored some of the deliberate elements articulated in the written score that create the potential for emotional expression and evocation. We now turn more particularly to leadership as a process that is enacted within a community of people as they seek to understand the nature and meaning of co-constitutive spaces in their reciprocal corporeality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715013485851">Aho, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715013485851">Boyer, 2005</xref>), or gesture.</p>
<p>To explore these insights we return to the Mackay poem and to its intent. Two lovers stand on the seashore before a calm blue sea, feeling the warmth of the sun whilst gazing into each other’s eyes. The poem links the emotional relationship of the lovers with the environment within which they stand. Thus, the ephemeral and intangible elements of happiness and joy are located within a physical context, an environment which contains discernible elements which are accessible through the eyes of the lovers and our memories as perceivers providing a seamless transition within the text between emotional experience and physical encounter. The performance of Strauss’s setting of the poem that we have described offers a similar openness. For, although we have discussed the composition itself and the actions of the performers as discrete elements, they are nonetheless all embodied as a living <italic>Gestalt</italic> together situated in a time and place. The work of leadership is similarly embodied. Although the tasks of planning, strategizing and organising derive from intellectual activity that might result in written texts which are passed around members of the organisation, ultimately these ideas are translated into embodied activities. It is the leader’s ability to become acutely aware of his or her body and its potential to communicate that underlines our understandings here of leadership activity. For, as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715013485851">Boyer, 2005</xref>) notes;<disp-quote>
<p>The torso leans in to emphasize the gravity of a point, or leans back to invite dialogue; arms are raised in disbelief or crossed to fend off critics, hands flutter in a thousand arcs of emphasis(p.. 245).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The leadership response is to become aware of more than content alone, but also the embodied form of that content. The Strauss song as we have described it is a stylised expression of the human voice in conversation and action. Taking this outside this specific musical forum, voices communicate ‘attitudes and gestures … [and] … subtle variations in, for example, prosody, length and accentuation of the syllables, and breathing, all convey information outside the semantics of the utterances’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715013485851">Aho, 2009</xref>: 35). The embodiment of leadership, then, necessarily means that we turn our attention to vocal gestures and the haptics of expression.</p>
<p>The poetic text, the composition, the performers, and the audience are embodied in one place; in this instance, at the Penthouse at the Lincoln Centre in New York in January 2010. The modalities are separated by thin, ‘gossamer’-like spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715013485851">Doucet, 2008</xref>) and each mode calls the other into existence. We are not able to say which individual is the leader, for ‘there is no “bodily me”, no sense of [an individual] body, in the absence of the perspective of <italic>others</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715013485851">Crossley, 2006a</xref>: 87, emphasis added). Thus, as Crossley maintains of individual identity:</p><disp-quote>
<p>Embodied consciousness gives me a world, a setting, but in focusing on the setting I necessarily put myself out of focus. Embodied consciousness sinks into the background, allowing the world around me to be foregrounded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715013485851">Crossley, 2006a</xref>: 79).</p></disp-quote>
<p>The embodiment of leadership through gesture necessarily invokes the other, whether that be a single individual or a group. Indeed, according to Merleau-Ponty, for the self to be fully present, there is paradoxically a negation of the self, a negation that implies being and invites the creation of spaces within which people sense, feel, think and act. This ‘negation of negation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 1968</xref>: 54) opens space for becoming and it is this openness that underpins not only Strauss’s articulation of <italic>Morgen!</italic> but also the German Romantic Lieder as a genre.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742715013485851">Figure 3</xref> graphically illustrates the interconnections among the performers. Although the individuals retain their unique identity, they share a co-constructed space together. They invite each other into that space and it is in this space where leadership occurs (shown by the grey intersecting centre). No single performer is ultimately responsible for the work’s creation, and indeed if they were to perform their parts individually, their music would be unexceptional. It is only together and with the audience members that they are able to create a profound work of art. Leadership, we claim, is similarly a collaborative process which continually invites people into the affective domain where actions will occur (the templum). Each individual performer is required to ‘accept’ or ‘block’ the offer to enter this co-creative space (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson, 2003</xref>: 122) and in affirming the other by gesturing ‘yes’, they invite the audience to make the same choice.
<fig id="fig3-1742715013485851" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The co-creative space.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1742715013485851-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>There may, however, be those who do not accept the offer, as is perhaps the case with the gentleman straightening his tie, who appears to be waiting for this song to finish and for a more preferred artist to appear (we note that earlier in the performance he was distractedly talking with his partner). By resisting or refusing the offer to participate in the process of creation, further opportunities may be shut down. For, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1742715013485851">Thomson (2003)</xref> claims, ‘those who say “Yes” are rewarded by the adventures they have, and those who say “No” are rewarded by the safety they attain’ (p. 122). Leadership, then, is found in the ways in which we affirm the other, and notwithstanding the potential for initiatives and invitations to be rejected, and opportunities closed, we think that the art form that we have explored offers an exemplar for how open gestures may inform ways of leading that are invitational.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Romanticism as an artistic genre <italic>and</italic> political phenomenon in itself avoids closure, defers endings and creates space for more to come. Indeed, this is a place of great discomfort because it requires that leadership is continually constituted moment-by-moment by bodies gesturing to each other in an open and mutual embodiment. The discomfort arises from what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485851">Kermode (1967)</xref> describes as being in a liminal space; in the middle, somewhere between a beginning and end. The Romantic expectation is that we will construct our identity without the comfort of relationships that rely on stepwise formulae that dispel dissonance and leave us in the safety of concordant harmony. Perhaps this is why we are prone to privileging an individual, to whom we give <italic>leader</italic> status, because he or she is supposed to assuage our fears of living <italic>between</italic>, without any sense of how to begin or to end. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485851">Kermode (1967)</xref> claims;</p><disp-quote>
<p>[People] in the middest make considerable imaginative investments and coherent patterns which, by the provision of an end, make possible a satisfying consonance with the origins and with the middle (p. 17).</p></disp-quote>
<p>The Romantics do not offer such comfort, but instead require us to engage with the uncertainties of our environment and deal with dissonant problems as they arise as best we can. In essence, Romanticism is a rebellion against closure, and in keeping with the Romantic tradition, neither Mackay nor Strauss offers the consolation of a clear beginning and a complete end.</p>
<p>It is this unfinalisability that is the ground from which the materiality of embodied leadership grows; and the ability to avoid endings, authoritarian claims and non-negotiable judgements are at the heart of Romanticism. It is this aesthetic orientation that became the basis for Romanticism’s characterisation as a rebellion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715013485851">Newton, 1964</xref>) and translation into the kinds of political actions that resist the totalitarian claims of ‘Fascism, Communism, and Nazism, but also managerialism, whether progressive or corporate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715013485851">Cherniss, 2006</xref>: xxix). It represents a desire to throw off the bounds of control and to explore the unknown, thereby opening spaces and times for experimentation and problem-finding instead of the deadening routines of practical problem-solving. Thus, it is this open-endedness that the Romantic aesthetic links with embodied leadership practice.</p>
<p>Avoiding closure and deferring endings implies that ‘relations are inherently conversational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715013485851">Crossley, 2006b</xref>: 32) and it is in opening dialogue with the other that gestures towards further interactions. Thus, the spaces in which performances-as-conversations occur create the settings where one is able to ‘shift from the spatiality characterising one sensory realm to that of another and back again without losing our hold on the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715013485851">Langer, 1989</xref>: 77). By implication then, the body is both <italic>being</italic> <italic>seen</italic> and <italic>seeing</italic> and therefore has a ‘double belongingness to the order of the “object” and to the order of the “subject” [and] reveals to us quite unexpected relations between the two orders’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 1968</xref>: 137). The notion of reversibility in that bodies are in conversation with each other implies that spaces are deliberately, purposefully and intentionally co-created where each body ‘<italic>calls</italic> for the other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715013485851">Merleau-Ponty, 1968</xref>: 137, emphasis added) and are invited to respond.</p>
<p>The analogue of the performance that we have discussed demonstrates that leadership is an incarnate activity that occurs in the moment as people invite others into spatially-bound and temporal relationships. Even though the musicians have a written score from which to work, this is merely a skeletal form which requires embodiment in time and space. Furthermore, there can be no performance without the audience calling forth the performers to express themselves within this moment.</p>
<p>Romanticism is more than an idealistic notion; it is an invitation to forms of concretised embodiment and openness, where the object and subject become intertwined into a situated co-creative process. Strauss’s composition of <italic>Morgen!</italic> and its realisation by Bell, Fleming and their accompanist as discussed, is an example of this inter-connection and co-creation. Throughout the composition, Strauss avoids closure, introduces unresolved harmonies and concludes the song with a sense that there is more to be sung and imagined. Furthermore, the trio as they perform the song gesture to each other and the audience in ways that are inclusive and opening. Their use of rubato enables them to wrest the never-ending onslaught of chronological time and suspend it in a supratemporal environment, the <italic>kairos</italic> of social time that has its own ‘internal, immanent, quasi-temporal structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715013485851">Ingarden, 1986</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>The leadership task as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715013485851">Ladkin (2010)</xref> in her analyses of Heidegger’s notion of being is similarly open-ended and relies on people using tools that are ‘ready-to-hand’ while at the same time communicating that readiness through gestures that in the moment demonstrate a ‘present-at-hand engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715013485851">Ladkin, 2010</xref>: 44). This involves understanding the nature of time and space, and their fluidity. Leadership as a process, then, involves becoming acutely aware of how space is being deployed by actors within it and how time is given or even suspended through gestural pauses, intimations and invitations.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1742715013485851"><title>Conclusions: Reflexive embodiment</title>
<p>Our discussion has centred on the aesthetics of gesture by focusing on a work of art. We have located our study within the domain of relational leadership and have maintained that gesturing openness allows a dialogic environment to develop that is embodied in the members of the community within which leadership occurs. In order to provide this openness and the opportunities for co-creativity, gesture resists closure. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1742715013485851">ten Bos (2005)</xref> understands the openness of gesture as being beyond teleological forms of finality and, therefore, beyond means-ends formulae. He argues that, ‘the gesture refers to a formless kind of life that allows for a community (polis) without entrenched identities, functions, and exclusions’ (p. 27).</p>
<p>Every moment offers an opportunity for gestural responses and such gestures need not be boldly overt or grand statements. For instance, small gestures such as ‘tears welling up’ may embody a profound sense of pain and anger that signal the desire for further engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715013485851">Guillemin and Gillam, 2004</xref>: 261). Small gestures may also act as affirmative cues that invite ongoing collaboration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715013485851">Bathurst and Ladkin, 2012</xref>); even ‘<italic>mundane</italic> small details, actions and conversations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715013485851">Cunliffe and Eriksen, 2011</xref>: 1428, emphasis added) are important gestural indicators.</p>
<p>In an organisational context, gestures may be as simple as a smile, nod or even a brief ‘hi’ as people pass each other in corridors. They may be as routine as leaving an office door ajar, or more deliberate in refraining from answering a phone or responding to a text message during conversations or meetings. These gestures provide a context from which further intentional acts may be expressed, inviting interaction.</p>
<p>Therefore, as our foray into the world of musical performance has suggested, gestures not only evoke audible spaces and experiences but also tactility, for, as McLuhan claims, ‘touch is not so much a separate sense as the very interplay of the senses’ (McLuhan cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715013485851">Simon, 1969</xref>: 94). This interplay is also expressed in leadership through invitational gestures which change the contexts within which organisations function. Organisations become, then, more than places for the meeting of minds. Ideas are transformed into bodies who share together through a whole gamut of nuanced gestures that enrich meaning and encourage dialogue. As an embodied process leadership creates a space where ‘the cloak of authority’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715013485851">Etherington, 2007</xref>: 600) slips from ‘tonic–dominant’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715013485851">Kermode, 1967</xref>: 30) forms of problem-definition to problem-solution and finally to problem-closure, to those that are dialogic, transparent, open and co-creative. For, acts of ‘problem-construction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1742715013485851">Zaccaro and Klimoski, 2002</xref>: 8) rely on ‘our own not knowing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715013485851">McDonnell, 2005</xref>: 135) and an acknowledgement that our gestures draw on ‘ethically important moments’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715013485851">Guillemin and Gillam, 2004</xref>) within which we invite each other to participate openly and actively, without a concomitant need for closure and certainty. These gestural invitations mean that we may enter a conversation as one person and emerge as another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715013485851">Butler, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Our presentations of ourselves in the world are dynamic and contingent, and as we invite the other into responsive relationship, together we are continually transformed. For instance, our encounters with Strauss and his Lieder, especially <italic>Morgen!</italic> direct us to experiences that are emotionally charged and visceral. These bodily encounters are both audible and tactile, and open the possibility for the kind of reciprocal exchange that is based on our many narratives that surface in our relationships. Like Strauss, these narratives do not rest on a predetermined form, but imply fluidity in our organisational structures. In response, leadership becomes a gestural art that invites open exchange, dialogue and co-creativity.</p>
