<abstract>
<p>This study explores the sound world of the performer, building on increasing evidence that timbre is the most salient variable performance parameter and can also be the primary source of inspiration and structure in composition. Psychological, psychoacoustic, musicological and aesthetic literature is reviewed, to establish the connection between existing (listener focused) research and potential performer motivation and affect. An interview study with one elite performer/composer (classical guitar) was undertaken to investigate timbre in live performance, specifically as part of the communication process. Results show that timbre salience varies according to style: in Baroque music it mainly enhances other performance parameters and in ‘contemporary’ music it is integral to composition and interpretation. Emotional affect in the performer appears to be related to inner drive towards optimal representation of musical understanding, which then generates the evolution of extended instrumental techniques, allowing ever more imaginative use of timbre. Parallels with aesthetic and philosophical theory are offered as explanation for some of the more intangible elements of performance, particularly in relation to the main priorities and motivations of the performer. Further research might synthesize psychological and philosophical reasoning in this respect and establish whether these findings are common to other instruments, performers and cultures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Varying timbre is one of the principal ways through which performers communicate musical structure, ideas, emotions and musical personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson &amp; Juslin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735610388898">Juslin, Friberg, Schoonderwaldt, &amp; Karlsson, 2004</xref>). Timbre was held by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0305735610388898">Seashore (1936</xref>, p. 24) to be ‘the most basic attribute of all music’ and more recently by Levitin to be ‘the most important and ecologically relevant feature of auditory experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610388898">2006/2008</xref>, p. 45), assertions that have been echoed by other researchers. Timbre has also been shown to be fundamental to human communication in both speech and music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610388898">Patel, 2008</xref>) to the extent that even very young babies distinguish and remember timbres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735610388898">McAdams &amp; Giordano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0305735610388898">Trainor, Wu &amp; Tsang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0305735610388898">Trehub, Endman &amp; Thorpe, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735610388898">Rudy, 2007</xref>). These observations are supported by increasing evidence that, unlike other performance parameters, timbre is processed in both right and left hemispheres of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735610388898">Menon et al., 2002</xref>) which is in accord with findings that it is perceptually more salient than pitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735610388898">Huron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610388898">Patel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The ecological significance of timbre (its relationship with the immediate environment) is of particular interest to the performer, for reasons summarized by Evens:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the sound, the total timbre of an instrument is never just that instrument, but that instrument in concert with all the other vibrations in the room, other instruments, the creaking of chairs, even the constant, barely perceptible motion of the air. (2005, p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Dynamic manipulation of sound is critical in performance – not least in the need to adjust to different acoustic conditions. However, despite scientific support and increasing acceptance that tone colour is at the heart of expressive musical performance, it remains less researched than other performance parameters, particularly in a musicological context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610388898">Johnson, 1999</xref>). Under-represented in existing literature is the subjectivity and ‘artistic value’ of timbre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610388898">Boulez, 1987</xref>, p. 161), specifically its function as one of the most potent elements of emotional communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610388898">Hadja, Kendall, Carteret, &amp; Harshberger, 1997/2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735610388898">Padova, Santoboni &amp; Belardinelli, 2005</xref>). Similarly, its critical role in composition has not been widely investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735610388898">Boulez, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610388898">Krumhansl &amp; Iverson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735610388898">Lerdahl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0305735610388898">Schönberg, 1911</xref>). This is despite continuing advances in empirical research that include substantial progress in the analysis, modelling, auditory processing and perceptual organization of sound (for illustration and implications see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams, Depalle &amp; Clarke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0305735610388898">Peretz &amp; Zatorre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0305735610388898">Tsang 2002</xref>). There have also been notable advances in measuring physiological arousal induced by emotional responses to music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735610388898">Panksepp, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0305735610388898">Rickard, 2004</xref>) and the significance of this phenomenon in terms of the wider aesthetic experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735610388898">Konečni, Wanic &amp; Brown, 2007</xref>). Such research, although providing a wealth of valuable information, does not recognize that the performer’s perceptions and responses might have a different foundation from those of the listener. The musicological and emotional implications of timbre have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735610388898">McAdams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735610388898">Padova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0305735610388898">Pressnitzer, McAdams Winsberg, &amp; Fineberg, 2000</xref>) and because it is both physically and aesthetically under direct control of the performer, it seems a suitable medium through which to investigate performers’ subjective experiences. In this article I draw on and apply existing scientific timbre research within the context of live performance.</p>
<p>The article is organized as follows. First, I address the lack of precise terminology for timbre and respond by offering some clarification. As a sound basis of investigation I then draw on existing literature to suggest why timbre, though significant, has received relatively less attention than other performance variables. The apparent dichotomy between quantitative and qualitative timbre research is addressed by some artistic and philosophical discussion regarding the employment and effectiveness of timbre. This is followed by a brief exploration of listener perception of timbre, intended as a backdrop for the investigation of performer perception. Next, recent studies on timbre as part of the communication process are discussed in relation to the aims of the current study. A qualitative (interview-based) study of the aims, strategies, imaginative influences and employment of advanced techniques in respect of tone production of one purposefully chosen elite concert performer/composer is then undertaken. Finally, I analyse the interview data, draw out and discuss emergent themes and suggest further lines of research.</p>

<title>Background and research context</title>
<sec id="section3-0305735610388898">
<title>Definitions of timbre</title>
<p>For timbre research to be meaningful, the inherent problem of absence of a timbre language must be addressed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735610388898">Kanno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0305735610388898">Wessel, 1979</xref>). Words such as ‘tone’ and ‘timbre’ are non-specific, leading to a variety of interpretations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610388898">Howard &amp; Angus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735610388898">Lerdahl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735610388898">McAdams &amp; Giordano, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, formal definitions do exist. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0305735610388898">McAdams, Vieillard, Houix and Reynolds describe timbre as ‘the attribute of auditory sensation that distinguishes two sounds that are otherwise equal in terms of pitch, duration and loudness, and that are presented under similar conditions’ (2004</xref>, p. 190). This is a generally accepted scientific definition. However, they also admit that this is a ‘non definition’ in that it cannot represent the artistic properties and expressive potential of timbre. Although differences in basic sound between instruments of similar register and volume range can be distinguished and described in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610388898">Levitin, 2006/2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735610388898">Marozeau, de Cheveigné, McAdams &amp; Winsberg, 2003</xref>), these definitions do not specifically recognize ongoing expressive, performer-generated changes of sound within the basic spectral parameters of each instrument.</p>
<p>Timbre can also be regarded as synonymous with ‘tone colour’ or ‘tone quality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0305735610388898">Wessel, 1979</xref>), yet these terms are equally vague and the latter could actually be perceived in judgemental rather than objective terms. Menon et al. include the words ‘tonal color and <italic>texture</italic>’ (my italics) when defining timbre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735610388898">2002</xref>, p. 1742), which together with the concept of ‘acoustic richness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0305735610388898">Sacks, 2007</xref>, p. 107) begins to breathe life into description of timbre in a musical context. Seashore used the term ‘sonance’ for the ‘successive changes and fusions that take place within a tone from moment to moment’ and recommended that this should be the accepted understanding of the term in a musical context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0305735610388898">1938/1967</xref>, p. 103). This might be described as the ‘evolution’ of timbre (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610388898">Patel, 2008</xref>) and it is this dynamic interpretation of tone quality within performance that forms the backdrop for the current study.</p>

<title>Why is the performer’s perspective under-researched?</title>
<p>Timbre is undoubtedly fundamental to other co-existing performance variables, but there may be a number of reasons why it remains the least researched and arguably still the least understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610388898">Hadja et al., 1997/2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735610388898">McAdams, Winsberg, Donnadieu, Soete, &amp; Krimphoff, 1995</xref>). First, it is the hardest parameter to measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0305735610388898">Risset &amp; Wessel, 1982/1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0305735610388898">Scherer &amp; Zentner, 2001</xref>) and has been aptly summarized by McAdams as ‘encompassing a complex set of auditory attributes as well as a plethora of auditory and musical issues’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610388898">1999</xref>, p. 85). Second, the technical means by which timbre is created can be difficult to observe as well as to measure. Its affective potential may then be underestimated, including the degree to which it might be integral to expressive body movement (as recognized by Davidson, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735610388898">1994</xref>). Third, timbre can only be notated in a very general sense, using instrumental performance directions and/or descriptive metaphor. This, of course, implies that performers have considerable freedom (despite performance practice conventions), but it also hinders empirical research. Equally (if not more) significant is the variability in perceptual context due to relational judgements. A further complication is that expressive use of timbre is an aspect of performance that is particularly individual and ephemeral. Performers use apparently intuitive, often extremely subtle timbral variation to convey a multiplicity of musical messages, both structural and emotional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610388898">Earis &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735610388898">Lindström, Juslin, Bresin, &amp; Williamon, 2003</xref>). It is therefore pertinent to the current study to consider why the timbral landscape should be such an indispensable part of communication in performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0305735610388898">
<title>The significance of timbre in performance</title>
<p>The fact that timbral differences are more easily distinguished than pitch differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735610388898">Huron, 2001</xref>) lends credence to McAdams’s argument that the significance of timbre to the composer stems from its role as a form-bearing dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735610388898">1989</xref>). As such, it should also be central to interpretative decision-making and projection in performance. Performers’ tonal intentions and the necessary management of techniques become increasingly sophisticated over time – but why should this be? A strong motivational factor is a desire, or even <italic>need</italic>, to find ways to express music, to express oneself through music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735610388898">Persson, 2001</xref>) and to establish a strong musical identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0305735610388898">MacDonald, Hargreaves &amp; Miell, 2002</xref>). An advanced performer will have developed sufficient technical command to be able to draw on a wide range of tone colours, evolving from a continuum of large and small-scale physical movements that embody Seashore’s concept of ‘sonance’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735610388898">Howard &amp; Angus, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Expert performers appear to perceive timbre through the creation of mental images (conscious internal representations) that inform and guide technical decision-making as an interpretation develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610388898">Holmes, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610388898">Bailes (2007)</xref> demonstrates this ability in a study where listeners participate in timbre-based discrimination tasks, and it is therefore not surprising that imagery and timbre perception appear to produce similar cognitive representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735610388898">Halpern, Zatorre, Bouffard &amp; Johnson, 2004</xref>). Holmes identified this phenomenon in elite performers, who, before playing, image (either physically or mentally) the character of sound that they wish to produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610388898">2005</xref>). It is clear that, as a vehicle for communicating structural concepts and interpretative imagination, timbre is vital. Choices will be shaped to a greater or lesser extent by perception of musical and cultural context, but it is in accordance with Bailes’s findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735610388898">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735610388898">2007</xref>) that the physical production of tone is guided by imagery, <italic>followed by</italic> degrees of perception. This also accords with Holmes’s findings that the desire and ability to create a particular sound at any one moment is at the heart of expert performance.</p>
<p>While psychologists continue to posit the possibilities of unravelling the elements of expression so that a working paradigm can be found (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735610388898">Juslin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0305735610388898">Woody, 2002</xref>), philosophers generally focus on the more mystical and ineffable qualities of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0305735610388898">Scruton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0305735610388898">Zangwill, 2009</xref>). They also recognize the power within some individuals to induce profound emotional affect in themselves and others through the medium of music performance. In this context, the elusive but central nature of timbre has been identified by Scruton, who evokes both the concept of ‘sonance’ and the tonal innovations of Schönberg (e.g. ‘Farben’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0305735610388898">Schönberg, 1909/1922</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305735610388898">1</xref></sup> by suggesting that tone is a product of the imagination and we must distinguish between tone and sound – ‘When we hear music, we do not hear sound only; we hear something in sound, something which moves with a force of its own’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0305735610388898">1997</xref>, pp. 19–20). At elite levels all aspects of tone are carefully considered and nurtured and if we can understand how the performer perceives tone moving with ‘a force of its own’, it may help to counter the inadequacy of language as a vehicle for meaningful discussion.</p>
<p>Performers commonly use metaphor to convey an image of a particular quality of tone (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735610388898">Budd, 1985/1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735610388898">Kanno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0305735610388898">Zangwill, 2007</xref>), but Scruton suggests that perception through metaphor is itself dependent upon both imagination and cultural context:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The musical experience … is not merely perceptual. It is founded in metaphor, arising when unreal movement is heard in imaginary space. Such an experience occurs only within a musical culture, in which traditions of performance and listening shape our expectation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0305735610388898">1997</xref>, p. 239).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This may be true, but whatever the cultural influences, the distinctive sound produced by elite performers is embedded within their musical personalities and is integral to their ability to communicate through music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström Wik, 2003</xref>). There is a need to find means of expressing one’s own ‘voice’ and indeed a particular quality of tone is commonly associated with a particular performer, irrespective of idiomatic foundations of style (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735610388898">Benadon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735610388898">Johnson, 2002</xref>). The instrument becomes an extension of the self and because no two acoustic instruments have the same basic sound quality, choice of instrument and other materials associated with sound production is critical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0305735610388898">2</xref></sup> Although identity is not a static state and the quest for a musical voice cannot be a finite process, even relatively recent research tends to centre on timbre as an acoustic phenomenon (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735610388898">Caclin, McAdams, Smith &amp; Giard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0305735610388898">Tsang, 2002</xref>), rather than on its role in expressing the musical identity and imagination of the performer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0305735610388898">
<title>Perception and structure</title>
<p>There is evidence that timbre can be perceived independently from other elements of sound such as pitch, and that it can also represent structural features of music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735610388898">Huron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0305735610388898">Marozeau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0305735610388898">Pressnitzer et al., 2000</xref>). This suggests that timbre perception is at least as relevant as perception of other performance parameters. Progress has been made in the investigation of perceptual organization and in the interpretation of sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735610388898">Krumhansl, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735610388898">Krumhansl &amp; Iverson, 1992</xref>). In addition to this, there is strong evidence to suggest that timbre has an important role in music perception. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0305735610388898">Warrier &amp; Zatorre (2002)</xref> have demonstrated that pitch perception is influenced by spectral variation of timbre, but further research is needed to show how – or indeed, if – perception during performing (active) might differ in attributes from perception during listening (passive). Lack of timbral language inhibits the transfer of scientific theory to the realms of live acoustic performance, but it has been shown that, based on the use of descriptive metaphor, listeners tend to find common ground in objective interpretation of the effects of different timbres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0305735610388898">McAdams, Beauchamp &amp; Meneguzzi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0305735610388898">Sloboda, 1991</xref>). When giving an objective response to the same musical stimulus they can be in broad agreement regarding timing and degree of affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610388898">Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2003</xref>). However, commonly accepted metaphors for timbre still seem far removed from the complex emotional and structural messages with which elite performers work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0305735610388898">Waterman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Listeners’ subjective reactions to music can be identified through measurement of physiological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0305735610388898">Steinbeis, Koelsch, &amp; Sloboda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0305735610388898">Thaut, 2009</xref>). This shows greater heterogeneity, ‘contingent upon a listener’s complex personal interpretation system’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0305735610388898">Thaut, 2009</xref>, p. 555) than if an objective (verbal) response is sought. Assuming that performers have subjective and idiosyncratic involvement, measurement of their physiological responses during performance might support a self-reporting methodology. To what extent do performers <italic>consciously</italic> consider timbre as significant in inducing affect and integral to other performance dimensions? Do performers, like listeners, consciously perceive timbre as a framework for music analysis, adopting an appropriate range of schemata when processing tone (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0305735610388898">Tsang, 2002</xref>)?</p>
<p>Tsang showed how analysis, perception and structure cannot be separated, but it is worth considering structure to some extent independently, because across a number of related disciplines, timbre is acknowledged as significant in defining and conveying musical structure. This is not surprising, as any musical sound has a timbral quality, but despite recognition, scientific evidence for this aspect of performance is still limited. We therefore draw on psychoacoustic studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610388898">McAdams, 1999</xref>) to show how performers might form representations of structure through timbre and on neuroscience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0305735610388898">Menon et al., 2002</xref>) to identify the significance of timbral processing in this respect. As an example of the former (and possibly because it is multidimensional) timbre has great potential to contribute to the ‘movement between tension and relaxation’ that characterizes western musical structure and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0305735610388898">McAdams &amp; Giordano, 2008</xref>, p. 77). Pressnitzer et al., investigating roughness as a dimension of timbre, were able to show that tension and release could be perceived through orchestral timbral differences alone, in the absence of tonal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0305735610388898">2000</xref>). Of further interest to the performer is that temporal as well as spectral attributes of timbre appear to feature strongly in auditory processing – in practical terms this means features such as attack time (Iverson, 1995, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0305735610388898">McAdams, 1999</xref>) and brightness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0305735610388898">McAdams, 1989</xref>). This is highly significant in making technical choices such as choosing fingerings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610388898">Holmes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0305735610388898">Woody, 2002</xref>) or indeed any other means of controlling sound.</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that timbre also has considerable significance in the creation and violation of expectation (anticipation of structural features that are repeated and therefore expected), which is a principal source of emotive power in music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735610388898">Meyer, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0305735610388898">Warrier &amp; Zatorre, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0305735610388898">
<title>Timbre and emotion</title>
<p>Induction of emotion and emotional response to music have more often been studied in relation to other performance parameters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735610388898">Clarke, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735610388898">Juslin, Friberg &amp; Bresin, 2001–02</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0305735610388898">Steinbeis et al., 2006</xref>) and the potential effects of microchanges in timbre have been underestimated. Yet listeners have identified timbre as significant in inducing emotional affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0305735610388898">Padova et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests that timbre has distinct emotional valence. Listeners form similar objective judgements when performers play according to a directed emotion or mood, but this has an artificial aspect. It does not recognize the nature or relevance of the performer’s subjective experiences prior to, during or after a performance, or indeed the degree to which these might, through interpretative choices, impact upon emotional communication. Although measurement of physiological responses to musical stimuli can suggest altered emotional states, induced emotional response is still far harder to measure or describe than perceived emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite forming the basis of little research into emotion in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson &amp; Lindström, 2001</xref>), timbre is clearly relevant for composers, who recognize its demonstrable power to induce affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610388898">Boulez, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0305735610388898">Lerdahl, 1987</xref>). By focusing on timbre, I hope to discover something of the unique emotional landscape of the performer – to what extent his/her perception of emotional content, and indeed his/her awareness of induced emotion within him/herself, is contingent upon the music, or is derived from other sources. I am not aware of existing studies that attempt to illustrate the existence of, or balance between, perceived and induced emotion within the performer.</p>

<title>The study</title>
<sec id="section9-0305735610388898">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>There are distinct methodological concerns associated with researching artistic use of timbre, partly due to vague terminology and the multidimensional nature of timbre, both of which complicate study of timbre perception. Sounds can be perceived in very different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>) – at times startlingly different, as can be seen from the wide-ranging case studies narrated by the neurologist Oliver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0305735610388898">Sacks (2007)</xref>. Personal characteristics and experiences also ensure that subjective responses vary in nature and degree of affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0305735610388898">Thaut, 2009</xref>) and it is reasonable to suppose that this will be as true for the performer as for the listener.</p>
<p>Little research has resulted from collaboration between scientists (psychologists, psychoacousticians and neuroscientists) and elite concert performers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0305735610388898">Windsor, 2009</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0305735610388898">Levitin &amp; Cuddy, 2004</xref>). When writing about timbre in composition, Boulez identified a fundamental dichotomy between the two groups’ research interests and objectives, suggesting that quantitative research sits unhappily with the more intuitive, artistic interests of the performer/composer who is ‘not interested in measurement or objective analysis. What matters to them is the function of timbre, … and even more so the affectivity created by the perception of timbre in the context of the work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735610388898">1987</xref>, p. 162). It is a hindrance to empirical research that the higher order refinements of technique that distinguish elite performance are not usually obvious and their true significance can be overlooked by the non-expert. Furthermore, generative processes leading to choices and production of timbre are not freely discussed, as non-verbal communication is generally more effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610388898">Davidson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735610388898">Davidson &amp; Good, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study differs from research hitherto undertaken in the field of musical timbre in that it is designed to investigate the role and function of the performer and the composer. Much research has been concerned with measurement and modelling (synthesizing) of acoustic properties (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735610388898">Juslin et al., 2001-02</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0305735610388898">Välimäki, Pakarinen, Erkut &amp; Karjalainen, 2006</xref>) and the perceptual qualities and effects of timbre (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735610388898">Gabrielsson &amp; Juslin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0305735610388898">Tsang, 2002</xref>) but only a few have included live, performer-generated timbres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610388898">Earis &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610388898">Johnson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing the division of purpose between quantitative and qualitative research identified by Boulez, the aim of the current study is to allow further understanding of the artistic and aesthetic function of timbre, from the subjective perspective of the performer. The choice of a qualitative methodology is also supported by some doubt in the scientific community as to whether true objectivity, as sought through quantitative methods, is actually achievable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735610388898">Patton, 2002</xref>). A further reason is that timbre control is multifaceted and continually evolving, making it challenging to obtain meaningful measurement data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0305735610388898">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The current study is investigative rather than comparative. Insight into personal representations of emotional and structural communication and other aspects of performance preparation and experience are central to its aims. From critical examination of other research methodologies it appeared that, for a phenomenological study of this nature, the most information-rich data would come from a performer’s own description of working practices (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610388898">Chaffin &amp; Imreh, 2001</xref>) – that is, ‘phenomenological’ as ‘concerned with an individual’s personal perception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0305735610388898">Smith, Jarman &amp; Osborn, 1999</xref>, p. 218). A semi-structured conversation-style interview was chosen to allow optimum flexibility and depth of response. The interview was supported by an interview guide that included topics key to the aims of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0305735610388898">Patton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0305735610388898">Robson, 1993/2002</xref>). Since the study explores areas of performance preparation that are not generally articulated, a purposeful sample of one (<italic>N</italic> = 1) highly meta-cognitive elite performer was considered appropriate. It has been demonstrated that performers of the highest level are most likely to have sufficient confidence to be able to focus on the music (particularly emotional and musicological events) rather than being distracted by issues relating to themselves and perceived deficiencies in their own playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0305735610388898">Waterman, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In view of the potential difficulties of exploring some of the more aesthetic, intangible aspects of expression in performance, analysis is facilitated by reference to Patrik Juslin’s functional five-stage model of expression in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735610388898">2005</xref>) as a paradigm for study of one specific performance parameter. Based on prior definitions of communication in performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735610388898">Johnson-Laird, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735610388898">Kendall &amp; Carterette, 1990</xref>), Juslin asserts that musical communication is effected through a chain of events: the composer’s expressive intention–the performer’s expressive intention–the acoustic performance parameters–the listener’s perception–the listener’s affective response. All are necessary elements in performance, but in line with the aims of this article I focus principally on the performer’s expressive intention and the acoustic parameters, with some additional reference to the composer’s expressive intention.</p>

<sec id="section10-0305735610388898">
<title>Refinement of the term ‘elite performer’</title>
<p>As with the definition of ‘timbre’, it is essential for full understanding of results and implications that the term ‘elite performer’ be differentiated from the term ‘expert performer’, which has been widely used in the field of music psychology to describe a player with a good degree of competence. ‘Expert performer’ can range from advanced students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735610388898">Lindström, et al., 2003</xref>) to a world-class concert pianist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735610388898">Chaffin &amp; Imreh, 2001</xref>), so the term is clearly not precise enough to prevent misinterpretation. Since the performer selected for the current study falls into the world-class concert performer category, I draw on the definition given by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735610388898">Ericsson and Charness (1994)</xref>, who describe such experts as ‘exceptional’ or ‘top-level’. Although this is in the context of discussion on the existence of innate talent, the terms are in accord with the sophisticated conceptual approach, experience, motivation and dedication to musical communication that characterizes this level of performer as opposed to other ‘experts’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0305735610388898">
<title>The participant</title>
<p>The participant is internationally recognized as someone who evinces the highest degree of technical ability and musicality and is also able to articulate insight and working processes in both verbal and written form. He is an experienced solo performer and professor of classical guitar at the Royal College of Music, London. In an attempt to cast further light on the interface between composer and interpreter in respect of communication through timbre, the participant is also a composer whose works are both popular and notable for their original and imaginative use of sound. His well-documented success in all three fields of professional activity was considered key to establishing an appropriate degree of authority for the interview data. Guitar was chosen for reasons of clarity. First, timbre variation is achieved by a number of distinct techniques that, although functioning concurrently, can be clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0305735610388898">Traube &amp; D’Alessandro, 2005</xref>). Second, both hands are in contact with the instrument, giving the performer direct control over the sound source (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610388898">Evens, 2005</xref>). Third, vibrato is not central to tone production and the complication of an extra, primarily pitch-based dimension is thereby avoided. Full confidentiality was offered, but declined, since the participant did not consider the material in any way sensitive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0305735610388898">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The focus of the study and the specific areas under investigation were explained immediately prior to the interview. In order to define likely topic areas, an interview guide was prepared but in practice the discussion took a number of interesting turns that prompted considerable deviation. In most cases deviations concerned timbre (or other aspects of performance integral to timbre) and have therefore been included in the analysis. Occasional probes were used, specifically to allow clarification, elicit further information, and integrate responses across different topic areas (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0305735610388898">Appendix</xref>). The conversation lasted for 45 minutes, was recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Participant and interviewer met again after an interval of one week, during which both had had time to reflect on the previous conversation and further elaboration of a few specific points then ensued. The second conversation lasted for 20 minutes and was also recorded and transcribed.</p>
<p>Data from the interview were analysed and interpreted using the technique of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0305735610388898">Willig, 2001/2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0305735610388898">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Emergent themes were interpreted in the light of both literature reviewed and observations made in the earlier part of this paper. This enabled identification of higher order themes, which were then categorized (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305735610388898">Figure 1</xref>), although considerable integration within the interview data necessitated some cross-referencing between categories as the analysis progressed. As IPA will always be an <italic>interpretation</italic> of experiences, analysis was carried out in accordance with the original principles of grounded theory, which is designed to allow for the generation of theory in a defined area. The potential for deductive analysis was recognized, but by no means expected, mainly due to the absence of appropriate language for timbre (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735610388898">Charmaz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0305735610388898">Willig, 2001/2008</xref>). A considerable degree of subjectivity was acknowledged in that although not a guitarist, the researcher is an expert performer (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735610388898">Finlay, 2009</xref>). This was considered an advantage in that it enabled inductive analysis on a basis of reasonable understanding of both technical and artistic context.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify key motivations and working methods in employment of timbre in elite performance. The data give evidence of the degree of significance attached to timbre, prime motivations in both performance and composition, and the relationship of timbre with musical structure and other performance parameters. Less predictable insights also emerged, prompting some discussion in the context of a range of related disciplines. All categories are illuminated by exemplar quotations, in which italics indicate emphasis by the subject. Underlining is to draw attention to points of particular note.</p>
<sec id="section14-0305735610388898">
<title>The integral role of timbre in performance</title>
<p>The results agree in general with empirical and theoretical research reviewed earlier. However, some emergent themes have not yet been explored to any extent. It was expected that timbre would be employed by the participant to convey musical structure, but of particular interest was the <italic>degree</italic> to which consideration and management of appropriate techniques was given to represent and communicate this aspect of performance – essentially, the participant regards <italic>the music itself</italic> as his main priority. He repeatedly referred to timbre in performance as ‘tone colour’ and from a number of different aspects, made it clear how it is integral to developing an interpretation. Early in the interview he emphasized that timbre is fundamental in guitar playing, but is also inseparable from other performance parameters:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>somebody navigating on a ship can change the course by a couple of degrees, which ultimately results in them being 50 miles further up the coast – sometimes colour changes are a similar sort of thing – it can be a tiny (change), but can make an enormous difference.</p>
<p>… there are in some ways what I call dimensions to it – strands – like a rope that entwines together.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In several responses he elaborated by making it clear that despite its effectiveness, timbre is not usually the first performance variable to be considered:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>one of the things I stress is that if I’m starting off I can get good dynamics and a nice shape before I add colour … the colour in a sense then adds a new dimension and hopefully makes it special rather than ordinary.</p>
<p>I might experiment with the tone quality of a chord or a line … then colours start to emerge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, rather than implying that timbre is secondary, these statements suggest that the dimension of tone colour evolves as a product of the imagination. Reflecting the more philosophical interpretations suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0305735610388898">Scruton (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735610388898">Hanslick (1854/1891)</xref>, and others, the participant continued:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of it’s knitted into the dynamic markings – if something’s written dolce for example I would automatically be thinking of a certain kind of colour in the left hand and something in the right hand – maybe a certain territory that certain dynamic markings occupy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Cultural traditions inform perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735610388898">Huron, 2006</xref>) and if this is taken to include expectations within different musical styles, it can be seen how the structural contribution of timbre varies according to style:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>tonal contrasts (in Bach) would feature a much smaller percentage than if I was playing something like the Britten <italic>Nocturnal</italic>, where tonal contrasts are a much more integral part of the structure and the idea behind the composition.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0305735610388898">
<title>Timbre, speech and language</title>
<p>In the same context (but specifically about communicating effectively through timbre) the participant made numerous analogies with communication through speech and language:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>just like speech – you know, the way it’s communicated, or an actor – tiny little gestures can suddenly make the performance seem great and you can’t quite put your finger on what it is when you see somebody who’s really brilliant at what they do … they might be saying the same words and doing the same kind of inflection, but there’s just that extra – you know – microscopically different perception or ingredient that elevates it to something different.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and directly associating verbal language and music:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>it’s very grammatical, opening sentence and then next sentence reflecting on that – there’s a sort of left right nature to it. In the same way you might do a slightly different inflection with your voice if you were repeating something, or stressing something, then sometimes the colour changes kind of communicate it like that. Colour change becomes a substitute for inflection perhaps.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a logical connection, given increasing evidence of significant similarities in cognitive organization of language and music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0305735610388898">Patel, 2008</xref>), their evolutionary parallels and possible integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735610388898">Brown, Merker, &amp; Wallin, 2000</xref>). To understand the similar communicative functions of music and language is by no means unique, but it illustrates the metaphor of <italic>speaking</italic> to <italic>people</italic> in the same way as a great actor or orator, only conveying a score rather than a text. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0305735610388898">Traube and Depalle (2004)</xref> suggest that guitarists seem particularly sensitive to correlations between phonetics and vocal tones, but this may or may not apply to other instrumentalists.</p>
<p>Further analogies to verbal communication were made in the use of the term gesture, in this case as a metaphor to highlight and separate musical ideas:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>you get two ideas into peoples’ minds and you separate them spatially … that’s often what the hand gesture does.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0305735610388898">
<title>Timbre and gesture</title>
<p>Much has been written about the role of gesture in performance (for a recent overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735610388898">Davidson, 2009</xref>). However, this was more often related to emotional rather than structural communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0305735610388898">4</xref></sup> Davidson reasonably acknowledges that some instrumentalists’ gestures might be bodily representations of structural boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610388898">2005</xref>), but does not suggest that they might also embody a representation of the sound itself. Frith, however, does suggest that musicians’ bodies embody their art and that the physical creation of music is a representation of the score on another level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735610388898">1996</xref>). This phenomenon is amply illustrated in the following responses:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>on guitar – I have a funny term … musical bonsai – it’s all very small, but because of the gesture and where you play, you map what people hear visually, in the same way a conductor might point to the brass or to the strings or to the percussion – the right hand does that as well, so if I’m creating a warm sound I maybe choose to move towards the fingerboard, or turn my hand in that direction … To the listeners looking on from the front, they’re kind of <italic>seeing</italic> the sound, just in a slightly different place</p>
<p>Feeling sound as gestures – when you do a warm sound, it’s not dissimilar to – like I’ve said to my students – stroking a cat, or picking something up gently … it’s a hard thing to describe, but with a thinner sound – if I’m trying to create a <italic>thin</italic> tone, there’s a certain gesture that’s a little bit more claw like – it’s almost like the upper spectrum – the frequency has a gesture that I associate with it …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These vivid descriptions indicate a clear sequence of multi-sensory perceptual events, from the performer’s apparently seamless connection between the artistic concept and playing technique (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735610388898">Holmes, 2005</xref>) to listener affect. It could be that direct contact with the sound source and the intimacy of the playing position make gestural characterization of timbre particularly relevant on the guitar, but it is also worth briefly examining psychological dimensions of timbre perception in evidence here. First, it is reasonable to assume that the visual impact of a continuum of gestures in relation to the sound influences subjective perception of timbre (Handel, 1995, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735610388898">Hadja et al., 1997/2002</xref>), as does the varying location of the sound-source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>). Second, the relationship between instrumental gesture (the playing technique) and perceptual timbre space has been explored: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0305735610388898">Traube and Depalle (2004)</xref> were able to demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the gesture and the sound that relates to the plucking position along the length of the string. Furthermore, Earis and Holmes showed that the fundamental frequency energy is also affected by the degree of nail or flesh used in right hand articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735610388898">2007</xref>). The angle of the hand and therefore also the associated gestures vary accordingly,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0305735610388898">5</xref></sup> which means that more nail in the attack will turn the hand round into a position that is indeed ‘more claw like’. Conversely, to pluck the strings with flesh rather than nail, the hand will be in a more open position and the gesture correspondingly more gentle:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>ultimately to me the nails are a bit like – erm – it sounds a bit odd, but a bit like frequency filters. If you play to the side (of the finger) you tend to produce a warmer, fatter sound which lifts the fundamentals of the note, where if you play with a thin sound, in a certain kind of way, you trigger higher frequencies – brighter, crisper, harsher, brittler sounds, so in that sense the gesture is almost like a dial – you literally just turn your hand or change in a particular way that moves you round that spectrum – just literally like turning a dial on a stereo … the finesse is sometimes miniscule to produce changes in colour – it’s to do with nail shape and tiny changes of elevation and angle and things … I’m tending to think of a colour in terms of its frequencies …</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section17-0305735610388898">
<title>Further perspectives on metaphor</title>
<p>Use of metaphor shows gesture and technique in playing to be in some respects analogous to speech and language. Both psychologists and philosophers accept that metaphor is necessary when there is an absence of ‘timbre language’. This participant used metaphor freely to illustrate specific movements, sounds or character within the music, rather than moods or emotions perceived by the audience, as suggested by previous research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0305735610388898">Panksepp, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0305735610388898">Sloboda, 1991</xref>),</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>a timbre [e.g. ponticello<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0305735610388898">6</xref></sup>] can be humorous and witty in one environment – and then in another it might suggest violence or nastiness or sarcasm – so in a sense I suppose there may be a very oblique emotional language that goes with a particular tone.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact, he made several references to light and shade (or dark) as opposed to actual colours, and clearly forms a unified image of both sound and light spectra, thereby apparently translating metaphor into cross-modal representations of sensory dimensions. This phenomenon was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0305735610388898">Marks (1975)</xref> in terms of a perceptual correlation between brightness (density) of both sound and light and is perhaps reminiscent of the well-documented sound/colour synaesthesia experienced by a number of musicians, notably Messiaen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735610388898">Bernard, 1986</xref>). Messiaen also identified an analogy between sound resonance (frequency) and colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0305735610388898">Messiaen, 1986</xref>). The above quotations illustrate Marks’s argument that ‘synaesthesia emerges from deep psychological similarities inherent in perceptual experience itself, similarities that provide some of the raw materials for linguistic extensions of meaning through poetic metaphor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0305735610388898">1990</xref>, p. 28). The term ‘synchresis’ has been coined to describe the involuntary mental fusion of acoustic and visual stimuli in the context of electroacoustic sound (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735610388898">Rudy, 2007</xref>), but here, it also seems appropriate in the acoustic sound world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0305735610388898">
<title>Timbre and affect</title>
<p>Also significant is the fact that, although speaking in fluent and vivid terms about how he communicates <italic>music</italic> to an audience, the participant found it uncharacteristically difficult (and apparently irrelevant) to articulate specific emotions in relation to the actual nature of audience affect, consistently implying that his aim is always to find ways of enabling understanding of the music itself.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s just something you <italic>feel</italic> in the end – that you want to say in the music – you can’t articulate it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He also made it clear that the nature and degree of individual listener affect is accepted as infinitely variable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0305735610388898">Thaut, 2009</xref>) and that this tends to be a positive aspect of performance overall. He sees the <italic>intensity</italic> of affect as the main determinant of effectiveness of a performance, in other words, the degree of real engagement he has succeeded in generating – hence the comment that extremes of timbral colour are the most effective:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>sometimes it’s more at the extreme ends of the colour spectrum … very, very thin sound might be sort of shocking … or an incredibly round sound … with lots of vibrato – sometimes it’s an incredibly beautiful or an incredibly shocking sound that has the most emotional kick.</p>
<p>… on some days inevitably you feel more emotionally engaged in what you’re doing than others – some days it’s a bit more of a day at the office but other days it’s great – it’s really inspiring when everything’s going well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is not entirely consistent with the few studies that have sought to establish the nature and degree of the performer’s own feelings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0305735610388898">Lindström et al., 2003</xref>; Minassian et al., 2003, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2009</xref>), where a tendency to try and convey specific emotions was identified in a significant number of performers. However, these studies were conducted among sub-elite performers and it is possible that at the highest levels of expertise, the focus is more on the music itself (a feature that was also identified by some subjects in the aforementioned studies). The participant’s own emotional engagement with music is something he can’t explain, since it appears to be an intrinsic part of him as a person and always has been. His principal motivation in respect of timbre is connected with his drive to represent all aspects of music as he himself experiences it, and his own emotional responses in performance appear to relate to whether he achieves his own intrinsically driven musical goals:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>there’s a certain kind of sound you want to produce and then – ‘marking’ yourself in terms of how well you produced it – if you’re thinking I want to produce a really lush colour on this note and then you play it, part of you thinks yes I got quite close, or yes I got it exactly, or no I got nowhere near it.</p>
<p>… you get a buzz out of a particularly nice acoustic …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A number of studies have shown that performers form self-monitoring representations during performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735610388898">Davidson, 2005</xref>), but in this statement, a positive affective state also evokes the element of hedonism in performance identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0305735610388898">Persson (2001)</xref>. The participant expressed feelings of pleasure associated with his own accomplishment in respect of tone production (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735610388898">Kubovy, 1999</xref>). This response may also be linked to the dopamine reward system, shown to be related to emotional self-satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0305735610388898">Levitin, 2006/2008</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0305735610388898">Salimpoor, Benovoy, Longo, Cooperstock, &amp; Zatorre (2009)</xref> have demonstrated that pleasure associated with listening to music can itself arise from induced increases in emotional arousal, which they suggest can be called ‘musical emotions’. This term may equally describe the apparently abstract, but intense emotional engagement felt by performers.</p>
<p>When asked what makes others’ performances inspiring for him, the participant immediately mentioned commitment, and emphasized that, as in other art forms, a rare degree of skill is also a significant element:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>rarity of skill – to me that’s always been an element of great art … it’s like when you’re at a great performance, everybody somehow knows that they might be at something special that they might not see again for the next five years, ten years – or ever – or feel in a similar kind of way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, witnessing extraordinary skill demonstrated in playing a musical instrument has been identified as a source of pleasure in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735610388898">Kubovy, 1999</xref>), but a dynamic relationship between this aspect of performance and the outcome of physiological arousal has not yet been established.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0305735610388898">
<title>Timbre and artistic purpose</title>
<p>Possibly the most interesting and in some ways surprising result was the emphatic and clear distinction made by the participant between the use of timbre when learning and performing others’ works, and when composing. Numerous composers of the last hundred years or so would identify with the participant’s unequivocal statement, ‘I’m interested in sound for its own sake’. He continued:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I would just play a chord on the piano and find that interesting to listen to, even if it’s not placed in a musical environment – sometimes I experiment with sounds, extended techniques and things like that produce a certain kind of timbre and then I’ll think ‘ah yes, I can do this with them’, rather than searching for a sound in my head and then the other way round.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is entirely supportable if it is accepted that timbre can form the basis of musical structure (as in Schönberg’s ‘Farben’), or at least function as the principal form-bearing dimension (as in Messiaen’s <italic>Chronochromie</italic> (1960)) – as it can do in music of other cultures. It has been shown how timbre can induce emotional affect, and related to musical expectation, can be fundamental to its emotive power (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0305735610388898">Meyer, 1956</xref>). The following statement demonstrates a clear artistic purpose in this respect:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>the musical objective in a particular piece is sometimes to produce a sound that’s unexpected or maybe even shocking or surprising – that’s the nature of what I’m sometimes trying to do.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735610388898">Rudy (2007)</xref> argues that recorded media music is unique in that it can represent recognized objects or events in an ambiguous context; that this challenges listeners’ perceptions is illustrated by reference to Schaeffer’s <italic>Étude aux Chemins de Fer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0305735610388898">1948</xref>), an early example of <italic>musique concrète</italic>, based on train sounds. It would seem that the same premise might also apply to contemporary live instrumental music in that the participants’ own compositions for guitar generally tend towards the representational rather than the abstract, drawing on an eclectic range of sources including the rich traditions of the instrument, but also popular contemporary influences and extended techniques. This reflects a recognized perceptual challenge in sonic representations of objects or events, being neither the thing they seem to be, nor the instrument as it is usually heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0305735610388898">Rudy, 2007</xref>). The participant deliberately creates such ambiguity in that although there is a clearly defined musical context in terms of the instrument, setting and sometimes the form, a dimension of ‘challenge’ is apparent in innovative use of familiar guitar sounds in a blurring of music and ‘sound effect’:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I like to get people to re-evaluate a sound – so things like string squeaks or extraneous noises you can twist round so that they become ‘normal’ sounds – people re-evaluate and think instead of a squeak, it sounds – like a bird, or an insect, or some other strange sound …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In fact, all these dimensions of timbre in contemporary composition are drawn together in an extract from the participant’s own programme notes, which makes an apt concluding quotation:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Junglescape’ is an attempt to convey a range of contemporary guitar techniques in a simple tonal world. The harmony is quite limited and static, drawing on the drone from folk music and incorporating modal elements. Technical complexity and harmonic simplicity combine to balance one another and an unconventional tuning takes the performer and listener into the relatively unfamiliar [on the guitar] key centres of Eβ and Bβ. The intention is to create many layers of sound in the listener’s mind and to change our perceptions of what a sound is. In fact for the first minute or so of the piece a listener should not even be able to tell what instrument is playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0305735610388898">Ryan, 2009</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ultimately, if timbre is as significant in structure and perception of contemporary music as this quotation and other composers suggest, its power as an expressive tool in more classical forms may be greater than is usually thought, particularly since timbral change can be easily heard, if not clearly defined.</p>

<title>General discussion</title>
<p>This study goes some way towards bridging the gap between scientific (psychoacoustic) study of timbre and the reality of timbre employed in live performance. Given the demonstrated significance of timbre and also the unexpected content of some interview responses, three areas, in particular, raise questions that are not adequately explained by existing research. These relate principally to the emotional and aesthetic roots of performance, both of which feature strongly in the participant’s relationship with timbre.</p>
<p>First, the participant’s intuitive engagement with music appears to account for his strong emotional responses – among the most interesting results were those relating to artistic and aesthetic motivations for specific timbres. His drive to communicate the music as he felt it should be represented revealed the strong internal motivations associated with successful performing artists. When musical goals are achieved, his emotional response clearly centres on feelings of satisfaction and occasionally elation, the intensity of which is generally dependent upon the perceived degree of task mastery – he consistently referred to employment of specific timbres as a key element in this process. His response is related to the musical outcome rather than the self, but this is not a simple equation in that (from this study) it appears that at elite level the musician <italic>is</italic> the self, which implies a high degree of personal involvement and investment in sound as a precursor of induced emotion (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735610388898">Evens, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, it was notable that the participant had difficulty speaking in any detail about timbre in relation to emotion as a dynamic constituent of the communication process, although he was very articulate about the timbral spectrum in practice. Its strength in terms of potential emotional affect in both the audience and himself was recognized and valued, showing that artistically driven manipulation of sound is clearly at the heart of expert performance. However, it is significant that although the participant used vivid metaphor to describe timbre, he clearly found it superfluous to try to identify specific moods or emotions that such sounds might induce. He generally regarded it as both inevitable and positive to the communication process that perception and nature of affect are subject to infinite individual variation. This is particularly illuminating, as only recently has the degree of potential variation in listener perception and affect been reliably demonstrated and accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735610388898">Juslin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, timbre exemplifies the participant’s numerous responses that related to the ineffable qualities of music, for which the natural line of reasoning seems to be more of aesthetics than a psychological interpretation, although both disciplines recognize likely cultural variables. Other than the few allusions to philosophical thought already mentioned, this line of argument is beyond the scope of this article, but in the interests of wider investigation of performer motivations, brief mention is merited. One particularly interesting example is the participant’s deep involvement and fascination with sound. While other composers corroborate this phenomenon, no satisfactory psychological, environmental or ecological explanation exists. Similarly, his drive to perfectly represent his own understanding of music is a prime motivating force. Both these observations, together with the participant’s reported satisfaction (sometimes elation) when such goals are achieved, seem to resonate with philosophical theories relating to the will and music as the ultimate expression of metaphysical realities (e.g., Schopenhauer, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735610388898">Bowie, 2007</xref>), at least as much as with psychological theories of hedonism and physiological reward systems. Since much philosophical and aesthetic literature addresses music as a whole, it would seem promising to take one demonstrably affective performance dimension (timbre) as a focus for further empirical research.</p>
<p>The sources of the participant’s engagement with sound are not clear, which begs further investigation of the origins and nature of musical ‘gift’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735610388898">Howe, Davidson &amp; Sloboda, 1998</xref> and ensuing literature) and of performers’ emotional responses to music. Study of timbre as a medium for expressive musical performance might then usefully inform pedagogical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0305735610388898">Johnson, 1999</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735610388898">Juslin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0305735610388898">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>). Control of a wide tonal range is technically demanding, but teachers could introduce awareness and development of timbre at an earlier stage of development than is usually practised. In a nominal hierarchy of priorities timbre is generally in the shadow of other performance parameters, but it could receive equal attention from the start, with techniques developing accordingly. Awareness of the potential interest of an enhanced sound world might then become firmly embedded at an early stage, developing motivation to explore this dimension further.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Through investigation of key motivations and working methods in elite performance this article demonstrates the potential significance and effectiveness of timbre in live music. The research has corroborated recently acknowledged (but little tested) aspects of emotional communication in music performance, specifically those relating to perception and induction of emotion as part of the performing experience. It has also given insight into concepts and working practices relating to the role of timbre in contemporary acoustic composition. The term timbre is clearly too simplistic to encapsulate the complex synthesis of acoustic properties that constitute instrumental sound – the artist’s ‘voice’ – in performance. It is central to artistic purpose, yet as a concept it is impossible to define or quantify in anything but a general sense (both artistically and in the practice of performance). Perhaps it is its dynamic, ever shifting nature that makes it such an essential vehicle for the imagination. Scientific study of timbre continues to provide further definition of its dimensions. However, there is no reason why more philosophical debate should not be directed towards expanding our understanding of the more mystical, ineffable dimensions of timbre, particularly its significance to the human condition – as is implied by the findings of this study. A starting point might be that timbre is rooted in human evolution through speech. As music is another form of communication, both need consideration in a wider frame, suggesting that research should be integrated across a range of disciplines. Further investigation along these lines might also help to establish more firmly why sound is such a meaningful element in performance. Cultural, musicological and philosophical contexts are clearly relevant, but might there also be a fundamental physical engagement with sound of which we are as yet unaware?</p>

<p>I must express my gratitude to the guitarist Gary Ryan, without whose insight, imagination and enthusiasm this research would not have been possible. I am also deeply grateful to Jonathan Clark, Noola Griffiths, Aaron Williamon and Christopher Holmes for their encouragement and help during the later stages of preparation, and to one anonymous reviewer for clear direction towards future research. Finally, as always, I am indebted to the staff of the Jerwood Library (Trinity College of Music) for their unfailing patience and co-operation in helping me to access many resources not normally available in a conservatoire.</p>

<title>Author biography</title>
<p><bold>Patricia Holmes</bold> is a Senior Lecturer at Trinity College of Music, UK, where she runs postgraduate courses in Applied Psychology of Performance and Instrumental and Vocal Pedagogy. She is also Trinity’s International Tutor. Research interests reflect her wide experience as a concert performer and centre on cross-disciplinary study of various aspects of elite concert performance. These include use of imagery (specifically in relation to the integration of emotion and technique), investigation of personal characteristics that contribute to the development of expertise in performance and the significance of timbre as a means of musical communication. She is currently part of an interdisciplinary team developing a health-screening programme for music students.</p>
