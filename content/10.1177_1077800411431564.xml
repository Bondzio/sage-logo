<abstract>
<p>This personal narrative highlights an intended ambivalent pregnancy, speaking to Sotirin’s call for radical specificity in mother-writing. The author began writing in a creative nonfiction workshop from memory fragments, diary entries, interviews, and scholarly research recognizing the story contained secrets, omissions, places she can’t remember, and places that are still in shadow that ethically need to stay closed. The use of creative nonfiction frames the story as a series of marginalized discourses from a relational dialectics perspective, in particular ambivalence (vs. certainty), bodily knowledge (vs. medicalization, vs. middle-class pregnancy), and flux (vs. cost–benefit ratios). The problem is that these marginalized discourses are not well represented in the totalizing picture of the <italic>pregnant lady</italic>. The story works as a performance text to transform totalizing oppressive discourse into a restructured aesthetic moment.</p>

<title>Cost: 18 Academic Articles</title>
<p>It is visible. The fashionable princess seam top strewn with red and yellow poppies doesn’t cover enough. I must talk about being knocked up every time I shake someone’s hand or lean in for a hug. “Babies cost an article a year.” Mitch tells me this when we sit down behind the book display table wedged into one end of the Qualitative Inquiry Conference registration room. His presses’ books just unpacked from boxes are stacked high enough to offer some privacy. The typical conference smell of freshly inked paper and stale coffee dispel some anxiety about whether my manuscript on poetry as research method, which he will publish, is good enough.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m pregnant.” I pat my stylish fetus mound with the expected gesture. His flat statement about the cost of what I named the Faulkner Fetus (to the horror or amusement of a few) pops my bravado. Others are just now noticing the 6.5-month lump, which I have carried to her first academic conference. I grip a fully caffeinated latte from the student union and wonder whether he thinks anything of my beverage choice? I did say no to an extra shot of espresso. And this is only cup two, the last of my self-imposed daily allotment.</p>
<p>This thought and all of the questions I have been asking myself about my pregnancy, and those I have been imagining others will ask me, annoy me. The truth is I have never fully wanted to be pregnant or have children. Not in that 100% way I thought pregnant women should feel. Would feel. In fact, I had attended a few childfree by choice support group meetings at my university the previous year. Though, the truth is also this: I felt like a childfree fraud sitting in a circle with the other attendees who enacted an absolute certainty. I confessed disinterest in children because of the environmental impact, gendered expectations, love for solitude and work. However, immediately after getting married I had spent four solo months teaching in Madrid, manufacturing a mental picture of a child. A child built with the most attractive features of Josh and myself, of course. “<italic>Just missing mi esposa</italic>,” I reasoned as I traveled with students and other professors while Josh remained in Syracuse to care for the house and our pet rat. I can’t remember if I ever told Josh about the only two childfree meetings I had attended before getting pregnant the following month. We did at least talk about children before we decided to get married. I told him, “I’m ambivalent.”</p>
<p>“I’m ambivalent, too,” he said.</p>
<p>I have abhorred every second, minute, and hour of being pregnant. My imaginings of the annoyances I would experience are being born out in precise detail like some kind of bas-relief. And now, in one of the arenas where I have learned to feel competent, my book publisher affirms this antipathy with an explicit cost analysis. “This kid will not cost me articles!” I think as I watch conference attendees browse the current and classic releases of everything research method. Then, as is usual lately, conflicting thoughts ruin my concentration. I ask myself whether I really do care or only feel I <italic>should</italic> care as I feel Baby Girl kick my ribcage with great enthusiasm. Secretly, I have been trying out the new moniker, Baby Girl, when she moves, which she does a lot when I am working or eating, or teaching. A consistent alarm clock, she wakes me up at 7 a.m. with her hiccups.</p>
<p>As Mitch and I talk, I will Baby Girl to allow my mind the front seat. <italic>Please, do not make my shirt move!</italic> I <italic>think</italic> to her, though evidently you are supposed to <italic>talk</italic> to your “unborn baby.” All of the patronizing pregnancy instruction manuals insist you narrate your daily routine to make a baby Einstein <italic>in-utero</italic>. I just can’t speak out loud to a fetus what I do all day: <italic>And now I am cracking an egg. Wow, I just wrote a 7-page syllabus in an hour. What kind of cookies do you want me to order us from the Cookie Jar?</italic> Even worse, months from now, well after the kid is born, I will find a wretched website proposing something called epigenetics,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077800411431564">1</xref></sup> the hatred of women hiding under the rippling banner of science:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We happen to live in the time where science has more than proven all the detriments of a pessimistic attitude. In another hundred years, every pregnant mom in the world will be consciously cultivating happy joyful thoughts specifically to foster optimal growth for their unborn children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Now we can label women <italic>crappy moms</italic> from conception. I embody this label as all of my good preggo oxytocin comes from Chocolate Crinkles; the Faulkner Fetus kicks especially well after some cocoa powdered sugar love.</p>

<title>Cost: My Synapses</title>
<p>“Faulkner, you should write about this.” My friend and coauthor, Pam, snorts as we talk on the phone, presumably about a research project, but really she is listening to my litany of pregnancy maladies, urging me to take field notes.</p>
<p>“Baby brain may be the worst at this point. I can’t remember the names of objects like <italic>that round ball</italic> that opens the door.”</p>
<p>I’m lounging in my office, during office hours, waiting for no-show students, wondering whether the few hours I spend in the building each week are suffocating the fetus. After a colleague complained loud enough about our sick building, the Ohio OSHA determined there was indeed mold proliferating in the ceilings and walls, but the colonization was not enough to kill us. This was supposed to be comforting?</p>
<p>I should be writing, doing research, working on my tenure portfolio, prepping, teaching—all of the activities I am compensated for under the title <italic>assistant professor</italic>. What I do with this time lately, though, is obsessively search online for ambivalent pregnant ladies and instant message friends about my bodily annoyances. I can’t focus on much except this. Mostly, I find blogs devoted to pregnancy complaints, and the “but it’s worth it” qualifier is usually explicitly stated. I have heartburn so bad it’s like a rotten lab experiment, <italic>but it will be worth</italic> it when she or he arrives.</p>
<p>“If I write about this, I will have to add more money to the kid’s therapy fund.” I say. Pam’s laughter makes me snort as I tally up all of the things I am doing wrong, will do wrong, could do wrong: <italic>daily cookies, bike riding, hand-me-downs, day care, refusal to allow the kid to wear pink, be a cheerleader</italic>.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Relational thinking <italic>requires</italic> us to step beyond simplistic (yet powerful) dichotomies to recognize a dialectic relationship, a “third space” wherein many possibilities exist for combinations of both/and. Each woman’s life represents a different story with a different combination of desires regarding her private/public lives, and this story evolves over time as different events and opportunities arise.

<title>Cost: Persona</title>
<p>It is the last two weeks of spring semester. My interpersonal communication students and I are talking about aging and friendship, whether this influences the longevity of high school and college relationships. I have a terrible teaching schedule—Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-night—that feels more than unlucky given my desire to be in bed by 5 p.m. Growing a fetus takes energy, more energy than I’ve ever needed. Forget recovering from the worst hangover or running a marathon energy. I wear fewer clothes to class, allowing the winter walk from my office to the classroom to slap me awake.</p>
<p>They ask me whether I keep in touch with anyone from high school. I tell them I live too many states and moves away. High school was so long ago I even forget to be nostalgic. “In fact, I’m not going to my 20-year high-school reunion in June.”</p>
<p>“Why?” more than one student asks.</p>
<p>I have just set myself up for the revelation I avoided all semester. I did not want to be the knocked-up professor, to talk about everything baby, to risk being seen as a walking womb, to have my every statement about relationships scrutinized. These were the reasons I did not want to tell my colleagues, either. Of course, that was taken out of my hands when the director of the school asked whether she could announce the <italic>good news</italic>. I hesitate because I know what is going to happen next. But I must respond. “I will be seven and a half months pregnant.”</p>
<p>The female students burst with questions. “When are you due?” “Why didn’t you tell us?” “Are you excited?” I still do not wear maternity clothes at 5.5 months, but I thought some of them surely had noticed the looser shirts not tucked in and skirts with stretchy waistbands, the fact that I often sit on the table in the front of the room to teach.</p>
<p>“I am a grumpy pregnant lady. I don’t really want to talk about it.” But the students need some more explanation and won’t let me move on. I try to explain my ambivalence, how I never wanted to be pregnant. Though I never wanted to be married either and that was working.</p>
<p>“What does the word ambivalent mean?” I don’t answer and start talking about the next exam.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Ambivalence is not a very well-understood construct and does not have a standard measurement. . . . Our analysis suggests that disaggregating those women who are ambivalent from the overall group of women with unwanted pregnancies may highlight a group of women who have unique characteristics and risks.

<title>Cost: Certainty</title>
<p>Medical researchers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077800411431564">2</xref></sup> ask pregnant women the question I wrestled with hourly: “How do you feel about having a baby now?” The ambivalent are characterized as those who accept being pregnant without any enthusiasm, those who change their negative assessment to be positive or accepting, and those with contradictory feelings. Doesn’t this typify most pregnant women?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077800411431564">3</xref></sup> Doesn’t being pregnant mean you have negative and positive feelings pulling you like a field-day tug-of-war contest? Is one really enthusiastic about funky smells, hemorrhoids, and joints that ache when you breathe? What about the gaping vortex of need, aka an infant?</p>
<p>I get the concern for attitudes given demonstrable research that negativity and ambivalence may be related to undesirable outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077800411431564">4</xref></sup> for mothers and children, such as inconsistent contraception use, congenital abnormalities, low birth rate, vaginal bleeding, prenatal accidents, and pregnancy complications. My question after reading the clinical list of problems is, “What about the process of being pregnant?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077800411431564">5</xref></sup> Why all of this need for a nice resolution? What is missing from all of the popular and clinical pregnancy talk is a more sophisticated understanding of ambivalence toward pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077800411431564">6</xref></sup> than the dichotomous “planned, wanted, or intended” versus “unwanted or accidental.” At least, I discovered there is a field of study devoted to unintended pregnancy, those pregnancies that are mistimed or unwanted at conception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077800411431564">7</xref></sup> However, the <italic>intended</italic> ambivalent pregnancies are the group that does not seem to be well represented. This is, of course, why I did not advertise my ambivalence, just the antipathy toward being pregnant and my pregnant body.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077800411431564">8</xref></sup> Our entire culture participates in the hatred toward the female body, especially a threatening pregnant body, and this hatred translates well into pithy <italic>Facebook</italic> status updates. <italic>The fetus insists on chocolate, though I can’t tie my shoes. Decaf sucks. We love sugar.</italic></p>
<p>Being pregnant is akin to writing a cost–benefit analysis report with few pros listed on the right-hand side of the spreadsheet. In my search for certainty, the unbalanced sheet of costs won’t disappear. The ricocheting pro versus con dialogue was not something I mentioned when the nurse practitioner asked me at the office visit to establish the fact of my pregnant body, “Was this a wanted pregnancy?” The answer wasn’t an absolute yes. But it also wasn’t no. Josh and I both say, “yes.” I could have said, “I am committed to a healthy pregnancy.” But then I would have also had to say <italic>what I consider to be a healthy pregnancy</italic>. And this includes coffee, cookies, and bitchy skepticism. I know not to react against the happy-glowing-pregnant-lady myth in the obstetrician’s office pasted with this dominant discourse. When I sit in the lab room to get blood drawn for iron level and HIV tests, pictures of patients’ happy infants thumb-tacked to the corkboard stare me silent as do the Anne Geddes prints hung in every exam room, the flowered wallpaper trim encasing the building, and the box of toys spilling out of the kids’ nook in the waiting room.</p>
<p>I remember the previous semester when students in my sexual communication class designed a safer sex campaign for a local service agency. Sara clicked off the costs of a child with a PowerPoint slide, and I felt a flutter of, what? Unease. Hypocrisy? I imagined that I was pregnant, and this presentation was for me. I knew even without peeing on a stick. Colin finished the just-say-no-talk with why getting pregnant is a poor choice. “Here in Ohio, the first year will cost you US$15,036, and total costs will be like US$322,000. This is true. My sister had a baby last year, and she is always broke.” I don’t ask them about why they have not considered the myriad of reasons for pregnancy, why they are using the analogies of money and choice. I am the students’ collective middle-class fear.</p>
<p>I forget about the students’ presentation until the Saturday after Thanksgiving when the family leaves, and I slink to the Walgreens near the house for a pregnancy test. The air is damp with rotten leaf mold, and my face flushes with the secret. Not the chill. I am uncertain why I am doing this alone given that Josh and I agreed to try and conceive. I just need to take the walk. To let the flutters in my chest, a mini-anxiety coaster, work their spasms through my tired system. The utter exhaustion that feels worse than any hangover and the incessant need to pee is the alarm that makes me attend to my body. For the four days we had our parents over the holiday, I assumed that the cocktails and cleaning and cooking and making rules and passive aggressive arguing were the triggers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Would-be-mothers . . . cannot escape the dictates of their female bodies . . . they are, despite education and professionalism, simply bodies upon which problematic biological dramas (e.g., infertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, and breastfeeding) are played out. Such tales infiltrate our cultural discourse and the lives of women simultaneously, silencing the possibility for alternate life scripts and locking women into definitions that resist elaboration.

<title>Cost: Medicalization</title>
<p>The technician has me lift my shirt as she pulls my waistband down, tucking some crinkly white paper into the top of my pants. Josh sits in the chair on the left of the ultrasound machine that I presume is for audience members because it is oriented toward the screen. He attends every doctor appointment, and he also lets me tell him again and again, “I wish you could be the one pregnant.” I scooch down the black pleather–covered exam table and rest my hands under my head as the technician dims the lights. She uses warmed conductor gel, so that when she squirts it on my abdomen I don’t flinch. That comes later.</p>
<p>“An alien!” I can’t see Josh from my prone angle on the table. He is leaning forward into the shadows of the machine. I smile at his humor, what I think is confirmation.</p>
<p>“It does look like an alien!” I agree with Josh and move my head to get a better view of the dark grey and white sonar image on the ultrasound machine screen. The young technician continues to move the paddle around my midsection, being careful to keep the cord off the conductor gel, and makes no comment about our observation. She pushes the paddle down with some pressure in order to register an image. We hear a muffled duh-da duh-dada-da-duh she tells us is a heartbeat. It sounds strange to me, like an uneven rain, a surprise storm tapping on the skylights in our house.</p>
<p>The instrument begins to feel as hot as a lap-top battery on my skin. The technician, whose name I can’t remember even though she introduced herself, has her honeyed hair pulled back into a functional pony tale, wears navy scrubs and pair of pink Crocs. Every one seems younger than me, pregnant at 37. I have been engaging in the guess-their-age game when I encounter any mothers or pregnant women.</p>
<p>“Here’s your baby.” She hands me the grainy black and white film with three different views of the alien. I tell Josh that we should not put this picture into a baby book because it would give any child nightmares. “It’s creepy looking.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it an embryo?” I ask the question without pause thinking about prolife rhetoric. This talk about unborn babies irritates me, and lately the irritation turns to anger. Everything irritates me in this amped-up hormonal stew that feels like my usual PMS squared. I am an academic. I can, and do, research about gestation, about stages. At eight weeks, I can still decide to abort this embryo. I have no intention to do so, but I know this sack of cells is not an “unborn baby,” not viable yet.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” The technician tells me I can get up and check out after she hands me a towel to wipe the gel off my midsection. I wonder whether these things are being noted in my chart—bad mother, poor attitude, watch with caution.</p>
<p>At the next ultrasound two weeks later, the one I agree to because of my advanced maternal age, the experience is even worse.</p>
<p>“You are here because you’re old.” The fertility specialist at Toledo Hospital sits behind the clichéd dark wooden desk, his computer rests on one edge, and my chart lies open in the middle. This greeting stuns me. “We used to call you an ugly name, elderly primagravida.” I laugh because he expects it. I nod for him to go on. I am not pleased with his tone, and the more he talks, I know he’s patronizing me. Josh sits beside me. He does not seem to be reacting, so I remind myself to ask him about it when we leave.</p>
<p>“Your eggs are old—not like when you were 21 and the eggs were fresh, young.” The doctor shuffles the papers inside my file as he talks. I want to vocalize the “buts” looping inside my head as his soundtrack keeps going and going. <italic>But I was too busy with school and being a deep adolescent to have a child in my early 20s. I managed to get pregnant in one month on two separate occasions. Clearly age is not affecting my fertility. I have resources. I am middle class enough; I can tell a child no. I have more patience, job security, a savings account, a bourgeoisie life style, and strong social network.</italic> But, I don’t say anything; I just keep nodding. I hope he sees that I will be a better mother. Now.</p>
<p>The doctor slides some pamphlets across the desk. He is talking about amniocenteses and other tests that can be done, the benefits and the risks. “You mean false positives.” I am smug. I know the medical term, interrupt him, talk over him, smug until we hear there is no news. The nuchal translucency screening, which I liken to a supersonic 3D ultrasound, did not provide the measurement of the amount of fluid behind the neck. The damn embryo was 2 cm too short to determine a ratio of Down’s risk. We had to make another appointment for the next week when the embryo would transform into the Faulkner Fetus.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If we consider public and private lives, each with its related sets of constraints and rewards, then the knot of anxiety that accompanies the transition to motherhood for many women begins to unravel—at least conceptually. There is no separation of these experiences of productivity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411431564">Foster, 2005</xref>, p. 78)</p>

<title>Cost: Waiting—Benefit: Not Being Knocked-up Anymore</title>
<p>Josh wakes up with a snort. It’s cold. His neck and right side are stiff. <italic>What’s that noise?</italic> He groans when he recognizes the scream of the fetal monitor alarm. The slide-out chair next to the air-conditioning unit was like sleeping on the ground in winter. It was that comfortable. Dr. Bass, the OB who will be on duty when our daughter decides to pop out, asked him what he thought of the chair. She sometimes slept on one in an empty Labor/Delivery/Recovery room and could not tolerate more than one night. He had been sleeping on the rock for almost three weeks. At least he got to steal pudding cups from the OB floor fridge at night while we watched DVDs on my laptop.</p>
<p>I’m untwisting the monitor straps and moving the hot monitor face-plate from side to side on top of my fundus. The machine’s constant shrill makes it hard for Josh to hear my muttering. The elastic straps constrict my middle, so I always show him the red circle mark on my skin like a sweat stain from an icy glass whenever I’m freed. The nurse from the day shift had even switched out the previous machine with a newer antepartum monitor from another room on the OB floor. This machine did not work any better, though the nurse claimed the Doppler and contraction transducer were more sensitive. “The hospital is still paying it off, but the tech support with this model is terrible.” The alarm always went off just when we would fall asleep.</p>
<p>“Sorry! I’m trying to fix it. I’ll turn it off.” I learned which button could reset the machine after a few nights of the annoying pattern: The alarm would sound. A nurse would stroll down the corridor and through the kitchenette to our room to adjust the monitor straps. We would fall asleep. The alarm would sound. Josh would tell me to push the call button. I would fiddle with the machine myself because I knew the nurses could hear the monitor in their station. Of course, the nurses never heard the alarm. Or they ignored it. I know that Josh got tired of telling me to reluctantly press the call button by my head. At first, he assumed that something was wrong with Mimi, but the alarm went off anytime I rolled over, the baby hiccupped, the air-conditioning went on, the sheets wrinkled.</p>
<p>And so we wait.</p>
<p>“Unexpected bleeding during pregnancy can be caused by three conditions.” Dr. Leggat tells me he is going to give me an obstetrics lecture. He is on hospital duty the next two days, so he scoots past my post at the table with my laptop and lunch tray to sit in the rocker. I know Josh will be irritated he missed this because he usually waited until after the doctor’s rounds before going home to feed the rats, pick up the farm share, and do whatever else I had written on the back of envelopes he shoved into his pocket.</p>
<p>I’m thrilled Dr. Leggat is talking to me not as a patient, but in what I consider a smart target audience maneuver, as a student in a lecture! Situation one is placenta previa. However, your placenta is where it should be—not covering the cervix. I nod, clasp my hands at the bottom of my belly, dig my nails in so as not to interrupt as I have for every other talk Dr. Leggat and any medical staff have given me during this pregnancy. I don’t even ask about Dr. Bass’s hypothesis—that I may have some bleeding uterine cysts that have become more sensitive because of hormonal changes. He continues with his explanation. The second situation is placental abruption where part of the placenta peels away from the uterus before birth. My numerous ultrasounds showed nothing problematic, though it is still a possibility. “We only see twenty percent of all cases that way. You are the third—and worst category—a mystery.” This is why this second stay at what I call the <italic>Spa Wood County</italic> will be an extended one and only end with a birth. “In the past women would stay on bed rest for months with their knitting.” <italic>Uh, does he not see the lace merino shawl on the needles in my lap?</italic></p>
<p>The mystery of this entire thing is what worried Josh. That and my nonconcern. <italic>I feel fine. The kid is kicking and hiccupping and enjoying her warm swim.</italic> I felt fine, except for the usual late pregnancy complaints. I almost did not tell Josh about the second bleed, especially because it was 11 p.m. on a Friday night when I noticed. I wanted to go to bed and wake up in spontaneous labor. The “what if” made me grab our packed bag and put on a pair of stretchy pants. Dr. Bass had told us during one of her rounds, “We don’t know why women go into labor, what makes it happen. This is why I like obstetrics, there is a lot we don’t know about pregnancy. It’s an exciting medical specialty.”</p>
<p>Josh walks into the room later in the afternoon singing “I tip <italic>my hat</italic> to you. I <italic>tip</italic> my hat to you,” my requested “decent coffee” in hand. “Stop it!” I play yell at Josh, though this is one of his funnier songs. He was fascinated with the medical urine hat resting in the bathroom bowl and wondered whether the nurses went around singing about them. “Why do they call it a hat?” Another mystery.</p>
<p>My recollection of Leggat’s lecture proves we should go nowhere. I know what Josh is thinking: <italic>That damn-hippy doula and her text messages urging my high-risk wife to check out of the hospital.</italic> He laughs at the t-shirt we bought his brother with the picture of a Semi-Truck grill and the words—“Think Fast Hippie.” The “but what if” was ever present. There was no more bleeding. There was nothing in the fetal monitor scans. There was a normal picture on the sonograms. <italic>But</italic> the possibility of a bleed-out, the quickness with which maternal and fetal mortality was threatened made him hungry to stay and eat the cafeteria’s mashed potatoes with extra gravy. Actually, he loved the easy access to cheap gravy three floors down. Other than the hair he once found on a Sloppy Joe, he relished the high-fat food in Styrofoam containers he carried up to our room on the OB floor.</p>
<p>He had seen the blood all over the sheets, on my hospital gown, on Dr. Bass’s hands the first time we rushed from the office to the ER, and Dr. C’s hands the second time, spotty on the admitting room floor trailing to the bathroom. Josh hated they released me the first time after 5 days, even though I complained I felt fine. He wanted to stay in the hospital with the monitors, the trained staff, and the equipment in the C-section room we saw during the tour in our childbirth class.</p>
<p>To me the thought of a “rapid operative delivery” was repulsive, was the antithesis of the private hypnobirthing classes I had to hunt down for us to attend. Yet he was quiet and said nothing about the “fake earth-goddess” instructor or the 20 or 40 or 60 birth videos we watched on her black-leather couches that were perfect for napping during the practice hypnosis sessions. He was quiet even though the births made him queasy and certain he could not be near any bloody show.</p>
<p>And so we wait.</p>
<p>When I ask what he remembered about the birth, Josh describes my screaming, the blood, and the moment Mimi shot out like a piece of popcorn. And what a waste of money that doula was, the one who urged a high-risk woman to leave the hospital and who did not show up until the last hour of labor, minutes after my bloody water broke, unassisted.</p>
<p>This was the third induction, the one I consented to because we couldn’t take any more of the spa. One overnight Cervidil prostoglandin E2 vaginal insert and a pitocin drip at 39 weeks gestation ended with a run to Jimmy Johns. The Ultimate Porker—what I remember as my first meal—is a magical sandwich filled with bacon and ham and mayonnaise and general grumpiness dissipating goodness that a cup of pudding from the kitchenette was not. The nurse who would chant “pushing is just like taking a big poopie” had not administered the drip properly, irritating everyone <italic>in-utero</italic> and <italic>out</italic>. The second failed attempt was natural method Monday, a Foley bulb catheter that caused too much bleeding coupled with ineffective nipple stimulation. It was this final pitocin drip that coaxed our daughter out. On her due date and three minutes before dinner, before the midnight hour that Dr. Bass, the nurses, everyone predicted. Mimi did not spend much time being pushed out. I was walking around the halls pulling the IV poll, rolling around on a birthing ball, asking for back rubs during contractions, dragging IV lines into the bathroom to pee, thinking I may actually die from the pain.</p>
<p>Then I’m in bed. There’s lots of blood. Josh stays positioned by my head. He hears Dr. Bass’s concern about the amount of blood—always the blood—there isn’t enough time to do a C-section because the baby’s head is crowing. <italic>Now</italic> she rushes to get out. I don’t really hear any of this talk. One nurse is pushing an oxygen mask over my face, some other nurse and the doula are holding up my legs. <italic>No</italic>, no mirror, <italic>no</italic> I don’t want to feel the baby’s head. I just want it to be over. Secretly, I was in no hurry for the birth because I feared labor, knew the hypnobirthing creed of a “pain-free birth” was like a unicorn jumping over the “rainbow relaxation” chants Josh and I had practiced for months.</p>
<p>“It’s just like taking a big poopie.” The nurse that should retire is at one foot of the bed, urging me to push. Josh confirms this memory later. My screaming hurts his ears. He feels the entire floor quaking from the noise and wants to put his hands over his ears to protect them from the ringing. And then. Mimi shoots out.</p>
<p>I am supposed to tell you how happy I was, that the birth was my happiest moment ever, that I cried, warbled, and shook from joy. Yes, I shook, but the shaking was from exhaustion. And the first two things I said were, “Thank God I’m not pregnant anymore.” Then a panicked “It is a girl?” What I remember is that I was simply stunned. And then relieved for the shower I got to take after the golden colostrum moment, the cord-cutting, weighing, and swaddling of the baby. This was the prize for no analgesics, no epidural. Josh tells me he was overwhelmed in that good almost the miracle of birth way, but not quite. He thought, “Ah, she looks like Sandra. No wait, she looks like my father in law.”</p>
<p>I disclose pieces<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077800411431564">9</xref></sup> of the story during the semester I teach a relational communication seminar, relieved—no ecstatic— to end the year of breastfeeding, to be lifted out of the cloying baby fog. The students and I struggle through the latest iteration of Leslie Baxter’s relational dialectic theory—RDT 2.0—my favorite interpersonal theory in graduate school. I rolled around in the idea of flux, the way it felt like an epistemological homecoming. We argue about whether we can apply it to our personal experience given the radical idea that relational scholars should use discourse and not <italic>the individual</italic> as a unit of analysis. This shocks me into framing my (and as I understand now Josh and Mimi’s) story as a series of marginalized discourse, in particular ambivalence (vs. certainty), bodily knowledge (vs. medicalization, vs. middle-class pregnancy), and flux (vs. cost–benefit ratios). The problem is that these marginal/centrifugal discourses are not well represented in the totalizing picture of the <italic>pregnant lady</italic>. The rigidity freezes the alternative script, doesn’t allow me to look at my funny, stubborn, watermelon, pot-sticker, and dog-loving child, and say with smirking elaboration, “but it was all worth it.”</p>

<p>Ambivalence about pregnancy is a common, though understudied, experience. In part, this may be because the further away from the pregnancy, the more likely a woman will alter her story (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411431564">Duck, 2011</xref>). Ambivalent women are older, nonwhite, and opposed to abortion. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411431564">Bouchard (2005)</xref>.</p>
