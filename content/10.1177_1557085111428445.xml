<abstract>
<p>Research on intimate partner homicide has increased along with public awareness and policy responses toward domestic violence. The current study addresses the decline in gender-specific intimate partner homicides during a time marked by significant transformations in domestic violence legislation, including the enactment of the 1994 Violence Against Women’s Act. In an attempt to account for changes in intimate partner homicide during this time period, we examine the exposure reducing potential of domesticity, domestic violence resources, and females’ economic status, while also acknowledging their possible backlash/retaliation effects when accounting for inequalities in the economic statuses of males and females. By incorporating a pooled time-series design to model change, our research reveals changes between 1990 and 2000 in key theoretical predictors of domesticity, domestic violence resources, and economic deprivation significantly influence the trends in male-victim intimate partner homicide, but not female-victim intimate partner homicide for a large sample of 178 urban cities.</p>

<p>There has been growing interest recently in capturing the changes in female victimization and offending rates over time. This interest has stemmed from the current literature on the gender gap in crime, specifically those studies examining whether female offending or victimization rates have changed significantly over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1557085111428445">Heimer, Lauritsen, &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1557085111428445">Lauritsen, Heimer, &amp; Lynch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1557085111428445">Schwartz, Steffensmeier, &amp; Feldmeyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1557085111428445">Schwartz, Steffensmeier, Zhong, &amp; Ackerman, 2009</xref>). It is within this vein of research that we seek to examine the changes in gendered violence, particularly intimate partner homicides involving males and females.</p>
<p>The research on gendered crime, intimate partner violence in particular, is quite revealing. Statistics show that intimate partner homicides have declined since the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111428445">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085111428445">Greenfield et al., 1998</xref>). Although this decline has been documented for both male and female victims of intimate partner homicide, the magnitude of the decline is much greater for the rate of intimate partner homicide where the female was the offender (male victims). Given the growing interest in intimate partner homicide and incorporating change into the study of homicide, this research seeks to explore how various theoretical and policy relevant predictors are associated with the changing nature of gender-specific intimate partner homicide during a time that is marked by not only a precipitous decline in urban homicide rates but also significant transformations in legislative responses toward domestic violence, such as the enactment of the 1994 Violence Against Women’s Act (VAWA).</p>

<title>Trends in Intimate Partner Homicides</title>
<p>The early 1990s marked the beginning of a significant drop in violent crime rates throughout U.S. cities, which extended well into the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1557085111428445">Blumstein &amp; Wallman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111428445">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1557085111428445">LaFree, 1999</xref>). Interestingly, the sharpest decline in homicides has been observed in the family category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld, 2000</xref>), with most of those homicides generally occurring between spouses, ex-spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1557085111428445">Durose et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111428445">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2007</xref>). Statistics on gender-specific intimate partner homicide show that the decline witnessed in intimate partner homicide rates over the past two decades has been similar for both male and female victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1557085111428445">Fox &amp; Zawitz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1557085111428445">Greenfield et al., 1998</xref>), though the magnitude of the decline is greater for male victims. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1557085111428445">Figure 1</xref> documents the patterns of change in the rates of male- and female-victim intimate partner homicide over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1557085111428445">1</xref></sup> Specifically, across large U.S. cities, the rate of female-victim intimate partner homicide decreased 33% from 1989 to 2001, whereas the rate of male-victim intimate partner homicide decreased 45% during this same time period.</p>

<p>It is important to note that these trends witnessed throughout the 1990s coincided with many transformations that were occurring in domestic violence legislation. Specifically, awareness toward domestic violence changed drastically with the passage of the 1994 VAWA, which improved criminal justice and community based responses toward domestic violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1557085111428445">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, it has been suggested that efforts to protect females against violent partners may have a greater impact on male-victim intimate partner homicide by providing females with options other than partner violence to protect themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan, Nagin, &amp; Rosenfeld, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>). Transformations in legislation toward domestic violence during the 1990s as well as findings produced in recent studies suggest that more research is needed to fully understand the changes in intimate partner homicide over time and across gender.</p>

<title>Theoretical Perspectives</title>
<p>Research drawing from feminist perspectives has produced a number of theoretical approaches to understanding gendered violence. We incorporate three different perspectives to explain gender-specific intimate partner homicide. The first approach highlights the importance of reducing the exposure between violent couples by providing nonviolent alternatives to women who are being abused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>). The second approach identifies the potential for backlash/retaliation by males against females when certain conditions (e.g., economic gains, power threats) are presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, as a growing body of literature documents the link between economic marginalization as contributing to gendered violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111428445">Heimer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1557085111428445">Reckdenwald &amp; Parker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1557085111428445">Steffensmeier &amp; Haynie, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1557085111428445">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1557085111428445">Whaley &amp; Messner, 2002</xref>), we explore economic marginalization as a potential explanation for intimate partner homicide. We outline each of these theoretical arguments below.</p>

<sec id="section3-1557085111428445">
<title>Exposure Reduction</title>
<p>According to the exposure reduction hypothesis, limiting the exposure or contact of intimate partners that have a history of violence toward one another should decrease the probability of intimate partner homicide. Ideas behind the exposure reduction perspective stem from four main findings from previous research. First, domestic violence research shows that intimate partner homicide is commonly the result of prolonged violence in the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111428445">Browne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111428445">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111428445">Goetting, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1557085111428445">Smith, Moracco, &amp; Butts, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1557085111428445">Totman, 1978</xref>) or a prior history of violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111428445">Browne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1557085111428445">Chimbos, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1557085111428445">Daniel &amp; Harris, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1557085111428445">Totman, 1978</xref>). Second, research has shown that in violent relationships women are more likely to be seriously injured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1557085111428445">Berk, Berk, Loseke, &amp; Rauma, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1557085111428445">Brush, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1557085111428445">Crowell &amp; Burgess, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1557085111428445">Fagan &amp; Browne, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1557085111428445">Langan &amp; Innes, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1557085111428445">Schwartz, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1557085111428445">Stets &amp; Straus, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1557085111428445">Stout &amp; Brown, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1557085111428445">Straus, 1993</xref>). Third, victim precipitation is more likely in female-perpetrated intimate partner homicide than male-perpetrated intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111428445">Goetting, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1557085111428445">Silverman &amp; Mukherjee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1557085111428445">Wolfgang, 1958</xref>). Finally, research also suggests that when women kill, they are more likely to kill an intimate partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>) and usually use violence in an effort to protect themselves or their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>). With the accumulation of these findings, researchers have hypothesized that factors designed to reduce the exposure between violent couples should have a stronger association with male-victim intimate partner homicide, by reducing the likelihood of males being killed by their female partners in self-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A main factor that has been shown to influence male-victim intimate partner homicide by reducing the exposure of violent partners is the availability of domestic violence resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>). Specifically, research has shown that domestic violence resources have the ability to provide abused females with alternatives besides killing their male partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>). This is apparent from the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al.’s (1999)</xref> study. They examined the ideas behind exposure reduction, looking specifically at the availability of domestic violence resources, as well as declining domesticity (i.e., decrease in the marriage rate), divorce (i.e., increase in the divorce rate), and the improved economic status of women (i.e., females’ educational attainment relative to males’ and females’ income relative to males’). Their results are generally consistent with the exposure reduction perspective, where factors designed to reduce exposure between violent partners were more closely associated with the decrease in male-victim intimate partner homicides rather than female-victim intimate partner homicides.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1557085111428445">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other common factors that have been considered to produce exposure-reduction effects are increasing divorce rates and decreasing marriage rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld (1997)</xref> examined intimate partner homicide trends in St. Louis and found that 30% of the decline in African American spousal homicides was attributable to falling marriage rates and rising divorce rates. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al. (1999)</xref> found that the decline in marriage rates was related to the decline in married male and female intimate partner victimization. Conversely, a high divorce rate corresponded to fewer wives killing their husbands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1557085111428445">4</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">Dugan et al. (2003)</xref> found similar results. However, decreasing marriage rates may mean that more individuals are cohabitating together without getting married. Research suggests that males and females in cohabitating relationships are at a higher risk of intimate partner homicide victimization compared with males and females in married relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085111428445">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1557085111428445">Shackelford, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1557085111428445">Wilson, Daly, &amp; Wright, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1557085111428445">Wilson, Johnson, &amp; Daly, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential for improved economic status of women to produce exposure reduction effects has also been discussed in the recent literature. Commonly examined in terms of educational attainment, income, and employment, the idea is that an increase in females’ access to opportunities may give them other nonviolent alternatives to killing their violent male partners. Also, increased status would reduce females’ dependence on males. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al.’s (1999)</xref> results followed this prediction. They found that an increase in females’ relative educational attainment was associated with a decline in nonmarried male victimization. They suggest that “more educated women are better able, and perhaps more willing, to exit violent relationships and thus avoid killing their partner” (pp. 204-205). Furthermore, they found that females’ improved status in terms of earnings was associated with a decline in intimate partner homicide victimization, particularly married male intimate partner homicide victimization.</p>

<sec id="section4-1557085111428445">
<title>Backlash or Retaliation Hypothesis</title>
<p>Contrary to the exposure-reduction perspective, the backlash perspective theorizes that increased male violence toward their intimate partners is due to a perceived loss of power or control because of females’ improving economic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111428445">Browne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1557085111428445">Vieraitis &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>). This hypothesis was first developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1557085111428445">Williams and Holmes (1981)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1557085111428445">Russell (1975)</xref> as a warning of the potential consequences of females’ increased economic conditions or gender equality. That is, women’s improving economic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1557085111428445">5</xref></sup> (i.e., increased income, employment, and educational attainment) would make women less dependent on men, which would threaten men and actually cause them to increase violence toward their partners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1557085111428445">Avakame (1999)</xref> states “initial reductions in gender inequality might cause increases in violence because it would frustrate males into intensifying their use of violence to reassert their diminishing patriarchal power and authority” (p. 927).</p>
<p>This is especially true for females being killed by their male partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1557085111428445">Block, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085111428445">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>) and is heightened when females attempt to leave the relationship. Research has shown that when male unemployment is high relative to females, wives killed by their husbands’ increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1557085111428445">Bailey &amp; Peterson, 1995</xref>). Research has also suggested the possibility of retaliation by the abusive partner from domestic violence interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111428445">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1557085111428445">Goetting, 1995</xref>) or other nonviolent alternatives to reduce the exposure between violent partners, which have the possibility to threaten a male’s control over their female partner. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">Dugan et al. (2003)</xref> found a retaliation effect where domestic violence resources actually increased homicide between intimate partners because they failed to effectively reduce exposure between intimate partners. In fact, the prosecutor’s willingness to prosecute violators of protection orders, though intended to reduce exposure between violent intimate partners, actually caused a retaliation effect where homicides increased for married and unmarried White females and African American unmarried males.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1557085111428445">
<title>Economic Deprivation and Marginalization</title>
<p>The role economic deprivation and marginalization plays in gendered violence cannot be overstated. Long ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1557085111428445">Merton (1968)</xref> articulated how deviance results from the unequal distribution of opportunities among classes in society, where inequalities in particular lead to an increase in violence for both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1557085111428445">Blau &amp; Blau, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1557085111428445">Braithwaite, 1979</xref>). Furthermore, feminist scholars have long posited inequality—gendered inequality—as a contributor to the gendered nature of violence. For example, feminist literature signifies the patriarchal system of male domination and control over women as a cause of gender inequalities in society and ultimately the oppression of women in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1557085111428445">Walby, 1986</xref>). When examining female crime, the economic marginalization hypothesis positions the economic disadvantage of women, such as high levels of joblessness and poverty, as a substantial predictor of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1557085111428445">Box &amp; Hale, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1557085111428445">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1557085111428445">Heimer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1557085111428445">Heimer, Wittrock, &amp; Unal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1557085111428445">Steffensmeier &amp; Streifel, 1992</xref>). However, even though economic deprivation and marginalization has been well documented in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1557085111428445">Bailey, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1557085111428445">Steffensmeier &amp; Haynie, 2000a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1557085111428445">2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1557085111428445">Whaley &amp; Messner, 2002</xref>), few studies have included indicators of economic deprivation and marginalization when addressing intimate partner homicide at the macro level (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1557085111428445">Reckdenwald &amp; Parker, 2008</xref>). Economic deprivation and marginalization, which for females may be caused by gender inequalities, may influence intimate partner homicides by creating strain and frustration. It is likely that the source of strain caused from economic deprivation and marginalization may differ for males and females. For males, strain may pertain directly with lack of resources, whereas for females the source of strain may be related to the lack of financial independence that would lessen the ability to leave an abusive relationship.</p>

<title>Hypotheses—Summarized</title>
<p>Central to our hypotheses is the changing nature of intimate partner homicide over time, something that has rarely been incorporated into the literature exploring male and female intimate partner homicides to date (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref> for exceptions). Examining the dynamic nature of intimate partner homicide will give us a better understanding of the differential declines in gender-specific intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000 and what contribution key theoretical and policy relevant predictors played in the changes in intimate partner homicide during this critical time period. Also, our hypotheses were developed around empirical evidence that shows that though both male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides have declined over time, the magnitude of the decline is larger for male victims as well as the assumption that certain factors are more strongly associated with either male- or female-victim intimate partner homicide. Based on the above theoretical arguments, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-1557085111428445" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Exposure-reduction hypotheses:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Changes in domesticity and availability of domestic violence resources are significantly related to the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Changes in females’ status relative to males’ significantly contributes to the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Backlash/retaliation hypotheses:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Changes in females’ status relative to males’ significantly contributes to the change in female-victim intimate partner homicide over time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Economic marginalization/deprivation hypotheses:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Changes in the absolute measures of economic deprivation and marginalization will significantly be related to changes in both female- and male-victim intimate partner homicides over time, which is in line with gender inequality and/or strain theory arguments.</p></list-item></list>
<p>To summarize, we argue that domesticity and the availability of domestic violence resources will be more strongly related to the decline witnessed in male-victim intimate partner homicides because of the impact these factors have on the amount of exposure violent couples have and the chances that females will resort to killing their violent partners in self-defense. Changes in females’ status is predicted to have an impact on both male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides; however, the impact for males and females is based on different (opposing) theoretical mechanisms. That is, females’ improved economic status is predicted to decrease male-victim intimate partner homicide by affording females opportunities to reduce the exposure between themselves and their violent partners. Whereas, females’ economic status is predicted to increase female-victim intimate partner homicide from the backlash of abusive partners when their power and control is threatened by female’s economic gains. Economic deprivation and/or marginalization is hypothesized to influence both male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides either in terms of strain or frustration associated with limited resources, which would influence both genders or would specifically influence females as it lessens their ability to leave a violent partner.</p>

<title>Current Study</title>
<p>In this study, we attempt to address the observed shifts in male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides over time by building off of the previous research by Dugan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>). In line with this noteworthy research, we examine the exposure-reducing potential of factors related to domesticity, the status of women, and domestic violence resources, while also acknowledging their possible backlash/retaliation effects. Importantly, we extend Dugan and colleague’s research by also accounting for the vastly different economic statuses between males and females, which are assessed in relative (disparities between males and females) and absolute (poverty levels and joblessness) degrees. Furthermore, we expand on the types of domestic violence resource measures used to include male batterers counseling programs and the availability of referral services. Also, while Dugan and colleagues limited their analyses to the largest cities in the United States, we expanded our sample to include all cities with a population greater than 100,000. In addition, we employ a methodological approach that appropriately models the change in structural conditions and intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000 while also acknowledging the rare nature of these events (and/or potential for high zero counts) methodologically, something that was lacking in previous research. By doing this, we are able to estimate the impact of changes in important factors (such as domestic violence services) and gender-specific structural conditions on the observed shifts in gender-specific intimate partner homicide. This research hopes to build on previous research that has uncovered factors that explain the decrease in male-victim intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>), while also investigating other factors that may influence the change witnessed in female-victim intimate partner homicide. Examining this time period is critical not only because of the precipitous decline in urban homicide rates since the early 1990s, but also because the evidence that legislative responses toward domestic violence may differentially influence male and female intimate partner homicides.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>For this study, the unit of analysis is cities with a population of 100,000 or more in 1990. The resulting urban sample contains 200 cities that meet that criterion. Of those cities, 178 were used in the analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1557085111428445">6</xref></sup> Multiple data sources were used for the current study. The dependent variables are based on data from the Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1557085111428445">7</xref></sup> for the years 1989-1991 and 1999-2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1557085111428445">Fox, 2005</xref>). U.S. Bureau of Census summary files 1 and 3 for 1990 and 2000 are the sources of data for the independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1557085111428445">U.S. Bureau of Census, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1557085111428445">2003</xref>).

<sec id="section9-1557085111428445">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The two dependent variables are the changes in male- and female-victim intimate partner homicide counts from 1990 to 2000. To determine the counts of male- and female-victim intimate partner homicide for a given city and a given year, the counts were aggregated to the city level for each year by the offender’s gender and intimate partner relationship. Consistent with other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1557085111428445">Messner, Deane, Anselin, &amp; Pearson-Nelson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1557085111428445">Villarreal, 2004</xref>) counts for each city are based on 3-year sums (1989, 1990, 1991 and 1999, 2000, 2001) to control for any fluctuations in reporting and relative low frequencies of offending. Also, consistent with other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1557085111428445">Flewelling &amp; Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1557085111428445">Williams &amp; Flewelling, 1987</xref>) only murders and nonnegligent manslaughters with single victim and single offender were included.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1557085111428445">9</xref></sup> In addition, intimate partners include spouses, common-law spouses, ex-spouses, and boyfriends/ girlfriends. Homosexual relationships were excluded for the purpose of this study because the male–female dynamic is of particular importance and because of the small number of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 2003</xref>).

<sec id="section10-1557085111428445">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>To assess whether domesticity and domestic violence service availability had an exposure reducing effect on intimate partner homicide, seven measures are included in this study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1557085111428445">appendix</xref> for detailed information on the measurement of all independent variables). These measures include the percentage of divorced males, the percentage of divorced females, the percentage of unmarried partner households, the number of shelters offered per 100,000 females, the number of legal services offered per 100,000 females, the number of referrals offered to females per 100,000 females, and the number of male batterers counseling services offered per 100,000 males.</p>
<p>Three ratio measures of females’ status relative to males’ are included in this study to test exposure reduction and/or backlash/retaliation effects. These measures have been used in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1557085111428445">Whaley &amp; Messner, 2002</xref>). Females’ status has been suggested to have exposure reducing effects on male-victim intimate partner homicide by providing females with alternatives to staying in a violent relationship and killing their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>); however, it has also been acknowledged that females’ status may have the potential under certain conditions to produce backlash/retaliation effects when males are threatened by their loss of power over their female partners as their status increases or as gender equality increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1557085111428445">Whaley &amp; Messner, 2002</xref>). The ratio measures include the ratio of male-to-female median income, the ratio of the percentage of males employed to the percentage of females employed, and the ratio of the percentage of males with 4 or more years of college education to the percentage of females with 4 or more years of college education.</p>
<p>Two gender-specific absolute measures are included in the models to capture economic deprivation and/or marginalization. These measures include the percentage of males living below poverty, the percentage of females living below poverty, the percentage of males jobless, and the percentage of females jobless. A third absolute measure of the percentage of households on public assistance is also included to measure economic deprivation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1557085111428445">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Five control measures are included in this study. These measures represent predictors commonly used in homicide research to control for structural characteristics of areas. They are residential mobility, police officer rate per 1,000 residents, the log of the percentage Hispanic, and a dummy coded variable for region (south). Residential mobility has been suggested to influence intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1557085111428445">Williams &amp; Flewelling, 1988</xref>), particularly male-victim intimate partner homicide as a result of male aggression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne and Williams (1989)</xref> suggest that mobility may isolate females from support networks that would give females other avenues when conflicts arise instead of resorting to lethal violence. Controlling for the officer rate is consistent with other research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1557085111428445">DeWees &amp; Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1557085111428445">Steffensmeier &amp; Haynie, 2000a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1557085111428445">Steffensmeier and Allan (1988)</xref> suggest that the increased presence of police officers may be associated with variations in arrest patterns. The percentage Hispanic is included in the models to account for the fact that research has shown that Hispanics are less likely to be involved in intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1557085111428445">Paulsen &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>). A variable for the south is used in the present analysis to control for any regional differences in intimate partner homicide offending. Research has shown that homicide rates are higher in the south (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1557085111428445">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>) and that intimate partner homicide is higher in the south as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1557085111428445">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1557085111428445">Nisbett &amp; Cohen, 1996</xref>). The overall homicide rate for cities is included to control for the change in the homicide rate over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1557085111428445">
<title>Methodological Considerations</title>
<p>The domestic violence service data had some missing data that were addressed in this study. That is, there were instances where a program in a city did not report whether a particular service was offered. In these cases, the mean of that particular service across cities was imputed. To determine if the missing values were missing at random, a dummy variable for whether the mean was imputed for a city was added to the initial models (i.e., 1 = <italic>mean imputation</italic>, 0 = <italic>no mean imputation for a city</italic>). Results showed that the missing values were missing at random and therefore the mean imputations were appropriate to use.</p>
<p>Another methodological issue common to structural analysis is multicollinearity. We assessed multicollinearity in two ways: (a) examining bivariate correlations between the variables and (b) examining variance inflation factors. After examination of the correlation matrices, it was evident that there is collinearity and partiality among the regressors, particularly among the factors representing economic deprivation and/or marginalization. Using confirmatory factor analysis, we created an index that combined the gender-specific measures of the percentage living in poverty, the percentage jobless, and the percentage of female headed households receiving public assistance payments. The indexes are referred to as the Male Economic Deprivation Index and the Female Economic Deprivation Index in the respective models.</p>
<p>The bivariate correlation matrices for the domestic violence service variables clearly show that many of the individual domestic violence services are highly collinear. Four variables were of particular interest because they represented service information that was collected for both time periods and they included shelters, legal services, male batterers counseling, and referral services for each city. In the final analyses, composite measures of these variables are used. We reexamined bivariate correlations and variance inflation factors after factor analysis was used and collinearity among the predictors was greatly reduced. In fact, no variance inflation factor in the final models exceeded 4.0.</p>

All the variable means are significantly different except for the mean of the number of referral services per 100,000 females.

In addition, for both males and females, economic deprivation and the percentage divorced decreased from 1990 to 2000, as well as the ratio of male-to-female educational attainment, the ratio of male-to-female employment, the rate of male batterers counseling programs, and the overall homicide rate. In contrast, the ratio of male-to-female median income, the percentage of unmarried households, the rate of the number of shelters, the rate of the number of legal services, the percentage Hispanic, residential mobility, and the officer rate increased from 1990 to 2000.</p>

<p>where <italic>x<sub>it</sub></italic> is the vector of covariates for both cities (<italic>i</italic>) and time periods (<italic>t</italic>), with dummy variables controlling for city (ν<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) and time trends (λ<italic><sub>t</sub></italic>). A time variable for year 1990 was included in the analysis to control for period effects, with the year 2000 as the reference period. There are advantages to this type of analysis. For instance, pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis increases the number of observations (<italic>i</italic> × <italic>t</italic>) and also allows one to model time and space and generalize between them.</p>
<p>Due to the skewed nature of the dependent variables, both the female-victim intimate partner homicide count over 3 years and the male-victim intimate partner homicide count over 3 years was transformed using a logarithmic transformation. An issue arose with the logarithmic transformation when the count of intimate partner homicide equaled zero. The log of a zero equals –∞. To fix this problem, all zero counts were also coded as zero for the logarithmic transformation of the intimate partner homicide count. To account for this, a dummy variable was included in the models that represented zero counts for intimate partner homicide (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111428445">Hausman, Hall, &amp; Griliches, 1984</xref> for rationale). Also, the log of the population 15 and older multiplied by a factor of 3 was included in the models to control for the population size and to account for the skewed nature of the variable.</p>
<p>Both fixed-effects and random-effects models are appropriate to use for pooled cross-sectional analysis; however, for the current study, the fixed-effect estimation was used for a variety of reasons: (a) it expresses variables only in terms of change within a unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1557085111428445">Parker, 2004</xref>), which is appropriate, because the current study seeks to determine the relationship between change in key theoretical constructs and change in the dependent variable for a given city; (b) it controls for all omitted and included time-invariant variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1557085111428445">Allison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1557085111428445">Johnson, 1995</xref>); and (c) the Hausman specification test indicated that the fixed-effects model was more appropriate to use than the random-effects model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1557085111428445">Greene, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1557085111428445">Hausman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1557085111428445">Hsaio, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1557085111428445">Maddala, 1983</xref>).</p>

<p>In line with exposure-reduction arguments as well as our first hypothesis, the change (decrease) in the percentage of females that are divorced had a negative, statistically significant effect on the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000. It appears that more intimate partner homicides result when divorce rates decline and the exposure between violent couples is not reduced. Research has suggested that high marriage rates are related to high intimate partner homicide rates. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al. (1999)</xref> found that the higher the marriage rate in cities, the higher the rates that wives kill their husbands and husbands kill their wives. Divorce reduces the exposure between violent couples and offers a nonviolent solution to ending a violent relationship. By choosing to stay in a violent marital relationship, females may find themselves in violent situations where nonviolent alternatives are not available and killing their partner is their only foreseeable option. Also, the change (increase) in the percentage of unmarried households had a positive, statistically significant effect on the change (decrease) in male-victim intimate partner homicide, suggesting that choosing to not marry may reduce the dependency of females on males by affording them greater flexibility and independence when trying to exit a violent relationship and avoid lethal violence. Furthermore, the change (increase) in the availability of shelters to females had a positive, statistically significant effect on the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000. It seems that an increase in the availability of shelters may afford women the opportunity to find a nonviolent alternative (i.e., a place to stay) besides killing their violent partners, which is associated with the decline in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. This is consistent with previous research that found legal services and hotlines to have a significant reduction in male-victim intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, the change (decrease) in the availability of referral services to females had a negative, statistically significant effect on the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Less referral services available to females is related to more male-victim intimate partner homicides, possibly due to fewer options available to leave a violent relationship. No significant relationship is found between changes in the rate of legal services available to females or the rate of batterers counseling programs available to males and male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Interestingly, contrary to our second hypothesis, none of the changes in the indicators measuring females’ status relative to males are significantly related to the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in line with economic deprivation and marginalization arguments and our fourth hypothesis, the change (decrease) in the Female Economic Deprivation Index had a positive, statistically significant effect on the change in male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000. In all likelihood, less deprivation in terms of poverty, joblessness, and public assistance results in more alternatives for females to exit an abusive relationship because they are not financial dependent on their partners and therefore will be less likely to kill as a means of escape or a last resort, which is associated with the decline witnessed in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time.</p>
<p>Interestingly, support is not found for the changes in the variables identified by the theoretical perspectives on the changes in female-victim intimate partner homicide counts from 1990 to 2000 for this particular sample of cities. It was predicted in our third and fourth hypotheses that changes in the status of females and the economic deprivation and/or marginalization of males would be related to changes in female-victim intimate partner homicide over time; however, this does not appear to be the case. Male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides are unique events with different motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1557085111428445">Block &amp; Christakos, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1557085111428445">Browne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1557085111428445">Campbell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1557085111428445">Daly &amp; Wilson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1557085111428445">Dobash, Dobash, Wilson, &amp; Daly, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1557085111428445">Goetting, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1557085111428445">Stout &amp; Brown, 1995</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1557085111428445">Archer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1557085111428445">Saunders &amp; Browne, 2000</xref> for a review) that require a unique set of explanations. From this analysis, it seems that changes in economic deprivation and/or marginalization, which influences male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000 and has consistently been a key factor in the homicide literature, does not have the predicted influence on female intimate partner homicide victimization from 1990 to 2000 for this sample of cities. Also, measures representing the increasing status of females relative to males appear to have little influence on males killing their female intimate partners, which is contrary to backlash/retaliation predictions stated in our third hypothesis. Females’ increasing status from 1990 to 2000 seems to not have elicited the expected result: males lashing out to the perceived threat of losing control of their intimate partners. It is important to note that this study does not find support for this theoretical explanation during this time period and for this particular sample of cities. These findings should be taken with caution, as there are important aspects of intimate partner violence not included in this study, particularly, race and marital status—both of which have been shown to be important in intimate partner homicide research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1557085111428445">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1557085111428445">Wells &amp; DeLeon-Granados, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to examine the changing nature of both male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides from 1990 to 2000. Clearly, the crime drop of the 1990s is a complex issue, but our goal was to examine the gendered nature of violence, via our investigation of intimate partner homicides, to get a better understanding of the role gender inequality plays within the crime-drop debate. Our research suggests that one explanation will not suffice. Drawing on theories of exposure reduction, backlash/retaliation, and economic deprivation and/or marginalization, pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses are presented to evaluate the effectiveness of these perspectives when providing a dynamic explanation of male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides in large cities over time. Availability of domestic violence services and the relevancy of policies affecting women’s access to public assistance and welfare were also incorporated into this study given the prominent role policy has played in gendered violence and the lives of women in recent decades.</p>
<p>Based on previous intimate partner homicide literature as well as homicide literature in general, it was hypothesized that changes in domesticity, the status of women, and domestic violence resources would have an exposure-reducing effect by reducing the exposure between violent partners and be associated with changes in intimate partner homicide, particularly male-victim intimate partner homicide (see Hypotheses 1 and 2). Possible backlash/retaliation effects of the changing status of women were hypothesized to influence female-victim intimate partner homicide over time because of the potential for the change in the status of females to threaten males’ power over their female partners (see Hypothesis 3). Changes in factors representing economic deprivation and/or marginalization were hypothesized to be associated with both male- and female-victim intimate partner homicides over time because of either the strain or frustration that is associated with limited resources or, specifically for females, the lack of financial independence which would lessen the ability to leave an abusive relationship (see Hypothesis 4). Dramatic changes were occurring in domesticity, the status of females in terms of income, joblessness and educational attainment, economic deprivation, and domestic violence resources from 1990 to 2000 in large cities and any of these changes have the potential to affect gender-specific trends in intimate partner homicide. Overall, there is some support for a dynamic explanation of changes in the key indicators on the changes in male-victim intimate partner homicide from 1990 to 2000 and no support on the changes in female-victim intimate partner homicide for this sample of cities.</p>
<p>To summarize, as expected, changes in female economic deprivation within cities are significantly associated with changes in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Also, the measures of domesticity (percentage of females divorced and percentage of unmarried households) are related to changes in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Furthermore, two of the domestic violence resource measures (availability of shelters and referral services) are related to the changes in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time, directly in support of exposure-reduction arguments.</p>
<p>This research makes two methodological contributions to the literature. First, this research links a feminist-informed literature with other violence literature by incorporating exposure-reduction and backlash/retaliation arguments with economic deprivation and marginalization arguments. Second, this research employs a methodological approach that models the change in resources and gender-specific structural conditions from 1990 to 2000 for the rare event of intimate partner homicide, something that has not been done in the literature to date. The choice of time period is critically important to the study of violence, because dramatic changes occurred in domesticity, the status of females, economic deprivation and marginalization, and the availability of domestic violence resources with the enactment of the VAWA in 1994.</p>
<p>Although we can only speculate on why these findings emerged, a clear policy implication from this line of research would be to continue to provide domestic violence resources and services to females in violent relationships while increasing efforts to adequately protect victims of abuse. Once victims are adequately protected, policies and programs should be enhanced to provide these women with more resources and support, such as jobs, public assistance, and counseling. Policies geared toward increasing females’ economic independence, and thus reducing deprivation, would make it easier for females to leave cohabitating as well as violent marital relationships. Taking a theoretical standpoint, this research speaks to the importance of reducing the exposure between violent partners as well as increasing economic resources for females. Interestingly, based on this research, it appears that females’ status gains have not resulted in the hypothesized reaction of males—lethal violence—suggesting that the growing equality of females to males in terms of income, education, and joblessness does not elicit retaliation by males in response to their diminished power and control over their female partners.</p>
<p>By doing so, this research adds to the knowledge of the decline in male-victim intimate partner homicide, but still leaves explanations behind the decline in female-victim intimate partner homicide unclear. Research needs to continue to examine gender-specific intimate partner homicide, but particularly female-victim intimate partner homicide. Surprisingly, neither economic deprivation and/or marginalization nor the status of females is associated with female-victim intimate partner homicide over time, whereas some of the predictors are associated with male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. It is extremely important to gain a better understanding of predictors of female-victim intimate partner homicide, given the fact that female-victim intimate partner homicide has not decreased as sharply as male-victim intimate partner homicide over time, despite the increase in domestic violence resources geared toward preventing violence against females. It is essential that more research examines female-victim intimate partner homicide over time to gain a more complete understanding of what is influencing the decline witnessed, as this may be the only way for us to see a larger decline in these types of homicides.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this research. First and foremost, the data used for the dependent variables are based on Supplemental Homicide Reports. The deficiencies of this database have been well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1557085111428445">Junger-Tas &amp; Marshall, 1999</xref>). In addition, data were limited to two time points (1990 and 2000). Although the 1990s witnessed drastic changes in intimate partner homicide victimization, changes in intimate partner homicide have been witnessed since 1976. It would be interesting to expand the data to include earlier data, thus documenting long-term shifts and changes in structural predictors, resources and programs available, and levels of intimate partner homicides. Furthermore, like many empirical studies, the ability to make causal inferences is limited. Issues with internal and external validity and unaccounted for extraneous variables makes us unable to draw absolute judgments about causal inferences. Also, there are issues in the generalizability of the results, in that our analyses include only urban cities with a population of 100,000 or more. Prior research has suggested differences in trends in rural and urban intimate partner homicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1557085111428445">Gallup-Black, 2005</xref>) as well as factors that influence the occurrence of intimate partner homicide, including the access to domestic violence services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1557085111428445">Tolman &amp; Bennett, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>Also, there are limitations in the measurement of some of the independent variables. First, it is acknowledged that actual usage of the domestic violence services was unable to be captured in cities. Just the fact that shelters, legal services, batterers counseling programs, and referrals are offered does not mean they are being used to the fullest by individuals in violent relationships. Furthermore, this does not mean that the community is aware of the services available. Also, the size of the domestic violence service programs (i.e., service capacity) was unable to be captured. If domestic violence services are not being used or if programs have limited capacity, domestic violence services would have a limited effect on intimate partner homicide. Second, there are limitations of the measure of economic deprivation given the dramatic reform in the welfare system during the 1990s, particularly with the passage of the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. Thus, it is difficult to determine if this measure is accurately capturing a decline in the deprivation of females or if the decrease in the percentage of females on public assistance is a result of new regulations causing females to leave welfare rolls. Researchers have suggested other measures of welfare provisions that may be better indicators of economic deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1557085111428445">Cumley &amp; Heimer, 2010</xref>), particularly, provisions from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). However, these measures are at the state level and were not available for our sample of cities. Another limitation of this measure is that it does not capture females who are not in the labor market and financially dependent on their abusive partner because of their partners’ wishes and demands not for them have a job outside of the home.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a number of factors that were not considered in this study that may have an influence on intimate partner homicides over time, particularly female-victim intimate partner homicide. Some of these possible factors include race and marital status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1557085111428445">Dugan et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1557085111428445">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1557085111428445">Rosenfeld, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1557085111428445">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1557085111428445">Wells &amp; DeLeon-Granados, 2004</xref>), prosecution rates and arrest rates for domestic violence, the availability of a coordinated community response toward domestic violence in cities, domestic violence policies and laws, and domestic violence prevention efforts. Further research should include these indicators as they are likely to be important considerations in the investigation of intimate partner violence.</p>
<p>In sum, although this study is not without limitation, we advance the study of the gendered nature of violence by investigating important changes over time and incorporating leading theoretical perspectives into the study of both male and female intimate partner violence. Consistent with exposure-reduction ideas, domesticity is related to male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. When exposure is not reduced between violent partners, the potential for intimate partner homicide increases. Also, consistent with arguments behind exposure reduction, the availability of domestic violence resources are related to male-victim intimate partner homicide, where nonviolent alternatives provide females with other options besides killing their partners in self-defense. Consistent with economic deprivation and marginalization arguments, changes in female economic deprivation and marginalization were associated with changes in male-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Less financial dependency that comes with improving economic conditions for females appears to result in less female-perpetrated intimate partner homicide, because there are more options to escape a violent relationship. These findings reaffirm results of past research on intimate partner homicide as well as homicide in general. Surprisingly, neither economic deprivation/marginalization nor the status of females in terms of income, education, or joblessness is associated with female-victim intimate partner homicide over time. Only additional research that investigates gender-specific intimate partner homicide, changes in gender-based processes, and the availability of services to domestic partners will tell us whether these conclusions are robust and whether they have important policy implications.</p>

<p>The average rate of intimate partner homicide across U.S. cities for both males and females for each of the 13 years was calculated. It should be noted that the spike witnessed in female-victim intimate partner homicide between 1992 and 1994 is inconsistent with U.S. National trends of intimate partner homicide.

<p>Negative binomial fixed-effects and random-effects regression models were estimated, due to the large number of zero counts and skewed distribution of the dependent variables. However, the model for the male-victim intimate partner homicide data would not allow for the estimation of the Hausman test because the data failed to meet the asymptotic assumptions of the Hausman test. The assumptions of the Hausman specification test are often hard to meet and can be easily violated if observations are clustered or pweighted or if the model is misspecified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1557085111428445">STATA, 2003</xref>).

Much of her recent work has incorporated longitudinal models to examine how changes in the local urban economy differentially influence race-specific homicide rates over time.</p>
