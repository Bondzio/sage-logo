<p>Elise Giuliano asks why mass support for ethnic nationalism emerged in some ethnic republics of the Russian Federation and not in others. Although many scholars have examined the rise of ethnic nationalism and separatism in Russian regions, most of them—with a few notable exceptions, including notably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012438848">Gorenburg (2003)</xref>—have focused on the strategic role of nationalist elites rather than the support bases of these movements.</p>
<p>Giuliano argues that mass support for ethnic nationalism emerged in Russia’s ethnic republics when ethnic entrepreneurs successfully framed the economic problems of the titular nationalities (e.g., Tatars in Tatarstan) in ethnic terms and offered sovereignty or independence as a solution to the unequal economic status of the titular nationalities vis-à-vis ethnic Russians. Giuliano makes two separate claims about the sources of successful nationalist mobilization. First, nationalist elites who promote only cultural issues are not likely to win many followers. This is an intriguing claim that some scholars of ethnicity and nationalism might find controversial. Second, mass support is likely to elude nationalist leaders who fail to connect the economic problems of ordinary citizens to the subordinate status of their group. Nationalist leaders must first correctly identify issues that resonate with their followers—namely, economic problems—and then explain to them how self-rule will solve them. Giuliano appears to be heeding the warning that Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012438848">Rothschild (1981)</xref> made three decades ago at the beginning of the “cultural turn” in the social sciences:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The contemporary fad of “everybody is an ethnic; we are all ethnics,” by implying a nonexistent equality, threatens to conceal the real nexus of power, status and wealth in society. Modern societies are generally characterized by several overlapping patterns of stratification and cleavage, and the proper task of social scientists is not to become preoccupied with only one such pattern but to explore and exhibit the interconnections between them. (p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In incorporating economic factors into her analysis, Giuliano avoids many of the pitfalls that have plagued scholars who have adopted a political economy approach to the study of ethnicity and nationalism. Some of these studies have been rightly criticized as deterministic and actorless, with blind economic forces doing much of the work. Giuliano’s language is generally probabilistic, reflecting the contingent nature of political outcomes. She points out the multiple instances where the presence of favorable economic conditions, in the absence of active framing by nationalist elites, did not lead to the development of mass support for nationalism. Giuliano also stresses the limits of ethnic framing. Elite framing strategies are effective to the extent that they resonate with the living conditions of ordinary individuals. Most studies of ethnic framing have assumed that politicians who frame economic or other problems as “ethnic” or “nationalist” will be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012438848">Hale, 2008</xref>, pp. 140-160; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012438848">Snyder &amp; Ballentine, 1996</xref>). Giuliano, however, does not mention any negative cases where elite framing, combined with ethnic stratification, fails to generate mass support for nationalism.</p>
<p>Support for the book’s arguments comes from multiple sources—from survey research and aggregate economic data to discourse analysis of the republican press. First, Giuliano measures the support for mass nationalism in Russia’s ethnic republics. Although previous scholars have used the timing of republican declarations of sovereignty as a proxy for the strength of titular nationalism, Giuliano incorporates additional factors including the number of ethnic demonstrations, incidents of interethnic violence, survey research on mass attitudes toward sovereignty, and case studies of nationalist movements in 16 ethnic republics. From these measures, she categorizes republics as having either high or low levels of nationalism.</p>
<p>Second, Giuliano analyzes aggregate demographic and economic data from Russia’s ethnic republics from 1926 to 1989 to document the presence of either interethnic competition—Russian and titular parity in white-collar jobs—or an economic division of labor—titular overrepresentation in lower status occupations. With the help of these data, she is able to gauge both the economic status of the titular nationalities in 1989 as well as changes in social mobility over time. Giuliano acknowledges the difficulty of using Soviet economic data to measure economic differences between ethnic groups. The “intellectual work” category included both highly placed professionals and office workers. As many titular nationals occupied desk jobs in government agencies, it is difficult to evaluate titular or Russian economic dominance from these statistics. The industrial workforce was also often disproportionately ethnic Russian in many republics. These blue-collar workers were paid more than most white-collar workers for ideological reasons. Soviet affirmative action policies, as Giuliano suggests, further blur issues of titular and Russian dominance. Russians living in ethnic republics were often resentful of these policies, including different standards for admission to higher education. Whatever its limitations, the index of socioeconomic stratification that Giuliano assembles provides a baseline for evaluating economic differences between the titular nationalities and ethnic Russians in the various ethnic republics. Disaggregated data from Tatarstan provide additional support.</p>
<p>With measures of nationalism and economic stratification compiled, Giuliano is able to select cases for her comparative analysis: high titular economic representation and high nationalism, Tatarstan; high titular economic representation and low nationalism, Komi; low titular economic representation and high nationalism, Tuva; and low titular economic representation and low nationalism, Mari El. The resulting case studies draw on hundreds of newspaper articles that Giuliano was able to collect from republican newspapers. She selected articles about the nationalist movement and coded the demands of nationalist leaders found in them. In high nationalist republics, Giuliano found ethnic framings of economic problems, whereas in low nationalist republics these were absent, whatever their level of economic stratification. The case studies showcase Giuliano’s extensive fieldwork and knowledge of local politics. With the exception of Tatarstan, these cases are not the usual suspects that one finds in studies of Russia’s regions.</p>
<p>Giuliano provides a compelling argument for why mass nationalism developed in some ethnic republics and not in others and supports it with original research. Left unanswered is an equally large and important question that relates to both Russia’s ethnic regions and most of the broader postcommunist world: Why did mass nationalism quickly fade in importance shortly after independence? This is perhaps an unfair criticism. Giuliano uncovered the reasons why mass nationalism emerged in some of Russia’s ethnic republics. We should not expect her to probe the factors that led to the withdrawal of public support for nationalism over time. The reasons for the decrease in support for mass nationalism, however, are arguably intrinsically linked to the causes for the development of mass nationalism. If nationalist framing of economic inequality was so effective in galvanizing support for titular nationalism, why did popular support for titular nationalism evaporate so quickly?</p>
<p>Giuliano pays surprisingly little attention to the collapse of the Soviet regime and the emergence of an independent Russia. This perhaps can be explained by the fact that she cuts off her analysis in 1994, which is fairly early in the post-Soviet period. Giuliano also studies Russian regions whereas I study former Soviet republics. Russia’s ethnic regions never left the Russian Federation. Nonetheless, I believe that the profound political and economic changes that were initiated in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse help to explain why titular nationalism lost its mass following. First, Russian democratization—despite its many shortcomings—produced increased political competition and greater opportunities for titular national rule. Titular nationalists, once elected, could share blame with leaders in Moscow for unfulfilled promises. Giuliano mentions political competition at the republican level as a possible explanation for the decreasing salience of nationalism. It is hard to judge this from her analysis because the political arena she lays out is mostly populated by nationalists. Frames other than nationalist frames are also largely absent from the discussion.</p>
<p>Second, the withdrawal of the state as provider of ethnically defined goods decreased interethnic competition. Most of the grievances that were raised by nationalists in Giuliano’s analysis of the republican press related to the Soviet economic system, including the allocation of food, jobs, and apartments by the state. With economic liberalization, the Russian state stopped providing these private goods and starting offering public bads, including rate hikes for utilities, bank failures, and an ever-shrinking safety net. Unlike the hard-to-find consumer goods from the socialist economy, the costs of market reform were generally believed to be shared across ethnic groups. I find that the notion of “shared pain” helps to account for the decreased salience of ethnic nationalism after independence in Latvia and Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012438848">Bloom, in press</xref>). It might also explain why mass nationalism in Russia’s ethnic republics lost steam so quickly after the Soviet collapse.</p>
<p>These criticisms aside, Giuliano has produced a study that will be required reading not only for specialists in Russian and post-Soviet politics but also for students of ethnicity and nationalism. She should be commended for the rigorous testing of her argument, the rich detail of her case studies, and the original research that underpinned all of these contributions.</p>
