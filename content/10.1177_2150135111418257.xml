<p>Brain injury remains an unfortunate source of morbidity associated with congenital heart surgery. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is used by many centers and may help to minimize neurologic injury and improve outcomes. In this report, our protocol for multimodality intraoperative neuromonitoring is described, and the relevant available evidence in the congenital heart surgery literature is critically reviewed.</p>

<title>Our Multimodality Neuromonitoring Protocol</title>
<p>Neuromonitoring during congenital heart surgery at our institution is performed using a combination of near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD), electroencephalography (EEG), and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs). Our protocol and treatment strategy is modeled on the management algorithm described by Austin and colleagues.<sup>

<sec id="section2-2150135111418257">
<title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
<p>The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure regional oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) in the cerebral cortex was first introduced into our practice approximately six years ago and continues to be a core component of our multimodality approach. A pediatric SomaSensor probe (Somanetics Corp, Troy, Michigan) is applied to the forehead of the patient and connected to the INVOS 5100B Cerebral Oximeter (Somanetics Corp). A baseline cerebral oximetry value is obtained immediately following intubation. Cerebral hypoperfusion may be suspected when the rSO<sub>2</sub> decreases more than 20% below baseline,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418257">1</xref>
</sup> a value which is empirically based on testing performed in adults,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111418257">2</xref>
</sup> with thresholds for children yet to be definitively established. The NIRS data are collected continuously during the operation. Trends in regional cerebral oxygen saturation are observed. The NIRS data are routinely available to the entire operating room team, and feedback about NIRS data is communicated with the surgeons, perfusionists, and anesthesiologists involved with the procedure. When a trend is observed that shows decreasing values, the surgical team may decide to increase the pump flow rate, evaluate cannula position, increase hematocrit, or modify anesthetic levels, among other interventions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150135111418257">
<title>Transcranial Doppler</title>
<p>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound monitoring provides surveillance of cerebral blood flow velocity and detection of cerebral embolic signals. The TCD was added to our monitoring regimen shortly after the implementation of NIRS data collection. The TCD probe is typically positioned and secured to the right temple of the patient. Transtemporal insonation of the right middle cerebral artery is performed using a TC8080 2-MHz pulsed-wave transducer (Pioneer, Madison, Wisconsin). Continuous M-mode and spectrogram recordings are acquired from intracerebral depths between 30 and 50 mm. Pre-incision baseline values are obtained for the pulsatility index, mean flow velocity, and high-intensity transient signals. These values are then recorded continuously, and any concerning changes from baseline are communicated to the surgical team. Additionally, a second Doppler probe is used to interrogate the arterial bypass line tubing. Comparisons of values obtained from the arterial bypass line and the middle cerebral artery allow for a more complete picture of global and cerebral perfusion and characterization of embolic sources. Interventions in response to decreased cerebral blood flow velocity may include repositioning of the arterial or venous cannulas or increasing the pump flow rate. Decreased cerebral blood flow velocity, as well as decreased cerebral oximetry and electroencephographic slowing, can also be seen in the setting of inadequate venous drainage of the superior vena cava due to cannula malposition or obstruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111418257">3</xref>
</sup> Interventions in response to embolic signals may include adjustment of the vacuum-assisted venous drainage, repositioning of the venous cannula, or further de-airing of the heart and pulmonary veins.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111418257">
<title>Electroencephalography</title>
<p>Our third standard monitoring component is the use of raw and processed EEG, which is monitored continuously with real-time neurologist oversight on the Cascade IONM system (Cadwell Laboratories, Inc, Kennewick, Washington). Subdermal electrodes are placed in the scalp by the neurophysiologist. Alternatively, some centers may prefer to use nonpenetrating cup electrodes applied with paste. A modified bipolar four-channel array is utilized for patients less than 24 months, while infants and children of at least two years of age receive a standard eight-channel bipolar array. Baseline EEG data following anesthesia induction typically include a combination of delta and theta waves, with delta waves predominating in infants and theta waves more often present in adolescents. Raw EEG is evaluated for signs of slowing relative to baseline data, and processed EEG is used to evaluate trends in the EEG waveforms. Electroencephalography slowing may signify an increased metabolic need that exceeds cortical perfusion, due to poor cortical blood flow, insufficient anesthetic, or other iatrogenic factors.</p>

<sec id="section5-2150135111418257">
<title>Somatosensory Evoked Potentials</title>
<p>The SSEPs monitor the deeper structures of the brain and provide a window into spinal cord function. The SSEP monitoring is routinely used in our practice for patients older than 24 months. Because SSEP monitoring relies on the conduction velocity of peripheral and central nervous tissue, it has limited efficacy at earlier ages due to incomplete myelination of nerves. The SSEPs monitor the upper and lower extremity dorsal columns and medial lemniscus pathways via peripheral nerve stimulation and central recordings. The median and posterior tibial nerves are stimulated via adherent surface electrodes at the wrist and ankle using the Cascade IONM system (Cadwell Laboratories) in accordance with published standards.<sup>

</sup> Needles are placed in the scalp following the international 10-20 system, and recording sites include the brain stem, dorsal column nuclei, thalamus, and primary sensory cortex on the postcentral gyrus. Pre-incision baseline values are obtained, and the surgical team is informed of deviations from the baseline following the standard alarm criteria, which consists of either a 10% latency delay or greater than 50% decrease in amplitude.<sup>

<title>Corrective Interventions</title>
<p>Simultaneous interpretation of the multimodal data is continuously provided by the neurophysiologist stationed in the operating room. Surveillance feedback regarding cerebral blood flow velocity, embolic signals in the head and arterial bypass tubing, and status of the EEG waveforms is communicated to the surgeon and team. Adverse or concerning parameters instigate attempts at corrective intervention as described. The influence of neuromonitoring on the rate of adverse neurologic events in our patient population is currently under review and will be the subject of a future report.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>A review of the literature regarding intraoperative neuromonitoring studies in pediatric cardiac surgery was performed. The PubMed database was searched for citations containing combinations of the following terms: neuromonitoring, near-infrared spectroscopy, transcranial Doppler, electroencephalography, somatosensory evoked potentials, pediatric, congenital, cardiac, heart, and surgery. References from these citations were examined for potential relevance and inclusion as well. Reports were categorized as NIRS, TCD, EEG, SSEP, or multimodality. Studies that did not include intraoperative neuromonitoring were excluded.</p>
<sec id="section8-2150135111418257">
<title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
<p>Among the monitoring tools, NIRS appears to be the most widely used, although its true clinical benefit remains the subject of ongoing controversy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111418257">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111418257">8</xref>
</sup> The widespread adoption of NIRS technology has inspired debate among authors regarding its utility. A pair of review articles in 2006 argued the competing sides of the NIRS controversy. In an exhaustive review and analysis, Hoffman<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111418257">9</xref>
</sup> made the case that NIRS monitoring should be used for all adult and pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass patients. According to the author, NIRS is a mature technology that has a proven track record of scientific validation and clinical reliability. As brain hypoxia remains a significant cause of neurologic injury, timely detection of alterations in the cerebral oxygen economy can provide the opportunity for goal-directed strategies to improve oxygen delivery. The efficacy of cerebral oximetry to detect adverse conditions in the brain has been well established through a number of laboratory and clinical studies. Although the data provided by NIRS are not a stand-alone diagnostic test for ischemic injury, it can be used to construct a more informed picture of the adequacy of regional perfusion of the brain. Similarly, clinicians do not expect a single blood pressure measurement or single arterial oxygen saturation to serve as a solitary tool in the assessment of a patientâs well-being. In the experience of Hoffman,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111418257">9</xref>
</sup> adoption of intraoperative NIRS technology, along with other programmatic changes, has paralleled and likely contributed to improvements in outcomes at their institution.</p>
<p>In contrast, Muehischlegel and Lobato<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111418257">10</xref>
</sup> countered that NIRS should not receive universal application for heart surgery. First, these authors called into question the validity of the NIRS data, stating that multiple studies have reported rSO<sub>2</sub> provided by NIRS to be inaccurate and unreliable, even citing examples of ânormalâ NIRS readings in deceased participants. Second, the interpretation of NIRS data was questioned. The value of a single NIRS data point has been commonly debunked, according to the authors, with even NIRS proponents admitting that the absolute numbers are of little value. Rather, proponents argue, the value of NIRS is in observing the trend of the saturation data. Nevertheless, the definition of what is âabnormalâ or concerning is neither well established nor supported by studies. Finally, even if NIRS data are correlated with conditions leading to neurologic injury, it remains to be conclusively proven that intervention based on these data can improve cognitive outcomes.</p>
<p>One recent comprehensive review concluded that NIRS use in pediatric cardiac surgery has not been associated with improved outcomes. Hirsch and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111418257">11</xref>
</sup> provided a systematic review of NIRS use within the congenital heart disease literature. The authors analyzed 54 articles dealing with the entire perioperative period, including 38 studies of NIRS use in the intraoperative setting. Of the studies employing intraoperative NIRS, three studies attempted to correlate NIRS findings with direct clinical outcomes, and two other studies provided for planned follow-up evaluation beyond hospital discharge. The manuscripts that included clinical outcomes are reexamined in this study. Since the publication of this review by Hirsch et al, several articles have evaluated intraoperative NIRS and clinical outcomes, and these studies are examined as well. Hirsch and coauthors concluded that there is no data to demonstrate that intraoperative decision making based solely on NIRS can contribute to improved outcomes.</p>
<p>In a 1995 study of children undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest for the repair or palliation of congenital heart disease, Kurth and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111418257">12</xref>
</sup> reported on the changes of cerebral oxygen saturation related to the time course of the operation. The authors found that the regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) increased during cooling on bypass, decreased during arrest, increased during rewarming, and then returned to preoperative baseline levels. They also found that the half-life of the cerebral oxygen saturation index was longest in neonates, intermediate in infants, and shortest in children. Regarding postoperative outcomes, the authors found that adverse neurologic outcomes (seizures and coma) were associated with a diminished increase of rSO<sub>2</sub> during cooling on bypass (3% vs 33%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and that these patients also had a shorter cooling time prior to circulatory arrest (mean of 8 minutes vs 11 minutes; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). The applicability of these findings may be limited due to the relatively short cooling times used during this era.</p>
<p>In a subgroup analysis of a larger series, McQuillen and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111418257">13</xref>
</sup> evaluated the relationship between intraoperative NIRS data and postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a small group of 16 neonates. They found that the mean cerebral oxygen index (a measure of percentage oxygen hemoglobin saturation) during the period of aortic clamping was lower in patients (n = 6) who developed new postoperative injury on MRI. This study is noteworthy as one of the few reports to correlate low intraoperative rSO<sub>2</sub> with postoperative brain injury. Nevertheless, this report is limited by the small size of the patient population.</p>
<p>Fenton and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111418257">14</xref>
</sup> reported on intraoperative cerebral oxygen saturations in a cohort of 34 infants and children undergoing staged palliation for single ventricle heart disease and in a control group of 12 neonates with ductal-dependent circulation undergoing biventricular repair. Evaluation of cerebral oximetry at multiple intraoperative time points revealed no relationship between cerebral oxygen saturations and postoperative central nervous system complications. However, regarding mortality, cerebral oxygen saturation at the conclusion of the operation was lower (38% vs 61%; <italic>P</italic> = .01) in infants who experienced early mortality.</p>
<p>Kussman and others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111418257">15</xref>
</sup> followed cerebral oxygen saturations for 104 infants undergoing biventricular repair. They found that cerebral oxygen saturation varied according to congenital heart disease diagnosis but was not correlated with early outcome. However, no patient in this study died or experienced clinical seizures, stroke, or choreoathetosis, thus, limiting the ability to detect an association between cerebral oxygen saturation and morbidity or mortality. Later, Kussman and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111418257">16</xref>
</sup> provided a follow-up report on the same patient population. Of the previous cohort of 104 infants, 89 returned for neurodevelopmental testing at one year of age. After adjustment for age at time of operation, cerebral oxygen saturation during the 60-minute period following cardiopulmonary bypass was found to be associated with decreased Psychomotor Development Index (<italic>P</italic> = .02) and the presence of brain hemosiderin on MRI (<italic>P</italic> = .04). No patient showed evidence of severe brain injury on MRI. The presence of small foci of hemosiderin accounted for the majority of acquired postoperative imaging findings and was not correlated with other developmental abnormalities. Additionally, cerebral oxygen saturations could not be correlated with the presence of focal stroke (n = 1) or periventricular leukomalacia (n = 2), likely due to the small number of these findings.</p>
<p>In an elegant study, Andropoulos and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111418257">17</xref>
</sup> evaluated 67 patients with brain MRI before and after the neonatal cardiac surgery using high-flow bypass, cerebral oxygen monitoring, and an algorithm for intervention. When cerebral oxygen saturations decreased below a threshold of 50% in the preoperative, intraoperative, or 72-hour postoperative periods, a management protocol was used to attempt to increase oxygen delivery to the brain. Postoperative white matter injury was seen in 16% of patients and was associated with single ventricle diagnosis, preoperative white matter injury, and low brain maturity score. However, postoperative MRI findings were not correlated with sustained cerebral desaturation (ie, total minutes of cerebral oxygen saturation less than 45%).</p>

<title>Transcranial Doppler</title>
<p>Although there is an abundance of literature regarding TCD and cerebral emboli in adult cardiac surgery, there are few such studies pertaining to the pediatric population. OâBrien and others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111418257">18</xref>
</sup> reported on a study using carotid artery Doppler monitoring for emboli detection in 25 children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. The occurrence of emboli was most pronounced following the release of the aortic clamp, presumably due to residual intracardiac or intrapulmonary air. Children with right-to-left shunts or mixing lesions had a significantly higher number of emboli before the initiation of bypass, presumably due to air entering the vascular system through intravenous catheters. However, there was no correlation appreciated between the number of emboli and postoperative neurologic outcomes.</p>
<p>Gazzolo and others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111418257">19</xref>
</sup> used TCD to monitor cerebral arterial pulsatility and vascular resistance during the perioperative period in children undergoing reconstructive cardiac surgery using deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. This study showed a correlation between increased cerebrovascular resistance and a biochemical marker of brain damage. The TCD findings were not used to guide intraoperative intervention, and postoperative neurologic outcomes were not assessed.</p>
<p>Dibardino and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111418257">20</xref>
</sup> provided a case report of an unusual anatomic diagnosis that was suggested by TCD monitoring. Following induction of anesthesia in a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a right-hand side TCD probe was placed and the retrograde flow was detected. Upon sternotomy, assessment of the anatomy revealed unsuspected aortic atresia with type B interrupted aortic arch. The anatomic variant mandated a change in surgical approach. Although it is predictable that the correct anatomy would have been ascertained without the aid of neuromonitoring, this case report may highlight the added corroborative value that neuromonitoring can provide.</p>
<p>Rogerson and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111418257">21</xref>
</sup> reported on the use of TCD as a method for monitoring the quality of flow during pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. These authors demonstrated that TCD can be used to assess the quality of the pulsatile perfusion delivered to the patient through measurement of the pulsatility index. However, this study did not attempt to examine TCD as a tool to guide intraoperative intervention and did not report on postoperative neurologic outcomes.</p>
<p>Several important reviews on the use of TCD in cardiac surgery have been published. In 1997, a panel of experts convened to evaluate the efficacy of TCD for the detection of microembolic material. In their report,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135111418257">22</xref>
</sup> the International Consensus Group on Microembolus Detection described their recommendations regarding this new technique. Along with issuing a number of technical guidelines for the use of TCD technology and reporting of TCD data, the authors offered the principal conclusion that no current system of automatic embolus detection provided the necessary sensitivity and specificity for clinical application. Nevertheless, the authors regarded TCD as a promising technique with the potential to guide therapeutic decisions.</p>
<p>In 2006, Polito and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135111418257">23</xref>
</sup> provided a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the role of TCD monitoring during pediatric cardiac surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. Using a systematic search of MEDLINE, the authors selected 23 articles for inclusion. The majority of articles reported on the use of TCD for evaluating cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass, with a special emphasis on the physiology of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and regional cerebral perfusion. Regarding the utility of TCD for detection of cerebral emboli, the authors included just one study<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111418257">18</xref>
</sup> that demonstrated that carotid artery emboli are commonly detected during pediatric cardiac surgery and that these embolic events are particularly prevalent following removal of the aortic cross clamp. When considering studies that focused on clinical outcomes, the authors included one study and one review article. The lone study, the widely cited work by Austin and colleagues,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418257">1</xref>
</sup> showed that intraoperative interventions based on the use of TCD as part of multimodal neuromonitoring strategy were associated with decreased adverse neurologic events and decreased length of hospital stay. The review by Andropoulos and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135111418257">24</xref>
</sup> summarized the literature to date and offered a modified multimodality neuromonitoring protocol. Thus, in this review, the data related to outcomes are quite limited. In conclusion, Polito and colleagues suggested that TCD has an essential role in multimodal neuromonitoring, and, based on one nonrandomized study, can significantly improve neurologic outcomes following congenital heart surgery.</p>
<p>The role of TCD in cardiac surgery was also examined in a 2010 joint statement<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150135111418257">25</xref>
</sup> from the American Society of Neurophysiologic Monitoring and American Society of Neuroimaging. Authored by Edmonds and others, these practice guidelines determined, based on clinical literature and scientific evidence, that TCD monitoring is an established modality for the assessment of cerebral perfusion and the detection of cerebral emboli. The authors offered that TCD has limitations as a monitoring tool, and consequently, that optimal monitoring should include other technologies, such as NIRS and EEG. Furthermore, the authors made no assertion that TCD or multimodal neuromonitoring during pediatric cardiac surgery has been proven to result in improved clinical outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section10-2150135111418257">
<title>Electroencephalography</title>
<p>Reports of EEG use have more often focused on pre- and postoperative studies rather than on intraoperative monitoring. The few reports of pediatric intraoperative EEG have not clearly shown a correlation between EEG findings and neurologic outcomes and have not evaluated EEG use as a guide to real-time corrective intervention. Miller and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150135111418257">26</xref>
</sup> prospectively studied intraoperative EEG changes during open heart surgery with deep hypothermia in 66 infants, most of whom were neonates. The EEG findings were compared with neurologic abnormalities before and after surgery, as well as with patient characteristics and operative variables. No relationship was appreciated between intraoperative EEG findings and neurologic outcomes. The authors concluded that EEG changes during open heart surgery were not useful predictors of early neurologic morbidity.</p>
<p>du Plessis and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150135111418257">27</xref>
</sup> reported on intraoperative EEG as part of a large randomized study of 182 infants, which compared alpha-stat versus pH-stat strategy for management of cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest. Preoperative and postoperative EEG monitoring were also performed. A number of clinical outcome variables were assessed, including neurologic outcomes. The principal EEG findings in this study were that cerebral electrical activity following circulatory arrest returned sooner in the patients managed with the pH-stat strategy (29 minutes vs 38 minutes; <italic>P</italic> = .03) and that the occurrence of postoperative seizures tended to be less in pH-stat patients (2% vs 9%; <italic>P</italic> = .11). No correlation was reported between intraoperative EEG findings and postoperative neurologic outcomes. Despite the important role of EEG monitoring within this study, EEG was only used as a surveillance tool and was not used to inform intraoperative management. Accordingly, the findings of this article cannot comment on the possible utility of EEG to provide guidance for operative interventions to improve neurologic outcome.</p>
<p>Schmitt and coauthors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150135111418257">28</xref>
</sup> reported on EEG surveillance for spindle activity in 36 children undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. They found that the EEG findings were related to patient age and temperature and correlated with the cooling and rewarming phases of the operation. However, EEG was not used as an intraoperative management tool, and no clinical outcomes were reported. In a subsequent article, Schmitt and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2150135111418257">29</xref>
</sup> reported on the postoperative EEG findings and neurologic outcomes for this same group of patients. These authors found that postoperative slowing of the EEG is common following pediatric heart surgery, but that this slowing is not associated with adverse neurologic outcomes. Rather, as briefly mentioned within the manuscript but not extensively discussed, the occurrence of a normothermic isoelectric EEG greater than 50 seconds in duration was associated with a neurologic deficit in all such children in this cohort. Unfortunately, the authors did not provide statistical analysis or further comment on this phenomenon, and even the number of affected children was not clearly described.</p>
<p>The utility of EEG for intraoperative neuromonitoring was recently evaluated in a position statement from the American Society of Neurophysiological Monitoring. Authored by Isley and others,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2150135111418257">30</xref>
</sup> this 2009 guideline offered the general conclusion that intraoperative EEG use may reduce morbidity and mortality in a variety of surgical procedures. Specifically regarding cardiac surgery, the authors cited several adult studies that reported decreased morbidity and hospital stay associated with EEG neuromonitoring. The EEG is effective, according to the authors, for optimizing the balance between cerebral oxygen supply and demand, and for maintenance of burst-suppression and isoelectric patterns during deep hypothermia. In the end, however, the authors concluded that EEG monitoring during cardiac surgery is a practice option, based on classes II and III level evidence, and offered a Type U recommendation rating (ie, no recommendation, based on divided expert opinion, or insufficient data). Additionally, no recommendations specific to pediatric or congenital cardiac surgery were made.</p>

<title>Somatosensory Evoked Potentials</title>
<p>Only a handful of studies have described the use of SSEPs in association with congenital heart surgery. Coles and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2150135111418257">31</xref>
</sup> reported on the results of intraoperative monitoring of SSEPs in nine infants undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest for the repair of congenital heart anomalies. These authors showed that decreasing systemic temperature caused the slowing of neural transmissions, as evidenced by latency prolongation of the cortical and spinal cord responses. The cortical evoked response disappeared with hypothermia below 18Â°C. With reperfusion and rewarming, the time to recovery of cortical evoked potentials was a function of the timeâtemperature integral of the arrest period and the pH at the onset of circulatory arrest. Although the study was not powered to draw conclusions about SSEP findings and clinical outcomes, one patient who developed seizures demonstrated a prolonged delay in SSEP recovery, perhaps indicative of global central nervous system injury. This study was also purely observational, with no adjustment in operative management as a consequence of SSEP findings.</p>
<p>Ghariani and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2150135111418257">32</xref>
</sup> included at least three children in their report on SSEPs and neurologic complications in primarily adult patients undergoing hypothermic circulatory arrest for aortic surgery. Two of these pediatric patients experienced neurologic complications. A four-year-old developed a flap effect during retrograde aortic perfusion which resulted in severe brain hypoperfusion and led to long-lasting postoperative epilepsy and choreoathetosis. A 14-year-old with complex congenital heart disease underwent heart transplantation and developed ventricular fibrillation before the onset of cardiopulmonary bypass. Cortical activity was seen to rapidly disappear in both hemispheres. Following hypothermic bypass and rewarming, cortical activity reappeared, but with asymmetry, and the patient experienced transient postoperative seizures. Overall, these authors concluded that intraoperative SSEP monitoring helps identify intraoperative events responsible for neurological complications and may help prevent such complications in subsequent procedures. Nevertheless, SSEP monitoring to guide intraoperative management during pediatric cardiac surgery has only been described in rare reports with few patients.</p>

<title>Multimodality Neuromonitoring</title>
<p>The landmark study from Austin and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418257">1</xref>
</sup> was unique in that intraoperative NIRS monitoring led to corrective intervention aimed at increasing cerebral oxygen delivery. In this review of 250 patients, these authors found that interventions based on multimodality neuromonitoring were associated with decreased adverse neurologic events and decreased hospital stay. To date, this article stands alone as the key study demonstrating an improvement in outcome for pediatric cardiac surgery patients as a result of a neuromonitoring protocol and intervention algorithm. Although this sentinel report likely encouraged the practice of neuromonitoring for pediatric cardiac surgery, this study has not been repeated, and a randomized trial may be unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>Yeh and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2150135111418257">33</xref>
</sup> described the diagnostic advantage provided by multimodality neuromonitoring in a case of unsuspected cerebral air embolism. During a congenital heart operation managed with fibrillatory arrest, occult air embolism was detected by TCD, followed shortly by a precipitous decline in cerebral oximetry and the appearance of EEG changes. A series of therapeutic neuroprotective maneuvers were rapidly performed to treat the cerebral air embolism. Following restitution of antegrade perfusion, return of normal neuromonitoring parameters was evidenced, and the patient awoke from surgery with a normal neurologic examination and demonstrated an uneventful recovery. The authors concluded that this case illustrates the vital role played by multimodality neuromonitoring in injury prevention.</p>
<p>In an investigation of the safety of regional cerebral perfusion for aortic arch surgery in 15 infants, Kwak and others<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2150135111418257">34</xref>
</sup> used both TCD and NIRS to provide intraoperative surveillance for the quality of cerebral perfusion. These authors employed neuromonitoring with the purpose of assessing the adequacy of cerebral perfusion and intended to transition to usual circulatory arrest if adverse parameters were observed. They found no significant differences in cerebral oximetry between the pre-regional and regional perfusion periods, and no significant differences in cerebral oximetry between the right and left hemispheres. Additionally, there were no differences appreciated between pre- and postoperative EEG and brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. There were no deaths, and no adverse neurologic outcomes. Based on intraoperative neuromonitoring and favorable outcomes, the authors concluded that regional cerebral perfusion is a safe strategy.</p>
<p>Transfusion of red blood cells is among the several proposed interventions for perceived inadequate cerebral oxygen delivery based on neuromonitoring. Kimatian and colleagues<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2150135111418257">35</xref>
</sup> reported on the influence of the institution of a multimodality neuromonitoring strategy on transfusion rates at their institution. By comparing patient cohorts from time periods before and after the implementation of neuromonitoring, these authors found a significant increase in the amount of blood use at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (ie, prime blood) as well as hematocrit levels at the conclusion of bypass prior to modified ultrafiltration. Given the significant increase in the transfusion rate at the beginning of cardiopulmonary support, it is not unexpected that patients would experience an increase in final hematocrit at the end of bypass. Thus, the increased rate of transfusion may potentially be explained by a simple increase in the targeted hematocrit at the initiation of bypass and perhaps not due to more frequent transfusions during bypass in response to adverse cerebral oxygenation. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge that this era effect may be attributable to coincident literature regarding the benefits of a higher hematocrit on bypass. Finally, these authors did not report any clinical or neurologic outcomes associated with the implementation of this neuromonitoring strategy.</p>

<title>Future studies</title>
<p>The difficulty with performing a definitive prospective trial to prove the utility of neuromonitoring has been described previously. Proponents of these technologies have come to view neuromonitoring as an established standard of care. Therefore, supporters of neuromonitoring are unlikely to participate in a randomized trial, believing that it would be unethical to assign a cohort of their patients to the âno neuromonitoringâ control group. On the other hand, centers that do not use neuromonitoring may not be interested in conducting such a trial and may not provide the best proving ground. As with other technologies and processes, there is an associated learning curve, and centers that have no experience with multimodality monitoring may not provide an accurate assessment of its potential benefit if the trial is conducted in the absence of previous experience. Furthermore, such centers may view the addition of neuromonitoring as burdensome or as a disruption to the usual routine. Thus, the optimal setting for such a trial may be a program that has both neuromonitoring experience and a measure of equipoise regarding its benefit or lack of benefit.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Near-infrared spectroscopy is the most widely applied neuromonitoring modality. Many studies have aimed to correlate NIRS data with other markers of cerebral or systemic perfusion. There is some evidence that perioperative episodes of decreased cerebral oximetry are associated with brain abnormalities on MRI and decreased neurodevelopmental scores. Additionally, decreased cerebral oximetry may be associated with other adverse outcomes such as the need for postoperative mechanical circulatory support or the incidence of death. In regard to intraoperative interventions based on NIRS, there have been no studies to date demonstrating that intraoperative management guided solely by NIRS is associated with improved outcomes. The TCD, EEG, and SSEP are less commonly applied modalities for intraoperative neuromonitoring during pediatric cardiac surgery, and consequently there is a paucity of descriptive studies. Moreover, there are no studies that have shown that intraoperative management guided by TCD or EEG can result in improved outcomes. On the other hand, although the data in favor of multimodality neuromonitoring is clearly limited, some of the available evidence is arguably compelling. In the largest such study to date,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418257">1</xref>
</sup> intervention based on a combination of NIRS, TCD, and EEG appeared to rescue a portion of patients from potentially adverse neurologic outcomes, returning the rate of associated morbidity back to the baseline.</p>

<sec id="section16-2150135111418257">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The evidence supporting intraoperative neuromonitoring is primarily limited to one sentinel study. Although additional positive findings are available in the adult literature, it may not be appropriate to attempt to extrapolate these results to the pediatric population. Many authors advocate for neuromonitoring during pediatric cardiac surgery in order to detect and treat adverse conditions in real time, with the goal of improving neurologic outcomes. On the other hand, many centers do not use intraoperative neuromonitoring, and yet continue to report excellent neurologic and clinical outcomes. Given the low rate of adverse neurologic events, conclusive proof of the benefit of neuromonitoring may be difficult to demonstrate. Further clinical outcomes research is needed to assess the utility and cost-effectiveness of intraoperative neuromonitoring for pediatric heart surgery.</p>
