<abstract>
<p>A study of news media and strategic communication majors (<italic>n</italic> = 273) revealed differences in regard to personality indices and impetuses for selecting to pursue degrees. Showing overall agreement in the importance of openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, strategic communication students were significantly higher in their ratings of agreeableness. News media students were significantly higher in their ratings of openness. In addition, news media students stated a significantly higher rating of the importance of altruistic purposes. Strategic communication students placed higher emphasis on financial gain. Implications for pedagogy and the profession are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that news media (print, broadcast, and visual journalism) and strategic communication (advertising and public relations) students have distinct motivations and personalities. Mass communication educators have observed anecdotally that news media students differ from strategic communication students. Some of these observations match stereotypical assumptions—that strategic communication students are “people-people,” business students who couldn’t do math, or for-profit artists; news media students are either nitpicking perfectionists or motivated by fame and celebrity. Like most stereotypes, these preconceptions fail to capture the nuances and positive qualities of people entering the field, but they do point to an issue of increasing relevance to mass communication educators. However, despite the growing popularity of mass communication at the undergraduate level, little research has explored the possible influences on students’ choice of news media and strategic communication related majors.</p>
<p>Personality affects how and what people learn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077695813478180">1</xref></sup> At the most basic level, the present study attempts to establish whether the conventional wisdom—that students majoring in news media and strategic communication have different personality types—is correct and, if so, what the implications for mass communication education might be.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of mass communication majors, little research has investigated the possible influences on the choice to study strategic communication or news media. In 2011, 218,751 undergraduate students were enrolled in journalism, telecommunications, advertising, or public relations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1077695813478180">2</xref></sup> Also, for the past ten years, roughly 64 percent of mass communication majors have been female.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1077695813478180">3</xref></sup> Because of the increasing popularity of the major, a number of questions are relevant for understanding the composition of the mass communication student population. What personality traits characterize students deciding to study news media or strategic communication? What influences a student to choose to major in mass communication? In this study, news media and strategic communication majors were surveyed regarding personality characteristics and self-reported influences on their choice of major.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077695813478180">
<title>Personality Types and Major Choice</title>
<p>Many studies in other disciplines have established relationships between personality types and career choices. The beginnings of this area of scholarship are often credited to John Holland, whose early qualitative theory development led to a series of quantitative studies linking vocational inventories with various personality scales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1077695813478180">4</xref></sup> Hogan and Blake described a lack of agreement in personality literature over the years, but suggested that the five factor model, used in the present study, was adequate as a taxonomy for identifying personality variables in connection with vocational choice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1077695813478180">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although previous research has not compared personality constructs across the various areas within mass communication, a small number of studies have touched on the personality traits of students or practitioners in a few subfields. For instance, Taylor’s study of undergraduate application essays found that students pursing advertising enjoyed creativity and expressing ideas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1077695813478180">6</xref></sup> Another study that explored personality traits among people working in news media found that most journalists scored high in extroversion and that early success in journalism was positively related to extroversion and negatively related to neuroticism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1077695813478180">7</xref></sup> Using the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator personality scale, Svaldi found that journalism students and instructors were more intuitive than the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1077695813478180">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The five factor model, often referred to as the Big Five, describes the five basic dimensions of personality and is the most widely used personality model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1077695813478180">9</xref></sup> Debate about the prevalence of core personality characteristics has driven scholars to test and retest hypotheses in an attempt to validate the Big Five empirically. Through this debate additional characteristics have been proposed but have not been found to be salient through repetitive sampling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1077695813478180">10</xref></sup> The Big Five framework identifies five basic personality factors: agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, extraversion, and openness to experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1077695813478180">11</xref></sup> The framework’s assumption is that the factors remain over time and across situations and that the factors predispose people to act in particular ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1077695813478180">12</xref></sup> In addition, McCrae and John found that the Big Five holds true when everyday language descriptors are compared to theoretical models to assess personality traits. Furthermore, these five factors are identifiable across cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1077695813478180">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Costa and McCrae, openness to experience refers to personality traits such as an active imagination, aesthetic appreciation, intellectual curiosity, and a preference for variety. Conscientiousness refers to characteristics such responsibility and self-control. Agreeableness refers to characteristics such as friendliness and cooperativeness. Extraversion refers to characteristics such as being sociable and enjoying interactions with a wide variety of people. Finally, neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1077695813478180">14</xref></sup> See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077695813478180">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>A nearly unanimous consensus has emerged that all normal personality characteristics can be parsimoniously described by the five broad traits, as identified by the Big Five, and has been replicated across a wide range of settings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1077695813478180">15</xref></sup> The Big Five model has been effective at measuring relationships between personality and academic success,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1077695813478180">16</xref></sup> job performance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1077695813478180">17</xref></sup> and the relationship among personality, leisure interests, and mood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1077695813478180">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Big Five Inventory (BFI) was created in the 1980s by John, Donahue, and Kentle to be a shortened instrument to measure the five factor model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1077695813478180">19</xref></sup> Research participants can complete the BFI in approximately five minutes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1077695813478180">20</xref></sup> The BFI is a forty-four-item Likert-type questionnaire that measures the personality traits of openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.

<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Although the study of vocational interests has been an important research area within the fields of career counseling, vocational psychology,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1077695813478180">25</xref></sup> and career selection,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1077695813478180">26</xref></sup> less research has centered on the influences of various factors on college students’ choices of major. To the authors’ knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the potential relevance of the five factor model for students who choose to major in mass communication. Literature from other fields suggests that such a relationship exists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1077695813478180">27</xref></sup> Therefore, this study used the BFI to explore the relationship between personality and major choice among mass communication students choosing to study news media or strategic communication. Thus, the present study began with the following broad areas of inquiry:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>After institutional review board approval was received from the universities where data were to be collected, participants accessed the study’s informed consent and a seventy-three-item web-based survey via an email link. The web-based survey contained items that related to students’ motivations for studying mass communication and the shortened forty-four-item BFI survey. Given the limited amount of time that students are willing to commit to surveys, it seemed that students might have responded carelessly to a longer instrument and that a more time-consuming instrument could lower the response rate. Therefore, the shorter BFI instrument would yield better results.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1077695813478180">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>The survey took approximately ten to fifteen minutes to complete. A purposive sample was collected from junior- and senior-level students enrolled in journalism and strategic communication courses at three major Midwestern state universities. Upper-division mass communication classes were surveyed to help ensure that the participants were well established in their respective majors. Because large lower-level lecture sections were avoided, the sample from the three universities was relatively small but still sufficient for the exploratory purpose of the study. The online survey was hosted by the web-based tool SurveyMonkey to ensure that participant responses were protected though encryption and a third-party location. Results from the survey were downloaded from the survey collector and stored on a password-protected computer. Students received extra credit for participating in the survey.</p>
<p>Participants completed scales measuring their interest in journalism and strategic communication as a major, their area of interest, the impetus behind their decision to major in this field, and their personality traits. The five variables used to assess personality type were taken from the BFI.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1077695813478180">29</xref></sup> Questions were added to investigate specific motivations that the students might have for studying mass communication. Some of these motivations included income, parental or mentor involvement, interest in the field of mass communication, First Amendment rights, and preparation for a professional career or graduate study. All items were cast on a 1 to 7 Likert-type scale in which higher scores indicated higher levels of agreement on each item. In addition, students were asked to provide several demographic items, including age, year in school, major, specific media concentration (e.g., public relations), and number of media-related extracurricular activities they participated in.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077695813478180" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 334 participants responded to the survey. Cases in which less than half of the survey was completed were eliminated from the data set. In addition, participants indicating their major was not journalism or strategic communication and those who were undecided were eliminated from the data set to maintain the purposive sampling frame. Missing data were replaced using mean substitution. No more than 5 percent of any one variable or 10 percent of any one case was replaced in this fashion. On completion of data cleaning, we were left with 316 usable cases.</p>
<sec id="section5-1077695813478180">
<title>Descriptive Statistics and the BFI</title>
<p>Results indicated a strong sex imbalance, with women outnumbering men by more than a two to one ratio (men = 94, women = 222), which mimics the sex composition of the program enrollment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1077695813478180">30</xref></sup> We had a good mix of students across the scholastic spectrum, with print journalism holding the greatest number of majors (<italic>n</italic> = 116), followed by advertising or public relations majors (<italic>n</italic> = 97), broadcast majors (<italic>n</italic> = 88), several undecided students (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and those outside the field of journalism (<italic>n</italic> = 33). As stated previously, undecided and nonjournalism majors were eliminated, leaving a total of 273 cases to analyze.</p>
<p>Prior to analyzing the data, reliability analysis was conducted to identify the degree to which the scale items measured each personality construct. For this study, the scales maintained a high level of reliability for extroversion (alpha = .86), agreeableness (alpha = .75), conscientiousness (alpha = .79), neuroticism (alpha = .80), and openness (alpha = .80). Once reliability of the scales was established, five personality variables were created by summing the scores for all of the items and dividing by the number of scale items.</p>
<p>Research question 1 asked how mass communication majors would rate themselves in terms of the Big Five personality constructs. We conducted a simple mean score examination, keeping the variables on the same 1 to 7 scales used for each item, in which higher scores indicated greater agreement that the items in each variable fit the participant’s personality. The data revealed the highest scores on the agreeableness (<italic>M</italic> = 5.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81), openness (<italic>M</italic> = 5.12, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.80), and conscientiousness (<italic>M</italic> = 5.01, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81) variables. Extraversion (<italic>M</italic> = 4.92, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.99) was slightly lower, with the neurotic variable (<italic>M</italic> = 3.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.94) being substantially lower. Further analysis using a MANOVA and Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test indicated that a significant difference existed between news media students’ level of openness (<italic>M</italic> = 5.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and strategic communication students’ level of openness (<italic>M</italic> = 4.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Despite the remaining personality variables not being statistically different, means and standard deviations of the personality variables demonstrated differences between news media and strategic communication students.

<title>Comparison of Majors</title>
<p>Prior to our data examinations, we conducted a bivariate correlation matrix to assess the degree to which any demographic variables covaried with the Big Five variables. We found that sex and year in school correlated significantly with several of the variables. Thus, we retained these items for our future analyses.</p>
<p>For further analysis, the data set was split based on the two key areas of mass communication: news and strategic communication. We used the students’ responses to their major area (e.g., broadcast) and their area of emphasis (e.g., sports journalism) to recode the data into a dichotomous variable representing these two areas. This allowed us to better compare these students based on their primary area of interest and study.</p>
<p>Because of the unequal number of participants from each major, the data were analyzed to make sure homogeneity of variance was not an issue. Histograms were created to analyze the data for a normal distribution. Levene’s test for equality of variances was used to check the assumption of equal variances and was nonsignificant (<italic>F</italic> = 0.022, <italic>p</italic> = .88). Levene’s test ensures that the main assumption of equal variances within the data was not violated. Levene’s test is interpreted by examining the data for small <italic>F</italic> values and <italic>p</italic> values that are not below the .05 alpha level, which indicates that the assumption is not violated.</p>
<p>Research question 2 asked if news media students significantly differ from strategic communication students in terms of their Big Five personality constructs. We conducted a MANCOVA analysis of this data, as our correlation matrix revealed strong correlations among multiple personality types. The MANCOVA allowed for the assessment of the variables of interest while preventing the inflation of the region of significance, thus minimizing the chance of Type I error and increasing the statistical power of the test.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1077695813478180">31</xref></sup> The Big Five variables served as the dependent variables, with the major type serving as the independent variable. We retained sex and year in school as covariates.</p>
<p>The MANCOVA returned a significant result (Wilks’s lambda = 2.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) for the personality variable openness. Analysis of an individual ANCOVA confirmed that a significant difference existed between news media and strategic communication students in regard to the openness variable (<italic>F</italic> = 7.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), with the news students rating significantly higher than the strategic communication students. No other variable revealed any significant differences in personality factors and major choice.</p>
<p>Research question 3 asked what factors had the greatest sway over students in why they chose to major in a field of mass communication. Of the 25 items we used to identify potential influences, the overall data analysis revealed the students saw importance in the field itself as a primary factor in their decision. The five items that students agreed were most influential were the importance of the First Amendment (<italic>M</italic> = 6.16), their own level of intellectual acumen (<italic>M</italic> = 5.84), the importance of journalism as a field (<italic>M</italic> = 5.81), that the journalism field will allow them to make a difference (<italic>M</italic> = 5.78), and the feeling that journalism was a good field to enter (<italic>M</italic> = 5.93). The bottom five items were the influence of a family member such as an aunt or uncle (<italic>M</italic> = 2.54), parental influence (<italic>M</italic> = 2.84), the influence of friends (<italic>M</italic> = 2.96), the influence of a teacher (<italic>M</italic> = 3.19), and the sense that they want to become famous (<italic>M</italic> = 3.40).</p>
<p>In separating the groups based on their area of interest in news media or strategic communication, we found that the bottom five remained unchanged. For the top five, the two groups both placed the First Amendment as the most influential choice. However, news media students (<italic>M</italic> = 6.31) rated this factor as more influential than strategic communication students (<italic>M</italic> = 6.00). Other variables that were in the top five influential factors for both majors were the feeling that journalism was a good field and participants’ belief in their own intelligence. Strategic communication students rated their desire to learn higher than news media students, who in turn rated the importance of the field higher than strategic communication students.</p>
<p>Research question 4 asked if news media students significantly differ from strategic communication students in terms of their motivation for majoring in mass communication. To answer this question, we conducted a factor analysis to create clusters of items geared toward similar concepts. While we did not plan to combine these items, this would allow us to better examine subsets of items through the use of MANCOVAs. Once we removed cross-loading items, a principal axis factor solution with a varimax rotation revealed five primary factors: social responsibilities (the value of the First Amendment, the promotion of ethics within the field, the importance of the field, making a difference in the lives of others, and a thirst for knowledge), enjoyment of the field (like to learn, like mass communication as a field, like classes in journalism, and a sense that journalism could be fun), ego-based rationale (the glamorousness of the field, one’s own attractiveness rating, the desire for fame, and the importance of making money), the influence of others (family, parents, friends, and teachers), and the desire to take the next step within the field (job or grad school). We used these factor clusters as the dependent variables to conduct MANCOVAs, again retaining sex and year in school as covariates and major (news media or strategic communication) as the independent variable.</p>
<p>In the social responsibilities cluster, the MANCOVA was significant (Wilks’s lambda = 4.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and thus we examined the individual ANCOVAs. All factors revealed significant differences: the importance of the First Amendment (<italic>F</italic> = 5.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the promotion of ethics (<italic>F</italic> = 14.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the importance of journalism as a field (<italic>F</italic> = 13.56, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), the desire to make a difference (<italic>F</italic> = 9.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and their individual thirst for knowledge (<italic>F</italic> = 5.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Overall, the news media students reported significantly higher levels of importance on all social responsibility items than did the strategic communication students.</p>
<p>In the enjoyment of the field cluster, the MANCOVA was again significant (Wilks’s lambda = 2.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) with several contributory ANCOVAs. Students’ ratings of their enjoyment of learning (<italic>F</italic> = 4.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), the enjoyment of mass communication as a field (<italic>F</italic> = 8.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), the sense that journalism is fun (<italic>F</italic> = 5.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and that journalism is a good field (<italic>F</italic> = 5.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) were all significant, with news students being significantly higher than the strategic communication students. No significant differences were found between the two groups in regard to their enjoyment of their coursework (<italic>F</italic> = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>In the ego-based cluster, the MANCOVA was again significant (Wilks’s lambda = 4.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The ANCOVAs identified only one statistically significant factor, which was that strategic communication students believe the field is one where they will make a good salary (<italic>F</italic> = 7.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, it is noteworthy that getting rich was marginally significant (<italic>F</italic> = 2.61, <italic>p</italic> = .108). The ego-based factors of attractiveness and fame were not significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mass communication scholars have explored various subjects such as teaching ethics to journalism, public relations, and advertising students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1077695813478180">32</xref></sup> technology and mass communication education,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1077695813478180">33</xref></sup> and mass communication curriculum or course content.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1077695813478180">34</xref></sup> However, research has not explored mass communication students’ motivations and personality factors that influence their decision to study mass communication. In spite of the stereotypes that exist regarding the differences of personality between strategic communication and news media oriented majors, the students in the two areas were more similar than dissimilar. Therefore, the many stereotypes believed to be true of individuals within the areas of mass communication might not be related to individual personalities. Another possibility worth exploring is that personality traits stereotypically associated with mass communication professionals are actually the product of their experience in the field, developed after graduation. Moreover, it could be that personality differences of mass communication faculty plant the seeds of influence that later show up as differences between media professionals. These possibilities are worthy of further study.</p>
<p>Although fewer differences were found than expected, the study uncovered some surprising results. For instance, strategic communication students scored significantly lower on the openness to experience variable. Advertising students are thought to be interested in creativity, which would make them seem open to experience. Students with a news media focus scored lower in agreeableness; perhaps this dissimilarity stems from the differences in emphasis between the two areas. Possibly, these distinctions attract students with different personality orientations. The areas within strategic communication, public relations, and advertising relate more to satisfying interested parties such as the public, clients, and others. Therefore, agreeableness is an important trait in these fields. However, a career in news media focuses more on informing the public and increasing awareness than pleasing interested parties.</p>
<p>Although this research only found a couple of key personality differences, the survey did find some important differences in motivational factors. Students studying news media area rated significantly higher in the area of liking mass communication than students studying strategic communication. News media students were marginally higher in liking learning than strategic communication students.</p>
<p>The results seemed to confirm the notion that students studying the journalism and editorial area of mass communication are more motivated by a sense of altruism, whereas students who study strategic communication are motivated by profits. Strategic communication students were significantly higher in stating their desire to be rich, and news media students were significantly higher in terms of wanting to make a difference in the world, feelings about the general importance of mass communication as a field, and the belief in the importance of the First Amendment. News media students also valued ethical behavior more than the strategic communication students. However, the research found no differences in terms of their influences (family, friends, etc.) in selecting their major.</p>
<p>Understanding students’ motivations and personalities can foster better relations between instructors and students by providing instructors with a clearer view of what factors motivated their choice of a mass communication major. A student’s relationship with his or her instructor influences learning outcomes. Bloom, Englehart, Furst, Hill, and Krathwohl identified affective learning as an important emotional component of education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1077695813478180">35</xref></sup> According to McCroskey, affective learning results from a student’s attitude toward the (1) instructor, (2) course content, (3) the desire to take additional classes in the subject, and (4) the taking of additional coursework with the instructor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1077695813478180">36</xref></sup> Research on student evaluation of instruction indicates that student learning and evaluation of teaching increase when instructors make an emotional connection with their students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1077695813478180">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sharing common traits with one’s cohort contributes to a sense of community within a classroom or a major. According to John Dewey, a sense of community in an educational environment is essential to fostering students’ skills and interest, collaborative decision making, and the commitment to democratic values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1077695813478180">38</xref></sup> News media and strategic communication students engage in group activities while completing their educations. Students collaborate on advertising and public relations campaigns, write for the student newspaper, and work at campus broadcast stations. Student retention and satisfaction could be increased when faculty direct students to the areas of mass communication that match their individual motivations and validate the similarities that exist among mass communication students.</p>
<p>Another application of this research could be curriculum design. Students enroll in courses and a major with a set of expectations. Research indicates that when a class violates students’ expectations, students lose motivation and may react badly to the instructor. Understanding students’ motivations can help instructors tailor their classes to meet expectations, or if the expectations are incorrect or unreasonable, the instructor can adjust the students’ expectations earlier in their academic careers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1077695813478180">39</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-1077695813478180">
<title>Implications for Future Research</title>
<p>This study was exploratory in nature and could pave the way for future inquiry into mass communication students’ motivations and how personality influences academic and employment success. Future research could compare personality traits of university faculty members to their students to see what similarities and differences exist. The results may be particularly insightful in continuing to research and identify what personality traits in students and professors contribute to academic success for mass communication majors and faculty. Likewise, future studies could compare mass communication students with students in other majors to pinpoint characteristics that are specific to mass communication majors. It would also be advantageous to investigate if specific personality types are more successful than others within the mass communication profession.</p>
<p>Some factors limit the present study’s results. A convenience sample took the survey, which calls into question the degree to which the results can be generalized. The influence of cultural heritage on student perspectives might be worthy of exploration, as well as factors such as family income, work experience, religion, and academic performance.</p>
<p>Results from this study demonstrate that more similarities than differences in personality exist between news media and strategic communication students. Differences between these groups are more identifiable through their academic and career motivation. Implications of these results may be that instructors teaching in mass communication may better understand what motivates their students and how these motivations can help inform their pedagogy.</p>
