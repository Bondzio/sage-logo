<title>Leading Change: The Research Imperative</title>
<p>In its data-driven, landmark study, <italic>The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health</italic>, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified evidence-based nursing and nursing leadership as integral for the reinvention and reinvigoration of health care in the United States (Institute of Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800412439746">[IOM], 2011</xref>). In this report, the IOM advanced recommendations relative to practice, policy, and education designed to bring about sweeping and sustainable improvements to our nation’s health care system. As importantly, the IOM report demonstrated that both scientific research and its translation are central to our national efforts to improve health care. Nursing science, the report states, “is key to providing better patient care, improving health, and evaluating outcomes … Nurse scientists are a critical link in the discovery and translation of knowledge … To carry out this crucial work, a sustainable supply of and support for nurse scientists will be necessary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800412439746">IOM, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Scientific research has always been one of the main engines driving broad-based, innovative, and sustainable improvements in our health care system. In its capacity as the primary funder for nursing science in the United States, the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) is a principal player in clinical research and research translation. Research funded by the NINR has provided the evidence base for progressive clinical and community-based health care and health care policy for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1099800412439746">Hinshaw &amp; Grady, 2011</xref>). The authors of the IOM report cited research by NINR-funded scientists heavily, including studies addressing health care delivery and coordination, delineation of work force capacity and scope of practice issues and solutions, and person-centered, community-, and family-based health promotion and disease prevention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1099800412439746">IOM, 2011</xref>). NINR, in conjunction with colleagues across the nursing science community, will continue to lead the charge for system-wide health care improvements and to lay the scientific groundwork essential for national initiatives that support these improvements such as the National Prevention and Health Promotion Strategy, Partnership for Patients, and Healthy People 2020.</p>

<title>Advancing Health: Working Together</title>
<p>The central role of nursing and nursing science in health care is truly “an idea whose time has come.” As a scientific community, we must step up and embrace the challenges and opportunities of this renaissance in health care. In addition to conducting our research and expanding and deepening our collaborations with scientific colleagues from other disciplines, we must move in parallel to fully integrate ourselves into the practice, policy, and education communities that span biomedicine and the allied health fields.</p>
<p>A seminal initiative in this context is the Future of Nursing: <italic>Campaign for Action</italic> (CFA; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1099800412439746">[RWJF], 2011</xref>). This initiative is spurring the creation of broad-based regional partnerships—action coalitions—across the nation and is bringing synthesis and synergy to the health care community. The overall success of the CFA, and similar initiatives, will depend on the various components of the health care ecosystem working in concert—scientific research; clinical and community practice; education, training, and workforce development; and health policy and public legislation.</p>
<p>A crucial element of the CFA initiative is its Research Agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1099800412439746">RWJF, 2010</xref>), designed to expand the evidence base for health care and to underpin fundamental and transformative improvements in our clinical and community-based health systems. Through its Research Agenda, the CFA has encouraged junior researchers to submit proposals and has used a flexible review process staffed by experts in nursing science. In doing so, the CFA has sought to address some of the long-standing challenges facing nurse scientists in the United States. The science the CFA funds promises to complement existing research programs and to inform and guide the implementation of the IOM recommendations as we move forward.</p>
<p>NINR is committed to working ever more closely with colleagues in the private as well as public sectors on initiatives like the CFA. The Institute recognizes that such initiatives allow us to come together to refine and implement a more strategically comprehensive and innovative national scientific framework that can enhance our ability to address our most critical health and health care needs and challenges.</p>

<title>The Future of Nursing and Nursing Science</title>
<p>Disruptive innovation (DI) and continual process improvement (CPI) are intrinsic components of nursing and nursing science. Moving forward, nurses will continue to apply these principles to simplify complex technologies, reduce their costs, and increase their accessibility as well as place point-of-care technologies into the hands of frontline practitioners. Similarly, DI and CPI will enable us to catalyze and accelerate process improvements in the lab, clinic, community, classroom, and boardroom. Key areas for process improvement highlighted by the IOM report and the CFA initiative include training, education, and interprofessional collaboration. Process improvements in these areas may entail DI in our education and training programs and a reformulation of research and practice roles that will allow us to better optimize our synergies and leverage our adjacencies. </p>
<p>For example, doctoral programs could be redesigned to expand opportunities for intraprofessional coeducation of DNPs and PhDs, and more could be done to proactively promote and facilitate DNP-PhD collaboration in research and research translation. DNPs, like MDs and other health practitioners, are essential partners in research. Their experience in the clinic and in the community means that their involvement improves access to research participants; enlightens and enhances the design, implementation, and evaluation of research projects; and facilitates research translation into practice. Similarly, PhD scientists play a foundational role in advancing evidence-based practice, informing policy, and educating current and future nurse clinicians. By working closely together and blending their unique skill sets and expertise, DNPs and PhDs can serve as effective force multipliers to drive innovation and improvement. As we reimagine and reinvent our education, training, and research programs, we thus should encourage and foster intraprofessional and interdisciplinary collaboration within our own nursing communities as well as across the other biomedical and health science specialties. Through experimentation and exploration of new processes and approaches, we can definitively shift the paradigm of research and health care to one marked by collaboration and synthesis rather than competition and divisiveness.</p>

<title>Be Bold, Aim High</title>
<p>Nursing and nursing science stand at a critical nexus of health care, where science merges with health needs and challenges. Nursing research and its translation into evidence-based practice, policy, and education are key for the health and welfare of people around the world. We thus must “be bold and aim high” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1099800412439746">Tilghman, 2011</xref>) as we assume new and pioneering leadership roles in the years ahead.</p>
