<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine factors associated with treatment outcome of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases in Nepal. A retrospective analysis of MDR-TB cases by demographic determinants and treatment was conducted. A total of 494 MDR-TB cases were registered from 2005 to 2008, with data obtained from the National Tuberculosis Center. Chi-squared tests were used to assess statistically the association between smear and culture conversion and treatment outcome. Determinants were analyzed with the use of Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models to generate estimates of the associations with the time to treatment outcome. Sputum conversion status and culture conversion status were positively associated with treatment outcome for MDR-TB. In a multiple Cox proportional hazards regression model, no determinants were found to be associated with time to cure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of mortality in adults due to an infectious agent, and it kills approximately 2 million persons a year worldwide. The global epidemic of TB is growing. The spread of HIV/AIDS and the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are contributing to the worsening impact of this disease. The impact of TB is particularly evident in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions) and Africa. Approximately 86% of all TB cases reported worldwide occur in these regions, where 60% of the world’s population live.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511408067">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prevalence of MDR-TB is also a problem in parts of Asia and the Western Pacific, impeding the effort to control and prevent TB in this region. Multidrug-resistance, defined as resistance to at least isoniazid (H) and rifampicin (R), requires prolonged treatment with agents that are more expensive and associated with higher rates of toxicity than first-line antituberculosis drugs. Despite improved treatment response rates, MDR-TB continues to have higher morbidity and mortality than drug-sensitive TB. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 0.5 million new MDR-TB cases causing more than 1.3 million deaths in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511408067">2</xref></sup> For individuals diseased with multidrug-resistant strains of TB, the fatality rate is more than 50%. The high prevalence of MDR-TB may be the result of inadequate treatment, irregular drug supplies, poor funding and functioning of TB programs, underdiagnosis of TB cases, noncompliance on the part of the patient, and widespread over-the-counter availability of antituberculosis drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511408067">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511408067">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>TB is one of the foremost public health problems in Nepal, causing a significant burden of morbidity and mortality. The estimated mortality rate is 5000 to 7000 deaths per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511408067">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511408067"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511408067">7</xref></sup> Emerging MDR-TB is posing a new threat to TB control in Nepal, with current estimates being 2.9% (95% confidence interval = 1.8% to 3.2%) among new cases and 11.7% (95% confidence interval = 7.1% to 18.3%) among previously treated cases in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511408067">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511408067">9</xref></sup> High incidence of MDR-TB in Nepal is associated with poor compliance of previous treatment history of TB, HIV infection, and contact with drug-resistant cases. In addition, the incidence of drug-resistant TB is facilitated by poor treatment regimens that are often prescribed by doctors who have failed to follow national treatment guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511408067">10</xref></sup> The lengthy and more complex treatment processes to get cured make it difficult for patients to adhere to treatment through to its completion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511408067">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Nepal, the MDR-TB management program started in September 2005 with WHO Green Light Committee (GLC) approval and has since been diagnosing and treating MDR-TB patients under a GLC-approved DOTS-Plus project, using a standardized treatment regimen. Treatment progress is monitored with sputum culture examination every month during the intensive phase (first 8 to 12 months) and bimonthly during the continuation phase (9 to 24/32 months). The treatment program has been expanded to all 5 regions of the country. By 2008, the National Tuberculosis Center (NTC) had registered 494 MDR-TB cases for treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511408067">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many studies have investigated the outcome of MDR-TB treatment worldwide. A recent study in Nepal among 175 MDR-TB patients showed a treatment success rate of 70%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511408067">12</xref></sup> Reported rates of treatment success of MDR-TB ranged from less than 60% in Indonesia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511408067">13</xref></sup> and Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511408067">14</xref></sup> to just more than 80% in Hong Kong,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511408067">15</xref></sup> Korea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511408067">16</xref></sup> and Turkey.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511408067">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various studies have attempted to identify determinants for MDR-TB. Patient characteristics including age andHIV infection are also believed to influence the dynamics of transmission of drug-resistant organisms. However, information available on some of these issues is limited, controversial, and prompts further studies.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the treatment outcome of MDR-TB cases in Nepal and its associated factors from 2005 to 2008.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The study population included MDR-TB cases in Nepal under a GLC-approved DOTS-Plus project reported from 2005 to 2008. The data were obtained from NTC, a specific information system managed by the NTC coordination team, working for prevention and control of TB and HIV/AIDS in the region. Information obtained from individuals contains demographic characteristics including age, sex, caste, religion, and region. In addition, the final results of smear conversion and culture conversion at the end of the intensive phase (first 8 to 12 months) or at the end of the treatment or continuation phase (9 to 24/32 months) were reviewed. TB treatment outcomes were classified by standard definitions: cure, treatment completion, treatment failure, default, transferred out, still on treatment, and death.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Preliminary statistical analysis involved examining the frequency distributions of the determinants and outcomes. Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to assess the association between the outcomes. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to determine overall times to sputum smear conversion, cure, and failed/died, respectively, with other outcomes classified in each case as censored data. The log-rank test was used to assess the significance of differences between survival curves. Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate estimates of the associations between demographic factors and treatment and the time to cure, with other outcomes censored.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We undertook a retrospective review of treatment outcome of MDR-TB cases and factors associated with treatment of MDR-TB cases in Nepal. The majority of the cases were male, as has been documented in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511408067">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539511408067">20</xref></sup> Published studies have suggested higher risk of exposure to resistant strains together with poor compliance in males as contributory factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539511408067">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539511408067">22</xref></sup> Drug resistance was higher in younger age groups. This is a matter of concern and should prompt further studies. There was little variation of MDR-TB cases over the 4-year period. The central region accounted for more than half of the patients enrolled and has been the longest standing DOTS-Plus center in the country.</p>
<p>About 79% of the patients had sputum smear converted, and 57% of the cases had culture converted as the final results of sputum smear and culture test. Similarly, 32% of the patients were cured over the 4-year period. However, the low cure rate is due to the fact that 43% of the cases had not completed their full course of treatment as the treatment requires 18 to 24 months.</p>
<p>Cures from MDR-TB tended to occur in cases when both sputum smear and culture were converted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539511408067">Table 4</xref>). It should be noted that final treatment success is based on negative conversion of sputum and culture. In fact, sputum culture conversion is an appropriate indicator of treatment outcome in patients with MDR-TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539511408067">23</xref></sup> Sputum smear and culture conversion is used routinely as an indicator of the progress of treatment of MDR-TB and is an appropriate first goal of therapy.</p>
<p>Both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risks between demographic factors and treatment and the time to cure. The models revealed no statistically significant associations between cure and age, gender, and religion. These findings are consistent with other studies that have confirmed no differences in patient demographics and cure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511408067">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539511408067">24</xref></sup> However, patient education or socioeconomic determinants can lead to irregular medication intake that can contribute to resistance. Systemic problems such as inadequate public health resources and unpredictable drug supplies also play a role in treatment of MDR-TB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539511408067">25</xref></sup> These factors were not investigated in our study, and further research in this area is needed. The survival analysis indicated that any treatment benefit was confined to the first 24 months.</p>
<p>This study was limited by its retrospective study design, as sociodemographic variables were abstracted from routine medical assessments conducted on initiation of therapy. Besides this, we could not evaluate other factors known to be associated with drug-resistant TB, such as HIV infection, previous TB treatment, number of drugs to which organisms were resistant, weight, and prior hospitalization. However, plans to expand appropriate diagnostic and treatment services for patients with MDR-TB are urgently needed, particularly in regions where the burden of MDR-TB is greatest.</p>
