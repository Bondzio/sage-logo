<abstract>
<p>This study tests two hypotheses regarding factors affecting arrest of the perpetrator in domestic violence incidents. Black’s relational-distance thesis is that the probability of arrest increases with increasing relational distance between perpetrator and victim. Klinger’s leniency principle suggests that the probability of arrest is lower for male perpetrators assaulting female intimate partners, compared with other scenarios. The authors employed marginal logistic regression models using incident-based data from the National Survey of Violence and Threats of Violence Against Women and Men in the United States, 1994-1996, to test both effects. They found support for Black’s thesis: The likelihood of arrest was lower when the perpetrator was an acquaintance, a relative, or a romantic partner of the victim, versus a stranger. However, the authors’ results failed to support Klinger’s hypothesis. They found that men were more likely to be arrested when assaulting a female—regardless of relationship status—compared with assaulting another male.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a dramatic shift in the way police departments responded to incidents of domestic battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128711420102">Adelman &amp; Morgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128711420102">Browne &amp; Williams, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128711420102">Dugan, Rosenfield, &amp; Nagin, 2003</xref>). Factors ranging from federal initiatives, pressure from victim advocacy groups, and threat of litigation, to research that supported the merits of authoritative intervention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128711420102">Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984</xref>) compelled law enforcement agencies to redefine how they handled domestic battery calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128711420102">Hirshel &amp; Hutchinson, 2001</xref>). Policies that had, at best, followed a mediation model and, at worst, promoted a nonintervention strategy were now being replaced with mandatory arrest policies, increased domestic violence training, and specialized domestic violence units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128711420102">Adelman &amp; Morgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128711420102">Blackwell &amp;Vaughn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe, Klinger, &amp; Flavin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128711420102">Mignon &amp; Holmes, 1995</xref>). Coinciding with this shift in policy are data that seem to indicate a steady decline in the rate of domestic violence against women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128711420102">Rennison &amp; Welchans, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, despite these initiatives, there remains the argument that police are still less likely to make an arrest in the case of a domestic battery compared with other forms of physical assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128711420102">Black, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa, Austin, &amp; Buzawa, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, this may particularly be the case in situations where the victim is female and the perpetrator is male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128711420102">Avakame &amp; Fyfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe et al., 1997</xref>). In others words, the relationship between the victim and perpetrator, as well as the gender of each, may have a substantial influence on whether an arrest is affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128711420102">Felson &amp; Paré, 2005</xref>, employ the same factors when examining the likelihood of victims reporting sexual and physical assaults to the police).</p>
<p>In addressing police response to domestic battery as a function of relational classification, Black’s theory of law proposes that the smaller the relational distance between the victim and perpetrator (i.e., spouse vs. stranger), the less likely police will arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128711420102">Black, 1980</xref>). The argument is that law varies inversely with other forms of social control. The smaller the relational distance, the greater the likelihood that informal social controls govern the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128711420102">Black, 1976</xref>). The leniency thesis, however, a similar hypothesis grounded in different assumptions, states that officers are less likely to make an arrest in cases of male-on-female intimate-partner violence than in cases of nonintimate violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128711420102">Avakame &amp; Fyfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger, 1995</xref>). This position assumes that police are deferring both to male privilege and to the privacy that they feel should envelop intimate relationships.</p>
<p>Few studies have examined the influence of these extralegal factors on arrest policies. Those that have suffered from a number of internal and external validity problems, including the failure to differentiate between romantic versus relative relationships, the failure to employ the proper statistical models, the failure to control for gender, relying solely on official reports, and using small or regional samples. To date, then, whether either hypothesis is valid is still an open question. This study therefore tests both hypotheses employing nationally representative data on arrest in domestic violence incidents. In the process, we institute a number of refinements intended to address the limitations of earlier work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011128711420102">
<title>Previous Research</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128711420102">Black (1971)</xref>, using data from a 1966 study involving Boston, Chicago, and Washington, DC, found that the likelihood of arrest varied depending on the type of relationship involved. Specifically, those conflicts involving “family” members were least likely to involve an apprehension, whereas those incidents involving a stranger had the highest probability. He proposed the <italic>relational-distance</italic> principle: that the probability of arrest increases with increasing relational distance between perpetrator and victim. He theorized that the law would be especially likely to intervene in cases in which informal social control was low. Where it was greater, for example, where perpetrator and victim were connected by a relational bond, legal intervention would be less necessary.</p>
<p>Klinger is primarily responsible for suggesting the possibility that a leniency effect characterizes police arrest policy, in addition to a relational-distance principle. Specifically, police are particularly reticent to arrest men who assault their female intimate partners. The assumption here is that police, being largely male, would perceive such assaults as an excusable use of force to establish rightful dominance over a female partner. Moreover, considerations of family privacy would lead them to define such incidents as more of a private, than a public, matter. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger (1995)</xref>, using data from 77 incidents handled by the Metro-Dade Police Department in Florida, compared spousal versus nonspousal physical assaults. Although findings indicated a slightly lower arrest rate involving domestic parties, the difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Additional research attempting to test either <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128711420102">Black’s (1971)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger’s (1995)</xref> theses has produced mixed findings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128711420102">Berk and Loseke (1981)</xref> examined police response to domestic disturbances involving heterosexual romantic or conjugal relationships. Their findings indicated that an officer’s decision to make an arrest was based on the situational factors present and not indicative of any implied bias. A year later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128711420102">Oppenlander (1982)</xref> reported that police were <italic>more</italic> likely to arrest in cases of domestic disputes as compared with nonrelated disputants. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa et al. (1995)</xref>, using data from a midsized, Midwestern police department, found that after classifying incidents as either domestic, acquaintance, or stranger, their findings supported Black’s thesis: As relational distance decreased between perpetrator and victim, the likelihood of arrest decreased too. Controlling for both gender and relational distance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe et al. (1997)</xref> observed that police were less likely to make an arrest in cases where a male had assaulted a female with whom he had (or previously had) an intimate relationship, thus, finding support for the leniency thesis. Furthermore, they indicated that the use of weapons or assault to an officer increased the likelihood of arrest. Using data from the National Crime Victimization Survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128711420102">Avakame and Fyfe (2001)</xref> reported similar findings indicating police were less likely to initiate an arrest in regard to male-on-female spousal assaults compared with other forms of assault. They, too, found that victim injury, use of a weapon, and use of drugs or alcohol by the perpetrator enhanced the probability of arrest. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128711420102">Hirschel (2008)</xref>, using data collected from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), found that men and women were equally likely to be arrested in confrontations involving intimate partners as long as the circumstances were comparable. However, men were more likely to be arrested in other domestic violence incidents (i.e., parent–child, child–parent, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, etc.) as well as those involving acquaintances.</p>
<p>All the foregoing studies are limited by a number of methodological and/or substantive difficulties. In some cases, romantic and familial relationships were grouped together under the combined term <italic>domestic</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128711420102">Avakame &amp; Fyfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128711420102">Oppenlander, 1982</xref>), whereas others focused solely on intimate-partner violence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128711420102">Berk &amp; Loseke, 1980-1981</xref>). To determine whether relational distance exerts an independent effect on police response to domestic battery, we must differentiate intimate-partner relationships from nonromantic ones. Another concern involves the failure to control for gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128711420102">Avakame &amp; Fyfe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger, 1995</xref>). A valid test of the argument that male domestic batterers are less likely to be arrested can only be performed if female suspects are included in the analysis. Some studies also suffered from a reliance on regional samples and/or a limited number of cases for their analysis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128711420102">Klinger, 1995</xref>). Finally, there is the issue of reliance on official data (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128711420102">Fyfe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128711420102">Hirschel, 2008</xref>), which are known to underrepresent the prevalence of domestic assaults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128711420102">Mosher, Miethe, &amp; Phillips, 2002</xref>). In the current study, we address these problems by using a large probability sample of U.S. adults, distinguishing the victim–perpetrator relationship along the dimensions of gender and degree of closeness, and conducting an incident-level analysis of the probability of arrest with logistic regression models adjusted to handle interdependence of observations from the same victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128711420102">Fitzmaurice, Laird, &amp; Ware, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0011128711420102">
<title>Research Question and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Based on the theories and hypotheses discussed earlier, we assess the effects of both gender and relational distance on the probability of arrest in domestic assault. We also test how other factors, such as victim socioeconomic status (SES), use of intoxicants and weapons, victim injury, and perpetrator instigation, may affect the decision to make an arrest. Based on the review of previous literature, we propose the following hypotheses.</p>
<list id="list1-0011128711420102" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1): There is a positive relationship between relational distance and the probability of arrest</italic>. When comparing the probability of arrest in relative, romantic partner, acquaintance, and stranger relationships, the smaller the relational distance, the lower the likelihood of arrest.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2): The probability of arrest is lower for males assaulting female romantic partners than in other gender × relationship combinations</italic>. There will be a lower likelihood of an arrest in cases of male-on-female intimate violence compared with other forms of assault.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3): Use of a weapon, alcohol, and/or drugs by the perpetrator as well as injury to the victim will increase the probability of arrest</italic>. Based on previous findings in related literature, police will be more inclined to arrest perpetrators who used a weapon or had consumed alcohol and/or ingested drugs. Police will also be more inclined to arrest the perpetrators if the victim was injured in the attack.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section5-0011128711420102">
<title>The Data</title>
<p>Data are from the survey of Violence and Threats of Violence Against Women and Men in the United States, 1994-1996 (NVAWS hereafter). Conducted in 1995-1996, the survey involved telephone interviews with a national probability sample of 8,000 women and 8,005 men aged 18 and older residing in households throughout the United States. Victims were asked about their general fear of violence and ways in which they managed those fears, emotional abuse on the part of marital or cohabiting partners, and incidents of actual or threatened violence experienced by all types of offenders. Those disclosing victimization were asked more detailed questions about the characteristics and consequences of those experiences. Although the household participation rate was 72.1%, once the interview was begun, 97% of victims completed it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128711420102">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011128711420102">
<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0011128711420102">
<title>Outcome variable</title>
<p>The victim was asked whether he or she had ever experienced a physical assault as an adult. He or she could then report up to six different assaults experienced, giving such information as whether there was an injury as a result, the nature of the relationship to the perpetrator, the gender of the perpetrator, and so forth. The dependent variable in our analyses was whether the perpetrator of a particular physical assault on the victim was arrested by police. It was coded 1 (<italic>yes</italic>) or 0 (<italic>no</italic>). This question was only asked if victims reported that the police had been called to the incident. The response to this item was logically missing for those who reported that police had not been called. Most of the missing responses to this item were of this nature. However, a small number of victims who said the police had been called answered “don’t know” (40 victims) or refused to answer the question about arrest (9 victims). Nevertheless, we coded arrest simply as 1 if the police were reported to have arrested the perpetrator and 0 otherwise.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011128711420102">
<title>Gender of perpetrator/victim</title>
<p>The combination of gender of perpetrator with gender of victim was tapped with three dummy variables identifying a male assaulting a female, a female assaulting a female, and a female assaulting a male (a male assaulting a male was the reference category).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0011128711420102">
<title>Relationship to perpetrator</title>
<p>Three dummy variables classify victim–perpetrator incidents by relationship. Here, we are testing how police practices vary by the perceived presence of informal social control within the dyad. We created three dummy variables representing different levels of familiarity, including romantic, relative, and acquaintance relationships (stranger was the reference category). Romantics include those who are current or past: spouses, cohabiting, or dating partners. Relatives include nuclear and extended family members. There were very few incidents involving same-sex romantic couples: 33 in all. There were no arrests among the 13 incidents involving two romantically linked females. This poses a zero-cell problem in analyses using logistic regression, which necessitated alterations to interaction models (explained later). Nevertheless, we retained same-sex romantic assault incidents in the analyses to fully test the effects of the gender of victim and perpetrator, as well as their interaction with the nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator, on the probability of arrest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0011128711420102">
<title>Control measures</title>
<p>Although our primary attention centers around the effects of gender interaction and relational distance on the likelihood of arrest, we also added sociodemographic and behavioral measures as controls in view of the fact that they may influence police response. Furthermore, these measures allow us to separate the effects of gender and relational distance from related individual characteristics or displayed behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128711420102">Benson, Fox, DeMaris, &amp; Van Wyk, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Age of the victim is treated as a continuous variable ranging from 18 to 91. Employment status was collapsed into a dichotomous variable, coded as 1 (<italic>currently employed</italic>) and 0 (<italic>not currently employed</italic>), with the former including full-time and part-time workers as well as those in current military service. The “not currently employed” category includes those who are looking out for work, the retired, students, homemakers, and others. For education, midpoints were calculated and assigned as 4 (<italic>no schooling and 1st-8th grade</italic>), 10.5 (<italic>some high school</italic>), 12 (<italic>high school graduate</italic>), 14.5 (<italic>some college</italic>), 16 (<italic>4-year college degree</italic>), and 18.5 (<italic>postgraduate</italic>), then treated as continuous in the models. Race is tapped by creating two dummy variables indicating that the victim was Black or Other, with Whites as the reference group. Hispanic ethnicity is differentiated from race and is coded as 1 (<italic>Hispanic</italic>) or 0 (<italic>non-Hispanic</italic>).</p>
<p>In addition to victim characteristics, several variables were added to the model to reflect possible effects associated with contextual behavioral elements. Dichotomous measures were created to examine the impact that victim injury, perpetrator<bold>-</bold>initiated assault, and use of a weapon may have on the decision to arrest. The influence of substance use, at the time of assault, is examined through a series of dummy variables identifying whether the perpetrator had recently consumed alcohol, drugs, or both (not using a substance serves as the reference category). Similar dummy measures were created for the victim’s recent substance use.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011128711420102">
<title>Data Setup</title>
<p>For this analysis, female and male responses were combined into one data set to allow for the testing of possible gender influences. In addition, as the scope of this study involves examining police response to intimate-partner violence, as compared with other forms of violence, the cases here are restricted to those who indicated they had been victims of a battery as an adult. This, in turn, produced 5,653 initial victim cases. The data used for analysis were then converted from person level to incident level. That is, our unit of analysis was the physical assault incident. Each victim could contribute up to six physical assault incidents to the data set. As described in the data set documentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128711420102">Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 1999</xref>), if a victim was assaulted multiple times by the same perpetrator, only the most recent assault was described. Although not explicitly stated in the documentation for the data set, we assume that all incidents described by victims began with the most recent incident and ended with the most distal incident. However, multiple incidents were relatively rare. For example, all 5,653 victims contributed at least one incident, but only 1,020 victims contributed at least two incidents. Only six victims reported six incidents of physical assault, producing a total of 6,974 incident-level cases. Because multiple incidents contributed by the same victim are linked by virtue of coming from the same victim, the statistical analysis (discussed later) takes account of this dependence. Victim’s age and educational attainment are centered around their respective means in the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0011128711420102">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We estimate logistic regression models for the probability of arrest in any given incident using the technique of generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE is a binary-response analog of generalized least squares. Its use is necessitated by the dependence of multiple incidents contributed by the same victim, as alluded to earlier. That is, incidents are nested within victims, implying a multilevel structure to the data. Using GEE, we specify a marginal, or population-averaged logistic regression model for the population probability of arrest, conditional on model covariates. We separately model the mean response—the probability of arrest—and the within-subject association among the repeated responses. The latter is regarded as a nuisance characteristic of the data. Modeling this dependence is, however, necessary for proper inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128711420102">Fitzmaurice et al., 2004</xref>). We model this as an autoregressive process of order one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011128711420102">Wooldridge, 2003</xref>). This specification assumes a diminishing correlation between arrest events as they are farther apart in the reporting sequence.</p>
<p>Two forms of analysis are used: unconditional and conditional. Unconditional analyses are based on all 6,974 assault incidents and examine how model covariates predict the probability of arrest, in general. This answers the simple question “What determines whether a perpetrator is arrested in a physical assault?” However, conditional analyses are based on only the 1,725 incidents that were reported to the police. These examine how model covariates predict the probability of arrest, <italic>given that police were called to the scene</italic>. These are designed to answer the following question: If the police are called to intervene, what determines whether they arrest the perpetrator? Both types of analyses address the issue of what accounts for an arrest in a physical assault. However, the conditional analyses control the influence of model predictors on whether police are called to the scene.</p>
<p>In each analysis, two models are estimated. The first is a main-effects model with primary predictors being the gender mix of victim and perpetrator, and the nature of their relationship. The gender mix is represented by three dummy variables for, respectively, a male assaulting a female, a female assaulting a female, and a female assaulting a male. A male assaulting a male is the reference group. The nature of the relationship between victim and perpetrator is represented by dummy variables for a romantic relationship, a relative relationship, and an acquaintance relationship. A stranger “relationship” is the reference category. The second model adds terms representing the interaction of gender mix and nature of relationship. Because of the zero cell in the bivariate association between arrest and female same-sex romantic relationships, we omitted the cross product term <italic>female assaulting female</italic> × <italic>romantic relationship</italic>. This implies that the effect of <italic>female assaulting female</italic> (vs. male assaulting male) in the interaction model applies to both stranger and romantic relationships, and the effect of <italic>romantic relationship</italic> (vs. stranger relationship) applies to both male–male and female–female assaults. Missing data on explanatory variables were replaced using multiple imputations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128711420102">Allison, 2002</xref>). Model estimates and standard errors reported in the tables are therefore averaged values based on 25 replicates of the data with missing values replaced by imputation.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011128711420102">Table 1</xref> reports the univariate results for the between-subject and within-subject predictors. The gender breakdown was approximately 60% male and 40% female with the average age just below 40 years. The majority of victims were White (80.3%) with an average education of just less than 2 years of college. In addition, it appears that most were also employed at least part-time. Out of the total physical assaults that took place, only 25% were reported to the police. Totally, 23% of the batteries involve some form of weapon, whereas roughly 28% resulted in injury to the victim and 9% resulted in an arrest. Perpetrators were reported as having consumed alcohol, drugs, or both during the incident more often than the victim. Furthermore, perpetrators initiated the physical contact 93% of the time. The largest relationship type in the survey was romantic, followed by stranger, acquaintance, and relative. However, male-on-male violence accounted for the majority of the attacks, followed by male-on-female, female-on-male, and finally female-on-female.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128711420102">Table 2</xref> presents GEE estimates for unconditional and conditional models of the log odds of arrest. Model 1 is the unconditional main-effects model. The probability of arrest is unaffected by the victim’s demographic characteristics. However, several aspects of the assault incident itself are significant predictors. Hence, the likelihood of the perpetrator being arrested is elevated if a weapon was used, the victim was injured, the perpetrator was using alcohol or drugs (vs. not using any substances), or a male was assaulting a female (vs. a male was assaulting another male). The probability of arrest was reduced, in contrast, if the victim was using alcohol or both alcohol and drugs together (vs. not using any substances), or the victim and perpetrator were related as romantic partners, relatives, or acquaintances (vs. being complete strangers). Model 2 adds terms representing the interaction of the victim–perpetrator gender mix with the nature of their relationship. None of the interaction terms reaches significance at conventional levels. In sum, an unconditional analysis finds that, controlling for relationship type, incidents involving a male assaulting a female are significantly more likely to eventuate in the arrest of the perpetrator, compared with the case of male–male assaults. Also, controlling for the gender mix of victim and perpetrator, assaults in which victim and perpetrator already knew each other are less likely to result in arrest, compared with cases in which they were strangers.</p>

<p>Models 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128711420102">Table 2</xref>, summarizing results of the conditional analyses, present the same models but for only the 1,725 incidents in which the police were called. Once again, the victim’s demographic characteristics appear to exert no influence on whether the perpetrator is arrested. Far fewer incident characteristics are predictive of arrest, once the probability that the police are called is held constant. In particular, the perpetrator’s being on either alcohol or both alcohol and drugs raises the likelihood of arrest. And victim and perpetrator being in a romantic relationship reduces the likelihood of arrest, compared with being strangers.</p>
<p>No other factors are significant. Model 4 adds the Gender Mix × Relationship Type interaction effects. In this case, one interaction effect is significant and suggests that if a male assaults a female acquaintance, the probability of his being arrested is significantly greater than if a male assaults a female stranger. Although the estimated probability of arrest is also higher for a male assaulting a female romantic partner, compared with a female stranger, this effect does not reach significance. In this model, we also see now that the likelihood of arrest is also increased if a weapon was involved in the assault. In sum, the conditional analysis suggests that some predictors of arrest—most notably the victim being injured in the assault—are related to arrest primarily by virtue of being associated with the police being called in the first place. Other predictors in the same category are the victim’s use of alcohol or drugs and the participants being in either a relative or an acquaintance relationship, compared with being strangers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The effects of relational distance on the decision to arrest in cases of battery can readily be seen at the aggregate level. Past research has long documented that extralegal factors, such as race, class, and disposition of the perpetrator, can play a pivotal role in police response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128711420102">Goldman, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128711420102">Westley, 1953</xref>). Adding to this literature, our data support the argument that the relationship the perpetrator has with the victim clearly affects the decision to arrest. Specifically, we observe that the likelihood of arrest decreases as the perpetrator moves from stranger to acquaintance and finally to romantic and related status. Furthermore, we find that the association between relational distance and official recourse is present even with controls for victim’s sociodemographics and situational factors included in the model.</p>
<p>Our results seem to lend support to Black’s claim that intimacy repels law. Thus, it is possible that the main mechanism at work is the presence of other forms of social control in the relationship. In other words, the amount of formal control, in this case enforcement, applied in any given situation is inversely proportional to the amount of informal control perceived present. If this interpretation is accurate, then based on the results of this study, it would appear that informal social control mechanisms are recognized the most in situations involving relatives. A subsequent examination of contemporary statutory framework involving domestic violence supports this line of reasoning. The main impetus for change in domestic violence policy was due to a number of external factors, including pressure from female advocacy groups, civil liability issues, and federal initiatives—all concentrating on intimate-partner violence. Assault involving relatives was not the focus of attention, resulting in police continuing to adhere to the previously promoted mediation model. Consequently, many of the states that consider children under domestic violence provisions still allow for “reasonable discipline” by the parent, thus, recognizing that other forms of social control are present within the family structure, which, in turn, equates to less governmental intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128711420102">Larzelere, Silver, &amp; Polite, 1998</xref>). Could it be that the reason intimate partners follow closely behind relatives as being less likely to involve an arrest (compared with strangers) is because there is a spillover effect? In other words, officers may still have a tendency to view domestic partners as a family structure and therefore be less inclined to intervene to maintain the balance between informal and formal social control. However, as we are not directly measuring social control, this is only speculation at this point.</p>
<p>Unlike our finding regarding relational distance, our study does not support the leniency thesis. Contrary to the leniency argument, we find that men are <italic>more</italic> likely to be arrested after having assaulted a female compared with a male. As with relational distance, we find that the effects of male-assaulting-female incidents on the likelihood of arrest exist even with controls for victim’s sociodemographics and situational factors present. In fact, a closer look at what mechanisms might be at play may account for why leniency theory is not only unsupported but also in direct contradiction to the findings.</p>
<p>Decades of research have shown that gender influences enforcement. Several studies involving police–citizen encounters find that men are much more likely to be stopped, interrogated, or arrested than women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128711420102">Friedrich, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128711420102">Pastor, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128711420102">Rubinstein, 1973</xref>). This may suggest that police view male suspects as more threatening and more dangerous than female suspects. One possible reason for this disproportion may have to do with how stereotypes are formed by police. By and large, according to official data, men commit more crimes than women and, as such, have more negative contacts with police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128711420102">United States Department of Justice, 2010</xref>). Cognitive bias suggests that repeated contacts with groups that demonstrate disproportionate levels of offending may influence associated preconceptions. Once these negative cognitive schemas are formed, they are likely to influence the behavior of the officer, resulting in more punitive responses toward male, compared with female suspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128711420102">Smith, Makarios, &amp; Alpert, 2006</xref>). If this is true, then officers, both male and female, would be more likely to respond punitively to males who assault than females.</p>
<p>However, this perspective does not completely address the fact that male offenders are more likely to be arrested when their victim is female. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128711420102">Visher’s (1983)</xref> research suggested that this may have to do with how the officers see themselves. The concept of protection is deeply seated in the role of police officer. As the vast majority of police are male (88.2%), it is plausible that the socially ingrained belief that females need to be protected by males may also play a dominant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128711420102">Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2006</xref>). Yet again, this does not take into account the actions of female officers.</p>
<p>For an explanation that takes into account both the offender and victim, we must again return to Black’s description of the dynamic balance between forms of social control. Known as social geometry, Black’s theory posits that the observed gender bias involved in official response is a function of the social spatial difference that exists between the victim and offender. Revisiting the argument that law varies with other forms of social control, it is theorized that those who are dependent on others (i.e., women, children, and the elderly) have less access to other forms of control, prompting the law to react accordingly in an effort to balance the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128711420102">Black, 1976</xref>). Consequently, these individuals attract less attention from the law as offenders and more as victims. Taken together, social geometry predicts that officials are not only less likely to arrest in domestic situations but also more likely to arrest male offenders assaulting female victims. This is, of course, in direct contradiction to the foundation of the leniency argument.</p>
<p>Use of a weapon during the assault and injury to the victim increases the likelihood of arrest. The effect of weapon use is observed even after controlling for injury to the victim. In most cases, using a weapon during an assault aggravates the status to the level of felony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128711420102">Marvell &amp; Moody, 1995</xref>). Consequently, police are more likely to arrest both adult and juvenile suspects when the offense is a felony rather than a misdemeanor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128711420102">Black, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128711420102">Black &amp; Reiss, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128711420102">Lundman, Sykes, &amp; Clark, 1978</xref>). Injury to the victim increases the seriousness of the offense, reducing the amount of discretion available to the officer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128711420102">Black, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128711420102">Smith &amp; Visher, 1981</xref>). Signs of injury also serve as tangible evidence that a crime was committed, therefore not only making it easier to identify the primary aggressor but also providing evidence for later prosecution.</p>
<p>Officers are more likely to arrest the perpetrator during a complaint of battery if the perpetrator is found to have been using alcohol or drugs. This appears to be the case independent of other situational elements included in the model. Other research has shown similar patterns indicating that arrest is more likely in cases where the perpetrator was intoxicated regardless of the offense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128711420102">Engel, Sobol, &amp; Worden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128711420102">Novak, Frank, Smith, &amp; Engel, 2002</xref>). However, use of either alcohol or alcohol and drugs by the victim reduces the probability of arrest in cases of battery. Police can, in certain incidents, blame the victim for provoking their attacker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128711420102">Hart, 1993</xref>). More specifically, research has shown that police officers tend to focus more on whether the victim, not the perpetrator, was intoxicated prior to the battery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128711420102">Aramburu &amp; Leigh, 1991</xref>). In a related study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128711420102">Stewart and Maddren (1997)</xref> found that the level of blame to both victim and assailant was influenced more by the victim’s intoxication than the assailant’s. Subsequently, officers were less likely to arrest perpetrators when the victims were under the influence. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128711420102">Black (1976)</xref> regarding low normative status, in that appearing disreputable can stigmatize not only the perpetrator but also the victim, which in turn, can influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>In our attempt to expand on previous research, we approached the question of influence by separating out and consequently testing two distinct suppositions involving domestic violence response. Once we were able to disentangle the effects of relational distance and gender from the weight of contextual elements and the structural effects of SES, we found that the influence of relational distance was consistent with Black’s theory of law. However, gender played a role contrary to that prescribed by the leniency hypothesis. These findings are consistent with similar research conducted with official data (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128711420102">Buzawa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128711420102">Hirschel, 2008</xref>). The strength of our study, however, inheres in the anonymity of the survey method employed with nationally representative data, which overcomes many of the limitations associated with official reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128711420102">Maxfield, Weiler, &amp; Widom, 2000</xref>). In particular, the data we employed were better suited to capture the level of familiarity between parties by way of a questionnaire. Official data typically do not contain this information, with the exception for NIBRS, an incident-based reporting system, which itself has been criticized as being based on nonrepresentative sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128711420102">Addington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128711420102">Hirschel, Buzawa, Pattavina, Faggiani, &amp; Reuland, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Early models of law enforcement depict the police as dutiful officers working under the strict rule of law, dispatching justice uniformly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128711420102">Kadish, 1962</xref>). However, most scholars are of the opinion that selective enforcement is not only common but also routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128711420102">Black, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128711420102">1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128711420102">Lundman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128711420102">Reiss, 1971</xref>). Our results add to this consensus by supporting the argument that relational distance may have a direct influence on the likelihood of arrest in cases of battery. This effect is present alongside controls for SES and situational elements, which suggest that the influence is not merely endogenous to other individual- and situational-level characteristics. In contrast, we do not find support for the leniency theory. Instead, we find that being male acts as an aggravating factor in cases of assault where the victim is female, therefore increasing the likelihood of arrest.</p>
<p>Recall that many departments began changing their domestic violence policies in the late 1980s and early 1990s to reflect a proarrest stance. Yet our data, compiled from 1995 to 1996, clearly demonstrate that officers continue to be less likely to take into custody the offender in cases of domestic battery when compared with other forms of battery. If we are to take from these findings that it is the amount of perceived informal social control present within a domestic setting that influences arrest decisions, then any appreciable policy or program must take aim at reshaping the associated attitudes of law enforcement officials. Simply encouraging the arrest of the offender does not seem to change the opinion of most police that domestic battery, on some level, is in fact a form of self-regulation.</p>
<p>As these results are based on a national sample, it lends weight to the argument that this practice is not only endemic to policing but also most likely perpetuated by police culture. In other words, recruits may not necessarily enter into the force with preconceived notions that domestic battery should merit any less enforcement than other types of violence. As such, programs designed to reinforce the uniformity of enforcement action, despite the familiarity between the victim and offender, must start in the initial phases of training. Once this lesson is introduced in the academy, it can serve as the foundation for a fundamental shift in the way officers view their role when responding to interpersonal violence. Continued training throughout their career can act as reinforcement to the initial lessons taught. With time and proper implementation, deeply ingrained beliefs about the acceptability of physical confrontations within domestic settings should be replaced with a more thorough understanding of the necessity for enforcement within those emotionally driven situations known as domestic battery.</p>
