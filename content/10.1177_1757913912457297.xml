<p>The Department of Health is on course to meet its target of increasing the number of health visitors by an extra 4,200 by April 2015.</p>
<p>The news comes in the year that health visiting celebrates its 150 year anniversary. Compared to last year, three times as many health visitors began training in 2011/12. These figures mean that more than 6,000 new health visitors should be trained before 2015.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of health visitors will allow local teams to improve public health outcomes. Health visitors will be able to provide personalised care, and give more time to provide parents with critical health and development advice.</p>
<p>New parents throughout the UK will also get more support from health visitors in the home and community thanks to an expansion of the health visitor programme.</p>

<title>Whooping cough hits a 20-year peak</title>
<p>Whooping cough, a disease that was almost eradicated in the UK, is now more common than at any time in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>The highly infectious disease usually occurs in teenagers and adults but recently there has been a sharp increase in babies under three months being infected. In the current outbreak, five babies have died and there have been 1,781 confirmed cases in England and Wales in the first six months of this year. Two years ago there were just 137 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Whilst increased rates of infection every three to four years is normal as diseases peak in cycles, this current spike is at the highest. The increase has been partly attributed to greater awareness amongst doctors, but waning immunity is also likely to have contributed.</p>
<p>Figures also suggest that drug resistant cases of tuberculosis (TB) are on the rise in the UK, with the number of cases not able to be treated by common methods rising to 26% according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA).</p>
<p>Professor Ibrahim Abubakar, head of TB surveillance at the HPA said: “Although we are disappointed that there has been an increase in new TB diagnosis in the past year, we are pleased that TB cases overall have been stabilising since 2005, with around 8,500 to 9,000 new diagnoses each year. However the increase in drug-resistant cases remains a concern and a challenge to our efforts to control TB in the UK.”</p>

<title>Long working hours cause weight gain</title>
<p>According to a new study of more than 9,000 women, those who work longer hours are more likely to put on weight.</p>
<p>The study examined women aged between 45 and 60 years and found that 55% of the women gained weight over two years. Researchers found that women who weighed 69 kilograms and who worked more than 49 hours (defined as very long hours) a week gained on average 1.3 kilograms. This was compared to those who worked part-time, where only one kilogram was gained.</p>
<p>Those who worked more than 49 hours a week were also more likely to smoke, drink more, sleep less and do little or no exercise. Researchers suggest that employed women may be more likely to gain weight because they have less time for exercise, sleeping and preparing home-cooked meals.</p>
<p>Nicole Au, lead author of the study said: “Employed women had the greatest mean weight change (1.6%), and the smallest mean weight loss among losers. Among the employed sample, mean changes in weight increased with work hours (from 1.5% for part-time hours to 1.9% for very long hours).”</p>

<p>A study has found that whilst patients trust their doctors with their diagnosis, they will still look up their illness online in order to be better prepared to play an active role in their care.</p>
<p>The study by the University of California surveyed more than 500 people who were members of online support groups and who had an appointment with their doctor. No evidence was found to suggest that those who used online health information sites did not trust their doctor, but instead 70% reported that they were planning to ask their doctor about the information they had found. The need to seek further information online was also found to be higher among those who believed their medical condition was likely to persist.</p>
<p>In February 2011 there were more than 12,000 groups listed in the support category of the search engine Yahoo.</p>
<p>Co-author of the study, Xinyi HU said: “We found that mistrust was not a significant predictor of people going online for health information prior to their visit. This is somewhat surprising and suggests that doctors need not be defensive when their patients come to their appointment armed with information taken from the internet.”</p>

<title>Contraceptive use averts maternal deaths worldwide</title>
<p>Findings published in the Lancet, suggest that the use of contraception is likely to prevent more than 272,000 maternal deaths from childbirth each year.</p>
<p>The authors used a counterfactual modelling approach to replicate the World Health Organization’s (WHO) maternal mortality estimation method, and to estimate maternal deaths averted by contraceptive use in 172 countries. Data for the analysis were drawn from the WHO database for maternal mortality estimation, survey data for contraceptive use and information on births, female population aged 15 to 49 years and general fertility rates from the United Nations World Population Prospects database, 2010.</p>
<p>The figures revealed that 38 deaths per 100,000 women were averted through contraception use. This equates to a 44% reduction in maternal deaths worldwide. The decline in deaths for individual countries ranged from 7% to as high as 61%.</p>
<p>Amy Tsui, PhD, senior author of the study said: “Unwanted fertility and unmet contraceptive need are still high in many developing countries, and women are repeatedly exposed to life-threatening pregnancy complications that could be avoided with access to effective contraception. This study demonstrates how use of contraception is a substantial and effective primary prevention strategy for reducing maternal mortality, especially in low-income countries.”</p>

<title>Timeline for Alzheimer’s</title>
<p>Scientists at Washington University School of Medicine have devised a timeline of unseen progress of Alzheimer’s before symptoms occur.</p>
<p>Researchers looked at families with a genetic risk of the disease and found that signs appear up to 25 years before the expected onset of the disease. The study involved 128 people from the UK, US and Australia, and 50% had a chance of inheriting one of three mutations that are certain to cause early Alzheimer’s, which often develops in people in their 30s and 40s. Those who carry the mutations will go on to develop the disease.</p>
<p>Participants underwent blood and spinal fluid tests as well as brain scans and mental ability assessments. The earliest change was a drop in spinal fluid levels of the key ingredient of Alzheimer’s brain plaques. The scientists suggest that these can be detected 25 years before the anticipated age of disease onset. At 15 years, raised levels of tau, a structural protein in brain cells can be seen in spinal fluid and shrinkage can also be detected within parts of the brain. They also found that changes in the brain’s use of the sugar glucose and slight memory problems become apparent ten years before symptoms would appear.</p>
<p>Prof Clive Ballard, director of research at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “This important research highlights that key changes in the brain, linked to the inherited form of Alzheimer’s disease, happen decades before symptoms show, which may have major implications for diagnosis and treatment in the future. These findings are a good indicator that there may be key changes in the brain happening early in people who develop non-hereditary Alzheimer’s disease, but we can’t be sure. Further research into this complex condition is needed to confirm a definite link.”</p>

<title>Association for nutrition develops innovative tools for skill recognition</title>

<p>The UK is fortunate in having a body of well-qualified Registered Nutritionists (UKVRN registered) and Registered Dieticians (HPC registered) yet no schemes exist to improve and validate the competence of frontline nutrition workers such as community food workers, health trainers and nursery nurses who translate nutrition science into practice as part of their daily role. Nor is there any mechanism for ensuring that nutrition advice offered by Health Professionals at Level 5+ (on the Public Health Skills &amp; Career Framework)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457297">1</xref></sup> is accurate or consistent. The Workforce Competence Model in Nutrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912457297">2</xref></sup> was developed by the Association for Nutrition (AfN) to address these needs. It provides a framework which benchmarks competences and underpins standards for upskilling workers with such widely differing skill sets, levels of training, scope of practice and professional support.</p>
<p>The Workforce Competence Model in Nutrition is a major outcome of a three year project, ‘Improving Capacity, Confidence and Competence in Nutrition across the Workforce’, funded by the Department of Health and undertaken by AfN. It was developed through the following four stages:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913912457297" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Identifying and mapping the workforce responsible for nutrition delivery at levels 3,4 and 5+ on the Public Health Skills and Career Framework.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Scoping vocational training and educational provision in nutrition and how training provision contributes to workforce capacity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using 1) and 2) to derive Nutrition Workforce Competences to form the Workforce Competence Model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Testing and validating the proposed Workforce Competence Model among the target workforce.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Model consists of ten competences, focussing on essential knowledge and experience in nutrition, alongside vital delivery skills. Each competence is supported by a series of statements which demonstrate the necessary knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>This October, AfN will launch a new web portal featuring an innovative self assessment tool, underpinned by the Workforce Competence Model. This function was developed by talent selection specialists and draws on the practical expertise of volunteers working across the field of nutrition. It will enable frontline nutrition workers to test their levels of nutrition knowledge and experience against benchmarked standards leading to AfN certification.</p>
<p>All visitors to the portal will be able to view the Workforce Competence Model. Target workers will then have the opportunity to become an AfN member and access the self assessment tool, via a dedicated members’ area. This members’ area will also offer a range of other benefits including CPD guidance, providing workers with the means to record CPD, including training and events attended. AfN members will be notified of relevant AfN certified courses and have discussion boards to communicate with other members in similar posts across the nation.</p>
<p>AfN members will distinguish their entry level according to the level at which they are employed. Community food workers, health trainers and nursery nurses will sit the self assessment questions appropriate to levels 3 or 4 whereas health professionals such as GPs, midwives, nurses and pharmacists, who hold a higher level post within their own discipline, will sit a Level 5+ test. Levels are cumulative therefore users are expected to meet the requirements of statements at their entry level and below. Members who use the self assessment tool but do not meet the benchmarked standards of AfN, will receive in depth feedback to help them develop their skills and knowledge further. We encourage such workers to repeat the self assessment procedure in the future with a view to achieving certification.</p>
<p>AfN will list nutrition related training courses on the portal, having ensured they meet our screening criteria. Screened courses will be eligible for further assessment by the Course Certification Committee, as part of our training certification scheme, designed by volunteer course providers and leaders. The course assessment criteria were developed by testing and validating existing course materials against the Workforce Competence Model.</p>
<p>The web portal will also offer organizations from across the UK a forum in which to share good practice, advice and experience, plus news of events. Organizations which operate to high standards of practice, promote CPD amongst their staff and employ workers who are AfN certified can apply to become an AfN Centre of Excellence. AfN Centres of Excellence may use the web portal to assist in-house career development by enabling them to interact on-line with their AfN certified employees around managing their CPD.</p>
<p>AfN’s unique certification service has clear potential to benefit public health by delivering change beyond conventional professional boundaries and reducing nutrition related health inequalities in disadvantaged areas.</p>
