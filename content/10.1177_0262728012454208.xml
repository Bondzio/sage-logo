<p>Evidently there were two parallel streams of thought running in Singh’s mind while writing this book. The split is evident from the title itself, for one is unable to decide if the book is a commentary on India’s freedom movement with Jinnah as a protagonist, or whether this is a book centred on the life of the <italic>Quaid</italic>, with the freedom struggle serving as an effective backdrop. While tackling either of these subjects is an ambitious undertaking, combining both in the same book must be doubly so. The author has tried to straddle both boats, but at times one can see him losing balance and tilting too much towards one side.</p>
<p>The book starts with a brief discussion on Islam in India, from its advent until the mid-19th century. This chapter paints a general picture of Muslim society in India and places relevant socio-political changes into a wider cultural context, especially important for readers unacquainted with the history of Islam in the subcontinent. A commendable attempt to explain such a vast topic in a few pages, however, this account of Islam in India remains largely North-centric (p. 11), with no mention of the arrival of Islam in areas like Kerala, which makes his narrative rather incomplete.</p>
<p>The portrayal of Jinnah’s early life in the second chapter makes particularly fascinating reading. Besides focus on the man, the chapter examines the environment around him, providing interesting insights into Gujarat’s vibrant Muslim society (p. 53). The chapter presents the story of a brilliant young man coming into his own, but also provides important insights into the trajectories of the Indian National Congress while the future <italic>Quaid</italic> prepares for his political career. Both in their nascent stages of maturity are shown as trying to find an appropriate balance between idealism and pragmatic approaches to achieve their respective lofty aims.</p>
<p>The arrival of Gandhi on the Indian political scene marks the beginning of Jinnah’s gradual withdrawal from the Congress. It is common knowledge that Jinnah disapproved of Gandhi’s populist approach. However, Singh argues convincingly that contrary to popular perception, Gandhi’s coldness towards Jinnah was also responsible for their tense personal relation, which later on had more serious political ramifications (p. 87).</p>
<p>Although due attention has been given to Jinnah’s displeasure at Gandhi’s decision to support the <italic>Ulema</italic> and conservative Muslim opinion on the <italic>Khilafat</italic> issue (p. 90), Singh pays scant attention to the rise of Hindu fundamentalism in this period. The RSS is discussed rather briefly (p. 104), with absolutely no mention of Veer Savarkar’s conceptualisation of <italic>Hindutva</italic> and the Hindu nation, something which must have added to the anxieties of Muslims in India. Whether this omission is inadvertent or due to the author’s own political compulsions is anybody’s guess.</p>
<p>A good portion of the book is devoted to Jinnah’s rising political career after 1937, his claim of being the sole spokesman of the Indian Muslims and conversely his insistence on describing the Congress as a Hindu body. While Singh’s narrative is well argued and is based on meticulous research, he misses a crucial point. As far back as 1928, the author quotes Jinnah as saying: ‘I welcome the hand of fellowship extended to us by the Hindu leaders from the platform of the Congress and the Hindu Mahasabha’ (p. 144). This clearly demonstrates that Jinnah was quite sceptical of Congress’s rep-resentative character much before he became the <italic>Quaid.</italic> Another aspect conspicuous by its absence is Jinnah’s private life, particularly the deep emotional impact on him of his wife’s death, and his attachment to his sister, Fatima Jinnah.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the book, approaching the time of partition, there is a clear split between Singh’s narrative and his conclusions. Singh painstakingly narrates the tense political atmosphere of the 1940s and paints a vivid picture of the failed negotiations between the Congress and the League. However, he puts the blame for partition squarely into the hands of the Congress and specifically Nehru (p. 429). This vilification of Nehru as the architect of partition is not new. In fact, it is almost taken as a gospel truth amongst upper middle class Hindu society, which seems to have embraced neoliberalism as one of its deities.</p>
<p>Historically too, there have been many supporters of this argument. Maulana Azad’s <italic>India Wins Freedom</italic> had also blamed Nehru for reneging on the Cabinet Mission Plan, albeit in a more understated way. Singh’s attack on Nehru is more direct, citing specifically the Cabinet Mission incident as an example of his inflexibility. However, as M.J. Akbar’s <italic>Nehru: The Making of India</italic> has argued brilliantly, the Muslim League itself was not too keen on the plan and was treating it as a tactical gesture on the road to an eventual partition. Singh’s narrative avoids this aspect altogether, thereby leading to a more lop-sided account of the events that took place.</p>
<p>The author deserves praise, however, for his critical treatment of the last viceroy, Mountbatten. Most Indian authors have generally been rather kind to the viceroy, treating him with kid gloves. Singh carefully scrutinises the role played by Mountbatten in the unfolding tragedy, forcing the reader to look beyond the personal charm of the dapper viceroy (pp. 368–70).</p>
<p>Despite some faults, the author of this important study comes across as honest and sincere in his approach. The book is well researched and the author has argued his case in a manner that makes readers question their assumptions. That in itself suffices as a <italic>raison d’être</italic> for this important project, which deserves—and is likely to attract—a wide readership.</p>
