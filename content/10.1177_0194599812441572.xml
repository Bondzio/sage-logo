<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article reports an uncontrolled observational study on a small group of infants fitted with cochlear implants following personal audiological criteria and, up to now, with limited literature support due to the innovative nature of the study. This study shows, for the first time, significantly improved auditory-based outcomes in children implanted younger than 6 months and without an increased rate of complications. The data from the present study must be considered as explorative, and a more extensive study is required.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between November 1998 and June 2011, 386 children were implanted at the Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) Department of Verona and elsewhere by the senior author (VC). The present study is focused on a group of 12 infants aged 2 to 6 months (group 1), 9 infants aged 7 to 12 months (group 2), 11 children aged 13 to 18 months (group 3), and 13 children aged 18 to 24 months (group 4) all identified with profound bilateral hearing loss and fitted with a unilateral CI (Cochlear Nucleus Series, Cochlear Ltd, Sydney, Australia). None of the children in the present series had any hearing trials before surgery, and none were using sign language either pre- or postoperatively. All children in groups older than 12 months at implantation had their thresholds confirmed by behavioral audiometry.</p>
<p>All children were followed longitudinally and completed the 48-month follow-up period. A control group of 20 children with normal hearing and matched with the CI recipients for chronological age was also investigated. All children’s families used spoken Italian as their first language, and all participants attended an identical postimplant auditory rehabilitation program.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599812441572">
<title>Preimplant Measures</title>
<p>Preimplant audiologic and radiologic assessments were performed in all children following a personal protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812441572">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812441572">13</xref></sup> used to determine CI and hearing aid candidacy in children who failed neonatal screening. This included otomicroscopy, tympanometry and acoustic reflex thresholds, and click auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold assessment. If there were no measurable ABR thresholds, round window electrocochleography (RW ECoG) was performed using click stimuli. If the threshold was lower than 75 dB hearing level (HL), then we referred the infants to an audiologist for hearing aid fitting and ABR follow-up at 6 to 9 months. If the threshold deteriorated, then the infant returned to us for further evaluation. If the child had no cochlear microphonics and no compound action potentials with logon/tone-burst RW ECoG at 500, 750, and 1000 Hz, he or she was evaluated radiologically with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and revaluated by a pediatric neurologist. If the imaging studies excluded a severe malformation of the cochlea and cochlear nerve deficiency, then the severely to profoundly deaf child may have been a candidate for CI. We did not perform a hearing aid trial in these cases because, in our experience, the use of hearing aids delays the provision of auditory stimulation in infants without any acoustically induced electrical cochlear activity. In the present study, pediatric and neuropsychiatric evaluations excluded children with additional disabilities and subjects deafened by meningitis. This protocol was validated on 45 children in whom it was possible to perform behavioral pure-tone audiometry 1 to 3 years after the electrophysiological testing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812441572">18</xref></sup> The use of logon/tone-burst RW-ECoG reduces the percentage of potential CI candidates by approximately 25%, based on ABR findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812441572">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Children came to our department at different ages and received CIs with parental informed consent as soon as an accurate diagnosis was obtained and preoperative surgical protocols had been completed. In 18 children younger than 6 months, CI was delayed by approximately 9 to 15 months because of parental concern.</p>

<sec id="section10-0194599812441572">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The surgical technique has been detailed in a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812441572">3</xref></sup> A well-trained pediatric anesthesiologist administered intraoperative anesthesia and followed the infants between 2 and 12 months at the intensive care unit for approximately 6 hours after surgery. To avoid protrusion and prevent device migration, the receiver-stimulator was completely placed in a large bony seat in all children and tightened down with 3-O PDS tie-down sutures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0194599812441572">
<title>Intraoperative Measures and Device Fitting</title>
<p>Intraoperative measures and device fitting have been detailed in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812441572">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812441572">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812441572">13</xref></sup> All programming was performed by an audiologist in the presence of a rehabilitation therapist and using a combination of electrophysiological information and behavioral responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0194599812441572">
<title>Auditory-Based Communication Measures</title>
<p>The effect of age at CI fitting on auditory-based performance was assessed at regular intervals in children starting at 2, 3, and 4 years of device use. This battery of tests does not rely on parental or caregiver questionnaires or reports; rather, it is based on our team’s direct observations of behavioral performance using established methods and test materials.</p>
<p>Outcome measures included speech perception (Category of Auditory Performance [CAP] II), receptive language development (Test di Valutazione del Linguaggio, livello pre-scolare [TVL]), receptive vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Revised), and speech production (Fanzago test, PFLI [commonly known as the Bortolini test], video recording analysis, and International Phonetic Alphabet transcription).</p>
<p>Because we previously reported a ceiling effect using the CAP at 42 months’ follow-up in children fitted between 2 and 24 months,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812441572">13</xref></sup> at the last follow-up (48 months of CI experience), we used the CAP II (NEAP [Nottingham Early Assessment Package]; The Ear Foundation, Nottingham, UK), which introduces 2 new categories: CAP 8 (follows group conversation in a reverberant room or where there is some interfering noise, such as a classroom or restaurant) and CAP 9 (use of telephone with an unknown speaker in unpredictable context).</p>
<p>The TVL is a test of receptive and expressive language that is appropriate for ages 30 months to 6 years. The TVL scales have been widely used for children with normal hearing, children with specific language impairment, late talkers, children with cognitive deficits, and children with hearing impairments. The test is organized into several sections: word comprehension, sentence comprehension, sentence repetition, naming test, and elicited speech production on specific subjects. The TVL tools are toys and pictures, and the tasks include object manipulation and description based on structured questions.</p>
<p>Outcome measures of auditory-based performance (ie, word comprehension, sentence comprehension, and sentence repetition) were taken for each child from the 4 different groups, as close as possible to 30 months of age and then at 6-month intervals, until 48 months of device experience was reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812441572">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Revised (PPVT-R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812441572">20</xref></sup> was administered to all children to test receptive language level.</p>
<p>The Fanzago test is based on 22 tables representing 114 pictures that include all consonants and vowels of standard Italian in every possible position (initial, median, and consonant clusters). Words were presented to the child using a live voice with no visual cues, and the child was asked to repeat what he or she heard. Each child’s speech production was transcribed and evaluated according to the normal speech developmental pattern of a native Italian speaker. The total number of incorrectly repeated phonemes and clusters was expressed in terms of a phonetic difficulties percentage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812441572">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Bortolini test consists of 90 pictures representing objects and events, which the child describes/names, and 3 stories (2 stories with 6 pictures each and 1 story with 4 pictures). The picture-stimuli can elicit words that include most of the occurrences of all the standard Italian language phonemes (in initial and median position, as well as consonant clusters). The first 32 pictures are commonly used to obtain a quick result, as performed in the present study. Using a PC, the pictures were presented to the child one at a time, and the child was asked to describe what he or she saw. The child’s speech production sample must include at least 100 words for children aged 30 months and 250 to 300 words for older children. The child’s speech production sample was videotaped and transcribed according to the International Phonetic Alphabet. The sample was then evaluated in terms of phonetic inventory: each phoneme produced in the initial and median positions, in at least 2 different words, was included in the phonetic inventory (expressed in percent phonemes correctly produced).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812441572">22</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section13-0194599812441572">
<title>Safety</title>
<p>For the safety issues, the following parameters were investigated in each child over a 4-year longitudinal follow-up: duration of surgery, heart rate, cardiac arrest, bradycardia, asystole/ventricular fibrillation, hypotension, body temperature variation, blood pressure variation, blood loss, bronchopulmonary insufficiency, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, duration of hospitalization, and peri- and postoperative complications (flap necrosis, delay in wound healing, fever, facial nerve injury, otitis media).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0194599812441572">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check the data distribution. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with the Tukey post hoc test or the χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to assess the differences among groups as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>The mean duration of surgery was approximately 60 minutes, and it was statistically significantly lower in the 2- to 6-month cohort (52 ± 8 minutes, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) and the 7- to 12-month group (58 ± 9 minutes, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) compared with the older children (69 ± 7 and 71 ± 11 minutes, respectively, in the 13- to 18-month and 19- to 24-month groups). Correct implantation, with complete insertion of the cochlear electrodes, was achieved in all patients, and the tests confirmed correct functioning of the electrodes. All 45 patients used their CIs all day long on a daily basis.</p>
<sec id="section16-0194599812441572">
<title>Safety</title>
<p>No major anesthesiological or surgical complications such as cardiac arrest, facial palsy, or flap breakdown were observed.</p>
<p>Among minor anesthesiological complications, 2 children aged 13 and 24 months presented transitory bronchospasm and hypotension, both of which resolved with medical treatment. No laryngospasm was observed in any child, and no intensive care was necessary. Mean heart rate was 132 ± 9, 124 ± 12, 111 ± 14, and 105 ± 12 beats/min in children in the 2- to 6-month, 7- to 12-month, 13- to 18-month, and 19- to 23-month groups, respectively. The difference was statistically significant, with the youngest group experiencing the highest heart rate (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05), reflecting the age-appropriate heart rate of infants. No sudden rise or fall in body temperature was observed during surgery in any child. Blood pressure range during surgery was 60 to 95 mm Hg, 60 to 100 mm Hg, and 65 to 100 mm Hg for children in groups 1, 2, and 3 to 4, respectively. The difference among groups was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>No perioperative surgical complications were encountered in the present series of children. Blood loss was recorded as less than 30 mL in all patients.</p>
<p>There were 3 minor postoperative complications (0.7%) in the total population: 2 cases of wound seroma (1 in the 7- to 12-month group and 1 in the 13- to 18-month group) and 1 case of wound infection in the 19- to 24-month group; all were treated conservatively.</p>
<p>Children in the youngest group were discharged within 2.4 ± 1.3 days, 7- to 12-month-old children within 1.9 ± 1.1 days, and children in the 2 older groups after 1.6 ± 0.8 and 1.3 ± 0.7 days. Statistically significant differences only emerged when comparing the 2- to 6-month group with the 19- to 24-month cohort (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Two children, 16 and 19 months old, were readmitted to the hospital because of vomiting and fever 2 days after discharge. They were treated with intravenous infusion of antibiotics and discharged after 3 days. Delayed wound healing (&gt;10 days after surgery) was observed in 3 children in the 13- to 18-month group and in 2 subjects in the 19- to 24-month cohort.</p>
<p>Within 2 years of implantation, postoperative otitis media was observed in the same ear as the CI in 3 children in the 7- to 12-month group; all were treated medically with no further complications. No complications related to CI activation or long-term use were evident in any subject; none of the children suffered facial nerve stimulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Since the earliest reports, severely deaf children fitted with CIs have shown dramatic speech perception and production improvements, so that they may now enjoy a similar quality of life as their normal-hearing peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812441572">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812441572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812441572">25</xref></sup> This progress may be credited to several mutually supportive factors, some attributable to technologic advances and some to a number of daring otologists who decided to implant individuals with considerably more residual hearing and at progressively younger and younger ages.</p>
<p>Currently, in many centers, children aged 6 to 8 months are being implanted when insufficient benefit from hearing aids can be identified, reporting significantly improved auditory and linguistic performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812441572">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812441572"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812441572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812441572">13</xref></sup> Several converging lines of research support very early CI in children, suggesting that this procedure might also be desirable for infants younger than 6 months. Critical periods for the development of hearing may extend from the sixth month of fetal life to the early postnatal period with regard to phonology and, later, in other spoken language elements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812441572">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812441572">27</xref></sup> Auditory development begins well before birth, and fetal auditory sensory abilities are observed from about 26 to 28 weeks’ gestational age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0194599812441572">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0194599812441572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0194599812441572">30</xref></sup> At birth, the auditory sensory mechanism of the human neonate is fully functional and ready to establish neural connections based on auditory experience. Early language exposure, through social interaction, shapes the developing nervous system. Without this, linguistic abilities diminish quickly, and only early access to language provides a profoundly deaf child an opportunity to develop within the normal continuum. Deaf children identified and treated younger than 6 months have better and more rapid language development than children identified and treated later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0194599812441572">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, the population of infants younger than 6 months has the lowest mean age (3.9 months) described in the literature. These infants demonstrated systematically better auditory-based performance compared with all the other infants and children. Both receptive vocabulary and speech production in the youngest group were comparable with normal-hearing children and significantly better than growth rates achieved by children implanted after 6 months. The results show that these children were provided with the possibility of achieving their full potential, offsetting the need to learn at a faster than normal rate to attain age-appropriate norms.</p>
<p>Indeed, with a longer follow-up, differences outlined in the present study may disappear for some essential functions such as language comprehension but probably not for more complex abilities, related to specific and sophisticated phonetic, semantic, and morphosyntactic skills. It is believed that these can only be acquired during the early critical and sensitive developmental period, when sensory inputs lead to specialization of specific areas of the brain for language.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0194599812441572">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0194599812441572"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0194599812441572">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>A specialist pediatric team of experts, including a pediatric audiologist, neuroradiologist, surgeons, and anesthesiologists, is critical to achieve proper diagnosis, safe treatment, and correct rehabilitation in these children. Most of the outcomes of safety measures indicate equivalent values for younger and older children. As CI for children younger than 6 months is not as yet an established routine, the youngest group was observed postoperatively for a longer period, with longer hospitalization. Interestingly, the younger children had a shorter surgical time compared with the older ones because of their very thin skulls and because of the degree of pneumatization of the mastoid bone. In fact, the time for all the surgical steps and the amount of bone work were greatly reduced, from preparing the island of bone to accommodate the entire speech processor to reaching the cochlea, via an antrectomy and a posterior tympanotomy.</p>
<p>Because of the small sample size of infants younger than 6 months fitted with CIs, a generalization of the reduced complication rate results observed in the present study is certainly limited. The apparently high rate of delayed wound healing (11%) may be related to the low cutoff (&gt;10 days) adopted, whereas other centers may not consider wound healing of 13 to 15 days to be delayed. Indeed, wound seroma formation is higher than that reported in most pediatric CI series, but the total wound complication rate in our series (6.7%) is close to or even lower than literature reports of 5.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812441572">5</xref></sup> and 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812441572">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, this article reports an uncontrolled observational study on a small group, with personal audiological criteria and with limited support from the literature due to the innovative nature of the study. The data from the present study must be considered explorative, necessitating a more extensive study in terms of numbers of patients followed up.</p>
<p>In summary, given the current electrophysiological diagnostic procedures, allowing for very early detection of profound hearing loss, associated with advanced anesthesiological and rehabilitation techniques, we believe that the advantages and disadvantages of CI surgery in infants younger than 6 months should be more closely considered and investigated.</p>
