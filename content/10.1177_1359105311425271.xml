<abstract>
<p>Mixed-methods explored the potential for using Sure Start Children’s Centres (SSCCs) to deliver an intervention to improve the diets of disadvantaged women and their children. In an ‘expert’ discussion, SSCC staff described gaining women’s trust, meeting needs and bringing about change as key to engaging women successfully. Structured observations in SSCCs showed they host activities in an environment conducive to building relationships and meeting women’s needs. However, staff often missed opportunities to support women to make dietary changes. These data suggest that an intervention to help staff make the most of these opportunities would have the best chance of success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Compared to those with a higher educational level, women disadvantaged by a lower educational level have poorer quality diets, and have children with poorer quality diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311425271">Robinson et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311425271">2007</xref>). Mounting interventions to improve the diets of people from disadvantaged communities is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311425271">Wrieden et al., 2007</xref>). Such populations can be hard to engage with health education messages and may lead demanding, chaotic lives, making it difficult for them to utilize services offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311425271">Kelly and Stanner, 2003</xref>). In the UK, Sure Start local programmes were set up from 1999 to co-ordinate health and social care services, including childcare and play, early education and parental support, for families with children under four years old from disadvantaged communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311425271">Belsky et al., 2007</xref>). These evolved into Sure Start Children’s Centres (SSCCs), which aimed to provide a prescribed set of services, placing more emphasis on children’s development and reaching the most vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311425271">Belsky et al., 2007</xref>). Evaluation of the national Sure Start programme has shown that, while it took time to show an impact, improvements are now being identified. These include children showing more pro-social behaviour and independence; less risk of negative parenting; and families using more services designed to support child and family development. Evaluation suggests that the focused and specified services targeted at the most vulnerable appear to be producing beneficial effects, by way of improved parenting and children’s well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311425271">Belsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311425271">Melhuish et al., 2008</xref>). However, there has been no evaluation of the impact of Sure Start programmes on families’ diets, despite nutritional health being part of the SSCC remit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311425271">Belsky et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Programmes in Southampton, UK operate from several central locations, bringing together health and social care professionals to provide services, including baby clinics, oral health, play sessions and parenting groups, both within the purpose-built SSCC buildings and in the community as part of their outreach programme. SSCCs aim to ensure resources reach high priority areas.</p>
<p>This article describes a mixed-methods approach to exploring the potential for using SSCCs to deliver an intervention to improve the diets of women living in disadvantaged areas. Study 1 was an analysis of an ‘expert’ panel discussion convened to explore the issues involved in delivering services to disadvantaged women. Following on from and guided by that study, Study 2 was a structured observation of SSCC staff practice, focusing on how they support women to improve their diets. Findings are discussed and implications for the design of an intervention are considered.</p>

<title>Study 1. Expert panel discussion: practitioners’ perspective</title>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1359105311425271">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Opportunistic sampling was used to recruit practitioners working within Southampton SSCCs; these included staff employed directly by Sure Start, the health visiting team and the health trainers’ programme. Participants were known to the research team from previous stages of the research, or were nominated by those contacted. Ten female participants (mean age = 46 years) participated in the discussion: seven staff members from SSCCs, including a Children’s Centre Manager, Children’s Centre Co-ordinator, Locality Lead Co-ordinator, two Family Support Workers, Community Health Development Officer, Family Support Co-ordinator; two health trainers and one health visitor, all working within Southampton SSCCs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105311425271">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Practitioners were invited by phone or email to attend a focus group to discuss their experiences of working with women from disadvantaged communities. The discussion was audio-recorded and facilitated by a moderator (WL), supported by an observer (JK) and three academics interested in public health nutrition research who acted as co-facilitators. The moderator introduced the session by explaining the significant factors that had previously been found to be related to quality of diet in women in Southampton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311425271">Lawrence et al., 2011</xref>). Discussion was guided by an interview schedule (available on request) informed by previous research within SSCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311425271">Barker et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311425271">2008b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311425271">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311425271">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311425271">2011</xref>) and covered issues of engaging families, service delivery, evaluating the effectiveness of activities and barriers to healthy eating. Participants were invited to reflect upon their work with families, particularly with respect to food and eating habits, and upon the challenges of translating the research findings into an intervention to improve diet in the city.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105311425271">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The audio-recording was transcribed verbatim by a professional typist and the transcript compared with the raw data by the moderator to ensure accuracy. The material was sorted into themes, using inductive coding in line with the relativist ontological and subjective epistemic position adopted by the research team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311425271">Swift and Tischler, 2010</xref>). Using a constant comparative approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311425271">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>), these themes and their sub-themes were developed and depicted in a thematic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311425271">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). Analysis took place at the group level as individuals were unidentifiable from the audio-recording. By listening to the quotations selected from the transcript to illustrate the themes, the moderator attempted to ensure these were representative of the group’s views, and not just certain participants. Steps in the analysis included: (1) moderator review of the transcript; (2) development of a coding frame to account for emergent themes, illustrated with verbatim quotations; (3) thematic coding of the transcript using the coding frame; (4) production of a thematic map to illustrate a way of looking at the data; (5) repeating this iterative process (steps 1–4) until the thematic map provided a parsimonious model. Another researcher (MB) coded one-third of the transcript to aid the development of the coding frame. Both researchers met to discuss any minor disagreements and agreed the final coding frame and thematic map.</p>

<p>Emergent themes are illustrated below and in the final thematic map (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311425271">Fig. 1</xref>) which represents the essence of the discussion; these themes were characterized as ‘Gaining the women’s trust’, ‘Strategies to meet client, service and staff needs’ and ‘Bringing about change’.</p>

<title>Gaining the women’s trust</title>
<p>Practitioners based at newly established SSCCs talked of the pro-active approach they took to engage women, and agreed that the longer a Centre had been operational, the better the level of engagement: ‘It’s existed longest in Southampton and the hard-to-reach group’s got narrower and the other programme you’re talking about is quite new, so their hard-to-reach group is bigger. So we’ve got a very small amount that we don’t reach.’</p>
<p>It was felt that women could only begin to trust a service if they believed it was there to stay, and thus felt a sense of permanence and stability about what was being provided:
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s been lots of things, initiatives that have come and gone. And the reaction I’ve had in the 18 months I’ve been in post is ‘how long is this going to stay for?’ and I say ‘we’re here for the full term’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This illustrates the importance of time for gaining trust, and of the need to adopt different approaches in different areas depending on how long the Centre had been established. Staff then worked on building relationships in order to maximize attendance at the range of activities on offer. This might entail making the women feel valued:
<disp-quote>
<p>you might be the first person that’s said ‘well done’, so they feel supported and valued, and can make the next step … making that phone call and actually to say ‘we missed you’ – ‘You missed me? Who misses me? I’m not important.’ This is what some of these women are feeling like.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1359105311425271">
<title>Strategies to meet client, service and staff needs</title>
<p>Strategies used to meet the needs of women to improve their own and their children’s diets were discussed. For example, women and children were invited to try novel foods. Another approach consisted of healthy cookery courses running over several weeks. The group reflected on the reasons for offering a range of activities: ‘You’ve got to offer mixed delivery. For some, one-off taster sessions are the answer … some people will never attend a six-week course, but you might actually get them along to a healthy eating event.’</p>
<p>Practitioners believed that they were guided by the needs of their population, working <italic>with</italic> them rather than trying to force activities <italic>upon</italic> them, but also finding opportunities to share knowledge and skills. However, there were limits to what they felt could be achieved. One participant drew a parallel between herself and the women who attended: ‘You can give me the information but you can’t make me stop eating the six cream cakes, can you? I have to make that decision for myself.’</p>
<p>Respondents noted that meeting women’s needs was not just about laying on services, it was about getting them interested and attending regularly. Participants felt that Sure Start ‘worked’ because families saw it as existing for them – they ‘owned’ it. One said:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s very client-focused. They come in and take it at their own speed, making suggestions that work for them and you think ‘well actually that’s quite a good idea’. You just go with their flow but give them healthy information on the way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants knew they were not going to be able to force change – it would always be down to the individual: ‘It’s a step-by-step process, isn’t it? Giving encouragement and recognizing when people do make a small change … celebrate that and acknowledge it in some way so they can take the next step.’</p>
<p>It was clear that evaluation of SSCCs was largely limited to keeping registers and assessing simple outcomes, such as ‘customer satisfaction’. Staff believed they were doing important work and wanted this recognized through more sophisticated assessments:
<disp-quote>
<p>We’ve got commissioning coming on more strongly and to be able to say this is really good, this is what we do, capture all that gold dust that’s … sort of dusted under the table. You just don’t capture it enough and evaluation would really help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311425271">
<title>Bringing about change</title>
<p>One of the most discussed barriers was lack of resources to facilitate change:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of it’s about capacity for us to deliver that constant engagement. We’re talking about high numbers of children and families, and at times because of vacancies and sickness, some of the services are very stretched and that’s just another added pressure. Sorry to sound negative, but it’s the truth.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This lack of funding meant the Centres had to prioritize certain activities over others, which was considered to be detrimental to the service provided: ‘Sometimes the priority has to be the core delivery commissioned by Sure Start, so an extra phone call or follow-up might not be as much of a priority as a child protection visit.’</p>
<p>Fast food outlets were considered as barriers that stop women and their families eating healthily: ‘It’s very easy to go to the chippy, I’ve watched the families. My office is next door and you get some families who are in there virtually every night. They’re the ones we try and tackle’.</p>
<p>Mode of transport was perceived as another barrier:
<disp-quote>
<p>a lot of families haven’t got access to a car and they have to do everything by bus – the nearest big supermarket is quite a trek when you’ve got young children in a pushchair and bags and everything else. That’s inevitably going to make an impact. Some of the shops don’t stock any fresh vegetables or fruit, or it’s very limited.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But it was clear they felt money should not necessarily be an obstacle to eating well, and they discussed trying to convince women that they could afford healthy food:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d spent £30 on food and I said ‘I can feed a family of four for at least five days with this food.’ One of our established ladies on the estate said to me ‘I can’t afford to feed my family on that’ and I said ‘but that’s how much I spent. I’ll show you the receipts if you like’. It’s about showing them that they can.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was also recognized that women’s limited experiences of food restricted what they provided for their families:
<disp-quote>
<p>Historically, their families haven’t provided fruit and veg and actually two sisters that came with their children said their parents never gave them fruit. So it’s through coming to our groups – we do a lot around healthy eating and food tasting – that they’d actually tried some quite basic fruits like oranges, because they’d never even tried them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Associated with this lack of exposure to a range of foods, was a lack of cooking skills. This is what drove the Centres to put on cookery courses, hoping that learning new skills would motivate women to cook healthier meals for their families. However, they acknowledged the limits to what they could achieve: ‘If they’re going to cook sausages, let’s teach them to put them in the oven or put them with something else, rather than expect them to completely change their diet overnight.’</p>

<title>Study 2. Observation work: objective perspective</title>
<sec id="section12-1359105311425271">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section13-1359105311425271">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A member of the research team (JK) collated information on the activities running in Southampton SSCCs and organized attendance at a range of group sessions. Two researchers (WL and JK) attended sessions over a two-month period. At each, they introduced themselves to staff members, and participants when appropriate, observed the entire session and completed observation tools. At the end of each session, one of the observers interviewed the main facilitator to record their perceptions of the session. The number of sessions attended was determined by two factors: the two-month time period initially agreed for the observation work; and when observers agreed no new insights were being gained.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1359105311425271">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Three tools were developed to capture different aspects of the observed session. One was based on the original ‘taxonomy of behaviour change techniques’ (BCTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311425271">Abraham and Michie, 2008</xref>); the second assessed the use of specific healthy eating messages; and the third was an observation tool capturing the nature of the session. The taxonomy specifies 26 BCTs used to support others to change their behaviour, for example modelling the behaviour or prompting specific goal-setting. Observers recorded if they saw any of these techniques being used. On the healthy eating observation sheet observers recorded any messages about food labelling, budgeting, healthy weight, healthy diet in pregnancy, breastfeeding and weaning. Each of these had subsections, including five-a-day, salt and sugar. The general observation tool recorded facilitation style and skills; level of participant engagement; whether participants’ needs were addressed; achievements/challenges; training needs; and evaluation. All observation tools are available on request.</p>
<p>This mix of qualitative and quantitative data was deemed the most appropriate way of meeting the research aims, with researchers guided by best practice recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311425271">Swift and Tischler, 2010</xref>). The quantitative data provide an objective measure of the frequency of occurrence of certain events, while the qualitative data allow an exploration of the context of these events. Structured observations are useful for providing insight into the context of diet and eating habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311425271">Draper and Swift, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1359105311425271">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In each session, BCTs and nutrition-related cues (verbal and non-verbal) were noted, from which the total number of sessions where each were observed was calculated. A verbal cue was anything said by a staff member about food or nutrition; a non-verbal cue was anything related to food in the setting or any food-related activity. The ratio of non-verbal to verbal responses was assessed to give an indication of missed opportunities, for example where healthy snacks were provided but not discussed. The general observation tool provided largely qualitative data giving insights into staff practice, with some items allowing assessment of frequency, for example evaluation.</p>

<title>Behaviour change techniques (BCTs)</title>
<p>Techniques observed in the most sessions were: providing general encouragement (11/12); modelling/demonstrating the behaviour (11/12); providing opportunities for social comparison (11/12); and providing instruction (9/12). Examples of evidence recorded for these are given below:</p>
<list id="list1-1359105311425271" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Providing general encouragement – ‘Facilitator encouraged women when feeding, advising how to make it easier, more comfortable.’ (Session 8)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modelling/demonstrating the behaviour – ‘Demonstrated how to do most things, for example adding ingredients, spreading cheese sauce.’ (Session 3)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Providing opportunities for social comparison – ‘Children challenged each other to eat up the raw veg at the end, until it had all gone, and most had tried most things.’ (Session 2)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Providing instruction – ‘Facilitator encouraged independent learning by providing initial instruction and then allowing children to continue with pizza making by themselves.’ (Session 2)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Techniques used occasionally were: providing feedback on performance (5/12); providing information about others’ approval (3/12); and prompting practice (3/12). Just nine of the total possible 26 techniques were observed in use in any of the 12 sessions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1359105311425271">
<title>Healthy eating messages</title>
<p>The main areas for discussion were the consumption of sugar, fruit and vegetables, and alternative diets, such as cultural or vegetarian. However, no evidence of staff referring to recommended guidelines in relation to any of these areas was observed. Examples from the discussions were recorded as follows (proportion of sessions noted):</p>
<list id="list2-1359105311425271" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Sugar (5/13) – ‘Discussed juice for children – dilution, sugar-free drinks, drinking at mealtime and not between meals.’ (Session 10)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fruit and vegetables (5/13) – ‘Five-a-day not specifically mentioned, however discussed how to include more vegetables in food – cutting up vegetables so that children did not notice them.’ (Session 1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Alternative diets (3/13) – ‘Discussed vegetarian sources of protein.’ (Session 3)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There were missed opportunities where the non-verbal cues, such as posters, leaflets or healthy refreshments, were noted by observers but not mentioned by staff. Examples of such opportunities were recorded as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-1359105311425271" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The eatwell plate/Balance of Good Health (7/13) – ‘Range of healthy snacks were provided. Children and adults were encouraged to try them. No discussion about how these foods fit into a balanced diet.’ (Session 5)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promotion of breastfeeding (4/13) – ‘Women who were breastfeeding seemed happy to do so in the gated baby area, but a private room was also available. No discussion about breastfeeding with any of the women, including those using bottles.’ (Session 5)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While there was evidence of mainly healthy, balanced food choices being modelled in the selection of refreshments provided in the sessions, there was almost no discussion about food choices or healthy eating and no rationale for foods chosen as snacks. While leaflets on healthy eating, covering a range of topics were available, there was no discussion about these, and little attempt to encourage women to consult them or take them away.</p>
<p>There was no discussion by the SSCC staff on the links between diet and health, even in the cookery sessions; these sessions had mixed aims, such as budgeting, but did not always include healthy eating. This was reflected in some of the dishes and ingredients chosen. Some facilitators reported a lack of resources, such as appropriate recipes to support healthy eating, getting their recipes from a variety of sources, including participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1359105311425271">
<title>General observations</title>
<p>Staff adopted a participatory approach in all sessions; hence, parents and children chose many of the activities. A didactic approach was apparent in three sessions, but in only one was it the dominant style, where the facilitator spent a substantial amount of time talking and instructing. In nine out of 12 sessions, it was judged that participants were speaking more than or the same amount as the facilitators. All staff demonstrated a range of good communication and listening skills, plus a generally warm and inclusive style of interaction.</p>
<p>There was limited evidence of staff encouraging participants to debate issues, identify barriers to change or find solutions: brief examples of this occurred in only five out of the 12 sessions. For example: ‘Prompted children to think of accompaniment to their pizzas, and waited until they finally mentioned salad themselves’ (Session 2).</p>
<p>In five of the 12 sessions, needs of the parents/ children were clear from the outset – as children were referred to the group for extra support, or sessions were targeted at a specific population (breastfeeding, weaning), or in one instance because the facilitator asked what participants’ expectations were at the start. All staff considered the aims of the session to have been met and felt it had gone well. The most common achievements noted by the observers in every session were that mothers and children were relaxed, and enjoying themselves. No evaluation tools were visible or mentioned.</p>
<p>Observers noted that facilitators within five of the sessions would benefit from training on communicating healthy eating guidelines, and understanding dietary requirements during pregnancy/weaning or for chronic conditions such as diabetes. In four sessions, observers specifically noted that some understanding of the principles of behaviour change and associated techniques would have enabled facilitators to explore issues and encourage participants to try new things or make changes. Also in four sessions, it was observed that facilitators could have benefited from training in effective group-working, adoption of a more client-centred approach and how to be more organized and structured in the delivery of key messages.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analysis of the expert panel discussion suggested that in order to bring about change in women and families who attended the SSCCs, three key things needed to be achieved: women and families had to trust the Sure Start brand and practitioners; a range of strategies had to be used to meet the needs of families and support staff; and there had to be acknowledgement of the difficulties inherent in making changes to diet. Observations of activities being held in SSCCs suggested that these three things were being achieved to some degree.</p>
<p>The observation work demonstrated what SSCCs do for the community and provided an opportunity to explore the findings from the expert discussion group. The observers noted that staff were delivering a range of services to families with whom they had built good relationships – maximizing the potential for engaging as many families as possible thus reducing the numbers of those considered as hard-to-reach. Observers noted in all sessions that mothers and children were engaged and enjoying themselves, with opportunities to learn from each other. Learning from others’ successes and challenges can be an important mechanism in behaviour change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311425271">Bandura, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the acknowledgement of the value of feedback and evaluation of SSCC activities in the expert panel discussion, there was little evidence of evaluation. Evaluating outcomes without burdening participants is one of the challenges of assessing processes and outcomes in real world settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311425271">Barker and Swift, 2009</xref>). A consequence of not evaluating the sessions is that there are few opportunities for staff to reflect on how the activities are received. Addressing this gap would assist them in evaluating the success of their sessions in meeting the women’s needs.</p>
<p>Any food-related activities provide an ideal opportunity for exploring diet, hence refreshments and recipes provided during sessions were viewed as non-verbal cues to action as well as modelling healthy options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311425271">Food Standards Agency, 2008a</xref>). There was a general lack of discussion about any healthy eating messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311425271">Food Standards Agency, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311425271">2008b</xref>), even when relevant snacks or leaflets were present. There were thus many missed opportunities for discussion, exploration, problem solving and goal setting which could facilitate dietary changes. It was unclear whether this was due to lack of facilitator knowledge or confidence. In the expert panel discussion, practitioners acknowledged the many barriers to eating healthily and considered their role in addressing this. These barriers were consistent with those previously identified by women themselves, such as the cost of healthier foods, and the time needed to cook from scratch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311425271">Barker et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311425271">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>). It was unclear whether practitioners feel able to move beyond acknowledging the barriers experienced by women, to supporting the process of change. While the SSCC environment promotes healthy eating, it may have limited influence outside the building. The observation work suggests that staff could benefit from learning strategies for implementing and discussing healthy eating guidelines, which may make them more effective in supporting behaviour change and influencing women’s eating habits.</p>
<p>Evidence to support the view that practitioners are relatively unskilled in supporting women to change came from observing: a lack of reinforcement of healthy eating messages; missed opportunities to support change; limited reflection on the effectiveness of their session; and the limited use of behaviour change techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311425271">Abraham and Michie, 2008</xref>). Practitioners working with women and children seemed to utilize instinctively some basic behaviour change techniques, such as providing general encouragement, instruction and demonstration. Opportunities for social comparison were provided, as all sessions brought families together for the activities where they could observe and learn from each other. However, in order to maximize opportunities to effect behaviour change, the use of existing techniques needs to be strengthened and staff need to be introduced to other techniques proven to be effective in motivating, encouraging and sustaining positive behaviour change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311425271">Abraham and Michie, 2008</xref>). From the expert panel discussion, there emerged a sense that behaviour change was likely to come in small steps. There is a need for staff to move from empathizing with the difficulties women face towards supporting them to make changes.</p>
<p>Evidence from both the expert panel discussion and the observation work suggests that SSCCs may be the ideal vehicle for intervention. There is a good rationale for this approach, as research shows that interventions with disadvantaged women are more likely to be effective if they are delivered by individuals they trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311425271">Kennedy et al., 2008</xref>). SSCC practitioners understand a great deal about the lives of the women with whom they work, often living in the same communities and experiencing many of the same barriers to making healthy food choices. This gives them insight into how to meet their needs and suggests they may be ideally placed to adopt the role of position advocates or role models to support women to make changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311425271">Michie et al., 2011</xref>). Practitioners do valuable work with this population, but this research highlights some gaps that need addressing in order to make them more effective. Additional training in a range of techniques proven to be useful in motivating, encouraging and sustaining positive behaviour change would be one solution. Staff could benefit from learning strategies for discussing issues to do with healthy eating and how to promote problem solving in the women with whom they work. They could be encouraged to reflect on what is being delivered – why and how it might make a difference – in order to maximize their own effectiveness. An intervention would need to take account of the range of different staff groups that come into contact with this population of women, their differing skill sets and the constraints of the settings within which they interact.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>No claim is made for the views expressed by the expert panel discussion being representative of all staff working with women in Southampton. However, participants were recruited from different work groups within SSCCs across the city to access a range of perspectives. The observation work was also based on a small, purposive sample of SSCC sessions, so again it is not possible to assert that these are representative of all sessions being held across the city. Two of the observation tools were developed by the research team in order to collect data that would address the research question. They have not yet been used in other studies, so no claim is being made as to their validity or reliability. However, two observers attended most sessions together and compared notes to ensure they were coding in a similar and consistent way, finding the tools to be clear and simple to use. They also provided unique insights into SSCC staff practice, leading to increased understanding of the kind of intervention required. Since the completion of this work, the taxonomy has been revised, adopting a more tailored approach to diet and physical activity interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311425271">Michie et al., 2011</xref>). This article provides a preliminary picture of some of the techniques adopted by staff in their current practice.</p>
<p>While this research focuses on women using SSCC services, it is acknowledged that men play an important role in family food choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311425271">Barker et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311425271">Lawrence et al., 2009</xref>) and also attend SSCCs with their families. However, in the year ended March 2011, 84 per cent of the 10,500 parents attending SSCCs in Southampton were women, which we feel justifies our focus on women in this research.</p>
<p>Qualitative data require interpretation and it is acknowledged that another analysis of the transcript could produce a different reading. To minimize the likelihood of the analysis being misrepresentative, two researchers worked closely, following a standard methodology for qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311425271">Boyatzis, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311425271">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311425271">Swift and Tischler, 2010</xref>) in order to develop the coding frame and thematic map until final versions were felt to represent the findings discussed above. These interpretations have subsequently been presented to a range of audiences, including members of the expert panel, who have supported the conclusions presented here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The question addressed by this programme of research was ‘how can women living in disadvantaged areas be supported to improve their diets?’ The work described in the current article suggests that involving SSCC staff in supporting an intervention to promote health behaviour change would be an effective way to address dietary inequalities among disadvantaged women.</p>
