<abstract>
<p>Through an examination of military media management strategies, this article argues that the military are increasingly ‘mediatized’ where the media act as both a rationale and interface for communication within the military, and between the military and their audiences. Informed by ethnographic work with the British military, it is argued that military media management strategies are increasingly organised to appeal to, reassure and elicit support from multiple audiences – particularly the state and the military’s own internal personnel. In an attempt to move beyond conceptualisation of military media management as merely state propaganda, the author explores the degree to which the military, as a relatively autonomous institution, attempts to harness the power of media influence – whilst also protecting against it – in a manner that may be transforming the media–polity–military relationship and is reflective of the processes of mediatization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing recognition that the media play a constitutive role in informing communication between states and their external publics in the enactment of war and international politics. To this end, numerous analyses have focused on the ways in which states attempt to control and restrict information through politically directed military media management. One implication of these analyses – and the one that this article speaks to – is that, by reducing understandings of military media management to notions of state propaganda or mediated public diplomacy, the distinction between political leadership and military action is collapsed. Military media management becomes understood in traditional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212447908">Clausewitzian (1997[1832])</xref> terms as a continuation of state politics. This negates the complexities of military media management strategies that are designed to appeal to multiple publics, including those who govern the military. Consequently, the degree to which the military engage in relatively autonomous decision-making, motivated by their own institutional goals, remains unobserved and the media–polity– military relationship becomes oversimplified.</p>
<p>In an effort to interrogate some of these issues, this article explores how the military potentially negotiate political conflict and assurances (with its own personnel and with its political governors) in and through the media. The extent to which these negotiations are successful is not specifically addressed here, nor are the implications of such negotiations for the conduct of war. Instead, informed by ethnographic work with the British military, and based upon their own claims, this is an empirically grounded account of how military media management strategies, and the principles on which they are founded, are indicative of the processes and consequences of mediatization. Essentially, this article suggests that with the progressive integration of the media into their operations, the military’s interaction with those in and beyond their own institution increasingly take place through and via the media in a manner that submits to, and is dependent on, the media and their logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750635212447908">Hjarvard, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750635212447908">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750635212447908">Silverstone, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Before proceeding, it is important to highlight that the data on which this article is based were collected under terms in which no information could be quoted or accredited to particular military personnel, unless it was already in the public domain. Consequently, findings are referenced with a footnote highlighting their source (i.e. date of ethnographic work or interview) unless triangulated with information available in the public domain. It is acknowledged that that there are limitations to this form of referencing data. However, its summative nature is a necessary stylistic device utilised to present findings that are substantiated in rich empirical data obtained from an essentially under-researched institution.</p>

<title>Military media management: Media operations</title>
<p>The British military is a complex institution engaged in a range of activities at a diplomatic, political and military level. On the one hand, it is a government resourced and directed institution, accountable to parliament and the electorate. On the other, it is an institution with its own goals, rules, culture, identity and working practices. These combined elements are reflected throughout the structure and execution of military media management called ‘Media Operations’. For the British military, the organisational structure of Media Operations is symptomatic of a necessary adaptation to the political and media environments in which it operates. The ways in which this is articulated by the military is key to understanding how it sees itself as an independent institution responding to the contingencies produced by the combination of media reportage and political governance. The following discussion is both an indication of those factors the military consider salient to the organisation Media Operations, and a precursor to an interrogation of these same factors in relation to the ‘mediatized’ nature of the media–polity–military relationship.</p>
<p>According to the British military, the organisation of Media Operations is goal oriented, designed to limit contingencies and to safeguard the institution’s future. This is reflected in its fundamental goals. These goals are defined by military members and expressed discursively in the training of staff and through the military’s internal cultural practices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750635212447908">1</xref></sup> They are:</p>
<list id="list1-1750635212447908" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To protect and maintain the British military organization now, and in the future, in terms of securing resources, recruitment and retention.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To protect British military organization members, including relatives of those members, particularly in terms of sustaining morale and a will to work.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To achieve operational success in terms of attaining operational aims and protecting operational security.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These broad goals constitute the stable aims of the British military as a collective institution. They do not entirely reflect the goals of wider political governance, but instead signify what the military consider essential to the continued success of their own institution, independent of political direction. In this sense, they epitomise how the military conceptualises its institution as relatively autonomous, governed by its own internal politics and working practices. These goals also act as a framework for the development of more fluid, subsidiary goals related to specific operational aims, including Media Operations. The goals of Media Operations are also abstract but embody the challenges that the military consider the media environment presents to both operations and the institution. In no order of priority, they can be summarised as:</p>
<list id="list2-1750635212447908" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To retain ‘freedom of manoeuvre’ from political intervention.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To gain and maintain domestic political support for military activity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To gain and maintain public support for military activity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To achieve operational success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To protect operational security, including protecting British military organization members.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To maintain internal morale.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To gain and maintain alliance cohesion during an operation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To counter the enemy information campaign.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It is in its articulation of these goals that the military implicitly identify the significant influence it believes the media have on the military’s ability to achieve operational and fundamental goals. As such, these goals indicate the extent to which the military believe it necessary to integrate the media into the military’s planning to manage media influence. To this end, the military has developed doctrine and procedures from which it tries to initiate when, how and why the media report on their activities. In particular, the military recognises that it is in its interests to appreciate and cater for – rather than obstruct – the information-gathering needs of the media. It is here that the military’s submission to, and dependence upon the media and their logic, is most evident. Media Operations, and by extension other military activities, is thus organised around the media in an effort to harness the rewards of media influence, or manage the contingencies that media influence may bring to bear on the military institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">JWP, 2001</xref>, 3–45: 1A–2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212447908">JWP, 2007</xref>, 3–45.1: 3–2).</p>
<p>Critical to this process is the military’s appraisal of audiences because it is ultimately the recipient of media coverage with whom they are trying to communicate. In this appraisal, the military imagine how audiences may respond to media coverage of its activities and the bearing of that response on an operation and the military institution (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750635212447908">Goffman, 1969</xref>: 47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212447908">Mead, 1967</xref>). It then organises Media Operations’ work on the basis of these assumptions, incorporating what they believe will best influence audience responses in its favour. Such imaginings are further suggestive of a mediatized military. They not only indicate the extent to which the military conceive of media audiences as enablers of goal attainment, but also highlight why and how the military increasingly interact with significant ‘others’ through and with the media. This is further evidenced in the ways in which the military classify media audiences into various groups including public, military, political, adversary, civilians in theatre, etc. The distinction between audience groups is important. The imagined response of a group, and the implications of that response for goal attainment, will determine the strategies employed and ‘message’ communicated. For the purposes of this article, the following discussion focuses on the ways in which the military attempt to communicate with, and imagine the responses of, three key audience groups. These groups are further differentiated by their relationship to the military institution as either external or internal: the internal military audience, the external political audience and the external public audience.</p>
<p>The internal military audience comprises military personnel and their families, otherwise known as ‘dependants’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">JWP, 2001</xref>, 3–45: IB–1). Aware that service personnel have access to media coverage on deployed operations and also receive information about media coverage from their own kin back in the UK, the media become a means through which to communicate with this audience group.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On operations, many Service personnel become avid news watchers/listeners, tuning in to Satellite TV, BBC World Service and the Internet. Much of their knowledge of the wider operation in which they are involved develops from the information put across by the general media, rather than through the chain of command. JWP 3-45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">2001</xref>: IB-1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst some media coverage is argued to generate positive responses among the internal audience, the military have particular concerns about the effects of negative media coverage on recruitment, retention, the will to work and morale (pp. 1–5). Morale is a significant element of military work and is integral to the achievement of fundamental goals. According to one military member, it is the most important dimension of fighting power needed to secure the will of each military member to deliver what is needed in the battle space.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750635212447908">2</xref></sup> Indeed, British Defence Doctrine states: ‘No doctrine, plan or formula for conducting warfare is likely to succeed without the maintenance of morale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750635212447908">JDP, 2008</xref>, 0–01: 2–3). Friends and families of service personnel become especially important in this regard because concerns generated by media coverage may be communicated back to service personnel in a battle space via telephone calls and letters, further undermining morale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750635212447908">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Families are a key audience for Media Operations. They have a direct effect on the morale of the deployed force. While the chain of command will attempt to keep dependants fully involved, the reality is that TV news and the print media are a major source of information for many Service families. (pp. 3–45)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Consequently, Media Operations is organised around attempts to secure positive media coverage of military activities in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of the internal audience for two key reasons. The first, as illustrated above, is because the media provide a direct communicative channel through which the military attempt to sustain morale and retention among service personnel. The second, and related, is because media coverage is often believed to reflect the public mood. Coupled with this, morale and a will to work are seen as being contingent on positive and supportive responses from the public. As such, positive media coverage tends to be equated with public support which, in turn, is believed to be highly influential on the sustaining of morale. Thus, the media also become an indirect channel of communication through which the military attempt to gain public support in order to protect its own institution. Of course, such correlations between media coverage and public mood are founded on rather simplistic notions regarding media effects, the implications of which are considered in more detail below. For now, it is enough to note that the cumulative effect of this orientation to the media and their audiences is that the media become both the rationale and interface for military interactions with their internal audience. The same is true regarding its interactions with the political audience.</p>
<p>The political audience comprises ‘opinion formers’ and key decision makers in the national and international community (including members of parliament, political advisors and defence analysts) whose opinion may hold sway on the direction of government, alliance thinking and policy development. In contrast to the internal audience, the political audience is conceived of as external to the military institution but highly influential on it. Indeed, when considering the bearing of audience responses on its future actions, it is particularly important for the military to take account of those who control it, or upon whom it is dependent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750635212447908">Mead, 1967</xref>: 158). For the military, this audience group is its political governors whose continued support in terms of resource allocation and operational independence is critical to the continuation of military institution. At the same time, political support is believed to be partly contingent on the perceived support of the electorate – categorised here as the public audience – which obtains most, if not all of its information about military activities from the media. It is here that the responses of the public audience are seen by the military as critically interrelated with those of the political audience:
<disp-quote>
<p>Public support from the UK audience enhances a commander’s freedom of action, making him less vulnerable to external interference and overly restrictive Rules of Engagement (ROE). Support from international and regional audiences tends to enhance freedom of manoeuvre through consent … A positive portrayal of the military, particularly when operational success is achieved, supports the longer-term justification for resources. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750635212447908">JWP, 2007</xref>, 3–45.1 : 1–3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For the military then, popular support translates into political support, which in turn, translates into military independence and security. Again, it is the public audience whose imagined responses, indirectly, have significant influence on the military institution and its operations.</p>
<p>Categorised as external to the military institution, the public audience comprises the nation’s domestic home audience (in this case, the UK public). As suggested above, its responses are rarely considered in isolation to other audience groups. Rather, the military tend to conceptualise the response of the public audience in terms of how it may inform or influence the responses of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">JWP, 2001</xref>, 3–45: 22). However, whilst the responses of the internal and political audiences may be manifest in measurable actions (such as sustained morale, retention, political intervention or increased resources), expressions of support from the public audience are inherently difficult to determine. Indeed, with the exception of some external audience polling undertaken by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the military is essentially devoid of means with which to measure that actual impact of media coverage on the public audience. Instead, in the absence of tangible data, it tends to correlate public support with favourable media coverage of its activities. This is especially the case if the coverage reinforces those themes and messages the military is attempting to communicate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750635212447908">4</xref></sup> Hence, when the military takes account of audience responses in the formulation of its ongoing actions, what it is actually doing is taking account of media reportage and organising its activities on the basis of this assessment. By extension, it is the media – rather than the public – that influences military interactions with their internal and political audiences. Messages designed to appeal to and negotiate with these audience groups, and in turn assist with the achievement of fundamental goals, are therefore organised <italic>around</italic> and <italic>through</italic> the media. This is indicative of the processes of mediatization where institutions attempt to exploit the power of the media whilst concurrently utilising the same media as a barometer of their success in this regard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1750635212447908">
<title>The long screwdriver</title>
<p>With this in mind, the discussion will now turn to the ways in which the military attempts to strategically utilise the media to influence the media–polity–military relationship for its own gain. The motivation for doing so is fundamentally related to the ways in which the military conceptualise their own situated agency within the media and political environments in which it operates. On the whole, the military believe that it is a go-between in the media–polity–military relationship: a vehicle through which the media can criticise wider governmental policy. This is particularly evident in the military’s repeated use of the phrase: ‘We are a stick with which to beat government.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750635212447908">5</xref></sup> By implication, the military argue that the media consistently report negatively on aspects of military activity to challenge government. In particular, they cite recurring topics that the media focus on, including tension between coalition partners or military–political liaisons; the efficacy of military equipment; incidents of military or civilian casualties; and ‘mission creep’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750635212447908">6</xref></sup> One critical consequence of this ‘stick beating’ – as understood by the military – is that it can threaten the attainment of the military’s own goals, particularly ‘freedom of manoeuvre from political intervention’.</p>
<p>Political intervention, as the term suggests, is when politicians intervene in military matters. According to the military, political intervention can manifest itself in a number of ways, including restrictions on the type and numbers of weapons, numbers of troops deployed, or the involvement of political leaders in tactical level decisions such as battle plans. The latter is referred to as the ‘long screwdriver’ among military personnel:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750635212447908">7</xref></sup> a colloquial term used to describe the collapsing of strategic and tactical decisions by politicians, often against the judgment of military tacticians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1750635212447908">8</xref></sup> Examples cited by military personnel have included the political enforcement of a medium-range air campaign (15,000 ft above ground) in Kosovo (1999) despite standard RAF practice to operate at low-range (50 ft above ground) for safety and better visibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1750635212447908">9</xref></sup> This type of political involvement is particularly resented by the military. In extreme cases, it suggests that it can undermine the security of an operation and increase the risks to personnel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1750635212447908">10</xref></sup> Overall, however, the military argue that it negates the importance of the specialist military knowledge needed for tactical decision making and compromises military independence. Whilst the military consider some level of political intervention inevitable, it also correlates it with adverse media coverage of military activity which it believes creates a political imperative to intervene.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1750635212447908">11</xref></sup> Indeed, others have noted that when conventional distinctions between tactical military planning and strategic political actions are collapsed in media reportage, military autonomy is critically undermined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750635212447908">Badsey, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750635212447908">Peri, 2006</xref>). For the military, then, securing favourable media coverage through Media Operations helps to alleviate the intrusions of the long screwdriver.</p>
<p>Of course, the military’s interactions with its political governors are primarily conducted through an internal hierarchical chain of command and the Ministry of Defence. Despite this, and as the long screwdriver suggests, the military state that negotiations with and accountability to its political governors are increasingly conducted through the media.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1750635212447908">12</xref></sup> As a result, it emphasises that it must be seen to publicly adhere to and reinforce political objectives in media coverage. Similarly, and due to the increased diplomatic and multi-lateral elements to military operations, the military state it is also important to maintain a united ‘front’ with its political governors and coalition partners: ‘not only is it imperative to maintain a common media line at national level, but also it is equally important to ensure cohesion and to present a unified international front, in order to underline allied intent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">JWP, 2001</xref>: 3–45: 1–3). Indeed, because of the inherent newsworthiness of fractures in the united front, the military state that it is vital that it protects against – or manages appropriately – the media exposure of inconsistencies: ‘Recent campaigns have highlighted the need to harmonise key media messages and themes to counter the media’s tendency to expose differences and to exploit these for news purposes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750635212447908">JWP, 2001</xref>, 3–45: 1–3).</p>
<p>Consequently, echoing the traditional conceptualisation of the military–political relationship as subordinate and cohesive, the military argue that they try to incorporate and reinforce relevant political, diplomatic and coalition objectives in all their dealings with the media. In so doing, they attempt to construct a coherent and united relationship with their political governors in and through the media. This, in effect, is a performance of accountability based on their desire to avoid the long screwdriver and elicit sufficient political resources for the wider military institution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1750635212447908">13</xref></sup> The military therefore utilise the media as a communicative interface between themselves and their political governors (and by extension the public audience) to advance their own institutional aims. Yet, the media are more than a channel of communication in this regard, for it is precisely because of the media’s powerful influential properties that contingencies like the long screwdriver are generated in the first place. In short, without adverse media reportage generating a political imperative to intervene, the long screwdriver would be less likely to occur. Once again, the media provide the rationale <italic>and</italic> interface for interactions between the military and their audiences, and the institutional activities of the military come to be organised around this fact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1750635212447908">
<title>‘The stick with which to beat government’</title>
<p>Officially then, the military attempt to construct a united ‘front’ with its political governors in media reportage. Concurrently, however, it suggests that such a cohesive approach can engender conflict if the methods, application or ethos of its political governors (or indeed coalition partners) differ from its own. One military member, for example, suggested that NATO’s Media Operations policy was fairly reactive compared to that of the British military.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1750635212447908">14</xref></sup> In a further example concerning the protection of journalists, one military member stated that the US military viewed journalists as having no legal right to be within an area of US military activity. In contrast, the British military believes that journalists have every right to be in an area of operational activity, but have no legal right to expect military protection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1750635212447908">15</xref></sup> In these circumstances, particularly when the other coalition party is dominant, the military state that it is usually forced to alter its existing practices so as not to destabilise its relations with these parties or threaten the united ‘front’. In effect, this is the long screwdriver of coalition diplomacy and can be particularly resented by military personnel if it undermines the operational focus of their work.</p>
<p>Thus, despite proclamations to the contrary, the military are occasionally willing to compromise the united ‘front’ if maintaining it threatens the attainment of its own goals, particularly those related to internal personnel. These compromised performances are noteworthy for two reasons. First, they exemplify the degree to which the military are increasingly prepared to utilise the media to communicate with the internal, political and public audience in a manner that it hopes will assist with the attainment of goals. Second, but related, compromised performances illustrate how in order to secure media coverage of its message, the military orient their actions towards what it believes will best appeal to the media, especially ‘fractures’ in the united front. During the Iraq War, for example, a senior British military spokesman exposed fractures between the UK and US military by openly criticising the US military’s media management for its lack of efficiency:
<disp-quote>
<p>The media adviser we had here was an expert in his field. His US counterpart was evasive and not around as much as he should have been when it came to talking to the media. What happened was, in reality, you had two different styles of news media management and I feel fortunate enough to be part of the UK one. (Interview with Group Captain Al Lockwood, <italic>Correspondent: War Spin</italic>, BBC 2, 18 May 2003)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to the BBC, the military reinforced these sentiments in a complaint to Alistair Campbell stating that the US military news management team were not ‘up to the job’ and that ‘the Jessica Lynch presentation was embarrassing’ (BBC 2, 18 May 2003). Such inconsistencies in the united front are indicative of the potential discord between the coalition partners. However, to reveal these assertions to the media is in stark contrast to the military claim that media messages must be harmonised. Rather, they are suggestive of a public distancing from potentially ‘embarrassing’ or damaging actions of coalition partners. In short, to collude with the US military’s presentations would undermine the military’s own institutional ‘front’ among other audiences, especially among its internal audience.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is often with the internal audience in mind that the military expose fractures to the media. Thus, when the US military injured members of the British military in a friendly fire incident in 2003, both Channel 4 and the BBC reported that British troops were expressing increasing anger towards their US counterparts. This was supported by an interview with an injured British soldier who accused the US pilots of being ‘cowboys’, ‘trigger happy’ and ‘having no regard for human life’ (BBC News, 28 March 2003; Channel 4 News, 28 March 2003). From a political perspective, such accusations can be particularly damaging in their undermining of the united front. It is therefore unsurprising that UK Forces Minister, Adam Ingram, publicly questioned the validity of the soldier’s comments in light of his recent traumatic experience, asserting that the media interview was neither objective nor appropriate and, in fact, seriously undermining of the military’s duty of care to soldiers (BBC 1 and Channel 4 News, 31 March 2003). In contrast, for the military – who presumably permitted media access to the soldier for the interview – such expressions of resistance to (rather than acquiescence with) actions that had incurred casualties were better aligned to the reassuring of the internal audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1750635212447908">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, when two British soldiers were killed in an ambush during the Iraq War, Prime Minister Tony Blair quickly defined the incident in the media as an ‘execution’ and one of a number of atrocities committed by the Iraqi Regime:

<p>The release of those pictures of executed British Soldiers, if anyone needed further evidence of the depravity of Saddam’s regime, this atrocity provides it. It is yet one more flagrant breach of all the proper conventions of war. (Tony Blair, speech from Camp David BBC News, 27 March 2003)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In contrast, members of the British military privately stated that it was difficult to prove with any certainty that an execution had taken place,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1750635212447908">17</xref></sup> and publicly announced that, according to their analysis of the Al Jazeera footage, they ‘may’ have been executed (Channel 4 News, 27 March 2003). One military member argued that this deliberate undermining of the Prime Minister’s ‘execution’ definition (albeit a subtle one) was motivated by the military’s desire to protect morale among the internal audience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1750635212447908">18</xref></sup> Indeed, for the military, the communication of a (re)definition that might reassure the internal audience was of greater importance than publicly acquiescing with its political governors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1750635212447908">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Examples such as these are suggestive of how the military may be increasingly willing to renounce political subordination in and through the media for their own gain. When asserting its autonomy in this way, the military can be seen to be exploiting their position within the mediatized media–polity–military relationship by reversing the conditions under which it is usually enacted. Thus, contrary to being the vehicle through which the media criticises government, the military use the media to challenge its political governors. Indeed, such military critique in the media has been more evident amid the increasing disillusionment with the strategic organisation of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1750635212447908">20</xref></sup> In 2008, for example, Colonel Tim Collins, Commander of British troops during the Iraq war, was reported as criticising the government for poor strategic war planning and deficient resources (<italic>The Times</italic>, 17 December 2007; <italic>The Guardian</italic>, 14 April 2009). Similarly, Major-General Arthur Denaro was reported as openly condemning the government over the Iraq War: ‘I believe the Government has been very careless and lacked interest and hasn’t put in enough resources’ (BBC, Today Programme, 17 July 2008; see also <italic>The Times</italic>, 18 July 2008). Of course, it is noteworthy that both these challenges emanated from retired military officers who were therefore no longer obligated to maintain their subordinate role.</p>
<p>In 2006, however, serving officer Chief of General Staff Sir General Richard Dannatt was reported to be particularly defiant towards political leaders (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, 13 October 2006; <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>, 13 October 2006). Through the media, Dannatt first campaigned for better pay conditions for service personnel, arguing that soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan were working in highly dangerous conditions with little monetary reward (<italic>The Independent</italic>, 11 September 2006; see also <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>, 5 June 2008). He then condemned attempts to impose a liberal democracy in Iraq as ‘naive’, arguing that the presence of British service personnel was ‘exacerbating hostilities’ (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, 12 October 2006). Lastly, he challenged Prime Minister Tony Blair’s assertion that the military would stay in Iraq for ‘as long as it takes’ by stressing that troops should withdraw from Iraq within two years (<italic>Daily Mail</italic>, 13 October 2006; BBC News, 13 October 2006). In a rebuttal, Blair announced that early withdrawal would be ‘disastrous’ (BBC News footage of Prime Minister’s Questions, 18 October 2006) but in 2008 <italic>The Sunday Times</italic> reported that Dannatt’s criticisms had ‘forced [Gordon] Brown to say he would look again at forces’ pay’ (15 June 2008). Finally, in 2009, with his retirement imminent, the media reported that Dannatt had ‘infuriated ministers’ for publicly calling for more troops and better equipment in Afghanistan (BBC Today Programme, 21 July 2009; see also <italic>The Times</italic>, 18 July 2009).</p>
<p>Of course, it is difficult to be conclusive about the various facets of these cases without verification. Despite this, they are important examples. First, they are suggestive of how, in the military’s attempts to communicate with multiple audiences, the reassurance of the internal audience takes precedence over the performance of accountability to its political governors. As Dannatt himself claimed in 2009:
<disp-quote>
<p>What is important is the soldiers knew how much pressure they were under, they knew that I would fight their case – if you like – from within the tent. But they also had to have the confidence, because they listen to the radio, they watch the tele, they read the newspapers; they needed to know that their boss was actually out there for them as well as out there for the operations. That’s why I did what I did and I am afraid that every word was considered and calculated. (General Sir Richard Dannatt, BBC Today Programme, 21 July 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Second, they are suggestive of how the military may be increasingly willing to utilise the media in an attempt to manipulate the political environment in which it is situated. The response of the public cannot be underestimated in this regard. If popular support is believed to translate into political support, appealing to the electorate in a manner that might increase political pressure becomes critical to the success of the communication. This is, in effect, a reversal of the long screwdriver whereby the military exploit the media to create an imperative for political intervention but, crucially, in accordance with military demands. Rather than the military being the stick with which the media beat government, the media become the stick with which the military themselves beat government. Of course, the media is not a passive agent in this regard. Indeed, if, as the military suggest, it is the vehicle through which the media–polity relationship is enacted, then the military and media essentially become co-conspirators in the ‘beating of government’. In short, whilst the military define their activities in a manner that conforms to media logic to court media attention, the media can also be seen to prioritise and favour these definitions in order to challenge and critique wider government policy. It is through this process that traditional conceptualisations of military–political relations as subordinate or cohesive become fundamentally challenged.</p>

<sec id="section5-1750635212447908">
<title>The mediatized military</title>
<p>The tension between political thought and military action has long been recognised in analyses of military–political relations. Some conceptualisations of this tension evoke the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750635212447908">Clausewitzian (1997[1832])</xref> importance of military subordination to political leadership whilst others, although paying heed to Clausewitz, stress the importance of military autonomy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750635212447908">Finer, 2003[1962]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635212447908">Janowitz, 1971</xref>). Yet, traditional analyses of military media management tend to overlook such tensions. In so doing, they disregard the potential for military autonomy and reduce media management strategies (and content) to a continuation of state politics. Here it has been suggested that such analyses are oversimplified, particularly when considered alongside the growth of media visibility and media influence. Instead, this article suggests that like other institutions - such as the police - the military increasingly engage with the media to achieve its own institutional goals and protect against vulnerabilities (see, in particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212447908">Doyle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750635212447908">Ericson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750635212447908">Gitlin, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750635212447908">Manning, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1750635212447908">Schlesinger and Tumber, 1994</xref>). It is in its articulation of these institutional goals that the military signifies the extent to which it conceptualises its institution as relatively autonomous, governed by its own rules, culture, identity and working practices as much as wider political governance. It is also in the articulation of these goals that the military indicates why it is critical for it to integrate the media into its institutional planning: in order to harness the rewards of media influence and manage the contingencies that media influence may generate.</p>
<p>On the one hand, this integration of the media into military planning can be seen to be reflective of a necessary adaptation to changes outside the military structure, particularly in the media environment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750635212447908">Badsey, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750635212447908">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750635212447908">Janowitz, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750635212447908">Moskos, 1992</xref>). On the other hand, however, as this article suggests, military engagement with the media is not merely responsive and adaptive but is in fact proactive, based on the recognition that the media are of strategic importance to the attainment of institutional goals. To this end, the military consciously and purposefully organize their activities with the needs of the media in mind so as to influence the media–polity–military relationship to their advantage.</p>
<p>Critical to this influence is the military’s ability to communicate with significant audience groups. Messages are therefore designed to appeal to, and negotiate with these audiences <italic>through</italic> and <italic>with</italic> the media. It has been suggested here that the military are especially dependent on its political governors for resources and independence. As a result, it consistently performs accountability to this audience through the media. However, military dependence on the political audience is also relative to its dependence on the internal audience because it is the internal audience upon whom it depends for morale, retention and operational success. Hence, the military may – and has – consciously and deliberately jeopardize(d) a performance of subordination to reassure the internal audience and thereby protect wider institutional goals. In so doing, the military are not passively acquiescing with the demands of its political governors in traditional Clausewitzian terms. Rather, in the knowledge of media influence, the military intentionally attempts to harness its power for their own strategic gain (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750635212447908">Cottle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Inherent to this process of harnessing media power is the logic of the media. This logic becomes an implicit orientation framework, guiding and influencing the structure and organization of military activities in a manner that conforms to media production (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750635212447908">Altheide and Snow, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750635212447908">Mazzoleni, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750635212447908">Schrott, 2009</xref>). The more dependent the military are on audiences, the more this media logic shapes and reshapes its actions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750635212447908">Doyle, 2003</xref>). It is here that the processes and consequences of mediatization are most evident. For not only does the military increasingly interact – with those within and beyond the institution – through and with the media, but it does so precisely because of the influence the media may bring to bear on the military’s and others’ actions. Moreover, due to the perceived correlation between media coverage and wider public responses, the success of these interactions and their influence is also measured through media reportage. It is therefore the media – not the audience – that influences and transforms the organisation of military activities. It is in this solipsistic understanding of its own, and others’ orientation to the media that the military can be seen to be increasingly mediatized, where the transformative power of the media acts as both a rationale and interface for military media management.</p>
