<abstract>
<p>We report here Japan’s first pediatric perfusion survey. It covers practices from January 2007 through December 2009. Of the 70 congenital heart centers contacted, 53 (76%) completed the survey. They reported performing 3,379 pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedures in 2009, 3,408 in 2008, and 3,358 in 2007.Twenty-eight percent of all centers used CPB circuits with a priming volume between 151-200 ml. All centers used pre-bypass ultrafiltration and only 6% used retrograde autologous priming. A biomaterial-coated circuit was used by 78% of the centers, a roller pump as the arterial pump by 91%, vacuum-assisted venous drainage by 39%, dilutional ultrafiltration by 48%, and modified ultrafiltration at the end of the procedure by 30%. A regional oxygen saturation monitor was used by 69% of the centers and high flow (150-200 ml/kg/min) management with alpha-stat blood gas control was standard during moderate to normothermic CPBs. Crystalloid cardioplegia solution was used as myocardial protection by 56% of the centers, electronic recording of monitoring data by 51%. The centers performed 98 pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedures in 2007, 109 in 2008, and 119 in 2009; 58% of the centers used a centrifugal pump. This survey provides a description of the current practice in Japan. Future surveys will identify trends and rate of change in practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The history of perfusion is marked by serious challenges and major accomplishments. John Gibbon’s development of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine in 1953 marked the beginning of cardiopulmonary support during cardiovascular surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111424638">1</xref></sup>. The technique of CPB was widely implanted by Kirklin, Lillehei, and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424638">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111424638">4</xref></sup>. It has become an indispensable tool for cardiovascular surgery, whose progress has been astonishing. In congenital heart surgery, the improved results and lower mortality rate that have followed from evidence-based perfusion (EBP) practices are of special note.</p>
<p>In 2005, with the goal of providing an infrastructure for collaboration between healthcare professionals interested in the analysis of outcomes of treatments provided to patients with congenital cardiac disease, and the ultimate aim of improvement in the quality of care provided to these patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111424638">5</xref></sup>, the International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion was established as a collaboration of perfusion societies, clinicians, and industry to improve the delivery of care and outcomes for patients worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111424638">6</xref></sup>. It should lead to the highest quality of comprehensive care to all congenital heart disease patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111424638">5</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An estimated 9,000 congenital heart surgery procedures are conducted annually in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111424638">7</xref></sup>. To date, little is known about actual perfusion management and the organization framework for perfusion in Japan. A clinical database covering multiple congenital heart centers that collects data on perfusion performance would enable us to establish a database that would lead to improved EBP techniques. However, we have, as yet, no basis for a pediatric perfusion database in Japan. The aim of the survey was to determine current practice across Japanese centers. The unit of analysis for this study was individual centers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0267659111424638" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>We sent a 45-question perfusion survey in June 2010 by government mail and electronic mail to chief perfusionists in 70 congenital heart centers in Japan. We asked the recipients to fill in blanks and check all applicable boxes based on the predominant practices in their center. We clarified inconsistencies in the survey results by contacting respondents by e-mail or by phone.</p>
<p>The survey, which enquired about perfusion practices from January 2007 through December 2009, covered pediatric caseloads, CPB circuits (priming volume, solution, coating), CPB components (arterial pump, oxygenator, heart-lung machine), CPB monitoring (regional oxygen saturation monitor, in-line monitor, electronic recording), CPB management (perfusion flow, temperature, filtration, vacuum-assisted venous drainage, blood transfusion), blood gas management, hypothermia technique, myocardial protection (cardioplegia solution, temperature), pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and employment of perfusionists.</p>

<title>Priming solution</title>
<p>The most frequently used crystalloid priming solutions were Ringer’s lactate solution (39% of centers), Ringer’s acetate solution (22%), bicarbonated Ringer’s solution (18%), bicarbonate replacement fluid (11%), normal saline (4%) and others (6%). For standard colloid priming solutions, usage was 25% albumin (56% of centers), 20% albumin (9%), 5% albumin (18.5%), fresh frozen plasma (2%), low molecular weight dextran (3.7%) and no usage (10.8%). The drugs most frequently added to the priming solution were heparin, mannitol, sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics, and steroids. All centers employed pre-bypass ultrafiltration for blood priming-28% of the centers used 500 mL and 25% used 1000 mL. Only 6% of the centers employed retrograde autologous priming, and 55% used priming solutions at 36-37°C.</p>

Several perfusion surveys have been published on different aspects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111424638">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424638">14</xref></sup>. Groom et al. regularly report pediatric perfusion surveys in North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111424638">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111424638">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424638">15</xref></sup>. Multicenter organizations such as the Multi-Societal Database Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease and the International Consortium for Evidence-Based Perfusion can facilitate collaboration between healthcare providers interested in improving the quality of care delivered to congenital heart disease patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111424638">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111424638">6</xref></sup>. Although we are aware of the importance of evidenced-based “best practices” in perfusion and in initiating quality improvement in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424638">9</xref></sup>, we have not yet established a formal community to manage a special database for pediatric perfusion. As an initial step to that end, we report here our first pediatric perfusion survey.</p>
<p>In over 70% of the centers, 2 perfusionists worked on each pediatric perfusion procedure, the number recommended for safety management and good clinical outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424638">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, more than 70% of the perfusionists were certified (20% were undergoing clinical training). The median number of CPB procedures performed per center per year in our study was 50, which is about 39% of the number performed in France (128 in 2005), and the mean number performed by each perfusionist in Japan (72% of perfusionists performed less than 50) was less than 1/3 the number performed in France (134 in 2005; range, 22-322)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424638">17</xref></sup>. The difference may be due to Japan having many more congenital heart centers per population than France (1 per 200,000 vs. 1 per 400,000). Alternatively, the number of perfusionists per patient load may be greater in Japan. The low number of procedures performed by each perfusionist in Japan suggests that perfusionists may not gain enough practice to maintain their skills and that could engender a safety risk. For both patient safety and job security, it would be better to have a better balance of employment and caseload.</p>
<p>The use of oxygenators with an integrated arterial filter permits lower priming volumes, but only 1/4 of the Japanese centers used that setup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0267659111424638">Table 2</xref>). We found that vacuum-assisted venous drainage was not a standard perfusion technique, probably because gaseous microemboli are associated with it and trouble-shooting is difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659111424638">18</xref></sup>. Retrograde autologous priming was also not standard, probably because perfusionists want to avoid the complexity it involves at the start of the CPB. Since the Boston hematocrit trials suggested the potential advantage of a higher hematocrit level during hypothermic CPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111424638">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659111424638">21</xref></sup>, the trend in Japan has been to maintain hematocrit levels at over 25% during hypothermic CPB, especially during complex congenital heart surgery. Thus, most pediatric perfusionists avoid the non-transfusion CPB technique and vacuum-assisted venous drainage and retrograde autologous priming are not necessary for non-transfusion CPB techniques for young children. Hence, reducing the priming volume of the CPB circuit may not be important in the management of perfusion safety, especially in complex cases.</p>
<p>Concerning CPB components and circuits, the Terumo RX-05 oxygenator was popular because of its low priming volume, and the Sorin heart-lung machine was used predominantly. In General, products made in Japan were preferred, probably because of their easy maintenances and customizability.</p>
<p>We found that high flow management with alpha-stat blood gas control was standard during moderate to normothermic CPB. A North American survey taken in 2002, however, reported an increase in the use of pH-stat control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424638">15</xref></sup>, a technique that had become standard after 1993<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424638">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111424638">22</xref></sup>, but shifted to alpha-stat management to avoid deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in the presence of moderate to mild hypothermia. Related to that was the aggressive use of ultrafiltration methods such as pre-bypass, dilutional, and modified ultrafiltration, which may elevate the metabolic rate and increase collateral flow, to manage higher temperatures settings. Both high flow management and ultrafiltration methods might help acid-base management.</p>
<p>Crystalloid cardioplegia was the predominant solution used for myocardial protection. In North America, 67% of centers used blood cardioplegia in 2002<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424638">15</xref></sup>. Future surveys will track how this changes.</p>
<p>In-line continuous blood gas monitoring, which is recommended by the Japanese Society of Extra-corporeal Technology, was used at over 50% of the centers and is increasing due to a keen awareness of perfusion safety management in Japan. In Australia and New Zealand, in contrast, only 5.2% of centers reported in-line blood gas monitoring routinely in 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424638">9</xref></sup>. The technique is costly, so differences in usage may follow from differences in medical insurance systems (in-line monitoring is covered by medical insurance in Japan).</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have outlined the results of the first pediatric perfusion survey in Japan and compared some of the results with those of similar surveys conducted in other countries. Our survey lays the foundation for a Japanese pediatric perfusion database. Although we recognize the importance of “experience-based” practices to congenital heart surgery, we believe that data are also important and are necessary if we are to place perfusion on a sound scientific footing. We will update the survey at regular intervals so as to detail the progression of changes of pediatric perfusion practices in Japan.</p>
