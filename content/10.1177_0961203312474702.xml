<title>Objectives</title>
<p>The English version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Quality of Life Questionnaire (SLEQOL) is a validated disease-specific quality of life instrument. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Thai version of the SLEQOL (SLEQOL-TH).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Two independent translators translated the SLEQOL into Thai. The back translation of this version was performed by two other independent translators. The final version, SLEQOL-TH, was completed after resolving the discrepancies revealed by the back translation. One hundred and nine patients with SLE were enrolled to test the reliability, construct validity, floor and ceiling effects, and sensitivity to the changes of the SLEQOL-TH at six months. The differential item functioning (DIF) between the Thai and English versions was analyzed using the partial gamma.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>The internal consistency of the SLEQOL-TH was satisfactory with the overall Cronbach’s alpha of 0.86. The test-retest reliability of the SLEQOL-TH was acceptable with the intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.86. Low correlations between the SLEQOL-TH and SLEDAI were observed. The total score of the SLEQOL-TH was moderately responsive to changes in quality of life, with a standardized response mean of 0.50. When comparing the SLEQOL-TH from Thai SLE patients with the original SLEQOL version obtained from Singapore SLE patients, 11 out of 40 items showed a moderate to large DIF.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH has acceptable psychometric properties and shows construct validity. In comparison with the English version of SLEQOL, there are some items that showed DIF. The applicability of the SLEQOL-TH in real-life clinical practice and clinical trials needs to be determined.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203312474702" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-organ disease that is associated with a poor quality of life because of significant morbidity, mortality related to the disease itself or its treatment and the unpredictable course of the disease. The efficient treatment of SLE should demonstrate the effectiveness of controlling disease activity, preventing damage and improving the quality of life (QoL). It is therefore important to also measure the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in SLE patients in standard clinical care to capture the complete clinical picture. HRQoL together with disease activity, organ damage, adverse events and economic impact are the major outcomes for assessing treatment in SLE patients according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474702">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>HRQoL is a multi-domain concept that represents the patient’s overall perception of the impact of an illness and its treatment, and the degree to which persons perceive themselves able to function physically, emotionally and socially.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474702">2</xref></sup> The HRQoL assessment has two methods: generic questionnaires and disease-specific questionnaires. The generic questionnaires were developed for general use and may be used in many diseases. Currently, there is an increasing need for an HRQoL instrument that is valid in SLE. The 36-item short-form (SF-36)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312474702">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474702">5</xref></sup> and the EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D) are valid generic health-related QoL questionnaires used in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474702">6</xref></sup> Although SF-36 is the most common generic questionnaire used in SLE, the SF scales have been shown to miss several issues of importance to patients with SLE while including items that are of limited relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312474702">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312474702">8</xref></sup> Consequently, there are recognized advantages to using a disease-specific QoL instrument rather than a general health instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312474702">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been recommended that disease-specific questionnaires should be included in the assessment of HRQoL, as they might be more sensitive to change than generic instruments, and appropriate to evaluate specific therapeutic interventions in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312474702">10</xref></sup> Four valid disease-specific questionnaires in SLE were a lupus-specific symptom checklist (SSC) validated in the Netherlands in 2003,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312474702">11</xref></sup> the systemic lupus erythematosus-specific quality-of-life (SLEQOL) validated in Singapore in 2005,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474702">12</xref></sup> the Lupus QoL Scale (LupusQoL) validated in the United Kingdom in 2007,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312474702">13</xref></sup> the SLE QoL questionnaire (L-QoL) validated in the United Kingdom in 2009<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474702">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474702">4</xref></sup> and LupusPRO validated in the United States in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312474702">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>SLEQOL, one of the disease-specific QoL questionnaires, comprehensively covers the physical and psychological aspects of QoL in SLE. The SLEQOL domains have demonstrated good content validity and psychometric properties in SLE patients in Singapore in both English<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474702">12</xref></sup> and Chinese versions (SLEQOL-C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312474702">16</xref></sup> In addition, SLEQOL has been shown to have a greater sensitivity to change than the SF-36.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474702">12</xref></sup> With respect to the domains of HRQoL affected by SLE that may vary in a different socio-cultural context, we selected to translate the SLEQOL into a Thai version because the SLEQOL is a well-validated, disease-specific QoL questionnaire developed from a culture near Thailand.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the validity of the SLEQOL-TH in assessing the QoL of Thai patients with SLE.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312474702" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title>
<p>All SLE patients fulfilled the 1997 revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203312474702">17</xref></sup> and were older than 18 years. Patients were prospectively recruited from the outpatient rheumatology clinic in a single institution, Chiang Mai University Hospital, from June 2009 to July 2010, regardless of their disease activity. In this study, demographic data including age at protocol entry, socioeconomic status, occupation, education, cumulative clinical, immunologic manifestations and disease damage (using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC)/ACR Damage Index)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203312474702">18</xref></sup> were recorded at study entry. At each of the three study visits (baseline, two weeks and six months), the following information was collected using a standard protocol: disease activity (using Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203312474702">19</xref></sup> full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complement C3, C4 and CH50 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA titers, therapy and the SLEQOL-TH questionnaire. The questionnaire was self-reported. For elderly patients and those who are illiterate, the responses were performed with the assistance of accompanying relatives and rheumatology nurses. This study was approved by our institutional research ethics board and informed consent was obtained before the study according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312474702"><title>SLEQOL-TH</title>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH is composed of 40 questions; each question has a seven-point Likert scale, from 1 to 7, from best to worst QoL. The total score is calculated as per the original questionnaire by summing all the responses. The total score can range from 40 (best) to 280 (worst). The items in the SLEQOL were generated by healthcare providers experienced in the treatment of SLE and subsequently endorsed by patients. The translation was performed in accordance with the guideline for cross-cultural adaptation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203312474702">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two independent forward translations of the SLEQOL from English to Thai were commissioned. One well-informed rheumatologist translator (NK) aimed for equivalency from a clinical and measurement perspective. The other translator (AK), a schoolteacher, was the uninformed or naive Thai translator. The original English version was designed to be understood by people with a grade 6 education. When translating, we retained this principle and selected only easily understood words and phrases. A consensus version was derived from both sets of translations after discussions between both translators and one of the investigators (WL). The SLEQOL-TH was independently back translated to English by a naive translator (GG) and an English specialist (ER) who were blinded to the original English version. The comparison of the original SLEQOL and the back-translated version enabled the ready identification of linguistically or conceptually mistranslated items. After the translation process, an expert committee (WL and NK) was created to prepare the final version of the SLEQOL-TH.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203312474702"><title>The comprehensibility test</title>
<p>The final Thai version and the original English version were shown to six bilingual lupus patients. They were asked to assess every item regarding its understandability and embarrassment. There was some difficulty in understanding items 11 (taking part in sports), 25 (dietary restrictions), 29 (feeling low) and 34 (low self-esteem) and some embarrassment in responding to items 6 (walking 3 kilometers), 11 (taking part in sports) and 12 (sex), but not to the extent that the instrument is unusable. Generally, the patients found that the translation was accurate and did not offer any suggestions to modify the Thai version. The mean time taken to complete the Thai questionnaire was 7.17 ± 4.22 minutes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203312474702"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>We investigated the validity of the SLEQOL-TH. The test-retest reliability and floor and ceiling effect were determined. The construct validity was investigated by determining the internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha and constructing a correlation matrix of items of the SLEQOL-TH versus the SLEDAI-2K. Also, the responsiveness to change in the patients’ QoL over time was evaluated by asking patients to assess this with a 15-point scale, from –7 to +7. A score of –1, 0 or +1 was considered to mean that the QoL was unchanged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203312474702">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using the anchoring method, the responsiveness of the SLEQOL-TH was assessed with Liang’s standardized response mean (SRM), Kazis’s effect size (ES) and Guyatt’s coefficient (GC). SRM is taken as the mean difference between the baseline score and at month six divided by the standard deviation of the change in scores. The SRM value of approximately 0.2 represents a low sensitivity to change, 0.5 represents a moderate sensitivity, and 0.8 represents a high sensitivity to change;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203312474702">22</xref></sup> ES is calculated as the mean change divided by the standard deviation of the baseline scores. The GC is equal to the mean of change in the scores divided by the between-subject variability or the within-person change in stable subjects.</p>
<p>The differential item functioning (DIF) between the Thai and English versions was analyzed using the partial gamma, using this system of quantifying the extent of the DIF: no DIF when the gamma ranges from –0.21 to 0.21; slight to moderate DIF when the gamma ranges from 0.21 to 0.31 and from –0.21 to –0.31; and moderate to large when the gamma was &gt; 0.31 or &lt; –0.31.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203312474702">23</xref></sup> For this analysis, a set of data from 421 Singapore SLE patients who completed the SLEQOL in English was used for comparison.</p>
<p>The statistical software used in this study was SPSS for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). The statistically significant level was determined as a <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203312474702" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>There were 109 SLE patients, with four patients completing the questionnaire only in the first two visits, which were included in the reliability test. The demographic data of the patients are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203312474702">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The SLEQOL-TH showed no ceiling effect and minor floor effect. The range of its score is 40 to 280. The range of our patients’ score was 43–213. There were no patients in the 10% of the top score. However, there was one (0.9%) patient at baseline, four (3.8%) patients at two weeks’ follow-up, and five (4.8%) patients at six months’ follow-up were in the 10% of the lower score (≤ 44). The absence of a prominent floor effect suggests that the SLEQOL-TH is able to track the QoL of most patients even if it deteriorates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203312474702"><title>Internal consistency</title>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH showed reasonable internal consistency. The overall Cronbach’s alpha was 0.86. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203312474702">Table 3</xref>, the Cronbach’s alpha was more than 0.80 among all six domains except the treatment domain (0.59). The removal of single domains of the SLEQOL-TH did not change the overall Cronbach’s alpha. For the SLEQOL domains of physical function, activities, symptoms and treatment, Cronbach's alpha is always higher with all the items than with any one deleted. For the other two domains of mood and self-image, there was a slight increase of Cronbach's alpha if item 28 and item 40 were removed, respectively. However, this is insufficient reason to drop the items as it would compromise the integrity of the instrument.

<p>There were 105 patients who completed the questionnaire both at the baseline and at the six-month follow-up, with the mean interval between the visits of 5.85 ± 0.82 months. We compared the change in the SLEQOL-TH and the SLEDAI-2K of these 105 patients in these two study visits (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0961203312474702">Table 4</xref>). The SMR was 0.17 for the total SLEQOL-TH score and 0.53 for the SLEDAI-2K. For the 60 patients with a baseline of SLEDAI-2K ≥ 6, the SRMs were 0.28 for the total SLEQOL-TH score, and 0.35 for the activity domain and 0.76 for the SLEDAI-2K. This suggests that, in general, the scores of SLEQOL-TH and SLEDAI-2K move in the same direction.

<p>In the follow-up visit, the patients were asked to assess if their QoL had improved or worsened compared to the baseline visit. Out of the 105 patients, the global QoL had worsened in 14, was unchanged in 33, and improved in 58. The mean change of the total SLEQOL-TH score was negative 16.36 ± 38.37 in those who reported worsening, positive 9.18 ± 22.30 and 9.64 ± 34.46 in those who reported unchanged and improved global QoL, respectively.</p>
<p>Changes of total SLEQOL-TH scores as measured against self-reported global were assessed with responsiveness statistics. The SRM was –0.43 in patients who reported a worsened overall QoL, 0.41 in those unchanged and 0.28 in those who improved. The ES was –0.54 in those who worsened, 0.22 in those unchanged and 0.27 in those who improved. Similarly, the GC was –0.39 in those who worsened, 0.22 in those unchanged and 0.23 in those who improved. The magnitude of change in the total SLEQOL-TH score in the improved group was less than in the worsened group.</p>

<p>Comparing the SLEQOL-TH from 109 Thai SLE patients with the original SLEQOL version obtained from 421 Singapore SLE patients who completed the SLEQOL in English, 19 items showed DIF (eight slight to moderate and 11 moderate to large). These 21 items showed no DIF: 10, 14, 16 to 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, and 35 to 39. Slight to moderate differences were predominantly from the physical function and activity domains (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 15, 22 and 28). Moderate to large differences between the two versions were also seen in the physical function and activity items (items 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 25, 31, 34 and 40).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0961203312474702" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we included SLE patients who had a wide range of disease activity, socioeconomic and educational status covering the general SLE population. The SLEQOL-TH has been demonstrated to have satisfactory test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity and responsiveness.</p>
<p>The test-retest reliability of the SLEQOL-TH was excellent. The ICC of the total SLEQOL-TH was 0.86 and ranged from 0.74 to 0.85 for each domain. The test-retest reliability of the SLEQOL-TH was higher than the original SLEQOL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474702">12</xref></sup> particularly for physical function (ICC 0.74 vs. 0.59), activities (ICC 0.85 vs. 0.57) and treatment (0.75 vs. 0.52). In both studies, this SLEQOL-TH and the original SLEQOL study, the interval for repeating the questionnaire was two weeks. In additional, the floor effect of SLEQOL-TH was less pronounced than the original SLEQOL. This may be because of different QoLs in this group of lupus patients. If this particular group of patients has lower QoLs, it is likely that the floor effect will be less prominent.</p>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH demonstrates internal consistency. The Cronbach’s alpha for each domain of the SLEQOL-TH was higher than 0.80, except for the treatment domain. These finding were comparable with the original SLEQOL version in which the treatment domain also had a Cronbach’s alpha of less than 0.80. The low internal consistency in the treatment domain might be because of the variety of available treatment options. For example, the patients might have a fear of needles but preferred to follow a dietary restriction, so the score was not consistent among each item.</p>
<p>For the construct validity, the SLEQOL-TH correlated weakly with the SLEDAI-2K and the SLICC/ACR. The results from this study were consistent with the results from the original SLEQOL study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474702">12</xref></sup> The total SLEQOL-TH score, activity and symptom domains correlated with the disease activity index, while only the physical function domain correlated with the damage index. However, the correlations among disease activity, damage and HRQoL were also inconsistent with the previous studies. A negative correlation between disease activity and the HRQoL has been reported in one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312474702">24</xref></sup> Some studies found a correlation between disease activity, damage and HRQoL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474702">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474702">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203312474702">25</xref></sup> whereas the others have not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203312474702">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203312474702">28</xref></sup> These inconsistencies might be because of the different disease activity indices and QoL questionnaires used in each study. However, in fact, the disease activity and HRQoL may not necessarily change in the same direction, as the QoL is the patient’s perception, while the disease activity is the physician’s perception. The physician’s and patient’s perceptions of disease activity and global health differ, so the HRQoL needs to be measured in addition to measuring disease activity and damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0961203312474702">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH has been demonstrated to be responsive to change by a variety of responsiveness statistics, such as Liang’s SRM, Kazis’s ES and GC. The SLEQOL-TH has shown to be responsive to change only when the self-reported global SLEQOL-TH worsened compared to when the global SLEQOL-TH improved. Therefore, this instrument is more sensitive in detecting a deteriorating rather than an improving QoL. In other words, this instrument was sensitive to detecting deteriorating patients who needed their treatment adjusted. This result expands the results from the original SLEQOL study, which studied responsiveness only in unchanged and improved patients because there were too few patients who worsened. However, it should be noted that the sample size for calculating responsiveness was small, especially in those who worsened (<italic>n </italic>= 14).</p>
<p>When using SMR, for all patients, the SLEQOL-TH had a low response to change. However, in subgroup analysis for patients with high disease activity (SLEDAI-2K ≥ 6) at baseline visit, the SLEQOL-TH was moderately responsive to change. These results suggested that the response to change of the SLEQOL-TH may be more apparent when used in patients who have active disease. Patients who have stable disease activity may feel no change of their QoL during the observation period.</p>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH and the original SLEQOL are equivalent for most items in symptoms, treatment, mood and self-image domains, but not for physical function and activity domains. The previous versions of the SLEQOL, in English and Chinese, have been shown to be equivalent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203312474702">16</xref></sup> It should be noted that those two versions were studied in Singapore patients. Although Thailand and Singapore are both Asian countries, there are many differences in the socioeconomic status, lifestyle and culture. Thus, some non-equivalent items may result from the socioeconomic-culture effect.</p>
<p>There are issues in cross-cultural translation of QoL instruments that remain unresolved. Instrument equivalence, which we tried to achieve with thoughtful translation and cognitive debriefing and to demonstrate with DIF analysis, may, in fact, be an unreachable goal because of lack of conceptual equivalence, differences in cultural norm and lack of semantic equivalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0961203312474702">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0961203312474702">31</xref></sup> Though we followed the procedure for cross-cultural translation recommended by professional bodies, the methodologies have themselves not been subject to rigorous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0961203312474702">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are a few limitations in this study. First, the SLEQOL-TH was only moderately responsive to change in disease activity. The interval between study visits was six months. This complies with recent studies that showed that change in disease activity over time correlates with change in HRQoL measures if determined at one month, three months and six months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203312474702">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0961203312474702">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0961203312474702">35</xref></sup> Therefore, future work is needed to determine the most appropriate interval of evaluation for improving the responsiveness of the HRQoL measures. Second, in this study, we did not demonstrate the agreement between overall or sub-item changing of SLEQOL-TH score over time by patients and the importance of changing the treatment by the physician. This agreement remains to be proven in the next study. Third, we did not investigate criterion validity by comparing the SLEQOL-TH against other generic QoL instruments such as SF-36 or SLE-specific ones such as LupusQol, L-Qol or LupusPRO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312474702">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203312474702">15</xref></sup> None of these instruments have been formally validated in Thai lupus patients, even though the SF-36 has been used in a study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0961203312474702">36</xref></sup> Fourth, the linguistic validation was performed after the validation study was undertaken. In this cohort, 17.43% of patients had less than six years of education, yet all of them were able to read the questionnaire without assistance. Only one patient needed the assistant to read the questionnaire because of visual impairment from retinal vasculitis. Therefore, the delay of the linguistic validation does not invalidate our findings. It should be noted that we enrolled 109 SLE patients from only one tertiary-care center. Future multicenter studies with a larger sample of patients are required to determine the utility of the SLEQOL-TH in general clinical practice or clinical trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0961203312474702" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The SLEQOL-TH is psychometrical and shows construct validity. However, in this group of patients, the instrument was responsive only when the self-reported global SLEQOL-TH worsened compared to when the global SLEQOL-TH improved. In comparison with the English version of SLEQOL that was administered to Singapore patients, there are some items that showed DIF. The applicability of the SLEQOL-TH in real-life clinical practice and clinical trial needs to be determined.</p>
