<abstract>
<p>High fat diet-induced endotoxaemia triggers low-grade inflammation and lipid release from adipose tissue. This study aims to unravel the cellular mechanisms leading to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) effects in human adipocytes. Subcutaneous pre-adipocytes surgically isolated from patients were differentiated into mature adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Lipolysis was assessed by measurement of glycerol release and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time PCR. Treatment with LPS for 24 h induced a dose-dependent increase in interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression. At 1 µg/ml LPS, IL-6 and IL-8 were induced to 19.5 ± 1.8-fold and 662.7 ± 91.5-fold (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 vs basal), respectively. From 100 ng/ml to 1 µg/ml, LPS-induced lipolysis increased to a plateau of 3.1-fold above basal level (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 vs basal). Co-treatment with inhibitors of inhibitory kappa B kinase kinase beta (IKKβ) or NF-κB inhibited LPS-induced glycerol release. Co-treatment with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89, the lipase inhibitor orlistat or the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) inhibitor CAY10499 abolished the lipolytic effects of LPS. Co-treatment with the MAPK inhibitor, U0126 also reduced LPS-induced glycerol release. Inhibition of lipolysis by orlistat or CAY10499 reduced LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression. Induction of lipolysis by the synthetic catecholamine isoproterenol or the phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor milrinone did not alter basal IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression after 24 treatments whereas these compounds enhanced LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression. Both the inflammatory IKKβ/NF-κB pathway and the lipolytic PKA/HSL pathways mediate LPS-induced lipolysis. In turn, LPS-induced lipolysis reinforces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, thereby, triggers its own lipolytic activity.</p>

<p>Chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation is associated with obesity and is assumed to contribute to the risk of obesity-related metabolic complications such as type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425910386632">1</xref></sup> An increased release of pro-inflammatory molecules and free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissue particularly contribute to vascular and metabolic complications of obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910386632">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425910386632">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Erridge <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425910386632">5</xref></sup> showed that a high-fat meal induces postprandial low-grade endotoxaemia. Cani <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425910386632">6</xref></sup> further showed that metabolic endotoxaemia initiates obesity and insulin resistance, and identified bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the gut microbiota as a triggering factor linking inflammation to high fat diet-induced metabolic syndrome. Fat is more efficient than other nutrients in transporting bacterial LPS from the gut lumen into the bloodstream.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425910386632">7</xref></sup> Conversely, the influence of endotoxin on plasma lipid concentrations was attributed to its effects on human adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425910386632">8</xref></sup> The presence of functional Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 activated by LPS in human adipocytes was recently shown and may impact lipid metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425910386632">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adipocyte lipolysis is acutely regulated by metabolic signals (<italic>e.g</italic>. inhibited by insulin or stimulated by catecholamine) converging at the level of protein kinase A (PKA) activation. In turn, PKA phosphorylates and, therefore, activates the hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). This triggers the translocation from HSL to the lipid droplets whereby lipolysis occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910386632">10</xref></sup> Besides this classical lipolytic pathway, another triacylglycerol (TAG) lipase called adipose TAG lipase or ATGL participates. This enzyme initiates lipolysis by specifically removing the first fatty acids (FAs) from the stored TAG and thereby producing diacylglycerol, which is further hydrolysed by HSL and the monoacylglycerol lipase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425910386632">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data obtained in murine adipocytes showed recently that neither the inflammatory nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nor the metabolic PKA pathways were involved in endotoxin-regulated lipolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910386632">12</xref></sup> We aimed to confirm these findings in human adipocytes. Primary cultures of human pre-adipocytes surgically isolated from patients and differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> represent an attractive tool to characterize the intracellular mechanisms involved in LPS-induced lipolysis.</p>

<p>The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from patients. Subcutaneous fat tissue samples were surgically obtained from lean (body mass index, BMI &lt; 25 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910386632">2</xref></sup>) and obese (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425910386632">2</xref></sup>) donors (males and females, aged 31–65 years, mean 47 years) during elective abdominal surgery performed for various non-malignant conditions. The stromal-vascular cell fraction containing pre-adipocytes was isolated from fat tissue samples. The pre-adipocytes were expanded <italic>in vitro</italic> in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 2 ng/ml 2-FGF (Lubio Science, Luzern, Switzerland) until confluence and subjected to an adipogenic differentiation medium for 14 d as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425910386632">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>For experimental purposes, cells were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and kept for 48 h in a low-glucose medium (1.8 g/l glucose): DMEM (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with nutrient mixture F-12 (Lubio Science), gentamycin (50 µg/ml), <sc>L</sc>-ascorbic acid (100 n<sc>M</sc>), biotin (8 µg/ml), <sc>D</sc>-pantothenate (15 m<sc>M</sc>), HEPES (15 n<sc>M</sc>) and 3% FCS. Then, cells were treated with LPS (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) from 1 ng/ml to 1 µg/ml for 24 h. Additionally, if co-treated, adipocytes were pre-treated for 1 h before LPS stimulation with DMSO (vehicle), 80 µ<sc>M</sc> NF-κB inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; PDTC), 100 µ<sc>M</sc> IKKβ inhibitor (sc-514), 20 µ<sc>M</sc> PKA inhibitor (H-89; Merck Chemicals, Nottingham, UK), 10 µ<sc>M</sc> MAPK inhibitor (U0126), 100 µ<sc>M</sc> orlistat, 1µ<sc>M</sc> isoproterenol, 10 µ<sc>M</sc> milrinone (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 µ<sc>M</sc> CAY10499 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).</p>

<p>Cells were harvested in a 10 m<sc>M</sc> Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) lysis buffer containing 1% Triton-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and Halt™ phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Wohlen, Switzerland) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min). Protein concentrations of lysates were determined with the BCA protein assay kit from Perbio Science (Lausanne, Switzerland). Lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (20 µg/sample) were mixed in SDS sample buffer, subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (pore size 0.45 µm; Whatman GmbH, Dassel, Germany) using the Ready Gel® Precast Gel System and a Mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer System (BioRad, Reinach, Switzerland). After blocking of the membrane (1h, 20–22°C) with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated (16 h, 4°C) with GLUT-4 primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), washed and incubated (1h, 20–22°C) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody from Milan Analytica (Magden, Switzerland). Band intensities were detected with Immun-Star HRP substrate kit (BioRad) and densitometry values were calculated with the Image J software (NIH, USA). The membranes were stripped (20 min, 60°C in 1<sc>M</sc> Tris-HCl at pH 6.7, 0.01% β-mercaptoethanol and 10% SDS) to remove the antibodies added and to probe them again with anti-β-actin primary antibody (Abcam) used as loading control. Results were expressed as relative protein levels standardized such that values obtained in undifferentiated pre-adipocytes were set to 1.</p>

<p>In our well-characterized, human, pre-adipocyte-derived adipocytes, LPS induced mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and lipolysis (<italic>i.e</italic>. glycerol release). Co-treatment with inhibitors of IKKβ or NF-κB inhibited LPS-induced lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753425910386632">Fig. 8</xref>A). Co-treatment with the PKA inhibitor H-89, the lipase inhibitor orlistat or the potent inhibitor of human HSL CAY10499 also abolished the lipolytic effects of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753425910386632">Fig. 8</xref>B). Therefore, both the inflammatory IKKβ/NF-κB pathway and the classical lipolytic PKA/HSL pathway are involved in LPS-induced lipolysis. The link between these two pathways needs further investigation and may be direct or indirect via cytokines, adipokines or other intermediate pathways. The LPS-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines is reduced by inhibitors of lipolysis (orlistat, CAY10499) and is enhanced by lipolytic agents (isoproterenol, milrinone), suggesting that LPS-induced lipolysis reinforces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may contribute to trigger its own lipolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1753425910386632">Fig. 8</xref>C).

Co-treatments with the IKKβ inhibitor sc-514 or the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC inhibit LPS-induced lipolysis (A). Co-treatment with the PKA inhibitor H-89 or the hormone-sensitive lipase inhibitor CAY10499 abolishes the lipolytic effects of LPS (B). However, the link between the inflammatory TLR4/IKKβ/IκB/NF-κB and the classical lipolytic cAMP/PKA/HSL pathways needs further investigations. This link may be direct or indirect via cytokines, adipokines or other intermediate pathways which have to be determined and is represented by (…) in A and B. Inhibition of LPS-induced lipolysis by the MAPK inhibitor U0126 suggests that the MAPK pathway could be one of these intermediate pathways. In turn, orlistat or CAY10499 inhibition of lipolysis (C) reduces LPS-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (dashed line). Lipolytic agents such as isoproterenol (synthetic catecholamine) or milrinone (phosphodiesterase type III inhibitor) enhanced the LPS-induced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Together, this suggests that LPS-induced lipolysis reinforces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (dashed arrow) and may contribute to trigger its own lipolytic activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1753425910386632-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in human pre-adipocyte-derived adipocytes was increased upon LPS exposure, in agreement with previous data from our group showing that cytokine production and secretion was induced by LPS in adipose tissue explants and with data obtained in LPS-exposed human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425910386632">16</xref></sup> However, IL-6 and IL-8 were unable to induce their own mRNA expression in hMSC-derived adipocytes. Additionally, these cytokines could not induce lipolysis in hMSC- or pre-adipocyte-derived adipocytes (data not shown). Interleukin-6 and IL-8 are, therefore, useful markers of inflammation but seem not to represent the missing link between the inflammatory and metabolic pathways inducing lipolysis upon LPS stimulation. Nevertheless, their expression was decreased by an inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway and reduced by the lipase inhibitors orlistat or CAY10499 while lipolysis was abolished by each of them. This suggests that lipolysis is induced by the classical IKKβ/NF-κB inflammatory pathway and exerts a positive feedback loop on inflammation. Indeed, Shi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425910386632">17</xref></sup> demonstrated that fatty acids (FAs) can activate the receptor for LPS known as TLR4 in monocytes and adipocytes. Their data further showed that the mixture of palmitate and oleate induced IL-6 expression and secretion in adipocyte cell culture and that this inflammatory response depends on TLR4 receptor. Together, the release of FAs upon LPS-induced lipolysis may reinforce TLR4 activation and the increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Moreover, inducing lipolysis with either isoproterenol or milrinone in the absence of LPS for 24 h did not increase IL-6 or IL-8 mRNA expression in our adipocytes. This suggests that increasing lipolysis potentiated the pro-inflammatory effects of LPS but that increasing lipolysis by itself did not lead to an increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In comparison with isoproterenol, milrinone was a more potent inducer of lipolysis in our adipocytes, resulting in a more pronounced increase of cytokine expression in LPS-treated cells.</p>
<p>Fatty acid metabolism is regulated by precise control of lipolysis. Fatty acids are stored as TAG in adipocytes and their sequential hydrolysis results in liberation of FAs with the generation of DAG (diacylglycerol), MAG (monoacylglycerol) and glycerol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910386632">10</xref></sup> The indirect measurement of lipolysis by evaluating glycerol content and, therefore, release in the cell culture supernatant allows determining the final result of lipolysis. Indeed, lipolysis in adipocytes produces glycerol and FFAs. Glycerol cannot be re-utilised for TAG re-synthesis due to a lack of glycerol kinase in normal white adipocytes and is released along with FFAs, in the culture medium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425910386632">18</xref></sup> Several lipases are involved. ATGL initiates lipolysis, HSL is the intermediate enzyme and the monoacylglycerol lipase performs the final step.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425910386632">10</xref></sup> However, and unlike HSL, ATGL activity does not appear to be regulated directly by PKA phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425910386632">19</xref></sup> Our data show that LPS-induced lipolysis is dependent of PKA and inhibited by the potent HSL inhibitor CAY10499. Together, this suggests that HSL is the rate-limiting enzyme in the lipolytic effects of LPS.</p>
<p>These results are at variance with a study published recently reporting that both NF-κB and PKA pathways do not participate in LPS-induced lipolysis in murine adipocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425910386632">12</xref></sup> The different findings can be explained by the fact that our study was performed in human adipocytes. They also showed that phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα were slightly increased in LPS-stimulated adipocytes and that HSL protein content and lipase activity were increased upon LPS exposure, corroborating our observations. Additionally, their results showed that the MAPK pathway was involved in LPS-induced lipolysis. We, therefore, used the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor U0126 in a similar experimental setting and we could confirm that U0126 only partly reduced LPS-induced lipolysis. Therefore, MAPK signalling pathway is also involved in LPS-induced lipolysis in human adipocytes. Hypothetically, the MAPK pathway may represent one of the missing links between the inflammatory NF-κB and the classical lipolytic PKA/HSL pathways involved in the lipolytic effects of LPS in human adipocytes.</p>

<sec id="sec17-1753425910386632" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on these data, the inflammatory IKKβ/NF-κB pathway and the classical lipolytic PKA/HSL pathways are required in LPS-induced lipolysis. Additional work needs to be performed to understand the mechanisms of interaction between these two pathways. The observation that LPS-induced lipolysis reinforces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may contribute to trigger its own lipolytic activity further suggests that inflammation is triggering lipolysis and is a key player in its sustained activation in the obese state.</p>
