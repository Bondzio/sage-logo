<p>As someone who is approaching that period of life infamously referred to as ‘middle age’, I felt reviewing Stephen Fineman’s <italic>Organizing Age</italic> to be timely and relevant. On the subject of middle age, I take comfort in the fact that, from a cursory search on the Internet, there is much disagreement about when middle age begins and ends. Some say 40–60, others reckon 45–60 while <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://middleage.org">middleage.org</ext-link> suggests 25–75. Being outside the first two age ranges but within the last, I do wonder whether it really matters that I might be constructed as someone who is ‘middle-aged’? Is this not just a case of idle vanity? But, of course, age matters in different ways at various points in our lives and within the array of social spheres we occupy, not the least of them being the workplace. As much as I try to downplay my concerns, being branded a ‘middle-aged man’ troubles me because people make all manner of inferences about a person’s status and position in the lifecourse, some of which might be unpalatable. Acknowledging the validity of these and other age-related concerns, Stephen Fineman’s monograph on age and ageing is an engaging, scholarly and apposite examination of why age has been socially constructed in the way it has. Conceptualizing age as a ‘master discourse’ and adopting a multi-disciplinary style, Fineman draws heavily on the social science literature as well as populist accounts of age, in order to examine how age reproduces social divisions and important decisions in organizations. Organized into seven chapters, Fineman’s text skilfully teases out the moral and management implications of ‘age grading on how our lives are shaped and how we shape our lives’ (p. 2).</p>
<p>In the first chapter, ‘Why age?’, Fineman rightly points out that markers of age are not neutral but highly politicized, influencing, both negatively and positively, the way we feel, think and act in everyday life. As this chapter shows, societies construct age in particular ways at specific moments in time. This might be self-evident to most, especially to those readers who subscribe to a social constructionist perspective, but the argument that age discourse is often taken-for-granted underscores the merit in historicizing age. Here, Fineman examines how societies have marked out and attributed different meanings to the passage of time, revealing some surprising findings. For example, Ancient constructions of age did not deal in numbers but, instead, carved up life into distinct broad periods, the numbers of which were variously shaped by religious beliefs, folklore and cultural knowledge. This chapter also explores how age is gendered and how ethnic backgrounds influence age norms, and the consequences of violating particular norms in specific cultural contexts. This discussion is especially pertinent when Fineman introduces the notion of the ‘corporate career’, exposing the cultural assumptions made, for example, about women’s and men’s suitability for employment in general and at particular ages.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, ‘Age work’ investigates how we ‘do’ age, celebrating, defining and marking age as the years pass by. Conceptualized as the ‘interface of what we privately feel about our age and they see our age appearance and behaviour to be’ (p. 40), age work entails all manner of activities, from the younger dressing in a sexualized way to appear more mature to older people turning to cosmetic surgery to defy the ageing process. As Fineman argues, age work is undertaken in all spheres of life, including the workplace. Older men, for example, are no longer secure from the pressure to look youthful and fit for work, especially when compared to their younger counterparts. Some male employees in certain professions are no less aware than their female peers of the symbolic freight the ageing body carries about one’s identity and capability in the workplace. Facelifts, botox and microdermabrasion, among other cosmetic and medical interventions, are important examples of what Fineman calls ‘masking’ the ageing process. While this section of the book rightly draws out the gendered implications for men and women of a gender-age ‘double-bind’, noting particularly how individuals struggle to appear younger, it perhaps does not go far enough in analysing the agency in the actions taken by different workers to resist age norms. Arguably, this chapter raises more questions than it answers, evident in the concluding paragraph, which left me wanting more from Fineman about how age variously operates as a ‘master discourse’, and the opportunities and limitations within organizations for resistance. Equally thought-provoking is Chapter 3, ‘Generations’, which problematizes the notion of ‘generation’ when understanding the ageing process. As Fineman maintains, in the world of management, the concept of generation is attractive but tends to reduce the significance of age and ageing to clichés and stereotypes. This is troubling because organizations, management and marketing consultants have often produced literature and policy on managing age in the workplace on the basis that specific generations possess certain characteristics. With generations of workers conveniently categorized and characterized, organizational problems can be explained by ‘gaps’ and ‘conflicts’ between workers of different generations, rather than how organizations construct and attribute specific meanings to age and ageing. For me, Fineman is at his best in this book when he exposes the crudeness in the way age and ageing is understood by organizations, illustrated nicely by his incisive critique of ‘generations’.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, on ‘Ageism’, covers the basics of age discrimination. The usual myths about older people (i.e. too old to learn, too old to change and too sick because they are too old) are identified and problematized. It is clear that ageism is a ‘poor relative’ compared to other isms such as racism and sexism, requiring further empirical research into the many areas of age discrimination Fineman describes, such as ‘Lookism’, which is said to benefit the ‘beautiful’ and ‘attractive’ personally and professionally. More engaging, and perhaps the highlight of the book, is Chapter 5 ‘Capturing age cohorts’. Here Fineman turns his attention to those organizations designed for particular age groups, such as prisons, young offenders’ institutions, organizations that profit from child labour and care homes for older people. These ‘invisible’ organizational worlds, as the author calls them, are marked by age in ways that are contradictory and problematic. The discussion of young offenders’ institutions illustrates this vividly, as Fineman digs his teeth into the meaty issues associated with clashing ideologies of containment and reform, exposed in the multiple perspectives of those who occupy such organizations, such as prison officers and young offenders. The subject of organizing for dementia is treated with equal verve. Clearly evident in how Fineman berates facile notions of ‘person-centred care’ that often ignore the perspectives and experiences of those individuals diagnosed with dementia. This is a pressing issue for employers, especially as many people are living longer and facing the prospect of having to toil into deep old age. As Fineman correctly asserts, employers cannot afford to treat dementia as a taboo. While this subject is shaped by cultural prejudices about the ageing there might be opportunities for organizations to develop a new form of ‘professionalism’ in dementia care, in which the voices of dementia carers and those who are diagnosed with dementia, are brought to the fore. The gendered, racial and class dimensions to dementia care are underdeveloped, particularly debate on how they might intersect. Such intersectionalities are crucial to take into account because they have potentially far reaching implications for how organizations fashion an ‘ethics of care’ not just in relation to dementia care, but also in regard to the ageing process more generally.</p>
<p>The matter of ‘Retirement’, the focus of the book’s penultimate chapter, benefits from Fineman’s criticality. Retirement is no longer an uncomplicated contract between the individual, employer and the State. Anxieties about retirement are structured by all manner of pressing concerns (not the least of them being diminishing pension pots), revealing how organizing for old age is, in large part, a concern with the materiality of everyday life. Yet, as Fineman points out, the effort many of us invest in preparing for and surviving the world of work is not always matched by the effort we invest in preparing for a life of non-work post-work. Retirement is not just about whether we might have enough money to live on, but also about how we might continue to rely on existing social networks and informal ties. For example, emotional attachments, such as friendships, are crucial in older age, and while Fineman touches upon the impact of ageing on friendships there is still room for further discussion. The literature on ageing and friendship is not drawn on deeply, missing opportunities to complicate debates about the significance of friendship in older life and how these relationships are attributed different meanings by diverse people. One major omission, for example, are the perspectives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) people, for whom ageing and age holds particular concerns that are shaped by cultural prejudices about sexuality—e.g. what about older LGBT people in care homes? What about the experiences of ageing LGBT employees within contexts of work that are heteronormative? Mobilizing a vibrant sociological literature on this subject (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611426456">Cruz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611426456">Heaphy and Yip, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611426456">Heaphy et al., 2004</xref>) would help to craft a more nuanced analysis of the different perspectives on retirement in particular and on ageing in general. As it stands, the text is vulnerable to the tongue lashings of those critics who might feel it perpetuates a heteronormative bias in the ageing scholarship.</p>
<p>These observations notwithstanding, this book is an accessible introduction to the matter of age and ageing in the workplace. Ending on a positive note, by concluding that there might be signs of ushering in a new age of progressive debate and practice on this topic, Fineman leaves us in no doubt about the complexity and importance of this topic within different organizational contexts. As such, <italic>Organizing Age</italic> is a valuable contribution to a field of study that is attracting more and more scholarly attention, rightly so. I recommend this text as an essential read for anyone interested in this topic area, but also as a supplementary text on academic courses that adopt a critical perspective on analysing aspects of individual difference in the workplace, and how these are managed by organizations.</p>
