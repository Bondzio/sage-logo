<abstract>
<p>The combined impact of social class, cultural background and experience upon early literacy achievement in the first year of schooling is among the most durable questions in educational research. Links have been established between social class and achievement but literacy involves complex social and cognitive practices that are not necessarily reflected in the connections that have been made. The complexity of relationships between social class, cultural background and experience, and their impact on early literacy achievement have received little research attention. Recent refinements of the broad terms of social class or socioeconomic status have questioned the established links between social class and achievement. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to move beyond deficit and mismatch models of explaining and understanding the underperformance of children from lower socioeconomic and cultural minority groups when conventional measures are used. The data from an Australian pilot study reported here add to the increasing evidence that income is not necessarily related directly to home literacy resources or to how those resources are used. Further, the data show that the level of print resources in the home may not be a good indicator of the level of use of those resources.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1468798411416888" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The relationship between what children bring to school, early pedagogical experience and achievement is a central issue in current research and policy. Who succeeds and fails in the first year of school literacy? Why and how? Themost robust finding of half a century of educational research has been the linkbetween social class and achievement. From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411416888">Coleman (1966)</xref> to more recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411416888">Lucas, 2001</xref>), children from lower socioeconomic and cultural minority groups have tended to underperform by conventional measures. In Australia, this is corroborated in analyses of state reading test results against the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (IRSED) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411416888">Luke et al., 2003</xref>). However, there is little agreement on why. Cognitive and linguistic deficit models located the problem in family culture and socialization. This led to interventions such as the USA Project Head Start, which comprises preschool curricula designed to supply the ‘lacking’ linguistic and textual experience. Current policies in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2001) countries focus on expanding early intervention, preschool and parental support, to improve early achievement, while the most recent OECD (2006) report suggests a universal approach to access with particular attention to children who are in need of special support.</p>
<p>An alternative to <italic>deficit models</italic> was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411416888">Wells (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411416888">Heath (1983)</xref>, documenting children’s diverse cultural and linguistic resources. The prevailing <italic>mismatch model</italic> is that students from ‘at-risk’ backgrounds bring linguistic resources, cultural schemata and approaches to learning to mainstream schools. Sociologically, these forms of cultural capital are misrecognized in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411416888">Luke, 1996</xref>). The claim is that schooling systematically rewards those with the most middle-class and dominant cultural styles, linguistic practices and backgrounds.</p>
<p>The mismatch model is key to Australian qualitative studies. A study by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DEETYA), <italic>100 Children Go to School</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411416888">Hill et al., 1998</xref>) examined and tracked 100 children from home to school. In a DEET study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411416888">Freebody et al. (1995)</xref> used discourse analysis to conclude that teachers misrecognized home resources and lowered the semantic and intellectual demands on underperforming students. Qualitative US and UK studies made similar findings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411416888">Gregory, 2002</xref>). Australian case studies have explored the home/school transitions of linguistic minorities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411416888">Makin and Jones-Diaz, 2002</xref>), the use of ‘multiliteracies’ of digital culture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411416888">Downes, 2002</xref>) and home literacy events (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411416888">Nichols, 2000</xref>). They found that what children learn at home and can do with print and non-print modalities gets left at the school gate, and that these same children are often labelled as underachievers. Qualitative research thus makes the case that underachievement is the result of cultural mismatches, teacher misrecognition and an instructional self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>A closer investigation of the underperformance of children from lower socioeconomic and cultural minority groups reveals that earlier studies of home literacy environments (HLE) focused on measures of social status such as education and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>), which has frequently resulted ina deterministic relationship between socio-cultural factors and HLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel, 2006</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411416888">Auerbach (2001)</xref> has commented, this new version of a deficit model explains that: children from low-income, minority and immigrant families are ‘literacy impoverished’ (p. 385); they have limited resources; their parents, who do not read themselves or read to their children, do not value or support literacy development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411416888">Arnold and Doctoroff (2003)</xref> claim that socioeconomic status (SES) is a ‘powerful predictor of academic trajectories’ (p. 520) and that the influence of SES on ‘literacy skills emerge[s] very early’ (p. 520). While Arnold and Doctoroff indicate that a major advance in the study of economic disadvantage is ‘increased sophistication in understanding and measuring poverty and SES’ (p. 519), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel (2006)</xref> notes that ‘assumptions’ such as those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411416888">Arnold and Doctoroff (2003)</xref> ‘are generally based on the results of large-scale studies, using limited operationalisations of the HLE’ (p. 369). Other qualitative approaches have also challenged the seemingly uncomplicated relationship between SES and HLE (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411416888">Auerbach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411416888">Goldenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411416888">Purcell-Gates, 1996</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468798411416888"><title>Home literacy environments and literacy development</title>
<p>If social status is conceptualized more broadly than education and income, then other important facets of HLE such as those that relate to language and literacy development can be taken into account. Identifying relationships between specific aspects of HLE and educational and developmental outcomes can explain more than social status measures of education and income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411416888">Brooker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411416888">Sénéchal et al., 1998</xref>). It has been accepted for some time that home environments provide children’s first encounters with language and literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411416888">Purcell-Gates, 1996</xref>). Correlation studies have shown that supportive HLE, such as the provision of rich language and print resources, and parents reading books to children, enhances children’s emergent literacy abilities (e.g. Sénéchal et al., 1998). Qualitative researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411416888">Goldenberg, 2004</xref>) has suggested that facets of HLE that relate to language and literacy development may well be better predictors of children’s literacy scores than factors such as SES or ethnicity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411416888">Brooker’s (2002)</xref> case studies of one ‘Anglo’ and one Bangladeshi boy beginning school in the UK showed differences between home literacy practices and environments, and those of the schools these children attended. Differences were manifested in the very real effects of baseline scores on listening, speaking, reading and writing for these two children. With the aid of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411416888">Bourdieu’s (1989)</xref> notion of cultural capital and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411416888">Bernstein’s (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411416888">1996</xref>) theory of pedagogic discourse, a mismatch model of explanations resulted, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411416888">Brooker (2002)</xref> arguing that one way of addressing the problem is by attending to the ‘differential levels of communication between home and school’ (p. 309).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al. (2005)</xref>, early studies of HLE tended to focus on shared book reading while more recent research has viewed HLE as complex and multifaceted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al. (2002)</xref> suggested that different parts of home literacy environments influence children’s language and literacy development in different ways. They investigated the relationship between HLE and the literacy outcomes of 97 children aged four and five years in the USA, and compared the predictive value of six different HLE categories. Home literacy environments were categorized as <italic>limiting</italic>, <italic>passive</italic> and <italic>active</italic>, as well as combinations of these. For instance, interactivity is a combination of activity and passivity, and overall HLE is an aggregate of measures. Limiting environments were identified by the social class resources available, such as parental education and occupation, as well as parental characteristics that included ‘intelligence, language and reading ability, and attitudes towards education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>: 413). Passive HLE included what was called ‘indirect learning from models’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>: 413), such as children seeing parents reading books but involving no direct teaching of skills. Active HLE is defined as parents engaging children in activities aimed at developing language and literacy skills such as shared reading and rhyming games. While limiting HLE was associated with lower levels of children’s oral language, letter knowledge, phonological sensitivity and word reading skills, the ‘magnitude of the relations was a function of the manner in which the HLE was conceptualized, the ability assessed, and whether the relations were concurrent or longitudinal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>: 424). In other words, while HLE is recognized as a determiner of the level of literacy in young children, the strength of the relationship is contingent on the dimensions used to map HLE, how well the construct is operationalized and the context.</p>
<p>In a more recent study aimed at understanding the ecological influences on preschool children’s emerging language and literacy skills, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al. (2005)</xref> replaced the limiting, passive and active terms used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al. (2002)</xref> with <italic>parental demographics</italic>, <italic>parental literacy habits</italic> and <italic>parental activities</italic>, respectively, because they wanted to be more descriptive of what the categories meant in their study. They also added a fourth component of HLEs, <italic>parental reading beliefs</italic>, which was not included by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al. (2002)</xref>. Parental reading beliefs are described as the beliefs and attitudes that parents have about children’s language and literacy development, and the authors claim that parental beliefs ‘about their role in the development of their children are related to children’s literacy and language outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al., 2005</xref>: 209). Eighty-five parents completed initial and follow-up self-administered questionnaires, as did the 56 childcare teachers where children participated in programmes. The questionnaires used standardized scales and items that were based on the four components of HLE (see above). The findings support the importance of studying multiple contexts (home and preschool) as literacy development is influenced by the contexts of which they are a part. In terms of children’s outcomes, the study confirmed the significance of parental and teacher ‘literacy habits, activities, and beliefs … in relation to positive literacy and language outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al., 2005</xref>: 228).</p>
<p>Despite the move to more specific categorizations of HLE by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel (2006)</xref> makes an argument for the categories of HLE to be refined even further. Van Steensel set out to investigate whether HLE was able to add further to the predictive value of ethnicity and SES. The study involved 116 children and their parents from a city in the southern part of the Netherlands, with 48 native Dutch families and 68 ethnic minority families taking part. Data were gathered about home literacy environments using a specially devised parental questionnaire, and about children’s literacy development in kindergarten, first and second grades using standardized school tests and an observation form. The parental questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first probed the details of individual literacy activities of family members (parents as well as older siblings) and included questions about ‘reading books, magazines, newspapers, advertising brochures, making shopping lists, writing letters/postcards and using a personal computer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel, 2006</xref>: 371). The second focused on joint literacy activities involving the child (with parents or older siblings), including shared book reading, oral storytelling, joint library visits, watching literacy-focused television programmes (e.g. <italic>Sesame Street</italic>), singing children’s songs/rhymes and shared writing activities. For the most part, questions included the frequency of activities: 1 = hardly ever, 2 = once/more times per month, 3 = once/more times per week.</p>
<p>Results indicated that, in terms of relating HLE profiles to social and cultural factors, most ethnic minority families had a child-directed HLE (Profile 2), which meant that ‘a lot of minority children are frequently exposed to school-related literacy activities in their homes’ (p. 375). This is contrary to what has often been assumed in the past (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411416888">Arnold and Doctoroff, 2003</xref>) and supports qualitative studies such as those by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411416888">Auerbach (2001)</xref>. In relation to SES, van Steensel found that, as the level of education increased, the number of Profile 1 families (rich HLE) grew and the number of Profile 3 families (poor HLE) reduced. The number of Profile 2 families (child-directed HLE) remained the same at all three levels of education, indicating that ‘in every SES group, there are parents who value literacy for their children, but not for themselves’ (p. 375). In terms of relating HLE profiles to literacy outcomes, an ANCOVA showed that the majority of differences in literacy outcomes are accounted for by ethnicity. Including a wide range of literacy activities by parents and older siblings as well as those involving the child provided evidence of the value of abroad conceptualization of home literacy environments. In addition, van Steensel showed the importance of moving beyond income and education levels as indicators of SES to produce evidence opposing the idea that ‘low SES and ethnic minority families fail to support children’s literacy development’ (p. 378). Despite a number of ethnic minority families being categorized as having poor HLEs, most ‘frequently engaged children in school-related literacy activities’ (p. 378). However, as indicated in interviews, many parents stated that such activities were new to them, which led van Steensel to conclude that parents were aware of what is valued in Dutch society and engaged in shared activities as part of their acculturation to Dutch society.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1468798411416888"><title>Media practices</title>
<p>Debates about the relationship between home literacy environments and SES have recently begun to include the media practices of young children, as opposed to focusing only on those literacy practices traditionally associated with print literacy, such as shared books and visiting libraries. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411416888">Kress (1998)</xref> has made the point that wider definitions of literacy that include technologies and multi-modal ways of meaning making should be part of literacy. The inclusion of media practices in studies of home literacy environments has come with the recognition of the so-called digital divide, that is, the potential differential access to digital technologies such as the Internet, computer games and mobile phones brought about by SES (e.g. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411416888">McPake et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) report (2006) found a large gap in computer ownership related to income and parent education in the USA. A national random-digital-dial telephone survey in September 2005 of parents with children aged between six months and six years produced 1,051 respondents. Eight focus groups with eight participants in each group were also conducted in four locations throughout the country between March 2005 and March 2006. In each location, one focus group was conducted with parents of children aged between one and three years, and one for parents with children aged between four and six years. Just over half the children (54%) in lower-income households (less than $20,000 per year) had a computer in the home compared with 95% of those from higher-income homes ($75,000 per year or more). Of children aged six and less, 78% (8 in 10) lived in homes with a computer and 69% (7 in 10) had Internet access at home; 29% (3 in 10) had more than one computer. The KFF (2006: 33) claims that there is a ‘substantial racial and socioeconomic divide’ between those who have used computers and those who have not: 23% of Hispanic children aged between six months and six years had used a computer, 42% of African American and 50% of white children. However, the KFF claims there is also a:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…broader divide in children’s media use habits and household environments. Children from lower income families, children whose parents have less formal education, as well as children of color all spend more time watching TV, and are more likely to live in a home where the TV is left on most of the time; and they also spend <italic>less</italic> time reading or being read to. (KFF, 2006: 33)</p></disp-quote>
<p>In contrast to the KFF (2006) report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411416888">McPake et al. (2005)</xref> found it difficult to ascertain the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on the technical, cultural and learning (ICT) competences that children were developing at home. Their study involved a survey of: 405 parents (204 were returned) whose children were attending eight nurseries in central Scotland; case studies of eight ‘disadvantaged’ and eight ‘more advantaged’ children aged three to five years; and interviews with one staff member from four primary schools linked to the nurseries. Another difficulty in establishing the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage faced by McPake et al. was the ‘complexity of the family contexts we studied’ (p. 7). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411416888">McPake et al. (2005</xref>: 7) stated that although income is ‘likely to affect the amount and quality of equipment families possess, resourceful families on low incomes found ways of acquiring equipment they wanted’. For instance, those children from ‘disadvantaged’ families who were ‘enthusiastic about ICT’ may have been exposed to a wider range of experiences than those from ‘more affluent families whose parents restrict access or are less interested in involving young children in ICT based activities’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411416888">Marsh and Thompson (2001)</xref> of 18 families in a white working-class community in the north of England involved parents keeping diaries of the literacy activities in which children aged three and four years engaged over a period of four weeks. The children watched television and films far more than any other literacy activity and the televisual texts were a major source of narrative satisfaction. Television played a key part in relationships between family members as parents and siblings ‘watched television together, talked about television, played games related to television with each other and fought over control of the viewing space’ (p. 62). There was a great deal of pleasure associated with children’s expression of their literate selves through engaging with television, computer games and mobile phones, which was reciprocated by their parents.</p>
<p>A recent Australian case study investigated teachers and parents’ perspectives of digital technologies in the lives of young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411416888">Fox et al., 2010</xref>). Data were gathered from three teachers and 10 parents (all mothers) of children in the preparatory year, who were aged 4.5–5.5 years. The setting was purposefully selected to ensure that the preparatory children came from middle- to high-income households to maximize the possibility of digital technology being a part of their home environment. Teachers and parents’ perspectives of young children’s engagement with technology were polarized, with teachers being identified as techno-optimists and parents as techno-pessimists. Parental perspectives of technology were overwhelmingly negative, even though mothers did acknowledge that technology was a part of children’s lives and, therefore, some exposure to technology was appropriate and inevitable. However, all mothers used highly emotive language to express concerns about their child’s use of technology and chose to restrict children’s access to it. Alternatively, the three teachers were identified as techno-optimists because they all agreed that technology was a part of children’s lives and that it should be included in their everyday classroom experiences.</p>
<p>In an OECD briefing to ministries, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411416888">Bennett (2002)</xref> made the case for more dynamic statistical analysis of early childhood family and socioeconomic backgrounds and learning environments. Families are enmeshed in complex relationships and interactions. When these relationships and interactions are coupled with the number of literacy resources and how those resources might be used in families, measures such as level of education and income become insufficient justification for the underperformance of children from lower socioeconomic and cultural minority groups. Yet explanations of underperformance in literacy based on deficit models prevail (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411416888">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). This is despite challenges by qualitative researchers concerning the unsophisticated nature of links between SES, home literacy environments and children’s early literacy success. Taking account of the complexity and multifaceted nature of home literacy environments offers ways of moving beyond explanations of underperformance that are based on deficit or mismatch models. As with traditional literacy practices, what we have called media practices may also benefit from a refinement of, as well as an increase in, the categories that are used to make judgements about HLE and associated practices, especially in regard to ethnicity and SES. A more sophisticated approach to HLE that incorporates traditional literacy as well as recent ICT media and practices may be able to add further to the predictive value of ethnicity and SES.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1468798411416888"><title>The pilot</title>
<p>This article reports data from a parent survey that was piloted as part of a larger quantitative sociological study about family literacy practices, pedagogy and achievement in the first year of primary school (children turning six years of age by the end of June). The larger study is the first Australian large-scale quantitative study of variable sociodemographic factors, home experiences, instructional treatment and literacy achievement. It addresses policy debates on phonics, early intervention and standards, and aims to offer guidance for the development of early childhood curriculum strategies and programmes.</p>
<p>The pilot took place in Brisbane, the capital city of the state of Queensland, Australia. The purpose was to trial the instrumentation developed for use in the meta-study. The instruments and artefacts trialled included:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A reading test for year one students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Collection of best practice writing samples from year one students;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teacher survey targeting style of pedagogy;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teacher interview cross-referencing pedagogy survey;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A parent survey collecting information about demographics, home print resources, home print practices and home media practices.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The data reported and discussed in this paper are drawn from the parent survey pilot only. The questions addressed by this paper are:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Is there a statistically significant relationship between income and print resources, print practices and media practices?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is there a statistically significant relationship between print resources and print practices?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Three schools were purposefully sampled to provide a spread of socioeconomic position (SEP) as mapped by the IRSED index calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) (2008a, 2008b). This was done in an attempt to maximize the range of the family income variable. The income variable is to be used in the meta-study as one of the indicators of SEP at the student level. The ABS maps IRSED to postcode – i.e. to geographic groupings. By replacing IRSED with family income in the family SEP calculations it is hoped a more fine-grained analysis can be undertaken. This in turn should improve the stability of the model used to map child literacy levels to SEP and other predictors.</p>
<p>While the data provided a wealth of information with respect to the validity and reliability of the instrumentation to be used in the meta-study, this paper focuses on the relationship between income as a predictor of family print resources, print practices and media practices in the pilot schools. Whereas this relationship or the lack of it is inherently interesting, it impacts directly on building the regression model to be applied in the meta-study. As the meta-study will employ a multi-level regression model to account for contextual and group effects due to class membership, the relationships will, initially, be explored using a simple one-level model. This one-level model will take the following form:</p>
<p>LLR = B<sub>0</sub>+ B<sub>1</sub> SEP + B<sub>2</sub> PR + B<sub>3</sub> PP + B<sub>4</sub> MP + e</p>
<p>LLW = B<sub>0</sub>+ B<sub>1</sub> SEP + B<sub>2</sub> PR + B<sub>3</sub> PP + B<sub>4</sub> MP + e</p>
<p>LLH = B<sub>0</sub>+ B<sub>1</sub> SEP + B<sub>2</sub> PR + B<sub>3</sub> PP + B<sub>4</sub> MP + e</p>
<p>LLR: Literacy level (reading), LLW: Literacy level (writing), LLH: Literacy level (holistic), SEP: socioeconomic position, PR: home print resources, PP: home print practices, and MP: home media practices.</p>
<p>It is recognized that SEP is a generic multi-dimensional term and as such has no single set of indicators. As the name suggests the indicators will depend on a mix of social, cultural and economic factors. It is clear that income andlevel of education are key determiners. While several studies have challenged the idea that income is the most reliable single indicator of SEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411416888">Weigel et al., 2005</xref>), there is still a great deal of acceptance that this is the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411416888">Arnold and Doctoroff, 2003</xref>). The focus of this paper is to question this idea further. The meta-study will also include level of education of parents/carers and cultural background as composite indicators of SEP.</p>
<p>If home print resources, home print practices and home media practices correlate highly with SEP, as indicated by income or with each other, then the assumption of multicollinearity may not be met and the standard errors associated with the <italic>β</italic> coefficients will increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411416888">Berry, 1993</xref>). This will in turn lead to an unstable model. A further consequence is that the unique role of each independent predictor will be hard to assess. While simple correlations between the predicator variables are not the preferred method of assessing the level of multicollinearity, it is still a useful preliminary exercise and is explored in this paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468798411416888"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>A questionnaire was developed specifically for the task of investigating the relationships between income and print resources, print practices and media practices, as well as between print resources and print practices. The parent questionnaire consisted of three parts: background/family information; home resources and practices (print resources and practices, media practices: see Appendix for example items); and three general questions where comments were encouraged. Questions were included about the number of print resources in the home and respondents were asked to circle a number on a scale. In regard to print practices, respondents were asked to circle a number on a scale for the number of times/number of hours they engaged in specific activities with their child in a normal week. For media practices, participants were also asked to circle an appropriate number of times/number of hours their child engaged in particular activities in a normal week. A single aggregate score for each area for each family was then calculated. The details of this process are discussed below.</p>
<p>Correlation coefficients were calculated for all pairs. As flagged earlier, the underlying income variable is continuous but was collected in a way that aggregated it into bands, thus, technically, becoming ordinal measurement. All other variables were considered to be interval levels of measurement. In recognition of this situation, Kendall’s tau correlation was calculated for the relationships involving income and Pearson’s correlation was calculated for the correlation between print resources and print practices.</p>
<p>While it is acknowledged that multiple correlations were applied, <italic>α</italic> levels were not adjusted to correct for type 1 error in an effort to increase the power of the analysis. In each case a scatter plot was drawn to give a visual idea of the relationship and to help identify outliers and curvilinear distributions that could affect the correlations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468798411416888"><title>The sample and data</title>
<p>Three schools were purposely sampled to maximize the range of family income to be used as a partial indicator of SEP. Cultural diversity was also to be used as a predicator along with the language spoken at home and country of origin as indicators, so schools were chosen that drew from culturally diverse clientele. The following demographics paint a picture of the participants. Twenty-two parent surveys were collected from parents of children attending the first year of compulsory schooling, representing a 40% return rate. Measures have been instigated for the meta-study to improve the percentage returned.</p>
<p>While it is acknowledged that a sample of 22 is not large, as this was a pilot study, no attempt is made to generalize to a wider population based on the sample characteristics.</p>
<p> Smaller sample sizes also have an effect on the ability of a statistical test to reach significance. To this end, a priori power calculations were conducted. Hypothesizing a medium relationship based on the interpretation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411416888">Cohen and Manion (1994)</xref> of 0.6, a sample size of 22 and a one-tailed test, a power coefficient of 0.92 was generated at the <italic>α</italic> level of 0.05. One interpretation of this is that we would have a 92% chance of seeing a correlation at the <italic>α</italic> level of 0.05 if a relationship actually existed. This is sufficient statistical power for the purpose of this study. Where necessary the data were also normalized to ensure underlying statistical assumptions were met.</p>
<p>Respondents exhibited cultural diversity in terms of the birth countries of children (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411416888">Figure 1</xref>) and parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411416888">Figure 2</xref>), as well as the spread of educational level attained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411416888">Figure 3</xref>). For just over one-third of carers, year 10 was the highest level of education. These measures will be included as predictors of achievement in the meta-study but will not be discussed further in this paper.

<p>Of importance to the context of this paper is that income was distributed across a wide range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411416888">Figure 4</xref>). Income was categorized into bands in an attempt to overcome the reluctance of respondents to reveal exact family income. A consequence is that while the underlying variable is continuous, the collected data are ordinal. This has implications when considering the assumptions underlying the calculation of correlation coefficients. This is discussed in more detail shortly.
<fig id="fig4-1468798411416888" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Combined family income.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411416888-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>An overall measure of print resources available in the home was obtained by collecting count data, for example the number of books in the home. These data were then standardized, summed and averaged to obtain a single indicator. The data were then transformed to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 to aid interpretation.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468798411416888">Figure 5</xref>, a spread of scores was obtained with a reasonably symmetrical distribution. The same process that was used to generate an aggregate measure of print resources was used to generate an aggregate measure of print practices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468798411416888">Figure 6</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-1468798411416888" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Print resources.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411416888-fig5.tif"/></fig>

<p>Once again, the distribution displays reasonable spread and symmetry. An aggregate media practices score was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468798411416888">Figure 7</xref>) using the same process as applied to the print practices and resources data.
<fig id="fig7-1468798411416888" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Media practices.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411416888-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>While the scores display a reasonable spread, the distribution is less symmetrical than for the print resources and practices data. The measure of media practices incorporated a component referencing the use of computer/video games. This component tended to form a dichotomy with in the families, who tended to use games a lot or not at all. This has contributed to the unevenness of the distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468798411416888">Figure 8</xref>)<italic>.</italic>
<fig id="fig8-1468798411416888" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Video games and hours spent playing.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411416888-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Interestingly, if the children used video games, they were most likely to be accompanied in this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468798411416888">Figure 9</xref>).
<fig id="fig9-1468798411416888" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Video games and hours spent playing when accompanied.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411416888-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>While it would be tempting to assume that being accompanied while playing implied supervision, it could also be interpreted as children playing competitive games with siblings, parents or friends.</p>

<p>Analysis of the scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468798411416888">Figure 10</xref>) suggests little linear relationship between household income and print resources.

<p>Analysis of the scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468798411416888">Figure 12</xref>) suggests little linear relationship between household income and media practices. This is particularly the case if the two high-income points are considered outliers. For the purpose of this analysis they were retained.

<p>The Kendall tau correlation coefficient (-0.33) was significant at <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05 (one tail). There would appear to be a small negative relationship between level of income and media practices in the home as measured by the instrument employed. However, this result could be an aberration because, if the highest-income family is removed from the distribution as an outlier, the correlation is no longer significant at <italic>α</italic> &lt; 0.05 (one tail). This will be investigated in the meta-study where a larger sample size should improve the distribution and increase the power.</p>

<p>There appears to be little relationship between the level of print resources in the home and how those resources are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468798411416888">Figure 13</xref>).

<sec id="sec12-1468798411416888" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The sample size, projected effect size and selected <italic>α</italic> level generated a post hoc power coefficient of 0.92 – i.e. there was a 92% chance of detecting a significant correlation if one existed. In other words there was an 8% chance of committing a type 2 error – i.e. retaining the null hypothesis of no relationship between the two variables when a relationship actually exists. The power calculations were all based on utilizing Pearson’s correlation coefficient. All Kendall tau correlations were rerun as Pearson correlations with no change in establishing significance.</p>
<p>While the logic of hypothesis testing precludes proving the null hypothesis, it would be reasonable to argue that given the high power coefficient associated with the analysis, if a correlation did not reach significance then it is unlikely that there is an underlying relationship between the respective variables within the boundary of the pilot schools.</p>
<p>Given the above, the following assertions can be made in the context of the pilot schools:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The level of print resources found in the home is not related to family income;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How print resources are used in the home is not related to income;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The level of use of print resources is not related to the number of print resources in the home.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The first two assertions go some way to supporting the proposition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411416888">van Steensel (2006), i.e.</xref> that we should move beyond using income as a measure of the level of literacy support offered in the home. They also support the ideas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al. (2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411416888">Wood (2002)</xref> that a broader understanding of HLE is needed and, more specifically, one that treats HLE as ‘complex and multifaceted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411416888">Burgess et al., 2002</xref>: 411). Such complexities might include the level of print resources in the home and connections between how such resources are used. For example, in relation to the three assertions, a broader conceptualization would allow for high usage of resources that might be new (a new book) or a favourite (a particular game), as well as a higher level of use of certain types of resources (such as a preference for hand-held electronic games or a game played with other family members). If necessary it could not only allow for parental as well as child preferences in selecting resources but also for preferences by both parents and children regarding use of the resources available (children as well as parents can have favourites, as well as those that are less favoured). These are just a few examples of the dimensions that could be incorporated in a broader understanding of print resources and their use. Our point is that there seems to be much more to home literacy support than income alone.</p>
<p>In terms of media practices, we make the following assertion on the basis of the pilot study. The level of media practices in the home is weakly, and negatively, related to income. That is, those with a low income are more likely to have a higher level of media practices than those with a high income. This is only a weak negative correlation where 10% of the variation in level of media practices can be accounted for by variation in income. This could be interpreted as supporting the KFF claim that children from lower-income families spend more time watching television and are more likely to live in a home where the television is left on most of the time. It could also be seen as endorsing the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411416888">Marsh and Thompson's (2001)</xref> study of white working-class families for whom television played a key part in the relationships between parents and siblings.</p>
<p>While the data reported here are from a pilot study, they do complement other challenges to, and mounting evidence for, there not necessarily being a direct relationship between income and home literacy resources, or how those resources are used. Further to this, the data show that the level of print resources in the home may not be a good indicator of the level of use of those resources.</p>
