<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Entrapment of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon is an unusual complication of displaced fractures of the distal radius, especially in children. We report a case of EPL entrapment in a child, the youngest so far reported and the first associated with a dorsally displaced radial fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411430028">El-Kazzi and Schuind, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411430028">Thomas and Kershaw, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411430028">Uchida and Sugioka, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>An otherwise healthy 6-year-old boy was referred to us after falling onto the outstretched left hand, presenting with an irreducible dorsally displaced fracture of both the distal radius and ulna. He was treated by closed reduction and intramedullary fixation with 1.8 mm diameter Kirschner wires. The K-wire in the ulna was inserted proximally at the elbow whereas the K-wire in the radius was inserted proximal to the growth plate, adjacent to Lister’s tubercle. EPL function was intact post-operatively. The K-wires were left exposed through the skin and were removed after 4 weeks of immobilization in an above-elbow posterior splint. Additional immobilization with a forearm cast was maintained for 2 weeks. The patient did well until the fifth post-operative month when he was brought to the clinic because of inability to extend the left thumb, without any recent injury. Examination led to the suspicion of a rupture of the EPL tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411430028">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>At surgery, the EPL tendon was found to be trapped in the fracture callus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411430028">Figure 2</xref>). As it was impossible to carry out intraoperative tenolysis, the EPL tendon was reconstructed with transfer of the extensor indicis proprius (EIP) tendon to the EPL. Post-operatively, the limb was immobilized for 4 weeks, followed by physiotherapy, and pain-free normal function was achieved at discharge. Six months after injury, there was full wrist and forearm motion, and good function of the EIP transfer.</p>

</fig>
<p>Rupture of the EPL tendon is a well-known complication after a radial fracture in children. However, entrapment of the EPL tendon, alone or together with other tendons, after a fracture of the distal radius is a rather unusual complication in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411430028">El-Kazzi and Schuind, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411430028">Thomas and Kershaw, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411430028">Uchida and Sugioka, 1990</xref>). All previously reported cases of EPL entrapment in children have been associated with palmarly displaced radial fractures. The most likely theory is that in palmarly displaced fractures the EPL may also dislocate in a palmar direction and be trapped between the fracture fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411430028">Itoh et al., 1987</xref>). In the case we report, we believe that entrapment was due to the original location of the radial fracture close to the third compartment and subsequent entrapment of the EPL tendon in the fracture callus.</p>
<p>Entrapment of the EPL is a rare but possible complication following distal radius fractures in children and both clinicians and parents must be aware of this unusual complication. Although an EIP to EPL tendon transfer was done in the patient that we report, an intercalated tendon graft may also be considered as a possible treatment option.</p>
