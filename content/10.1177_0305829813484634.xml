<p>Most of the International Relations (IR) theories studying the causes of conflicts between states tend to focus either on the quest for power (realist approaches) or the quest for wealth (liberal approaches). In addition to the fact that these theories are considered as materialist or utilitarian, they are also seen as determinist because they define states as rational actors driven by ‘thick’ rationality, that is to say, by ‘fixed’ preferences in their objectives and calculations on how to maximise their power (rational choice theories) or how to increase their well-being in an international environment deemed to be governed by norms and democracy-based institutions (democratic peace theories). While departing from a critique of these theories, both Lindemann’s monograph <italic>Causes of War: The Struggle for Recognition</italic> and the collective work <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic>, edited by Lindemann and Ringmar and gathering together a dozen articles written by high-profile IR theorists, political science researchers, sociologists and philosophers (P. Allan, Ph. Braud, A. Honneth, A. Keller, T. Lindemann, E. Ringmar, R. Wolf and others), develop an original approach that puts the emphasis on the symbolic side of inter-state crises, and thus concentrates on the subjectivity of states and their need for recognition.</p>
<p>Can a war be caused mainly by symbolic factors related to states’ quests for preserving their positive self-images and face-saving rather than by materialist reasons linked to states’ pursuit of power and/or wealth? Do political decision-makers take into account symbolic gains and losses before waging a war? Can states get ‘offended’? Can peace be maintained without recognition among states? While tackling these questions from different angles that engage simultaneously the analytical tools and methods of IR theory, philosophy, psychology and sociology, the main goal of the two books reviewed here is to provide theoretical and empirical evidence that sociological, philosophical and psychological studies on recognition can be applied to political theory, and more specifically to the study of international conflicts. Consequently, <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic> advocates ‘abandoning the old <italic>Realpolitik</italic> for a new <italic>Identitätsproblematik</italic>’ and analysing ‘world politics as a social system … with the help of the tools of sociology’ (p. 4). On the other hand, <italic>Causes of War: The Struggle for Recognition</italic> underlines the need to integrate the concept of recognition in political theory, claiming that ‘non-recognition can be as much as an explanation of war (and peace) as that of other explicative “variables”, such as threats, power or wealth’ (p. 3). To attain these purposes, the discussion in both works is analogically structured in two main parts. The first part is devoted to the theoretical premises of the establishment of the so-called ‘international politics of recognition’. The second part is focused on the empirical applications of these policies through a number of case studies. At least three arguments are put forward in both Lindemann’s monograph and Lindemann and Ringmar’s edited volume.</p>
<p>The first one is related to an ‘interactionist’ conception of recognition considered to be applicable to relationships between states, which Axel Honneth defines in his contribution to <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic> as ‘a necessarily reciprocal act because a newly recognized state can only be viewed as a full-fledged member of the international community if it recognizes the states that offer it recognition in turn’ (p. 28). In this perspective, recognition is perceived not only as a social, but also as a political, act: it assigns a positive status to a state when the state’s identity is acknowledged by the other states and a negative status in the cases where recognition is absent (non-recognition) or denied.</p>
<p>The second argument refers to the concept of ‘struggle for recognition’ claimed to be inherent to inter-state relations and described in Michelle Murray’s chapter in <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic> as ‘the process through which states attempt to gain the recognition of their significant “Others” and to become subjects of a particular kind in the social order’ (p. 134). In this point of view, the denial of recognition represents an interaction between an offended state and a state-offender, and, as such, creates a source of conflict. The latter could take two interrelated forms, as described by Lindemann in <italic>Causes of War: The Struggle for Recognition</italic> (p. 9): first, a ‘struggle for prestige and glory’ caused by the denial of a hubristic state, that is, one defining itself as special and having a superior identity (Nazi Germany, Iraq under Saddam Hussein), by the other states; or, second, a ‘struggle for dignity’ related to situations where a state is disrespected by the other states (Germany after the Treaty of Versailles). However, the fact that the recognition problematic is presented in both works as crucial for the study of international conflicts does not mean that any refusal to recognise a state’s identity will be transformed necessarily into a conflict or a war. Nor can all wars be explained as ‘struggles for recognition’. As Lindemann points out in his monograph, the link between non-recognition and armed conflicts is ‘probabilistic and not deterministic’ (p. 29), meaning that the denial of recognition alone cannot bring about a war. Nevertheless, this denial is considered to be one of the chief factors likely to increase the risk of a military conflict and it is, therefore, important that it is taken into consideration in the study of international crises.</p>
<p>Drawing on the first two arguments, the third argument stresses the necessity to integrate not only the concept of recognition, but also the sociological and philosophical theory of the politics of recognition in political theory in order to better understand, even sometimes prevent, conflicts between states. Hence recognition, and in particular ‘thick recognition’ requiring each party in the conflict to understand the Other’s identity and fully accept it, is seen as crucial for maintaining peace, especially what is called ‘just peace’ as theorised by Pierre Allan and Alexis Keller in their contribution to <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic> (pp. 71–84). The importance of implementing a policy of recognition in the study of international conflicts is also stressed in Lindemann’s book, where the author maintains that ‘the peaceful management of international crises depends heavily on the ability of actors to engage in a kind of politics of recognition which confirms universal and more specific identity claims’ (pp. 5–6).</p>
<p>While the arguments presented in both works are well formulated and supported with rich empirical evidence, at least one methodological problem seems important to point out. This problem concerns the ‘transposition’ of the psychological and sociological concept of ‘recognition’ to IR theory where it is applied to collective political actors, namely states.</p>
<p>Some authors, such as Axel Honneth, seem very sceptical about such a conceptual transfer. In his chapter in the edited volume, Honneth holds that symbols of political recognition alone are not enough to create a solid basis for cooperation between states. Nevertheless, he stresses the necessity for integrating the affective dimension of recognition in IR so as to better comprehend a state’s foreign-political conduct, the latter having been, according to him, interpreted for too long largely within the framework of the realist model of ‘purposive-rational behaviour’ (p. 34).</p>
<p>Although in both works the ‘personalisation’ of the state rests upon the political decision-makers’ subjectivity and sensitivity to the physical survival of their state, its symbolic integrity and self-image, as well as upon the fact that international law refers to states as subjects, some discussions about ‘prickly states’, ‘offended states’ or ‘humiliated states’ could have been strengthened with more methodological explications and empirical evidence, especially regarding the conditions shaping the demand for recognition and self-esteem between states.</p>
<p>In <italic>Causes of War: The Struggle for Recognition</italic>, Lindemann goes even deeper in his analysis of the link between the denial of recognition and inter-state conflicts. Drawing on the works of sociologists (Erving Goffman, Philippe Braud, Anthony Giddens), philosophers (Axel Honneth), psychologists (Abraham Maslow), as well as on constructivist studies focused on the intersubjective aspects of recognition (Friedrich Kratochwil, Peter Katzenstein, Richard Price), Lindemann seeks to prove that there is a correlation between recognition and the dynamics of peace and war depending on states’ identities and symbolic needs, the denial of which can lead to aggressive behaviour. Thus, the author defies the theory of dissuasion and argues that, contrary to its main postulate, threats from one state could, on the contrary, trigger military action on the part of another state because threats often constitute attacks on a state’s reputation, identity and self-esteem. In order to support this claim, Lindemann builds his analysis on four hypotheses on the origins of inter-state wars, each of which establishes a link between non-recognition and conflicts driven by states’ motivations that might result in four different but complementary types of war: 1) ‘war for prestige’ provoked by the rejection of states’ ‘hubristic’ identities (i.e. identities conceived by political decision-makers as superior, because of their states being invested in a global mission) by the other states, as in the case of Hitler’s Germany, the Soviet Union under Stalin’s rule or Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s regime; 2) ‘war by antipathy’ caused by the heterogeneity of domestic identities that makes mutual recognition difficult, and can consequently spur an armed conflict such as the civil war between the Tutsis and the Hutus in the African Great Lakes region; 3) ‘war for honour’ triggered by attacks against accepted standards of a state’s universal dignity (Mao’s China until 1970); and 4) ‘war for identity’ prompted by attacks on specific identities such as a state’s political or cultural references or a lack of empathy, as in the case of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (pp. 31–43). While explicitly aiming to blend psychological theory with constructivism much in the line of authors such as Robert Jervis, Richard Ned Lebow, Roland Bleiker and Maja Zehfuss<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305829813484634">1</xref></sup> in order to stress the importance of states’ identity and motivations in international conflicts, Lindemann’s hypotheses seem to omit to explain the conditions in which these motivations and states’ desire for recognition have been formed. That is one of the reasons why the two sets of case studies used by the author to test his hypotheses are not fully convincing. In the first set he examines four international systems of past great powers. His goal is to prove that, contrary to traditional explanations related to the neorealist approach assessing system stability with regard to the distribution of material capabilities within great powers, international stability is likely to be maintained when the identity claimed by one state is recognised by the other powers without using any stigmatisation or exclusion practices. Based on this premise, two international systems are defined as stable (the Congress of Vienna, 1815–53, and the peace between the great democratic powers, 1945–91) because of mutual recognition among states, and two as unstable (the interwar period, 1919–39, and the first phase of the Cold War, 1945–53) because of the denial of recognition provoked by the development of hubristic identities by some states (Germany, Japan and Italy) and the existence of incompatible ideologies (the American and the Soviet one).</p>
<p>What seems arguable about Lindemann’s methodology applied to this first set of case studies is the way in which the author inserts quantitative analysis in his qualitative examination of the four aforementioned international systems by trying to find a correlation between great powers’ identities and the architecture of their government buildings. Thus, he concludes that an over sized and rectangular architecture represents the hubristic identity of a state and that ‘hubristic’ architecture should generally be associated with armed conflicts between great powers. Unless further explained, this result could be seen as speculative and seems to be prompted by the author’s willingness to assign by all means some quantitative added value to his analysis rather than by any sound methodology.</p>
<p>The second set of case studies refers to four serious international crises, two of which resulted in war (the Six Day War of 1967 and the Iraq War in 2003), namely, for prestige and dignity, because the states involved are deemed to have been unwilling to take into account the other state’s identity and aspiration for recognition. On the other hand, the other two conflicts (the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and the US–Libyan crisis, 1986–2004) were resolved in a peaceful way through management in a manner complying with a politics of recognition. Thus the author claims that the elaboration of a politics of recognition is just as important as material and security motivations in dealing with international crises and that war occurs when decision-makers fail to take into account such a politics. However, this hypothesis could hardly be applied to all types of states. For example, revisionist states, such as Nazi Germany, or authoritarian states, such as Libya at the end of Gaddafi’s rule or today’s Syria under al-Assad’s regime, are mostly driven by their material and security motivations rather than by symbolic ones. Moreover, the credibility of the results of Lindemann’s empirical analysis could also be questioned given the fact that his case studies are based primarily on secondary sources instead of pooling data and information from official documents and the historical archive. This limitation concerns to a lesser extent the case studies (the evolution of Taiwan’s identity, Iran’s proliferation crisis, the symbolic violence of 9/11 and others) examined in Lindemann and Ringmar’s collective work, where the empirical analysis seems to be more firmly supported with historical evidence.</p>
<p>Despite the above-mentioned shortcomings of the analysis in both books, their results are intriguing and suggestive. The undeniable contribution of Lindemann’s monograph is his original approach aimed at integrating the sociological and psychological theory of recognition in the constructivist approach of IR theory. By exploring deeply the correlation between the evolution of a conflict and the presence, or the absence, of a politics of recognition, the author persuasively demonstrates that the drive for political actors’ self-esteem can be as much a cause of an international crisis as the material quest for power and/or wealth.</p>
<p>Theoretically and empirically rich, Lindemann’s monograph <italic>Causes of War: The Struggle for Recognition</italic> and Lindemann and Ringmar’s edited volume <italic>The International Politics of Recognition</italic> could be considered as hybrid works blending social psychology and interactionist constructivism that come together to complete the realist and liberal approaches to studying international conflicts by putting forward the value of symbolic motivations of states, examined through a politics of recognition that stresses the role of the struggle for recognition in understanding and managing inter-state crises. These two books definitely have important ideas and approaches for academics, military strategists and policy makers, who for too long now have remained focused on states’ quest for power, security or other material interests at the expense of states’ need for self-esteem and preservation of a positive self-image for both materialist and symbolic reasons.</p>
