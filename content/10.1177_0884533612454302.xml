<abstract>
<p><italic>Background:</italic> Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. Extensive research has been completed to evaluate the relationship between dietary factors and breast cancer risk and survival after breast cancer; however, a summary report with clinical inference is needed. <italic>Materials and Methods:</italic> This review summarizes the current epidemiological and clinical trial evidence relating diet to breast cancer incidence, recurrence, survival, and mortality. The review includes emerging epidemiological studies that assess risk within breast cancer subtypes as well as a summary of previous and ongoing dietary intervention trials designed to modify breast cancer risk. <italic>Results:</italic> The available literature suggests that both low-fat and high-fiber diets may be weakly protective against breast cancer, whereas total energy intake and alcohol appear to be positively associated. Fiber may be weakly protective possibly through modulation of estrogen, whereas fruit and vegetable intake is not clearly associated with risk. Obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal disease, and adult weight gain should be avoided to reduce risk. In survivors, diet has the greatest potential influence on overall mortality rather than breast cancer–specific events. <italic>Conclusion:</italic> Diet is modestly associated with breast cancer risk; associations appear more pronounced for postmenopausal disease, and healthy choices after diagnosis and treatment likely support longevity more so than reduced risk for recurrent disease.</p>

<body>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women, accounting for 1 of every 3 cancers diagnosed. More than 230,000 new cases of invasive disease are diagnosed annually in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612454302">1</xref></sup> Lifetime risk has remained at approximately 1 in 8 women by 80 years of age for several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612454302">2</xref></sup> Although Hispanic and African American women have lower incidence rates compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), they tend to carry a higher mortality rate; importantly, major advancements in our understanding of disease etiology and risk have supported the development of highly effective, targeted therapies to treat women diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition, there has been a significant increase in early detection of disease, with mammogram screening prevalence now estimated at 66.5% in eligible women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612454302">2</xref></sup> Together, these 2 factors have resulted in survival rates as high as 99% for early stage disease in NHWs and average 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival rates of 89%, 82%, and 77%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612454302">1</xref></sup> These trends have resulted in an ever-increasing population of breast cancer survivors, a group with unique dietary concerns and needs, now approaching 3 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612454302">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over the past 2–3 decades, research to characterize breast cancer has demonstrated that this disease is highly variable in terms of tumor subtypes as well as the diverse etiology. Risk factors, both modifiable and not modifiable, may vary widely. This is an important concept because it not only suggests that therapies will vary, but how we quantify and qualify risk as well as what behavioral approaches are recommended to modify risk will likely need to be tailored to the individual disease classifications. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612454302">Figure 1</xref> summarizes the current diagnostic subgroups used to characterize breast cancer, key classification characteristics, and commonly prescribed therapies. Most breast cancer arises from transformation of healthy tissue into malignancy within either the lobules (lobular) or ducts (ductal) of the breast; the exception is inflammatory breast cancer, which is more diffuse and strongly correlated with an intense inflammatory response. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612454302">Table 1</xref> provides definitions of common terminology used in breast oncology.</p>

<title>Risk Factors</title>
<p>Several established risk factors for breast cancer have been identified, including hormone therapy, obesity, family history, and age. Among the most modifiable risk factors is diet (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612454302">Table 2</xref>). The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of breast oncology and the current evidence linking dietary factors to risk and prevention of breast cancer. Both primary prevention and tertiary prevention will be addressed. Some emphasis will be placed on modifiable diet after breast cancer treatment and survival as this is the population most likely to seek nutrition intervention and counseling.</p>

<p>In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund in collaboration with the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) published an expansive summary document describing the consensus findings from epidemiological research of the association between key dietary factors and breast cancer risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612454302">6</xref></sup> This report indicated that although alcohol was the dietary exposure most consistently associated with risk for breast cancer, weight gain in adulthood and current obesity/body fat were also associated with increased risk for breast cancer, although predominantly in postmenopausal women.</p>
<sec id="section3-0884533612454302">
<title>Alcohol</title>
<p>The evidence suggesting alcohol may increase breast cancer risk continues to mount. A recent analysis from the Nurses’ Health Study affirmed earlier research suggesting that even low to moderate alcohol intake may increase breast cancer risk, particularly for postmenopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612454302">7</xref></sup> In this recent analysis, risk was increased regardless of the source of alcohol, be it wine (red or white), beer, or spirits. This is one of the few reports also to evaluate patterns of alcohol consumption. The data suggested that binge drinking as well as drinking habits earlier in adulthood may further exacerbate risk, and these factors will need to be evaluated on a more consistent basis in future studies assessing these relationships. In the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) observational study cohort that included 87,724 postmenopausal women and 2944 incident cases of breast cancer over 5 years of follow-up, alcohol intake at the level of 1 drink daily was associated with an 82% greater risk for hormone receptor–positive lobular breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612454302">8</xref></sup> A follow-up analysis that evaluated these relationships by tumor type found estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) disease to be associated with alcohol intake, including separate analysis by intake of wine or liquor. In this same analysis, women who reported alcohol intake showed a lower risk for triple-negative disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612454302">9</xref></sup> No increased risk for invasive ductal breast cancer was shown. Investigation into the associated risk for breast cancer among <italic>BRCA</italic> mutation carriers who drink alcohol suggested there was no increase in risk and perhaps a protective relationship for wine intake in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612454302">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exact mechanism by which alcohol may increase breast cancer risk has not been elucidated. A reduction in folate and available methyl donors for DNA stability is one plausible mechanism. Earlier work from Harvard that has been corroborated by several other epidemiological studies suggested that the breast cancer risk associated with alcohol might be attenuated in women who reported a diet with adequate folate intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612454302">11</xref></sup> A recent study of breast tumor characteristics suggested that among those reporting higher adulthood alcohol intake, there is a significant increase in DNA methylation of target promoter genes, and this may account for the increase in risk shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612454302">12</xref></sup> Alternately, changes in circulating estrogen may account for the increase in risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612454302">13</xref></sup> This recent analysis suggests that alcohol increases breast cancer risk independent of folate status,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612454302">7</xref></sup> associations that may have been altered in response to the overall reduction in population-level folate deficiency in the United States following food fortification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612454302">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533612454302">
<title>Dietary Fat</title>
<p>The WCRF/AICR report indicated that evidence, although limited, was suggestive of an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women consuming higher fat diets as compared with those consuming lower fat diets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612454302">6</xref></sup> The role of dietary fat in breast cancer primary prevention has been studied in one of the largest randomized controlled dietary trials ever conducted in the United States, the WHI Dietary Modification Trial. The study randomized 48,835 postmenopausal women to either a low-fat diet (20% total energy; 40% sample) or usual dietary fat intake (60% of sample). The details of the study design have been described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612454302">15</xref></sup> Briefly, women in the intervention groups attended group classes led by a registered dietitian monthly, and then quarterly, for 4 years. Motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy, and group social support were all integrated to promote behavior change. After 8.1 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in the number of newly diagnosed breast cancer cases in the women enrolled in the treatment vs control conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612454302">16</xref></sup> However, a subgroup analysis suggested that among women who entered the trial with higher habitual dietary fat intake (&gt;36.8% total energy intake), breast cancer rates were reduced by 22%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612454302">16</xref></sup> Total energy intake, when adjusted for self-report error using a doubly labeled water-derived calibration equation, was also inversely associated with breast cancer risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612454302">17</xref></sup> In an assessment of predictors of dietary fat reduction, the WHI investigators found that younger age, more education, more optimism, and greater attendance at classes and self-monitoring all supported favorable dietary change.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612454302">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another randomized controlled trial studying the primary prevention of breast cancer, which enrolled 4690 Canadian women with high mammographic breast density into a low-fat group (20% energy) or a usual-diet group, also found no significant effect of the intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612454302">19</xref></sup> In this trial, both pre- and postmenopausal women were enrolled (mean age 47.1 years) and followed for an average of 10 years. In subgroup analysis, greater baseline body weight as well as lower carbohydrate intake was associated with greater risk for ER+ disease; the number of ER– cases was too small for statistical evaluation.</p>
<p>In addition to these intervention trials, epidemiological evidence suggests that dietary fat is modestly associated with breast cancer risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612454302">6</xref></sup> and type of dietary fat consumed may also influence risk. A meta-analysis of 57 studies conducted both in the United States and internationally indicated that saturated fat intake is associated with an increased risk for postmenopausal disease, polyunsaturated fats were associated with increased risk regardless of menopausal status, and monounsaturated fats had no significant association with risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612454302">20</xref></sup> In 1 study assessing risk related to tumor subtypes, vegetable oil–based margarine was associated with a 31% greater risk of ER–/progesterone receptor–negative (PR–) tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612454302">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, a high-fat eating pattern (&gt;40% of energy as fat), characterized by higher intake of processed meats, margarine, butter, and other animal fats, was associated with a 2-fold greater risk for breast cancer in a population sample of 15,351 women with 137 incident cases of invasive breast cancer. Furthermore, the risk was not modified by obesity, menopausal status, or even hormone therapy use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612454302">22</xref></sup> Of interest, a well-designed crossover feeding trial evaluating the effect of dietary fat on sex hormones, a plausible pathway for fat modulation of breast cancer risk, found a 51% increase in plasma estradiol with high-fat feeding but no association between n-3 fatty acids and hormone concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612454302">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Low fat diets may have a role in reducing age-associated weight gain in postmenopausal women and thus indirectly lower breast cancer risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612454302">24</xref></sup> Women randomized in the WHI Diet Modification low-fat diet arm, on average, also demonstrated a modest reduction in body weight during the early years of the intervention. Although this initial weight loss was followed by a steady increase in weight over the 7.2 years of follow-up, the trajectory of weight loss never reached the higher levels demonstrated in the usual-care group.</p>

<p>Studies also have evaluated the role of red meat and/or processed meat and breast cancer risk but to date provide inconsistent results. A 2010 meta-analysis supported the WCRF/AICR findings that suggested there was no conclusive evidence that red meat or processed meat acts as an independent risk factor for breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612454302">25</xref></sup> Efforts to evaluate these associations by tumor subtype are warranted.</p>

However, several dietary components do warrant discussion as the evidence, albeit limited in terms of number and quality, provides guidance in terms of what we tell our patients. For example, dietary fiber, which has been shown to modify estrogen concentrations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612454302">26</xref></sup> appeared to reduce ER+ disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612454302">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612454302">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Vegetable, Fruit, and Legume Intake</title>
<p>The relationship between greater fruit and vegetable intake and reduced risk for breast cancer has not been consistently demonstrated, particularly for U.S. cohorts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612454302">6</xref></sup> This may be related to the overall lower intake of fruits and vegetables in the United States or the reduced amounts of constitutive bioactive compounds in fruit and vegetables selections (State of the Plate: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pbhfoundation.org/pdfs/about/res/pbh_res/stateplate.pdf">http://www.pbhfoundation.org/pdfs/about/res/pbh_res/stateplate.pdf</ext-link>). Soybeans, a legume of the plant family, have been specifically identified for their potential protective association with breast cancer. Soybeans contain several bioactive compounds, including phytic acid, α-linolenic acid, and isoflavones thought to promote health through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and estrogen-modulating effects. A meta-analysis of 18 epidemiological studies of dietary soy intake suggested that high vs low soy intake was associated with a modest 14% reduced risk for breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612454302">29</xref></sup> Protection was more evident in premenopausal women. The studies evaluated were highly heterogeneous, and it is not possible to draw clear conclusions based on this meta-analysis or the evidence at large. Certainly, soy is a reasonable and healthy source of protein and other bioactives in the diet, but high consumption is likely only to demonstrate a protective effect in the context of other cancer-protective dietary behaviors.</p>

<title>Dietary Patterns</title>
<p>Although several nutrients or dietary components have been associated with breast cancer risk modification, there is a paucity of evidence evaluating the role of whole dietary patterns. A review of the evidence in 2009 suggested that no clear conclusions could be drawn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612454302">30</xref></sup>; however, some limited evidence supports the role of the Mediterranean diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612454302">31</xref></sup> Mechanistically, in addition to reducing oxidative stress, increasing satiety, and promoting an anti-inflammatory state, the Mediterranean diet may be protective against breast cancer through the suppression of Her2 oncogene expression by oleic acid (olive oil)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612454302">32</xref></sup> or a suppression of circulating estrogenic hormones in postmenopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612454302">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence from 3 association studies supports the hypothesis that healthier diets, combined with physically active lifestyles, can reduce breast cancer risk even in those at greatest risk for this disease. Specifically, female carriers of the <italic>BRCA1,2</italic> germ-line mutations for breast cancer show a reduction in overall risk as well as a delay in age of disease diagnosis if they report having maintained a healthy body weight, generally through active lifestyle and healthy eating habits during adolescence and early adult life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612454302">34</xref></sup> Higher dietary quality scores are associated with reduced odds for developing breast cancer in <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> carriers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612454302">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Body Weight</title>
<p>Although not a major focus of this review, body weight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612454302">6</xref></sup> has been consistently associated with greater risk for postmenopausal but not premenopausal disease. This is particularly true for luminal-type tumors and possibly also for the triple-negative tumor subtype in women not using hormone therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612454302">36</xref></sup> These associations have not been seen in women taking hormone therapy. As most breast cancer is ER+, there appears to be a significant role for circulating estrogen in imparting risk. In the absence of the higher exogenous exposure associated with prescription hormone use greater body fat equates to greater circulating estrogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612454302">37</xref></sup> Prior to menopause, the adipose-associated estrogen is low relative to the total available estrogen. Thus, obesity after menopause represents a significant increase in normal circulating hormones above what is expected at this age for those who maintain a healthy body weight. The “hyperestrogenic” host environment may explain the differential association of obesity with breast cancer prior to vs after menopause.</p>
<p>Some interesting research in rats wherein net energy availability was modified through energy restriction, physical activity, or both suggested that estrogen may not be the primary causal pathway for obesity-associated disease, but alternatively, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and related insulin levels could be driving risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612454302">38</xref></sup> Relevant to this observation, a meta-analysis showed that waist circumference, an indicator of central adiposity and insulin resistance, increased risk for premenopausal breast cancer by 79% and postmenopausal breast cancer by 50%. These data indicate that regardless of age, efforts to control visceral adiposity are imperative to control breast cancer risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612454302">39</xref></sup> Finally, a recent meta-analysis of 11 studies suggested that adult weight gain is predictive of a 2-fold increase in the risk for ER+ as well as ER+/PR+ breast tumors, with risk greatest among postmenopausal (risk estimate of 2.3) as compared with premenopausal disease (risk estimate of 1.54).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612454302">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, the evidence for an association between dietary practices and breast cancer is substantial. Some factors appear to be protective in reducing risk, whereas others may promote breast cancer. Certainly, limiting alcohol intake is one important approach to reducing risk. Current evidence is also suggestive that greater fiber intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612454302">26</xref></sup> and lower fat intake in postmenopausal women with high habitual fat intake through modulation of estradiol levels may reduce breast cancer risk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612454302">16</xref></sup> as can lower overall energy intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612454302">17</xref></sup> Although most evidence has not consistently supported the role of greater vegetable intake in reducing breast cancer risk, most healthcare providers continue to promote varied and bioactive-rich vegetable intake owing to the theory that exposures above current intake and that are habitual could feasibly reduce risk.</p>

<title>Dietary Concerns During Therapy</title>
<p>Once diagnosed with breast cancer, patients have a plethora of treatment modalities to “cure” this disease. Treatment will vary by disease stage, grade, proliferation, and molecular markers as well as evidence of tumor spread to lymph nodes or other organs. The dietetic approaches will vary with individual therapy as well as the individual response to therapies. Approaches to diet therapy to be employed during breast and other cancer treatments have been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612454302">41</xref></sup> and thus are only briefly described below.</p>
<sec id="section11-0884533612454302">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Almost every breast cancer diagnosis will be treated surgically, either with lumpectomy or mastectomy. As much as possible, those diagnosed with breast cancer should be encouraged to increase intake of lean protein sources, as well as foods rich in vitamin A, zinc, and vitamin C prior to surgery to promote optimal healing and immune function prior to and after surgery. Although no randomized trials have been conducted to specifically test the role of presurgical diet therapy for optimal breast cancer surgical outcomes, knowledge of the importance of diet in healing supports this approach. Supplementation of the diet with targeted nutrients is likely to afford additional benefit in terms of postsurgical healing and reduced risk for infection in women who demonstrate inadequacies in their diet. Dietary practices should be evaluated and recommendations to correct deficiency should be made prior to surgery if possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0884533612454302">
<title>Chemotherapy</title>
<p>Chemotherapy, when indicated, may be administered prior to (neoadjuvant) or after surgery. The most common chemotherapeutic regimes include cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), paclitaxel (Taxol), and docetaxol (Taxotere), although methotrexate, fluorouracil, and bevacizumab are also used. Therapy usually runs 3–6 months and for many women is relatively well tolerated. Common side effects of chemotherapy for breast cancer include nausea, fatigue, and changes in appetite. Most breast cancer patients will not demonstrate problems with weight loss during chemotherapy; many will be weight stable, although undesirable weight gain has been demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612454302">42</xref></sup> The mechanisms of weight change are likely multifactorial, including reduced metabolic rate, reduced lean mass, increased fat mass, reduced physical activity, loss of bone mass, and hormonal changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612454302">43</xref></sup> One report suggested that overeating was not a major contributing factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612454302">44</xref></sup> Yet, it is prudent to suggest that dietary intervention during treatment should include regular evaluation of net energy balance and should promote weight stabilization through changes in energy intake, physical activity, or both. Of note, chemotherapy in some studies has been associated with a reduction in lean mass and an increase in fat mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612454302">44</xref></sup> Thus, efforts should be made to integrate both aerobic as well as strength-training activities throughout therapy to promote cardiovascular health along with retention of lean mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612454302">45</xref></sup> Although protein supplementation, including concentrated leucine intake, has been shown to increase skeletal muscle mass in aging individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612454302">46</xref></sup> and mice with cancer cachexia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612454302">47</xref></sup> no studies have been conducted to evaluate efficacy in the postchemotherapy period.

<title>Radiation</title>
<p>Radiation therapy is commonly used to treat breast cancer, even early stage disease. Dietary concerns related to radiation therapy are limited. Fatigue is a common side effect and can significantly reduce physical activity, leading to weight gain.

<title>Hormonal Therapies</title>
<p>Select estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen were introduced on a broad scale to treat breast cancer in the 1980s; in more recent times, targeted estrogen-targeted medications that inhibit aromatase, the primary enzyme responsible for estrogen production, have been used to treat ER tumors. The aromatase inhibitors, or AIs, demonstrate efficacy similar to selective ER modulators (SERMs) with less endometrial toxicity. Both SERMs and AIs are associated with significant side effects related to the suppression of estrogen, including insomnia, hot flushes, fatigue, and in some cases weight gain; AIs also increase cardiovascular disease risk and fracture risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612454302">49</xref></sup> Recent association studies suggest that cruciferous vegetables and also dietary soy may enhance the effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612454302">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533612454302">51</xref></sup> Similar interactions between AIs and dietary constituents have not been studied.</p>

Another association study by Zhang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612454302">11</xref></sup> showed a hazard ratio for breast cancer mortality of 2.5 (1.2-5.3) in 698 women treated for breast cancer in the 1990s who reported higher fat intake, consistent with findings from another cohort of 4441 survivors wherein overall but not breast cancer–associated mortality was increased by 41% and 78% in relation to high intake of saturated fat and trans fats, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0884533612454302">76</xref></sup> However, studies are not consistent in identifying significant associations, and several have not supported an association between fat intake and recurrent disease or breast cancer mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533612454302">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0884533612454302">78</xref></sup></p>

<p>A second randomized controlled study of 3008 pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, also with early stage disease, resulted in null findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533612454302">79</xref></sup> In the WHEL study, survivors were randomized to 1 of 2 study arms: a low-fat, high-fiber, plant-based diet that was prescribed or the ACS guidelines for cancer preventive eating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0884533612454302">80</xref></sup> After 7.3 years of follow-up, new and recurrent breast cancer events were similar across the 2 arms, suggesting that the plant-based diet had no benefit above the ACS guidelines. What has been gleaned from analysis of this cohort is that women who enter and maintain higher plasma carotenoids (as a result of greater vegetable and fruit intake) demonstrated reduced overall mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533612454302">81</xref></sup> and a survival benefit was demonstrated in women with high plasma concentrations of carotenoids throughout the 6 years of measurement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0884533612454302">82</xref></sup> Of interest, women who entered the study with higher fruit and vegetable intake combined with greater physical activity demonstrated lower overall mortality, regardless of their BMI at the time of study entry, suggesting these dietary behaviors may trump adverse effects of high body weight on overall mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0884533612454302">83</xref></sup></p>

<title>Other Diet Components: Fiber, ω-3 Fatty Acids, Soy, and Select Vitamins</title>
<p>The WHEL study also identified a protective role for dietary fiber in that high fiber intake was associated with a reduction in circulating estrogen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612454302">26</xref></sup> and estrogen in turn was inversely associated with new breast cancer events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0884533612454302">84</xref></sup> in WHEL study participants. These data are consistent with findings from the Healthy Eating, Activity and Lifestyle Study (HEAL) cohort demonstrating a nonsignificant 32% reduction in breast cancer–specific mortality in women consuming higher amounts of fiber.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0884533612454302">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>An additional analysis from WHEL also suggested that high ω-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake from foods, were associated with a reduction in breast cancer events as well as a modest reduction in all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0884533612454302">86</xref></sup> The association between soy intake and breast cancer recurrence risk, particularly for women diagnosed with ER+ disease, has been an area of controversy for several years. Recent large cohort analysis has not shown any adverse effects of dietary soy intake postdiagnosis. In fact, data from the Life After Cancer Epidemiology study (LACE) showed a 52% reduced risk for recurrent disease among postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533612454302">53</xref></sup> Results from a similar analysis with the WHEL cohort found no protective or harmful association between soy intake and breast cancer outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0884533612454302">87</xref></sup> and in Chinese women (n = 524), high soy intake was shown to reduce breast cancer recurrence by 33% as compared with low intake but only in women with postmenopausal, not premenopausal, disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0884533612454302">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vitamin D status, as assessed by circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, was not associated with reduced breast or overall mortality in the WHEL study population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0884533612454302">89</xref></sup> However, higher intakes of calcium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0884533612454302">90</xref></sup> and vitamin C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0884533612454302">91</xref></sup> at the time of diagnosis have been associated with reduced overall mortality in women diagnosed with breast cancer and β-carotene intake with a 52% reduction in breast cancer mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0884533612454302">91</xref></sup></p>

<title>Diet Quality Indexes</title>
<p>Several cohort analyses have been conducted to determine if eating patterns are protective against new or recurrent breast cancer events. Overall, there is no evidence to date to suggest diet patterns are protective for these outcomes, but several studies have identified protection in relation to overall mortality after breast cancer. The HEAL multiethnic cohort has also explored the relationship between diet and breast cancer prognosis. Data from 670 women with local or regional breast cancer followed for 6 years suggested that postdiagnosis diet quality, as assessed using the Healthy Eating Index–2005 scores, reduced overall mortality by 60% and breast cancer mortality by 88%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0884533612454302">92</xref></sup> These results are supported by an observational study in 1901 breast cancer survivors in the LACE cohort that showed a 43% reduction in mortality in women who reported a dietary pattern that included greater vegetable and fruit intake combined with higher whole grain and poultry intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0884533612454302">93</xref></sup> Evidence from the Nurses’ Health Study did not show any of the 4 diet patterns tested to be associated with improved survival after breast cancer, but higher alternate Mediterranean diet score was associated with lower non–breast cancer death in survivors who reported low physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0884533612454302">94</xref></sup> Similar results were found in the Nurses’ Health Study in terms of a protective association for the prudent diet vs the Western diet and overall mortality of breast cancer survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0884533612454302">78</xref></sup></p>

<title>Alcohol and Breast Cancer Recurrence</title>
<p>A few studies have examined the role of alcohol in breast cancer recurrence. Analysis from the 1897 survivors enrolled in the LACE cohort, of whom 49% were reported abstainers, suggested that intake of 6 g alcohol per day, or just over 3 drinks or more per week, increased recurrence risk by 35%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0884533612454302">95</xref></sup> and risk was greatest for overweight/obese women. However, light alcohol intake, regardless of body weight, was not associated with recurrent disease in the WHEL study sample and in fact was associated with a 31% reduction in overall mortality in nonobese women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0884533612454302">96</xref></sup> In the WHEL sample, alcohol intake was higher in women with more favorable tumor prognostic indicators (stage, estrogen status, grade, etc), and for over a third of women, intake was adjusted downward from their usual intake levels after they received a breast cancer diagnosis and prior to enrollment in the WHEL study. These factors may account for the differential findings in these 2 analyses. Evidence from European cohorts suggests that prediagnosis alcohol intake of 1 beverage per day is associated with reduced 10-year survival after breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0884533612454302">97</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section22-0884533612454302">
<title>Weight Control</title>
<p>Only a few weight loss studies have been conducted in breast cancer survivors, and neither evaluated follow-up breast cancer events or mortality. A small study by Thomson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0884533612454302">98</xref></sup> suggested that a weight loss intervention that included counseling by a registered dietitian resulted in significant weight loss over 3 and 6 months. Importantly, the weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in unfavorable metabolic markers, including HbA1c, insulin, and total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These findings have recently been replicated in a 6-month weight loss intervention in 142 overweight breast cancer survivors wherein lipid profiles and glucose improved with weight loss therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0884533612454302">99</xref></sup> A larger multicenter weight loss intervention trial that includes energy restriction in combination with physical activity is currently under way and should provide a more definitive answer regarding the potential for lifestyle interventions, with weight control, to improve breast cancer outcomes (Dr Cheryl Rock, personal communication, University of California at San Diego, March 2012).</p>

<title>Dietary Change in Response to Breast Cancer Diagnosis</title>
<p>Dietary habits of breast cancer survivors have been described in the literature. In a study of WHEL study participants, self-reported data suggested that survivors made several changes to their eating habits after diagnosis. Specifically, the 3088 predominantly NHW survivors reported an increase in fruit and vegetable intake and a reduction in dietary fat intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0884533612454302">100</xref></sup> A more recent report of dietary habits in 260 women immediately postdiagnosis with breast cancer and again 2 years later did not show appreciable changes in diet over the 2-year, postdiagnosis period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0884533612454302">101</xref></sup> What is currently unknown is whether lifestyle counseling during the early posttreatment period may be effective in improving diet quality. Recent work from Christy et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0884533612454302">102</xref></sup> addressed this issue and suggested that mailed, tailored behavioral counseling information resulted in a significant decrease in total and saturated fat intake, an increase in fruit and vegetable intake, and better overall diet quality over a 2-year period.</p>

<title>Remaining Challenges/Research Gaps</title>
<p>Based on currently available epidemiological evidence as well as a wealth of basic molecular and cellular studies of breast cancer, it is clear dietary exposures do influence breast cancer risk. In fact, diet may represent one of the most modifiable risk factors for disease. Current evidence suggests that healthy dietary habits to reduce breast cancer risk should begin early in life. Evidence also suggests that although risk reduction may be modest for any one factor studied in an adult population, theoretically longer term (lifelong) protective dietary choices will reduce overall risk over time. Among the most convincing of evidence is a reduction in alcohol and total fat intake, a high-fiber diet after menopause, weight control through adult life and particularly after menopause, and, to a modest degree, an increase in vegetable intake. Clinicians should also be aware of the increase in overall mortality associated with higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes after breast cancer treatment. Supporting patients who have been previously diagnosed and treated for breast cancer who pursue healthier dietary patterns can modify and improve overall health.</p>
