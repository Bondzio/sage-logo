<p>Power is a ubiquitous feature of social life, particularly within the context of modern organizational society. Yet, as the editors of this volume highlight, power is a slippery concept, which receives less attention by organizational scholars than its importance merits. In particular, Dean Tjosvold and Barbara Wisse emphasize that, as organizations increasingly operate in globalized environments, more research is needed on how cultural and individual understandings of power influence the management of power and its impact on organizational effectiveness. This volume contributes to such a project by presenting insights from international scholars across a diverse set of disciplines, including sociology, organizational studies, social psychology, and leadership and management studies. Divided into five sections, the contributions address key issues emerging from contemporary research such as the social nature of power and how positive and negative aspects of power are managed through relationships, theories of leadership and power-sharing, exchange dynamics and outcomes, the power to influence, and how values and ethics shape forms of leadership.</p>
<p>The chapters address a wide variety of topics. For example, Jeffrey Pfeffer considers the roots of ambivalence towards power and politics. Barbara Wisse and Daan Van Knippenberg examine how self-concept influences individual behavior, including tendencies towards cooperation versus competition and susceptibility to influence. Considering the importance of implied theories of power, Peter T. Coleman provides evidence that the basic views individuals hold about the nature of people and of social reality may influence willingness to share power in organizational settings. Linda D. Molm elaborates a perspective to power studies based within social exchange theory. In a chapter on leadership and conflict management, Randall S. Peterson and Sarah Harvey highlight the benefits of indirect power (e.g., structuring the group, directing group processes, managing external boundaries), which is often more effective at diffusing conflict than direct power (e.g., taking over tasks, making decisions, instructing others). The closing chapter by Ping Ping Fu and Caroline Fu examines non-Western, specifically Taoist, values of leadership and their potential usefulness in Western management settings. All told, this volume provides a useful reference to contemporary research on power in organizations. It presents a broad array of disciplinary perspectives and findings, which would be useful to those with an interest in organizations, management, leadership, power, or conflict.</p>
