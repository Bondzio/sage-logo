<p>It is widely acknowledged that – since the 1980s – major changes have taken place with a view to children’s rights. The adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in 1989 has initiated legal and political reforms at international, national and local levels as well as a fundamental transformation of public attitudes towards children and childhood. It is less known that approximately at the same time there was a remarkable shift of paradigm in childhood studies, away from the traditional socialization perspective towards childhood as a social phenomenon and children as actors and participants in their life worlds as well as in society at large. In spite of the great potential in terms of political implications combined with this new research fashion, its impact on public discourses has so far been rather modest. Even within academia persons who were not directly involved in new childhood studies are likely to ignore these developments. The present handbook will definitely be instrumental in increasing the academic awareness as to new childhood studies. I agree with the publisher’s view as stated on the back cover of the book, that this is a landmark publication in the research of children and childhood underlining the relevance of a significant area of study. It is reflecting the state of the art of new childhood studies in the most comprehensive systematic and representative way since the origins of this research field approximately 30 years ago.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the handbook the editors start by making two remarks: first, childhood studies or social studies of childhood in general and the present handbook in particular do not pretend to represent all research about children, but primarily research on children and childhood in a broader social scientific context (child psychology, for instance, and, especially, the most influential child developmental paradigm with its body of knowledge accrued in more than a century are not included in this book). Second, although the beginning of this new research fashion as well as its institutional establishment is usually identified around the 1980s, there were quite a number of precursors from various research disciplines, who individually had anticipated an understanding of childhood as a broader social phenomenon and of children as actors well before that time.</p>
<p>In explaining the raison d’etre of new childhood studies, the editors distinguish (at least) the following five features as typical for the new childhood paradigm:</p>
<list id="list1-0907568211429754" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>focus on ‘normal’ childhood rather than on children in particular circumstances;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>acceptance of children here and now rather than in their capacity as future adults (implying a critique of the conventional socialization perspective);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>appreciation of children’s agency and participation rather than a narrow perspective of children as people on the receiving end in terms of provision and knowledge;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>analysis of structural constraints (and conditions) on (or of) childhood at the level of society at large, as against restriction to the particularistic world of the family;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>use of ordinary social scientific methods to study children and childhood, in the sense that children as human beings do not deviate in principle from other sociological research objects, and therefore, can and should be studied as such.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Section I, on concepts of childhood studies, is dedicated to theoretical foundations and methodological implications. In the first two chapters childhood is approached from two different perspectives:</p>
<list id="list2-0907568211429754" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Jens Qvortrup’s perspective is childhood as a structural form or as a permanent segment in any society (though varying over time), obviously directing the research focus towards childhood as generational unit as well as towards comparison with other units like adulthood or old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0907568211429754">Qvortrup et al., 1994</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Allison James’s perspective, instead, is childhood as agency or children as actors with a view to the construction of their own lives, the lives of those around them and of the societies in which they live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0907568211429754">James and Prout, 1997</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The chapters make clear that in childhood studies there is not just one new paradigm, there are at least two. Both of them contain an implicit critique with respect to the traditional socialization perspective, however on different grounds: the structure-oriented paradigm emphasizing the permanent nature of childhood as social segment is in conflict with a socialization paradigm underlining the transition process of children growing into society; the actor-oriented paradigm, instead, in interpreting children as co-constructors of their immediate life worlds as well as of society at large, presupposes above all a two-sided interaction between children and adults at all levels, and thus necessarily contradicts a functional one-sided socialization paradigm seeing children merely as passive subjects of social processes.</p>
<p>Priorities of the developmental approach as well as relations between the developmental paradigm of traditional child research and (predominantly the agency-oriented paradigm in) new childhood studies are addressed in a chapter on child development and development of childhood by Martin Woodhead. He refers in particular to some of the critical positions within developmentalism, and concludes that a research agenda on change in children’s growth and well-being may be essential for new childhood studies, too. A further theoretical chapter by Michael-Sebastian Honig deals with the question of how the child is constituted in childhood studies. Once again the different childhood paradigms are discussed, in this context however, not separately, but together, and in addition, the concept of generation as applied in childhood studies is confronted with that used by Mannheim in the 1930s – as also will be done by Leena Alanen and Heinz Hengst in Section III of the book. On the whole, Honig’s chapter may serve the reader as another excellent introduction to the book and as a guide to the following sections. The first section ends with a chapter on method and methodology in childhood research by Andreas Lange and Johanna Mierendorff.</p>
<p>Defining new childhood studies and theorizing on childhood and children is not only a main concern in the editors’ introduction as well as in Section I, but also a recurring issue in quite a number of the following chapters. Section II deals with historical and socioeconomic contexts; Section III with generational relations at both the social and the family levels; children’s everyday lives and the local framework are focused on in Section IV; and Section V is dedicated to children’s practice and children as participants. Once again, the two main research paradigms have been used for collecting and presenting different chapters: Sections II and III, on one hand, may be subsumed more or less under the structure-oriented paradigm; Sections IV and V, on the other hand, under the agency-oriented approach. Finally, there is a Section VI on children’s rights and place in the world dedicated mainly to the CRC and the gap between rights and realities as well as to childhood policies.</p>
<p>Altogether the book contains 28 chapters by some 30 authors, some of the pioneers of new childhood studies among them. Except for one, all authors have an American or European background, and among the Europeans all but one are from Germany, Great Britain or from the Nordic countries. This is an observation, not a critique, because the selection of contributors reflects perfectly the geographic distribution of centres of gravity in new childhood studies. From a substantive perspective, however, a problem may arise as a consequence of this restriction: with a few exceptions the childhood tackled in the handbook is mainly restricted to Northern childhood. While in the beginning of new childhood studies the focus on the North may have been instrumental in contradicting a widespread prejudice that only in poor countries were there problems with childhood, for the future, Southern childhood will have to be included in the analysis in order to prevent problematic generalizations of concepts and realities mainly based on Northern childhood.</p>
<p>The handbook gives the impression that generally the relation between the two new childhood paradigms, structure and agency, is not determined by lively interaction. There is nothing to be said against some division of labour, but there is also the need for engaging in joint debates to uncover synergies. The handbook could have provided an opportunity for doing so.</p>
<p>The handbook would have benefitted from an additional chapter on the state of the art with a view to childhood statistics, particularly from a brief overview of what has changed since the publication of ‘Do children count?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0907568211429754">Jensen and Saporiti, 1992</xref>). Given the relevance of indicators for policy and public opinion at European and national levels, it would have been worthwhile to have addressed in the same or a separate chapter the substantial progress in this area, as confirmed by the foundation of the International Society for Child Indicators (ISCI), with its journal on <italic>Child Indicators Research</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0907568211429754">Ben-Arieh, 2008</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0907568211429754">ChildONEurope, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is no chapter on the girl child, which might cause criticism among feminist researchers. I did not miss such chapter, but I would have welcomed a chapter dedicated to the similarities and differences, as well as the tensions and contradictions between gender and generational analysis.</p>
<p>The editors were right in providing space for tackling children’s rights and the CRC, but some critical issues with a view to the relation between children’s rights and childhood studies should have been addressed in this context. This holds in particular for Article 2 of the CRC dealing with discrimination, not mentioning, however, age as an illicit ground for discrimination, which means that the most relevant type of child discrimination, namely discrimination of children as against adults, is not addressed explicitly in the CRC.</p>
<p>Finally, I would have expected the editors to jointly contribute a concluding chapter on childhood research, past achievements, open questions and future agendas. Although some chapters contain recommendations, a comprehensive synopsis by the editors would have been helpful.</p>
<p>On the whole, <italic>The Palgrave Handbook of Childhood Studies</italic> is nevertheless an excellent book, and the few critical observations I have made are almost negligible as compared to what has been achieved by writing, editing and publishing it. Also the timing of the book is appropriate: some of the pioneers of childhood studies have already retired, others will do so in the not too distant future. From this perspective, the handbook will turn out to be an indispensable working tool for (the next generation of) childhood researchers. In addition to that it will be an important reference book for researchers from other disciplines and areas, in which childhood is approached from another angle, like in psychology, or in which childhood has so far been mostly neglected, as in political science, economics, geography, for example.</p>
