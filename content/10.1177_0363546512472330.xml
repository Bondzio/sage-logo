<sec id="section1-0363546512472330">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The use of patient-reported outcome measures to assess clinical outcomes after injury and surgery has become common in treating young athletes with orthopaedic injuries; however, normative data for these measures are limited and often include a wide range of ages and activity levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512472330">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To provide normative data for the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in a young and athletic population, and to compare scores between participants with a history of knee ligament injury and those with no history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512472330">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512472330">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>We administered the KOOS and WOMAC to 1177 college freshmen entering the United States Military Academy in June 2011. All participants were healthy and had been medically screened to meet the physical induction standards for military service. We calculated means, standard deviations, percentiles, ranges, and interquartile ranges for the KOOS and WOMAC by sex and injury history. We also compared median scale scores for those with a history of knee ligament injury with those with no history using the Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512472330">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Among the 1177 participants, 971 were male (age, 18.8 ± 0.9 years), and the remaining 206 were female (age, 18.7 ± 0.8 years). Normative median values and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for the KOOS scale scores among men with no history of knee ligament injury were the following: Symptoms (96.4; IQR, 10.7), Pain (100; IQR, 2.8), Functional Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (100; IQR, 0.0), Sports and Recreation Function (100; IQR, 5.0), and Knee-Related Quality of Life (QOL) (100; IQR, 12.5). For women with no history of knee ligament injury, the KOOS scale scores were the following: Symptoms (92.9; IQR, 14.3), Pain (100; IQR, 5.6), Functional ADL (100; IQR, 2.9), Sports and Recreation Function (100; IQR, 10.0), and Knee-Related QOL (93.8; IQR, 18.8). Among the men, 139 (14%) reported a history of knee ligament injury, while 33 (16%) women also reported a history of injury. All KOOS scale scores and the WOMAC Stiffness and Function scale scores were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) for men who reported a history of knee ligament injury. Similarly, Symptoms, Pain, and Knee-Related QOL on the KOOS and Pain on the WOMAC were significantly lower among women with a history of knee ligament injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512472330">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Normative values for all KOOS scales suggest a high level of functioning among participants with no history of knee ligament injury. Despite meeting the medical standards for military service, participants with a history of knee ligament injury had significantly lower KOOS and WOMAC scores upon entry to military service.</p>

<p>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) have become increasingly important in evaluating treatment effects in clinical practice and research in recent years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472330">24</xref></sup> To effectively evaluate treatment outcomes, PROs must meet several important criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512472330">1</xref></sup> Specifically, instruments should possess sufficient evidence of validity, reliability, and responsiveness and should be free of ceiling or floor effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, PROs should be evaluated in both patients and a relevant reference population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref></sup> should assess outcomes that are important to patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref></sup> and should be easy to administer and score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref></sup> Several recent systematic review articles have evaluated modern PROs for the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472330">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472330">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472330"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472330">24</xref></sup> While no single instrument has emerged as being clearly superior to the others, there does appear to be a consensus that it is critical to consider the specific population and context in which an instrument has been evaluated when selecting PROs for use in clinical and research settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472330">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472330"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472330">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Another consistent finding in recent reviews is that the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is among the top-rated PROs for use in the knee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512472330">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512472330">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512472330">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512472330">23</xref></sup> The KOOS was developed as an extension of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> and consists of 5 independently scored scales. The 5 dimensions of the KOOS assess Pain (9 items), Symptoms (7 items), Functional Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (17 items), Sports and Recreation Function (5 items), and Knee-Related Quality of Life (QOL) (4 items).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> Each KOOS item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (least severe) to 4 (most severe), and raw scores for each dimension are converted to a 0-to-100 scale, with higher scores representing better outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> The KOOS is a self-administered questionnaire that takes patients about 10 minutes to complete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The KOOS was developed in a rigorous manner, which took into account the existing literature and input from key stakeholders including patients, orthopaedic surgeons, and physical therapists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, the psychometric properties of the KOOS have been thoroughly assessed in many studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512472330">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472330">24</xref></sup> Existing evidence suggests that the instrument has good content,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref></sup> construct,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> and criterion validity and good reliability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> and that the KOOS is responsive to clinically important changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref></sup> In addition to having adequate psychometric properties, the KOOS contains a large number of items that are important to patients with knee injuries and mild to moderate osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512472330">22</xref></sup> The KOOS is currently available in 28 different languages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472330">2</xref></sup> and has been culturally adapted and cross-culturally validated for use in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup> Sweden,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512472330">19</xref></sup> France,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512472330">14</xref></sup> Germany,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512472330">3</xref></sup> Iran,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512472330">21</xref></sup> Singapore,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512472330">25</xref></sup> and the Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512472330">6</xref></sup> Finally, because the KOOS was based on the WOMAC, the WOMAC subscale scores can be calculated from the KOOS. The WOMAC has consistently been identified as one of the top PROs for evaluating outcomes associated with osteoarthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512472330">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512472330">17</xref></sup> and as a result, the KOOS has the advantage of being sensitive to changes from the time of knee joint injury through the onset and progression of posttraumatic osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512472330">20</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Despite the large body of evidence supporting the measurement properties of the KOOS and WOMAC in clinical and research settings, normative data for these instruments are limited,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472330">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472330">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472330">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> particularly in young and physically active reference populations. The only existing normative data for the KOOS were based on a population-based sample in Southern Sweden with relatively heterogeneous age groups (eg, 18-34 years) and activity levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> Another limitation of existing reference data for the KOOS is that it does not account for a history of knee injury or disease or for general health status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> These are important gaps in the existing literature when using the KOOS to assess outcomes in young and physically active populations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide population-based reference data for the KOOS and WOMAC in a young and physically active population at high risk for sports-related knee joint injury. A secondary objective of the current study was to compare KOOS and WOMAC scores between participants with a self-reported history of knee ligament injury and those with no history of injury.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512472330">
<title>Design and Setting</title>
<p>We conducted a descriptive study to document normative reference values for the KOOS and WOMAC in a young and physically active population at the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point. We also performed a cross-sectional analysis to evaluate differences in KOOS and WOMAC scores by sex and between those with a self-reported history of knee ligament injury and those with no history of injury. Finally, we compared the scale scores for the KOOS between the participants in the current study and participants in a prior study reporting normative reference data for the KOOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512472330">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All freshmen entering the USMA in the summer of 2011 were recruited to participate in this study. Participants were briefed on the purpose of the study and reviewed and completed the informed consent process with members of the study staff on either their first or second day after arrival at our institution. During the informed consent process, all patients were notified that their participation in the study was strictly voluntary. Furthermore, the informed consent process was conducted by a civilian to minimize any potential undue influence due to chain of command structures. Participants were informed that information that they provided would be used for research purposes only and would not be shared with their chain of command or be used to make determinations about their fitness for military duty. According to admission records at our institution, nearly 70% of all incoming freshmen participated in varsity athletics in high school. Furthermore, all participants were deemed healthy and medically fit for military service before admission to the USMA through the Department of Defense Medical Evaluation Review Board (DoDMERB). Specifically, all applicants are required to provide a full medical history and undergo a Department of Defense–sponsored physical examination before acceptance to the USMA. Any history of major joint injury requiring medical treatment or surgery must be disclosed. A history of injury, particularly injuries that require surgery, typically requires a waiver for entry, and as part of the waiver process, all treatment records including operation notes must be provided for review by the DoDMERB. Waivered candidates and those with new injuries sustained after acceptance to the USMA but before enrolling are all evaluated on the day they enter the USMA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512472330">
<title>Study Questionnaire</title>
<p>Patients who agreed to participate in the study were asked to complete a brief questionnaire that included basic demographic information, detailed questions about prior ligament injuries to the knee, and any history of knee surgery. The KOOS was also administered as part of this brief questionnaire. All items for the KOOS and WOMAC were scored according to the user’s guide for these instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472330">2</xref></sup> Briefly, all items were scored from 0 to 4 and summed for each dimension scale. Raw scores were then transformed to a 0-to-100–point scale, with higher scores representing better outcomes. If more than 2 items were missing from any of the scale scores, then the scale score for that participant was considered invalid and excluded from further analysis. When 2 or fewer items were missing for any scale score, the average scale score was imputed for that item according to the recommendations of the KOOS user’s guide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512472330">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We used data from 4 items included in the questionnaire to identify participants with a history of knee ligament injury. Participants were instructed that “these questions referred to knee injuries or conditions that they had ever experienced.” A participant was considered to have a history of knee ligament injury if he or she answered “yes” to any of the following questions: (1) Have you ever had an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury? (2) Have you ever had an injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL)? (3) Have you ever had an injury to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL)? (4) Have you ever had a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury?</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Normative descriptive values including means and standard deviations with 95% confidence intervals, medians and interquartile ranges, ranges, and percentiles were calculated for each KOOS and WOMAC subscale by sex and injury history. Our primary statistical analysis was performed using nonparametric methods because the data were not normally distributed based on visual inspection and the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Differences in median scale scores for the KOOS and WOMAC between those with a self-reported history of knee ligament injury and those with no history of injury were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and these analyses were stratified by sex. To compare the scores in the current study with previously published normative reference values for the KOOS, the difference in mean scale scores stratified by sex was evaluated using the Welch <italic>t</italic> test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> Specifically, we compared KOOS subscale scores among those with no history of knee ligament injury in the current study with previously published normative data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> The Welch <italic>t</italic> test assumes unequal variance between groups and is robust to variations in normality, particularly with large sample sizes, and allows for comparison between the normative values observed in the current study and previously reported normative values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 1268 freshmen who entered the USMA in the summer of 2011, 1177 (93%) consented to participate in this study. Among the patients who agreed to participate, 971 were male (age, 18.8 ± 0.9 years), and the remaining 206 were female (age, 18.7 ± 0.8 years). Fifteen percent of all participants reported a history of knee ligament injury (139 male, 14%; 33 female, 16%). Among the men who reported a history of knee ligament injury, 35 (25%) reported a history of knee surgery (12 ACL, 2 LCL, 5 MCL, and 16 with more than 1 ligament or a ligament and other structure, eg, meniscus, in the knee). Among the women who reported a history of knee ligament injury, 12 (36%) reported a history of knee surgery (8 ACL and 4 with more than 1 ligament or a ligament and other structure, eg, meniscus, in the knee).</p>
<p>Outcomes for each KOOS scale are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472330">Table 1</xref> by history of knee ligament injury and stratified by sex. We observed a high proportion of ceiling effects for all KOOS scale scores, and the proportion reporting ceiling effects was typically higher in participants who also reported no history of knee ligament injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512472330">Table 1</xref>). No floor effects were observed for the KOOS in this young and physically active population. All KOOS scale scores including Symptoms, Pain, Functional ADL, Sports and Recreation Function, and Knee-Related QOL were significantly lower for men who reported a history of knee ligament injury. All KOOS scale scores were also lower among women with a history of knee ligament injury; however, only Symptoms, Pain, and Knee-Related QOL were significantly lower. A comparison of KOOS scale scores by sex, stratified by history of knee ligament injury, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512472330">Table 2</xref>. When compared with men, all KOOS scale scores were lower among women both with and without a reported history of knee ligament injury; however, only Pain and Knee-Related QOL were significantly lower among women with a reported history of knee ligament injury when compared with men with a similar history of injury, and only Pain, Functional ADL, and Sports and Recreation Function were significantly lower among women who reported no history of knee ligament injury when compared with men with no history of injury.</p>

<p>Scores for each WOMAC scale are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512472330">Table 4</xref> by history of knee ligament injury and stratified by sex. We observed a high proportion of ceiling effects for all WOMAC scale scores, and similar to our observations for the KOOS, the proportion reporting ceiling effects was typically higher in participants who also reported no history of knee ligament injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546512472330">Table 4</xref>). No floor effects were observed for the WOMAC in this young and physically active population. In general, men and women with a history of knee ligament injuries reported lower WOMAC scores than those with no history of injury. Men with a history of knee ligament injury reported significantly lower Stiffness and Function scores on the WOMAC, while women with a history of injury reported significantly lower Pain scores. A comparison of WOMAC scale scores by sex, stratified by history of knee ligament injury, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0363546512472330">Table 5</xref>. Similar to the results for the KOOS, all WOMAC scale scores were lower among women both with and without a reported history of knee ligament injury; however, only Pain was significantly lower among women with a reported history of knee ligament injury, and Pain and Function were significantly lower among women who reported no history of knee ligament injury.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides normative reference values for the KOOS and WOMAC in a young and athletic population, which may be most appropriate for comparisons in older high school and younger college-aged athletes and physically active patients. While normative values have been previously published for the KOOS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> important limitations may restrict their clinical utility, particularly in young and physically active patients. The only study to publish population-based reference values for the KOOS relied on a simple random sample, stratified by age, which was selected from the National Population Records in a southern region of Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> The age range for the sample was between 18 and 84 years, and no exclusions were made for physical activity level or prior injury, illness, or musculoskeletal disease. As a result, previously published norms for the KOOS included relatively heterogeneous age groups (eg, 18-34 years), did not account for a history of knee ligament injury, and were not limited to physically active populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> These limitations are likely why we observed significantly higher scores for all KOOS scales among men and nearly all scales among women in the current study when compared with previously published normative values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> for the comparable age group and sex. It was not surprising that ceiling effects were observed in a relatively high proportion of participants in this young and active population or that these effects were more prevalent in participants who reported no history of knee ligament injury.</p>
<p>We observed significant sex differences for several KOOS subscales in both participants with a history of knee ligament injury and participants with no history of injury. Paradowski et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512472330">15</xref></sup> reported lower scores among women between the ages of 55 and 74 years for all KOOS subscales when compared with men of comparable age; however, the observed differences were only significant for the Pain, Symptoms, and Functional ADL subscales. Similarly, women in the current study reported lower scores for all KOOS subscales when compared with men, regardless of injury history. Women with a history of knee ligament injury reported significantly lower KOOS Pain and Knee-Related QOL scores, while women with no history of injury reported significantly lower Pain, Functional ADL, and Sports and Recreation Function scores when compared with men. The results of the current study confirm that KOOS scale scores vary by sex in young and active patients and that sex differences should be accounted for in establishing, interpreting, and using normative reference values for this instrument clinically.</p>
<p>Despite meeting the physical induction standards for military service, men and women with a history of knee ligament injury had significantly lower scores for many of the KOOS and WOMAC scales upon entry to the USMA, and some of these differences approached clinical significance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512472330">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512472330">24</xref></sup> While the observed differences are not surprising, these findings are particularly noteworthy. Regardless of recovering from their prior injuries sufficiently to be considered healthy enough for military service, many participants still reported significant limitations in their knee, regardless of sex. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these baseline differences among those with a history of knee ligament injury will affect their long-term outcomes during military service and subsequent physical activity. Finally, these findings highlight the importance of accounting for a history of knee ligament injury in establishing and using normative reference values in research and clinical settings.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report normative reference values for the WOMAC in a young and physically active population. Previous studies have reported normative values for older populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472330">8</xref></sup> have grouped those under age 35 years into a single group,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472330">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472330">5</xref></sup> or have failed to account for physical activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512472330">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512472330">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512472330">8</xref></sup> Similar to the KOOS, these limitations may negatively affect the clinical utility of existing normative reference data in physically active high school and college athletes and patients. The reference values presented in this study may be critical in evaluating degenerative joint changes over time in young athletes who sustain knee ligament injuries. This is particularly important given the high rates of posttraumatic osteoarthritis in young athletes after knee ligament injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512472330">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512472330">10</xref></sup> and that athletes in the second and third decades of life are at the greatest risk for these injuries. As with the KOOS, we also observed significantly lower WOMAC scores among those with a history of knee ligament injury and among women in relation to men. Similarly, the effect of significantly lower WOMAC scores among those entering military service with a history of knee ligament injury on long-term clinical and occupational outcomes is unknown and warrants further follow-up.</p>
<p>The current study has important limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. As with any observational study, there is the potential for selection bias. Specifically, it is possible that freshmen entering the USMA with a history of knee ligament injury may have chosen not to participate in the current study. Despite the 93% response rate in the current study, it is possible that some of those who elected not to participate may have had a prior knee ligament injury. To minimize the potential for this type of selection bias, participants were informed that the information that they provided would be used for research purposes only and would not be shared with their chain of command or be used to make determinations about their fitness for military duty. Another potential concern with selection bias in the current study is the population that was studied. All participants were prescreened through the DoDMERB process to ensure that they were healthy and fit for military service before data collection. Furthermore, the admissions process for our institution may have excluded some candidates who were academically deficient or less physically fit. This is also a potential strength of the current study population, as nearly 70% participated in high school athletics at the varsity level. As noted previously, because of the select nature of the study population, the findings of the current study are probably most appropriate for comparisons in older high school and younger college-aged athletes and physically active patients.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study provides normative reference values for the KOOS and WOMAC in a young and physically active population. The normative reference values in the current study were significantly higher than previously published values for the KOOS. Despite meeting the physical induction standards for military service, participants with a history of knee ligament injury had significantly lower KOOS and WOMAC scores on several subscales regardless of sex. For both the KOOS and WOMAC, men reported higher scores when compared with women, regardless of knee ligament injury history. As a result, it is important to account for age, sex, activity level, and history of knee ligament injury when establishing normative reference values for PROs like the KOOS and WOMAC.</p>
