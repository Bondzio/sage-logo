<p>The Association of Asthma Educators (AAE) has enjoyed an eventful summer! First and foremost, the 2013 Annual Conference was scheduled for August 2-4, 2013, at the Francis Marion Hotel in beautiful and historic Charleston, South Carolina. A fantastic and robust schedule of events provided a worthwhile experience for all. In accordance with the theme—<italic>History of Asthma: Where Are We Now?</italic>—course offerings outlined the founding of asthma research, as the newest advancements in treatment were emphasized.</p>
<p>Highlights of the conference included the preconference community service project, an initiative led by AAE members to aid Charleston residents in need of care; a diverse array of concurrent sessions; general sessions led by national thought leaders in the field of asthma education and treatment; and opportunities to review research posters displayed and presented by AAE members.</p>
<p>The conference helped set the stage to reveal several major updates to AAE’s member services functions and operations staff. AAE has recently begun working with a new management company, and key staff members were introduced at AAE’s onsite membership meeting. The new staff members are pleased to be working with AAE’s membership and are excited to announce the unveiling of the new AAE Web site, which was showcased during the conference and officially announced during AAE’s annual business meeting and luncheon. AAE’s new Executive Director, Brian Doty, CMP, announced the location of the 2014 Conference, and AAE’s staff members are working diligently to confirm locations for 2015 and 2016 as well. These locations will be based in part on the venues of the membership’s preference.</p>
