<abstract>
<p>To investigate the characteristics of diabetic patients with foot ulcers, their health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and the link between them. The study population included 131 consecutive patients presenting in a diabetic foot clinic with a new foot ulcer between December 1, 2011, and May 1, 2012. The authors collected sociodemographic data, foot and ulcer characteristics using the Wagner Grade, and HRQoL (using the SF-36 Scale) information; 54.2% of the patients were in Wagner 2 or Wagner 3 categories. In all the 8 SF-36 subscales and in the SF-36 summary scales, the patients with diabetic foot ulcer had significantly poorer HRQoL than the general population in China (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Their Wagner Grade had negative correlation with all the SF-36 subscales and the summary scales (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). In conclusion, new diabetic foot ulcers were already in poor condition when patients first visited the diabetic foot clinic. Concomitantly, patients had worse HRQoL compared with the general population. More effective interventions are needed to improve their self-care level and HRQoL.</p>

<p>With social and health care development, noninfectious chronic diseases have replaced infectious diseases to be the major killers, whereas diabetes ranks third.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612457034">1</xref></sup> According to the latest survey by the China Diabetes Association, China has a growing diabetic population that is close to 100 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612457034">2</xref></sup> Diabetic foot disease often comprises foot infection, ulcer, and/or deep-tissue damage associated with neuropathy of the lower limb and peripheral artery diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457034">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The annual incidence of diabetic foot in the diabetic population is 5% to 10%, and the probability of developing a foot ulcer in the life of a diabetic is 15%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612457034">4</xref></sup> Large health surveys have shown that 3% to 4% of diabetes patients expend 12%-15% of medical resource, and mostly in foot complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457034">5</xref></sup> In developing countries, diabetic foot patients occupy 40% of medical resource for diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612457034">6</xref></sup> According to a Chinese diabetic foot survey, most of the diabetic foot patients are elderly, with poorer education and income. Considering a mean hospital stay of 26 days and mean cost for each hospitalization of 14 906 renminbi plus outpatient clinic and indirect costs, the expenditure on a diabetic foot is huge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612457034">7</xref></sup> Foot ulcers cause much disruption in a diabetic patient’s life. Patients need to stay in treatment for long times, and their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) deserves attention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612457034">5</xref></sup> There are limited numbers of studies regarding the HRQoL of diabetic foot patients in China.</p>
<p>In this study, our aim was to (1) understand the demographics, characteristics (Wagner grade), and HRQoL of patients first visiting the clinic for a new diabetic foot ulcer; (2) explore the influence of diabetic foot and its severity on patient HRQoL; and (3) explore the influence of diabetic foot etiology on patient HRQoL.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612457034" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>The study design was prospective and observational. A total of 147 type 2 diabetic patients with foot ulcers were screened in the diabetic foot clinic of a tier II hospital in Shanghai from December 2011 to May 2012; 131 patients were enrolled, whereas 16 patients were excluded for the following reasons: acute heart failure (n = 2), severe arrhythmia (n = 2), kidney failure (n = 2), severe pneumonia (n = 1), communication impairment (n = 3), acute phase of schizophrenia (n = 1), depression (n = 1), family reasons (n = 1), and patient withdrawal (n = 3).</p>
<sec id="section2-1534734612457034">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Patients with type 2 diabetes who wanted to participate in this study and had wounds at or distal to the ankle were included. The patients were conscious and had the ability to communicate with the investigator. Patients were not included if they had nondiabetic foot ulcers, had acute complications (such as stroke, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction), had a tumor, had cognitive or mental illnesses, or had undergone significant life events within a month (such as loss of a spouse).</p>
<p>An ulcer was defined using the International Consensus on the Diabetic Foot as a full-thickness wound below the ankle in diabetic patients, irrespective of the duration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612457034">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534734612457034">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The data collection method was as follows: (1) we informed the patients about study objectives, relevance, and methods of examination and obtained consent; (2) the patients were interviewed regarding demography and cause of foot ulcer, and lab exam results were recorded; an attending doctor evaluated the ulcer and performed Wagner grading. If a participant had multiple ulcers at the same time, the wound with the highest grading was selected for analysis; for wounds with the same grading, the larger wound was chosen; (3) the participant completed the SF-36 independently; (4) the SF-36 form was received immediately after completion, and completion was checked by the investigator.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534734612457034">
<title>Medical Assessment</title>
<p>Each patient’s medical history was obtained via a standardized information form, which included variables such as age, sex, blood pressure, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, diabetes history, duration of foot ulcers before the first admission, history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease and other chronic complications of diabetes, previous history of foot ulcers and amputation, and cause of ulcers.</p>
<p>Laboratory data included fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 hours postprandial blood glucose (PBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), albumin, white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin, and wound exudate sample culture results.</p>
<p>Physical examination was done to document the body mass index (BMI). Malnutrition was defined as a BMI ≤ 18.5. BMI status was classified in China as follows: normal, 18.5 to 24; overweight, ≥24; and obese, ≥28.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612457034">9</xref></sup> Neurological assessment was carried out by testing for protective sensation using a 10-g Semmes-Weinstein monofilament. Vascular assessment was done by documenting the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) using a hand-held Doppler probe. The following ulcer-related characteristics were also assessed: location, topographic aspects, number of affected zones, infection, edema, depth, area, and wound healing phase. The area was calculated by multiplying the 2 maximum dimensions at right angles; the detailed assessment criteria for neuropathy, ischemia, and other variables were from the Saint Elian Wound Score System.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457034">10</xref></sup> For example, if the patient had no symptoms or signs of ischemia, the distal pulses were palpable, and the ABI was between 0.9 and 1.1, then ischemia was ruled out. When pedal pulses were palpable but diminished or the ABI was from 0.70 to 0.89, then the degree of ischemia was defined as mild. If palpable pulses were greatly diminished or absent or the ABI was from 0.50 to 0.69, limb ischemia was defined as moderate. If clinical data showed peripheral arterial disease, nonpalpable pulses, or ABI &lt; 0.5, then limb ischemia was defined as severe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612457034">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534734612457034">
<title>Grades</title>
<p>Patients were classified as Wagner grade 1 if the feet had a superficial wound, grade 2 for deep wounds penetrating to the tendon or joint capsule but not the bone, grade 3 for lesions involving deep tissues with abscess or osteomyelitis, and grades 4 and 5 for localized and generalized gangrene, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612457034">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534734612457034">
<title>Health-Related Quality of Life</title>
<p>HRQoL was measured using the SF-36 Health Survey. The SF-36 consists of 36 questions that measure 8 dimensions—namely, physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health. The scores in each dimension were transformed into 0 to 100 subscales. The sum of the 8 dimension scores were the total scores. A high score indicated a better HRQoL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612457034">12</xref></sup> The Chinese version of the SF-36 scale was developed by professor Li Lu and proved to be suitable for Chinese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612457034">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534734612457034">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>We used SPSS17.0 statistics software for analysis, and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was taken to denote significance. Continuous data were presented as means ± standard deviations. Where appropriate, Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or ANOVA was used for comparison of quantitative data. The independent <italic>t</italic> test was used to test for differences between quantitative data and the general population. The association between 2 categorical variables was analyzed using either the χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher’s test. When the independent variable yielded quantitative data, the Pearson correlation was used for analysis of the relationship between 2 variables. For correlation analysis between 2 ranked data, we used Kendall’s tau-b test.</p>

<p>As regards ulcer-related assessment, nonischemic ulcers constituted 43.5%, and mild-, moderate-, and severe-ischemic ulcers constituted 15.3%, 13.7%, and 27.5%, respectively. Noninfected ulcers constituted 14.5%, and mild, moderate, and severe infection were found in 30.5%, 48.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. Ulcers with no edema constituted 22.1%, and periwound (mild), unilateral leg (moderate), and bilateral leg (severe) edema were seen in 39.7%, 35.9%, and 2.3% of cases, respectively. No neuropathy (normal protective sensation) was seen in 19.1%, and diminished protective sensation (mild), absence of sensation to monofilament (moderate), neuro-osteoarthropathy (severe) were seen in 42.7%, 36.6%, and 1.5%, respectively. In all, 42.7% of ulcers were located in the phalange (mild); metatarsal (moderate) and tarsal (severe) locations were seen in 34.4% and 22.9%, respectively. Also, 31.3% of ulcers were situated in plantar or dorsal aspects (mild) and 56.5% in lateral or medial aspects (moderate); all aspects were affected (severe) in 12.2%. Among the patients, 74% had just 1 affected zone (mild), 20.6% had 2 affected zones (moderate), and 5.3% had multiple wounds (severe). In 11.5%, the depth of ulcers was superficial (skin only, mild); deep ulcers (below dermis, moderate) and all-layer ulcers (bone and joint, severe) were found in 32.1% and 56.5%, respectively. As regards the area of ulcers, 72.5% were smaller than 10 cm<sup>2</sup> (mild), 22.2% were between 10 and 40 cm<sup>2</sup> (moderate), and 5.3% were larger than 40 cm<sup>2</sup> (severe). We found that 8.4% of ulcers were in the epithelialization phase (mild), 19.1% in the granulating phase (moderate), and 72.5% in the inflammatory phase (severe).</p>
<p>We classified the diabetic foot ulcers into 4 categories according to etiology as follows: ischemia, neuropathy, both ischemia and neuropathy, nonischemia and nonneuropathy. The percentages were 12.2%, 36.6%, 44.3%, and 6.9%, respectively.</p>
<p>In terms of the severity of foot ulcers, 25.2% of the ulcers were Wagner 1, 22.9% Wagner 2, 31.3% Wagner 3, and 20.6% Wagner 4. More than half (54.2%) of the ulcers were graded as Wagner 2 or Wagner 3. Comparison between demographic data of patients with different Wagner grades showed no statistical difference (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Comparison between laboratory-related data of patients with different Wagner grades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1534734612457034">Table 3</xref>) showed no statistical differences for the variables FBG, PBG, and hemoglobin (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) and significant statistical differences for the variables albumin, WBC, and HbA1c (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, there were more male patients than female patients, with a ratio of 2:1. This could be associated with men being less conscientious about foot care and participating in more activities than women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612457034">14</xref></sup> According to this study, age between 65 and 70 years, diabetes history of more than 10 years, and other diabetic complications are the factors associated with higher incidence. It suggests that we should pay more attention to this population. We found that 56.5% of patients had a previous history of foot ulcer, and 66.2% had a history of amputation (including minor amputation). This shows the high recurrence rate of diabetic foot ulcer.</p>
<p>The mean duration of foot ulcers before the first admission is 2.4 months, which is long enough to indicate that the patient did not ask for specialized help immediately. The reasons could be not being aware, ignorance, and lack of access to specialized help. Diabetic foot centers should take the lead in offering specialized help, where physicians, nurses, health educators, podiatrists, surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, psychologists, and administration personnel all contribute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612457034">3</xref></sup> Our study shows unsatisfactory glucose levels and more or less hypoalbuminemia and anemia. Also, 57.9% of wound exudate samples turned out to have positive bacterial cultures, with various pathogens, although <italic>S aureus</italic> and mixed infections were the most common. Based on these, we summarize that the diabetic foot is characterized by male dominance, older age, malnutrition, long diabetes history, long duration of ulcer, high recurrence rate, and high infection rate.</p>
<p>The theme of the 2005 World Diabetes Day was “Diabetes and Foot Protection.” But awareness and self-care among patients is not sound, as supported by the evidence that Wagner grade 2 to 3 ulcers constituted the majority at first visit. The spectrum of the most common causes, such as footwear that does not fit (19.8%), injury (17.6%), and burns (9.9%), supports the view that up to 50% of diabetic foot ulcers are preventable. Some patients developed ulcers because of spontaneous blisters. Patients should be reminded that blisters should be handled by specialized personnel and not by puncturing by the patients themselves. Social support is very important. Chen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612457034">15</xref></sup> showed that diabetic foot patients should receive more social support to make them more adaptive to events and improve prognosis and life quality. In our study, 28.3% of foot ulcers developed without evidence of causes; however, 76.7% of these patients had diabetic neuropathy, which “mutes” i.e. renders the patient insensitive to pain/trauma and hence to potential triggering of wounds. It implies that for the high-risk population, a daily visual check and protection cannot be emphasized enough for early detection and diagnosis.</p>
<p>With the change of the medical model from a biological model to a biopsychosocial model, HRQoL receives more and more attention. SF-36, as the most popular and universal HRQoL evaluation tool, is widely used in different areas of medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612457034">13</xref></sup> This study shows that HRQoL, in particular the physical role subscale, is lower among diabetic foot patients. This coincides with other studies and may be explained by limited walking and self-care ability and long-term unemployment or sick leave.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612457034">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612457034">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compared with the normal population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612457034">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612457034">19</xref></sup> diabetic patients had lower scores in all the 8 subscales of SF-36. Some studies point out that the HRQoL of the diabetic foot population is even lower than the general diabetic population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612457034">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612457034">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734612457034">21</xref></sup>; possible reasons include long-term dressing change, frequent debridement, hospitalization, and uncertain prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612457034">17</xref></sup> A qualitative study on diabetic foot patients showed that a loss of self was very common because of living a restricted life, existing in social isolation, experiencing discredited definitions of self, and becoming a burden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734612457034">22</xref></sup> In short, the HRQoL of diabetic patients is significantly reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612457034">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>One study showed that SF-36 was able to differentiate between a healed diabetic foot patient and one whose ulcer has not healed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612457034">17</xref></sup> This study finds that Wagner grade is negatively correlated with the 8 subscales and the summary of SF-36. Severity of foot ulcer as determined by Wagner’s grade also were found to be significant and independent predictors of HRQoL impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612457034">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612457034">25</xref></sup> But when separately using the Cardiff wound impact schedule, a disease-specific HRQoL measure to assess the HRQoL of patients with diabetic foot ulcers, and the University of Texas wound classification system to evaluate wound severity, there was no significant difference in mean Cardiff wound impact schedule scores between categories of wound severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734612457034">26</xref></sup> This may be because different study tools were used, and we need more prospective research to explore the relationship between severity of diabetic foot ulcers and HRQoL.</p>
<p>This study also shows that a higher Wagner grade, representing deeper ulcer, larger size, more infection, ischemia, and edema, can be translated to the clinical signs of odor, exudates, and pain, which will compromise patients’ physical and mental health and social networking. Meanwhile, patients with higher Wagner grade, lower albumin, and higher HbA1c are prone to negative nitrogen balance and poor glucose control. A study in Thailand shows that glucose control influences HRQoL of a diabetic foot patient and reflects the overall self-management of the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612457034">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, patients with different etiologies of the diabetic foot will have different HRQoL. In general, a patient with neuropathy is better than one with ischemia or hybrid patients. This indicates that etiology may have prognostic value for life quality. But meanwhile, if the patient is free of pain, this could make him or her underestimate the disease, and consequent poor compliance may prolong healing time or lead to nonhealing. There are controversies regarding the influence of neuropathy on poor prognosis for diabetic foot ulcer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612457034">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734612457034"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734612457034"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534734612457034">31</xref></sup> We need more prospective studies to address this question.</p>
