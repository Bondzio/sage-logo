<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of undergoing a presymptomatic genetic test for the hereditary and fatal Huntington’s disease, using a case study approach. The study was based on 18 interviews with a young woman and her husband from the decision to undergo the test, to receiving the results and trying to adapt to them, which were analysed using a life history approach. The findings show that the process of undergoing a presymptomatic test involves several closely connected ethical and medical questions, such as the reason for the test, the consequences of the test results and how health-care services can be developed to support people in this situation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD), which typically starts to manifest in midlife, is a fatal genetic disease involving the fields of neurology and psychiatry. It is often regarded as a model for genetic diseases as a predictive genetic test is available that can be used before any symptoms are observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012452686">1</xref></sup> Being able to predict whether someone will develop a serious disease in the future is associated with several ethical issues, such as who is entitled to information regarding the results of a genetic test, if, how and when they should be disclosed, as well as the consequences of the result for the person taking the test and their family. These issues are especially pertinent in the case of HD since it leads to serious and long-lasting symptoms, and there is no cure. It is therefore important to highlight the ethical and social aspects of predictive genetic testing for HD in order to gain a deeper understanding of the situation in which the families concerned find themselves. This knowledge can then serve as the basis for the development of medical and social support.</p>
<p>HD is hereditary and is due to the expansion of a repetition in the DNA sequence called CAG in the <italic>Huntingtin</italic> gene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012452686">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012452686">3</xref></sup> The disease is autosomal dominant, which means that if one parent carries the mutant gene, each child has a 50% risk of inheriting it. The mutant gene has full penetrance, that is, a carrier of the mutant gene will always develop the disease, if he or she lives long enough. An inverse correlation has been found between the number of CAG repeats and the age at which the disease manifests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012452686">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012452686">5</xref></sup> However, the number of CAG repeats only explains about 60% of the variance in age at the onset of the disease and cannot be used to estimate when an individual will develop symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012452686">6</xref></sup> HD is clinically diagnosed when a patient presents with unequivocal signs of involuntary movement (chorea),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012452686">7</xref></sup> although non-motor symptoms actually develop gradually many years before the motor symptoms. Examples of these are psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, anger and obsessive–compulsive behaviour, as well as impact on cognitive capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012452686">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012452686"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012452686"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012452686"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012452686">11</xref></sup> Those affected by the disease gradually have difficulties in caring for themselves, and in the end stage of the disease, they become completely dependent on others. HD leads to death approximately 15–20 years after the manifestation of the first motor symptoms. Despite extensive research, only symptomatic and palliative treatments are available today.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012452686">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012452686">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012452686">12</xref></sup> Although the disease is rather rare, 4–10 per 100,000,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012452686">3</xref></sup> the consequences for those affected and their families are devastating.</p>
<p>Approximately, 15% of those at risk of developing HD choose to undergo a predictive genetic test before the onset of motor symptoms. Before the test is performed, the patients are required to undergo so-called genetic counselling, including several counselling sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012452686">13</xref></sup> The aim of counselling is to help the patients and their family make decisions bearing in mind their values, goals and situation and to help them cope with the consequences of their chosen course of action, be it to take the test or abstain from it. Prenatal diagnosis for HD is also possible during pregnancy by the analysis of foetal DNA in maternal plasma. The availability of predictive genetic testing leads to a series of ethical dilemmas, not only for the person in question and their relatives but also for the health-care system and society in general.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012452686">14</xref></sup> One question is whether, and when, it is beneficial to predict a disease that cannot be cured. This question, in turn, hinges at least partly on the answer to another question, namely, does the knowledge that you or a close relative will develop a fatal disease actually lead to a better quality of life or do the anxiety and sadness resulting from confirmation of the disease outweigh the possible benefits? It is obvious from the few empirical studies that have been conducted that both ethical issues and psychosocial consequences are central.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012452686">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012452686">16</xref></sup> For example, Klitzman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012452686">17</xref></sup> showed that while health-care workers provided those concerned with information, the emotional reactions of the family had considerable impact on the patient’s decision to go through with the predictive genetic test. However, medical knowledge and the emotional reactions of relatives may be in conflict with each other and with the person’s own preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012452686">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012452686">19</xref></sup> Another issue discussed in the literature is the anxiety that can arise when the result of the test is made known to family members, who would perhaps have preferred not to have known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012452686">20</xref></sup> Genetic testing thus affects the patient’s family as well as the patient themselves, regardless of the test results.</p>
<p>Previous research concerning predictive genetic testing for HD has mainly had a retrospective design, for example, Sobel and Cowan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012452686">21</xref></sup> and Decruyenaere et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012452686">22</xref></sup> who interviewed families, 12 months and 5 years, respectively, after the genetic test. Empirical knowledge on the decision-making involved, from deciding to take the test to making adjustments in everyday life that may be required depending on the result of the test, is sparse. Such knowledge is essential for health-care staff in order to understand the situation from the patients’ perspective, so that they can provide the appropriate care and support. The aim of the present study was therefore to elucidate the process involved in undergoing a presymptomatic genetic test for HD, in order to obtain an understanding of the patient’s perspective and the effect on a young couple.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733012452686" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A descriptive case study design, using a longitudinal narrative life history approach, was used. As people form the basis of groups, communities and cultures, investigating individuals’ lives in depth helps us understand the whole context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012452686">23</xref></sup> and the complex interaction between life and the lived context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012452686">24</xref></sup> This study was based on recurrent interviews with one young woman and her husband and presented in the form of thematic life histories, which imply an understanding of certain themes in a person’s life,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012452686">25</xref></sup> that is, the process involved in presymptomatic genetic testing.</p>
<sec id="section3-0969733012452686">
<title>The case</title>
<p>The couple described in this article are called Maria and Eric. They are about 35 years old and have been married for about 10 years. They live in a small town in Sweden and have a daughter called Julia who is 8 years old. They both know that HD runs in Maria’s family on her father’s side. Maria’s parents have always talked openly about the heritability of the disease but said that Maria would never suffer from the disease, as there would surely be a cure by the time she was middle-aged. The starting point of this study is the point at which Maria’s father is diagnosed with HD, at the age of 60.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733012452686">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The couple in question contacted the first author with the intention of sharing their story about HD and genetic testing as they were familiar with her research. The first author interviewed Maria and Eric separately on nine occasions during a period of 15 months. The first interview took place a couple of weeks prior to the genetic test, and the last interview took place about six months after they had received the results of the test. The interviews lasted between 1 and 2½ h and were of a narrative nature, consisting of questions such as the following: ‘Please, tell me about your present situation’. All the interviews were conducted in their home. The contents of the interviews were not disclosed to the couple until the last stage of the analysis. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcribed texts were returned to the respective interviewee, and follow-up reflective interviews were carried out to deepen and clarify the content.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0969733012452686">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The text was analysed in line with a life history approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012452686">26</xref></sup> and according to what Goodson and Sikes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012452686">25</xref></sup> call <italic>immersion</italic>, meaning that the researcher has to ‘bathe in the data’ by being open and curious about what the text conveys. The analysis was performed in several steps starting with a naïve reading of the respective narratives by the first author and the fifth author independently. Thereafter, the text was read several times and recurrent patterns related to the aim of the study were noted and grouped. The authors strove to be open to the messages in the text while reading them (i.e. using an inductive approach). The two authors continuously discussed the interpretation of the text. The analysis was guided by constructing a plot, that is, a conceptual scheme that weaves the story together<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012452686">26</xref></sup> using turning points to guide the direction in the plot.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733012452686">
<title>Ethical aspects</title>
<p>The study was guided by the Helsinki Declaration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733012452686">27</xref></sup> and approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund University (H15 2011/797), although the couple were not actually patients. Even if the study was initiated by the couple themselves, they were informed that they could withdraw their participation at any time. They were also assured that the results would be presented in a way that would safeguard their confidentiality. Both participants gave their written informed consent.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733012452686">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The results are presented in eight chronological themes reflecting Maria’s and Eric’s separate narratives. Our interpretation and description of their story are presented under each theme, together with condensed versions of their narratives.</p>
<sec id="section8-0969733012452686">
<title>Striving for knowledge – wanting to face the truth</title>
<p>The narrative starts when Maria has made the decision to take a presymptomatic genetic test. At this point, she did not consider whether it was right or wrong to take the test, or what the consequences would be, she just wanted to know. Her husband Eric supported her but did not want to influence her decision too much. His thoughts mainly concerned family planning and a wish to be able to plan for the future.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>When my father became ill I had to know. I think this is what I’d been waiting for my whole life. If my father had been free of the disease, I would not have had to take the test.</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>I knew that the risk increased markedly for Maria when we realized that her father was ill. I would really like Julia to have a sibling, but this time I don’t want to take a chance … But I also want it to be her own decision and don’t want to influence her in any direction; but deep down I want to know the truth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thus, at this point, they both wanted to face the truth and did not reflect very much over the consequences of such a decision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733012452686">
<title>Living in a vacuum while waiting for the result</title>
<p>The narrative continues after DNA sampling, which in itself Maria did not experience as a dramatic event. The period after the test while waiting for the results was described as a vacuum. This period was longer than normal as neither the physician nor Maria was aware of the pre-test genetic counselling required before the result of the test can be disclosed, and it was therefore performed after DNA sampling. Eric was not invited to take part in genetic counselling and therefore felt left out and had to deal with his own thoughts and concerns by himself.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>It came as a shock to me that I would have to wait so long for an answer I knew was waiting somewhere in a laboratory and concerned my own body and my own DNA. But I had to accept it, even if the genetic counselling didn’t give me any new insight …</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>I was not involved in the genetic counselling at all. I would probably have been welcome to participate, but I was not invited to attend. Sometimes I think we should decline to know the answer as it might be better to not know. But deep down I don’t believe Maria is ill, I actually don’t. Yet I see some signs, but I’d rather find other explanations of her behaviour.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The long period of ‘waiting in a vacuum’ was characterised by alternating between hope and despair for both Maria and Eric, but separately. They did not share their thoughts and feelings with each other to any large extent but carried their own burdens in silence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0969733012452686">
<title>The result of the test – chaos and despair</title>
<p>When the day came to receive the results of the test, Maria and Eric went to the hospital together, both feeling hopeful and quite sure that the result would be what they hoped for. However, the physician immediately told them that Maria had the mutation and the number of CAG repetitions she had, which Maria interpreted as indicating early onset of the disease.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>The only words I heard were how many CAG repetitions I had. I collapsed as I realized that the onset of the disease would be early and I would become ill around the age of 40. I tried to explain to Eric on our way home but he didn’t listen. I had to talk to someone but didn’t want to worry my father and make him feel guilty, so the only person I could think of to contact was my older brother, although our relationship is not that good.</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>I have a blurred memory of the visit. The doctor was very direct and got straight to the point, and we both cried, so did the doctor. I did not understand the meaning of the number of CAG repetitions, but it seems that Maria will become ill much earlier than her father did. In the initial period after we got the test result we were filled with despair, but at the same time we had a child to take care of. We had to express all our sorrow and despair at night, to spare Julia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite their long period of preparation, the truth brought about chaos and despair. Maria’s memory of the situation is very clear, while Eric’s is fragmented as he did not understand the information, although they both said that the test result was given in a calm and objective way. Their reactions on that day thus varied. Maria had an urgent need to share her feelings with someone who understood, while Eric seemed to need time to comprehend the situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733012452686">
<title>Deciding between privacy and openness – how much should we share?</title>
<p>Soon after realising the consequences of the test result, Maria and Eric had to decide whom to tell, and how, and their views on this differed. Maria wanted to share the information and be as open as possible, while Eric was more hesitant and mainly thought of protecting Julia. The reason for Maria’s wish to be open was her previous experience of rumours about how her father had become ‘weird’ and made strange movements before he was diagnosed.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>I want no secrecy, I don’t want people talking about me behind my back. It feels better if I can tell everyone and give my own version. I remember how it was with my father, with people talking behind his back when he behaved strangely.</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>I want to wait to tell everyone, mainly out of concern for Julia. She is still so young, and it’s wrong to tell other people before she knows. And how can I tell her? ... A couple of weeks later: We have now finally told Julia and said that mummy has the same disease as granddad. Julia’s immediate reaction was: ‘What – then I also have a 50% risk of getting the disease?’ … I had hoped that we could spare her this knowledge, and maybe get professional help as she seems to keep all her feelings inside.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Their reasons for telling or not telling others about their situation at this stage differed. Maria soon started to share her story with others, which meant that they had to tell Julia as well. This was also in line with the advice given by health-care staff. But they both said that they felt quite alone regarding their concerns about what was best for Julia at this point in time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733012452686">
<title>The first signs of the disease – stumbling in shame</title>
<p>A couple of months after the test result, Maria and Eric started to realise that Maria had actually shown psychiatric signs of the disease for some time. Although it was painful and shameful for her to acknowledge the presence of obsessive–compulsive acts and outbursts of anger, she now understood why and could ask for help. Eric had lived with Maria’s behaviour for years but had tried to find other explanations and keep it within the family. He now realised that it was a consequence of the disease.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>When we visited the outpatients unit for a follow-up visit, the doctor asked various questions, and my abnormal need for control was discovered, as well as my sometimes uncontrolled agitation. I now also started to notice that I lose my balance easily and I can’t stop the progression …</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>She has always had a strict system at home, she has always insisted that things should be done in a certain way, that the laundry must be done her way. She has also had outbursts of anger, and I sometimes wondered if our marriage would last. But my thoughts have also been about Julia, how has all this affected her?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At this point, Maria was given high doses of antidepressants, which made her feel more stable mentally. However, the pharmacological treatment meant that Eric found her emotionally blunted and more difficult to reach emotionally. Maria also started to notice physical signs of the disease.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>Maria’s emotional state is now more stable due to the medication, it’s better, but it also means that we can never cry together or share our grief over the situation because she is never sad anymore. She is the one who comforts me when I cry, and I wish I could comfort her, too.</p>
</disp-quote>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0969733012452686">
<title>Mirroring the future in younger and older generations</title>
<p>Maria’s father’s disease eventually progressed to the stage where he increasingly needed help with his personal care. Maria took on a caring role and therefore saw herself in her father’s situation on a daily basis. This, together with the memory of her grandmother’s last few weeks and months of life became the image of her own destiny. Eric’s main concern at this time was the consequences of Maria’s future deterioration, but the destiny of their daughter scared him even more. However, in order to cope with his daily life, he actively tried to avoid these thoughts.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>My father and I have the same sense of humour and can joke about the disease, when he has problems communicating, he says with a twinkle in his eye, ‘this will happen to you too’. But deep inside I think that I will definitely not make these strange sounds when I’m talking. Somehow, I’ll battle against it when my time comes. It is very hard for me to think that Julia also may carry the gene. But just as my father can’t be blamed, I am not to blame. I would not have wanted my mother and father not to have had me; my life has after all been good.</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>I can see how Maria’s father is getting increasingly worse and it really scares me to know that Maria will be the same. But what scares me even more is the thought of Maria losing her mind. How can I take care of the family and all the practical things by myself? But the thoughts of a future where Julia is also sick are too difficult for me to think about, I just can’t handle them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Maria’s father’s condition was thus a constant reminder of the future for both of them, as well as a source of worry about the future of their daughter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0969733012452686">
<title>Facing the challenges of the future – a contrast between life and death</title>
<p>As the picture of the future slowly started to consolidate in Maria and Eric’s minds, new questions about the future arose. Their thoughts were now concerned with death and dying, on the one hand, but the thought of having another child, on the other. Maria made it very clear that she was not scared about death but was worried about how the disease would manifest in the later stages and the fact that she would become dependent on others. She reflected over the process of dying and whether she wanted life-sustaining treatment, when the time arrived. Eric tried to portray himself in the role of a bystander, being a companion on Maria’s road to the inevitable end.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>I am not afraid to die, but I am afraid of going mad. I absolutely do not want Eric to look after me, he is my husband, not my carer. I do not want to be tube-fed, when the time comes I want to die. Eric really wants another child, and I want to give that to him as a love gift, so that he will not be so lonely when I’m gone. But we will ensure that the baby is born healthy.</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>All I want is to take care of her for as long as possible, but at the same time I must respect her wishes. If euthanasia had been legal, I think I would have liked that for her when she gets really seriously ill. I think it will be awful to stand and watch someone you love suffer. I love kids and wish that we could have a sibling for Julia. Many might think this is selfish, as the child will not have its mother there, and what if anything should happen to me too? I’ve also thought about how one day I’ll have to explain to Julia why we didn’t do a prenatal diagnosis on her.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The matter of life and death was ever present, although their outlook and motives varied. For Maria, the thought of another child meant a ‘gift of love’ to her husband, while Eric saw this as something that would bring joy and happiness into the family at a time of fear and despair. Both of them were eager to ensure that the next child should not be a carrier of the gene, and they contacted a genetic clinic to learn more about the procedures for genetic testing of the foetus.</p>

<title>Trying to adapt – a new outlook on life</title>
<p>About 6 months after receiving the result of the test, both Maria and Eric started to re-evaluate their present life and began to plan for the future they actually had together. Their perception of the future was that Maria would gradually develop more symptoms, meaning that their time together was limited. They handled the view of the future in different ways; Maria was sad about the thought that she would not be around when her grandchildren were born and the risk of being replaced by another woman. Eric tried to find meaning and joy in everyday life, trying to focus on the present rather than thinking about the future.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Maria</p>
<p>I have not regretted for a second that I chose to take the genetic test because now I know what to expect. Before, I had many dreadful thoughts – what if I have HD – now I know, and it makes me calmer. I try to appreciate the life I have and my family. I want to be present in my family’s mind even when I am gone. What if I should be replaced or forgotten?</p>
<p>Eric</p>
<p>Now that I know that the time we have left together is limited, I really try to ensure that our daily lives are as bright as possible. We have no grand dreams. We have just a few years left, and we must make the most of them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When Maria’s and Eric’s narratives end, they are both convinced that their decision to ‘see their future in a crystal ball’, by undergoing a predictive genetic test, was right. However, they do not know what consequences this will have on their life in a longer perspective. Their story illustrates the process they are going through during a difficult time in their lives and can guide us in our understanding of how this situation is perceived by those involved. This, in turn, will increase our awareness of the feelings and needs of patients and relatives in similar situations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Medical and ethical aspects are deeply intertwined when considering and undergoing a presymptomatic genetic test and affect not only the person concerned but also their family. The themes in Maria’s and Eric’s narratives reflect the academic bioethical discussion that has been ongoing for the past two decades; above all, they struggled with the central issue: Why should I (or anyone) take such a test, that is, what is the value of presymptomatic genetic testing?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012452686">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733012452686">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0969733012452686">29</xref></sup> Maria and Eric faced this question and thought about it in different ways. They had different views on why such a test should be done at all. Eric had a rather straightforward reason for Maria to go through with the test: it may be relevant for future family planning. This is in line with the views of many geneticists and patients who argue in favour of presymptomatic genetic testing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733012452686">30</xref></sup>: that is, it may enable a person or a family to live in accordance with their own values and plans, in other words, it promotes their autonomy.</p>
<p>However, as their story revealed, knowing in advance that you have a genetic disease may give rise to anxiety. While waiting for the result, Maria and Eric alternated between hope and despair. After they had been given the result they were, to a large extent, left on their own with their incomprehensible thoughts and emotions. In the period before the result was known, Maria thought further about the reason for wanting to find out if she carried the gene. She was trying to avoid the anxiety of not knowing, and thus indirectly identified the other main reason presented in the defence of presymptomatic testing: psychological well-being,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012452686">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733012452686">31</xref></sup> meaning that it may be better to face the truth and have the opportunity to accept that one carries a mutated gene than to live with the uncertainty. This indicates that issues concerning quality of life are highly relevant to the question of whether or not testing should be performed. This highlights the importance of respecting and strengthening the individual’s autonomy in these decisions and promoting awareness of the consequences of knowing, as well as not knowing.</p>
<p>The findings of this study also indicate that the way in which testing and disclosure of the results are carried out, that is, how information is provided to the patient, before, during and after presymptomatic testing, greatly affects the way in which the patients and families experience the procedure. This in turn has implications for health-care services. In the case of Maria and Eric, it was clear that the information provided before the test was structured according to a set of established guidelines but was mainly focused on Maria and excluded Eric. This meant that he was to a large extent left on his own with his thoughts and anxiety. The partners need for support, and the fact that they seldom seek support by themselves, has been highlighted also in earlier studies (see, for example, Refs 21, 22, 32 and 33). The study by Decruyenaere et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012452686">22</xref></sup> showed that many partners report a low quality of relationship and changed roles inducing marital distress 5 years after the test results. This calls for an increased development of supportive means; for example, support groups or individual counselling, directed towards partners and their specific situation. It is also important to consider the information provided when the result of the test is disclosed. If the health-care professional giving the result does not have detailed knowledge of the specific disease, there is a risk that the patient will be misinformed or will misunderstand crucial information, which may cause unnecessary anxiety. For example, Maria believed that the more CAG repetitions a person has, the earlier the onset. There is thus not only a need for specialised regional outpatient clinics for patients with diseases such as HD but also a need for increased knowledge among all physicians, as the first contact Maria had was not aware of the formal procedure of testing, which delayed the genetic counselling. Furthermore, there may be a delay of several years between receiving the test result and the onset of the disease, during which the patient and their family are left on their own, while in fact they need support. Previous research shows that early psychiatric symptoms and pathological changes can be detected more than 10 years before overt motor changes occur, in other words, the onset of the disease is much earlier than the time at which the diagnosis is normally made,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012452686">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012452686">7</xref></sup> which the couple in our story became aware of. So again, what are the benefits of receiving an early diagnosis, when no cure is available? One benefit could be an increased understanding of the psychiatric symptoms, which often occur early in the progression of the disease. This may lead to earlier visits to health-care professionals able to give pharmacological treatment and support, leading to an increased quality of life for the person affected and his or her family. Presymptomatic testing may also provide the patient and his or her family with the opportunity to adapt to the situation, make plans for the future and come to terms with the inevitable before it is too late.</p>
<sec id="section17-0969733012452686">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>This study must be judged in the light of its methodological limitations. We used a case study design involving only two people. The sample is small, but the aim of the study was to provide a frame for understanding how people experience a situation like this. There are many ethical as well as methodological concerns involved when using only one couple and by following them for such a long time. The relationship that evolved between the researcher and the couple was necessary to obtain depth in the interviews. However, it is inevitable that the researcher will become emotionally involved, which may affect the way in which data are collected and interpreted. Therefore, the interviewer had repeated discussions with the fifth author during data collection, and to reduce the risk of bias, all authors were involved in the analysis. Another aspect that strengthened the trustworthiness of this study is that Maria and Eric read the transcripts and confirmed our interpretation of them. Another question is to what extent we can ‘trust’ their narratives, but as the narratives were collected separately and over a relatively long period of time, during a time of crisis, this risk was almost certainly reduced.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Seeing the future in a crystal ball, that is, to undergo a presymptomatic genetic testing for HD, conveys several ethical, medical and emotional consequences. The support to people in this situation needs to be developed in order to provide accurate information and knowledge, involve the whole family and be increasingly focused on the inevitable emotional strains that the testing and the first signs of the disease bring about. It is also of importance that health-care professionals acknowledge the specific needs that the partners might have.</p>
