<abstract>
<p>Lateral ankle ligament surgical reconstruction can take many forms, including anatomic and nonanatomic reconstructions. The nonanatomic reconstructions require the use of autograft or allograft tendons to recreate the vectors of the injured anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) and the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL). The purpose of this study was to determine the minimum, maximum, and average graft length requirements for a modified Chrisman–Snook procedure. The structures at risk during drilling of the bone tunnels were documented to guide recommendations for tunnel placement. Modified Chrisman–Snook lateral ligament reconstructions were performed on 10 cadaveric below-the-knee specimens, with no known pathology. Transosseus tunnels were placed through and through the fibula, talus, and calcaneus at the origin and insertion sites of the ATFL and CFL. The minimum, maximum, and average graft length requirements were 91 mm, 170 mm, and 120.7 <italic>±</italic> 23.84 mm, respectively. The overall average graft requirement was approximately 120 mm. The length of graft was correlated with the height of the patient. Medial structures that were directly encountered, in at least one specimen, with the transosseus tunnels included the tibial nerve, tibial artery and flexor hallucis longus tendon. The posterior tibial nerve was the structure at greatest risk. The length of the graft, when performing the modified Chrisman–Snook, should measure approximately 120 mm, but considerable variability exists depending on the size of the patient. To avoid injury to medial structures, the transosseus tunnels should be made using either a blind hole technique or guide wire to avoid perforating the medial cortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic ankle instability develops after 10% to 20% of ankle sprains despite appropriate conservative management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012451316">1</xref></sup> More than 80 surgical procedures have been described to treat chronic ankle instability, categorized as either direct or indirect repairs, with or without augmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012451316">2</xref></sup> Direct anatomic repair (eg, Brostrom procedure) is preferred for most individuals with isolated anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) injuries or ATFL and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) combined injuries. Reconstructive procedures that use tendon grafts to augment stability (tenodesis) are generally reserved for individuals who have failed direct primary repair or have risk factors for re-injury, including ligamentous laxity, neuromuscular imbalance, obesity, or foot and ankle deformities.</p>
<p>The Evans, Elmslie, Watson–Jones, and Chrisman–Snook procedures are commonly described tenodesis reconstructions for chronic ankle instability. Many variations have been described that use different grafts sources, graft fixation, and tunnel placement. The authors recommend a modified Chrisman–Snook procedure as the preferred tenodesis procedure. Tendon graft options include autografts, allografts, and xenografts. Our preferred graft source is auto or allograft hamstring (gracilis). Coughlin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451316">3</xref></sup> reported the average autograft length harvested as being 12 to 16 cm in length to perform their modified Elmslie procedure using gracilis graft. Gracilis allograft is used for a wide variety of indications in orthopaedics, but the length is particularly relevant for its use with lateral ankle reconstruction because of the multiple tunnels and trajectories used in tenodesis reconstructions.</p>
<p>Graft length requirements can be affected by a number of factors, including the size of the patient and the specific technique used for reconstruction, which varies based on the type of graft fixation and the number of bone tunnels. Changing the direction and orientation of the bone tunnels may affect both the length requirements and the structures at risk with tunnel placement, especially with a lateral to medial calcaneal bone tunnel.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this study was to provide information regarding minimum, maximum, and average graft length requirements in relation to a patient’s height. Graft length information can help guide preoperative graft selection and decrease the risk of harvesting grafts that are too short. If allografts are used, significant cost increases can be avoided by approximating the graft length before the graft is opened and prepared.</p>
<p>The second aim of this study was to describe the structures at risk with varying degrees of calcaneal bone tunnel obliquity. This information may help the surgeon avoid neurovascular and tendon injuries on the medial side of the ankle.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ten below-knee cadaveric specimens were used, all with intact ankle orientation. The average age of the cadaveric specimens (at date of death) was 69.2 years. Average height was 68.7 inches, and average weight was 158 pounds. All the specimens were right below-knee specimens, 2 female and 8 male. Nine were Caucasian and one was African American. No specimens had evidence of trauma or surgery to the ankle.</p>
<p>The ankles were isolated, free of soft tissue, with the local ligaments left intact. Insertion points of the ATFL and CFL were determined by direct observation on the specimens at the talus, calcaneus, and fibula. The insertion points on the talus and calcaneus were marked with a guidewire. A guidewire was placed in the fibula connecting the anterior insertion point of the ATFL to the posterior insertion point of the CFL. Transosseus 4-mm drill holes were placed through the fibula, talus, and calcaneus. The length of the fibular tunnel measured 2 cm. We based the length of the fibular tunnel on previously published data describing a fibular tunnel length of 2 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451316">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A gauge flexible string was weaved through the tunnels in place of the allograft. The string was delivered through the fibula, talus, and calcaneus and was secured at the medial aspect of the talus and calcaneus as the ankle was held in neutral inversion and dorsiflexion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012451316">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012451316">2</xref>). To prevent overtightening of the graft, the ankle should be held in approximately 5° varus during the actual procedure.</p>

</fig>
<p>The string was marked where it emerged from the tunnel on the anterior aspect of the talus, and it was also marked where it entered the calcaneal tunnel on the lateral aspect of the calcaneus. The strings were then removed from the specimens, and the distance between the marks on the string was measured. This measurement accurately determined the extra-osseus length of graft necessary for a Chrisman–Snook reconstruction procedure.</p>
<p>After determining the graft length in the 10 specimens, we determined the various structures at risk for Chrisman–Snook calcaneal drilling. After drilling, the relative locations of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), flexor digitorum longus (FDL), calcaneal nerve, and posterior tibial artery to the drilling site were noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1938640012451316">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The minimum, maximum, and average graft length requirements were 91 mm, 170 mm, and 120.7 ± 23.84 mm, respectively. The overall average graft requirement was approximately 120 mm. When stratified according to height, a directly proportional relationship was noted with increasing height and increasing graft length. For individuals with a height of 5 ft 10 in. and above, the average graft requirement increased to 133 mm. For individuals less than 5 ft 10 in., the average graft length requirement decreased to 102 mm.

<p>The structures at risk were recorded in relationship to the guide pin exit point through the medial calcaneus. The tunnel was subjectively placed perpendicular to the calcaneus, with notable variations in the medial exit point.</p>
<p>For the FHL, the pin was posterior to the tendon in 3 specimens, through the FHL in 4 specimens, and anterior to the FHL in 1 specimen. In 2 specimens, the FHL was not affected.</p>
<p>For the FDL, the pin was anterior to the tendon in 2 specimens and between the tendon in 1 specimen. In the other 7 specimens, the FDL was not affected.</p>
<p>For the posterior tibial artery, the pin was between the branches of the artery in 2 specimens and anterior to the artery in 1 specimen. In the other 7 specimens, the artery was not affected.</p>
<p>For the posterior tibial nerve, the drilling was between the nerve in 2 specimens, through the nerve in 4 specimens, posterior to the nerve in 1 specimen, and just posterior to the calcaneal branch in 1 specimen. The nerve was not affected in 2 of the specimens.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tenodesis procedures were originally described in the late 19th century as a method of joint stabilization in paralytic deformities of the foot. In 1915, Gallie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451316">5</xref></sup> of Toronto published favorable results in approximately 100 tenodesis procedures performed in the foot and ankle. Evans and Van der Rijt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012451316">6</xref></sup> were the first to describe the use of a bone tunnel for tendon fixation as a modification to the procedure described by Gallie, and a multitude of technique variations have since been described to stabilize the ankle and subtalar joints.</p>
<p>The techniques have evolved in lateral ankle ligament reconstruction with a more recent emphasis on anatomic tunnel placement that augments the normal direction of constraint supplied by the ATFL and CFL. Elmslie<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451316">7</xref></sup> described a tenodesis procedure that involved drilling holes in the calcaneus, fibula, and talus to restore the function of the entire external ligament complex. He described placement of fascia lata graft in the drilling sites of the talus and calcaneus connected in a fibular tunnel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451316">7</xref></sup> Chrisman and Snook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451316">8</xref></sup> described a modified Elmslie procedure, which involved the use of a split peroneus brevis weaved through tunnels in the talus, fibula, and calcaneus. Coughlin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451316">3</xref></sup> also described a modified Elmslie procedure, which used a continuous gracilis graft weaved through a talar tunnel, a fibular tunnel, and a calcaneal tunnel. The ends of the graft emerging from the talar and calcaneal tunnels were sutured back to the graft itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451316">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The procedure recommended by the authors is referred to as a modified Chrisman–Snook procedure. This procedure is different from the modified Elmslie procedure described by Coughlin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451316">3</xref></sup> because the tunnels in the talus and calcaneus are drilled lateromedial directly through the talus and the calcaneus. Instead of the graft being sutured to itself, as in the modified Elmslie procedure described by Coughlin et al, the graft is anchored in the talar and calcaneal tunnels using interference screws. It is important the note the differences between the modified Chrisman–Snook procedure described by the authors and the other tenodesis procedures described above.</p>
<p>The assumption of an anatomic reconstruction is that the normal joint mechanics will be restored, but neither direct repair nor tenodesis techniques have been shown to restore normal contact pressures in biomechanical models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451316">9</xref></sup> A potential risk associated with tenodesis reconstructions in particular is overconstraint, restricting the allowable range of motion within the ankle and subtalar joints. The position of the ankle during final tensioning of the graft is important in this respect, with recommendations varying from 5° of hindfoot varus positioning to mild, unforced eversion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012451316">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1938640012451316">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The type of graft used for the tenodesis reconstructions varies according to surgeon preference and graft availability. Chrisman and Snook<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451316">8</xref></sup> used half of the peroneus brevis as an autograft in their described reconstruction procedure. The preferred options for this graft include autograft hamstring and peroneal tendons, allograft, or xenograft. Other autograft and allograft sites used in similar procedures include the gracilis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451316">3</xref></sup> palmaris longus tendon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1938640012451316">11</xref></sup> plantaris tendon,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451316">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1938640012451316">12</xref></sup> extensor digitorum longus tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1938640012451316">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1938640012451316"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1938640012451316">15</xref></sup> extensor digitorum brevis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1938640012451316">16</xref></sup> semitendinosus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1938640012451316">17</xref></sup> and Achilles tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1938640012451316">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>By determining the average length of the allograft needed for the Chrisman–Snook reconstruction procedure, the surgeon can prepare an allograft preoperatively.</p>
<p>The length, when performing the modified Chrisman–Snook procedure described above, should measure approximately 120 mm on average, but considerable variability exists depending on the size of the patient. The data show that there is a proportional relationship between increasing graft length and increasing height of the patient. Graft length also needs to consider the fixation method requirements. Intraosseous interference screws require relatively less length of graft than suturing it on the far side of the tunnel. Regardless of the fixation, the graft needs to be tensioned appropriately, and this requires a drill hole through the calcaneus to allow the graft to be pulled through and tensioned.</p>
<p>Care must be taken when drilling the lateral to medial tunnel. Subjectively drilling perpendicular to the lateral wall of the calcaneus, as performed in our study, resulted in significant injury to neurovascular and tendon structures on the medial side of the ankle. We have determined the structures at most risk of being affected are the FHL and the posterior tibial nerve (including calcaneal branch). Structures that are at less risk of being affected include the posterior tibial artery and the FDL. Attention should be paid while drilling to avoid impacting these structures. To keep all medial structures intact, the authors recommend blinded tunnel or guidewire-assisted drilling that does not rupture the medial cortex of the calcaneus.</p>
