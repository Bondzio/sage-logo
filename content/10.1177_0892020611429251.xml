<p>As the current chair of BELMAS I am very conscious of the central role that our annual international conference enjoys in creating a sense of a worldwide community dedicated to the best practice and theory in educational management and leadership. To achieve this much thought is given to the title of the conference, which in 2011 was “Educational Leadership in an Age of Globalisation – experiences from around the world”.</p>
<p>Consequently, a key aspect of the conference was that globalisation carries with it many benefits that are sometimes overshadowed by the negative connotations associated with the term; largely originating in the exploitative activities of some global organisations. There is no necessary link between globalisation and exploitation. Nor is there a necessary benefit harvest if we do not ensure that these opportunities to share the best practice are themselves exploited.</p>
<p>Another key aspect of the conference is its attraction to the whole professional firmament. It is pleasing then to see in this issue of Management in Education a paper by Izhar Oplatka entitled <italic>“The 2011 BELMAS Conference: new topics, diverse ideas, much more international than before”</italic>. In the paper there is much food for thought.</p>
<p>There is a suggestion that the international aspect of BELMAS has been enhanced in comparison with the 2007 conference and this is encouraging for our desire to be not simply an Anglophone voice. Similarly, changes in the conference balance compared to 2007 indicate an increase in conceptual and descriptive work which is likely to be conducive to engaging debate. In addition such a balance is an inducement to practitioners to make their voices heard through the value that we place on non-empirical work, which should form a symbiotic relationship with traditional empirical academic work.</p>
<p>From this basis we move forward into our 40 year celebrations asking ourselves what future shape the organisation could take. In part this is defined by the field of educational management as we understand it and central to this is its applied nature. We are not an <italic>‘archaeological’</italic> society, but rather one which seeks ultimately to impact upon practice in the interests of educational professionals, students and every other form of stakeholder.</p>
<p>To overtake these goals we have engaged in a process of <italic>‘professionalisation’</italic> whereby our office structure has been reviewed to provide a three pronged capacity. A full time business manager, a membership and website officer and a professional officer form a strong team that can service the society in its duty to members, its international relevance and its voice in domestic affairs. A symbol of our ambition is to be found in our new website and the developments that are underway to allow a fully interactive service. BELMAS has contributed strongly to rational debate in the field of educational management and its fundamental ambition is to be the best that it can be.</p>
<p>To this end I commend to you once again the current issue of Management in Education wherein you will enjoy the ongoing search for enlightenment.</p>
