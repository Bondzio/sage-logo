<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Urban/rural differences in secondary cardiovascular disease (CVD) events have previously been observed for Québec. These differences could be attributable to differential utilization of specialized cardiological care, such as revascularization procedures and visits to cardiologists; if this were the case, policies to increase utilization in rural areas would be indicated.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> This is a population-based cohort study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed mortality and hospital re-admission in Québec within 1 year after an initial cardiovascular event in relation to urban/rural location and specialized care utilization, controlling for demography, comorbidities, and cumulative hospitalization.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Analysis showed higher hospital re-admissions and slightly lower CVD mortality in rural areas, as well as less use of specialized care in rural areas. However, urban/rural differentials were not attributable to differences in utilization of care. Paradoxically, comorbidities were lower among patients who saw specialists.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Ultimately, urban/rural differences in secondary CVD outcomes were not attributable to differences in care utilization or our measures of underlying health status, and were likely due to cultural or lifestyle factors that are both hard to model and hard to change through policy. There appears to be overutilization of specialized care in urban areas, an issue which requires further study. Our results suggest that substantial caution is required when interpreting health service usage data and that critical factors in the relationship between specialized cardiological care and outcomes are still poorly understood at a population level.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741826711413371" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of countries, including Canada, have set explicit goals of providing equal access to health care to residents regardless of urban/rural residence;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711413371">1</xref></sup> nonetheless, urban and rural health disparities continue to be widely observed in many countries and settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711413371">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711413371">6</xref></sup> These disparities can be due to many factors, including access to medical care, utilization of medical care, cultural and lifestyle differences, ambient pollution, and socioeconomic differences. From a healthcare and policy perspective, it is important to distinguish which of these factors may be contributing to the difference in order to intervene properly.</p>
<p>In a previous study, we examined if urban/rural health disparities in three chronic diseases in Québec were attributable to similar access-to-care and utilization-of-care factors, including visits to specialists, medication use, and use of specialized diagnostic or treatment measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711413371">1</xref></sup> For all three chronic diseases – cardiovascular disease (CVD), osteoporosis, and diabetes – we found substantially lower utilization of specialized services in rural areas. However, this was not accompanied by consistent differences in mortality and morbidity outcomes, suggesting that the impact of differential care utilization is specific to each disease. Accordingly, here we examine in more detail how differences in utilization of specialized medical care affect CVD outcomes in relation to urban/rural residence in Québec. In particular, we would like to understand if urban/rural differences in (a) utilization of medical specialists (internists and cardiologists) or (b) revascularization procedures are responsible for differences in hospital re-admission rates and CVD mortality rates. If urban/rural outcome differentials are attributable to differences in care utilization, we should increase delivery of such care to rural areas. Conversely, since delivery of specialized care to isolated areas is expensive, a clear lack of association would show that money is better spent elsewhere.</p>
<p>Understanding the relationship between rurality, care utilization, and CVD outcomes is not straightforward. Urban/rural and socioeconomic status (SES) differentials in cardiological care and risk factors have repeatedly been demonstrated at many levels, including use of specialists, timing to treatment, prescription of best-care medication, angiography, catheterization, and revascularization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711413371">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711413371">11</xref></sup> However, lack of advanced care has not always translated into large effects on subsequent mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711413371">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711413371">12</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711413371">15</xref></sup> Revascularization is often associated with better outcomes, but this may be due to selection effects, where patients too sick to undergo surgery are not revascularized, making it hard to quantify the benefit of the procedure relative to the differences in those undergoing it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711413371">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test whether urban/rural CVD outcome differentials are attributable to care utilization differentials, we use a series of proportional hazards models with and without care utilization variables. If inclusion of care in the model substantially reduces the urban/rural effect on outcome, we can infer that differences in care utilization between urban and rural areas may be responsible for the outcome differentials and thus that addressing care utilization differences would likely improve outcomes. However, if inclusion of care utilization does not change the urban/rural effect, we can conclude that outcome differentials are due to other factors.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741826711413371" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>An extended methods section, including alternative analyses performed, is available in the online Appendix A.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711413371"><title>Data sources and study population</title>
<p>Patients’ data were obtained from Québec’s provincial hospital discharge register and Québec’s provincial demographic database which contains dates and causes of death. The physicians claim database was obtained from the Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711413371">17</xref></sup> Using a unique encrypted identifier, the patient files were linked to provide individual level information on demographic characteristics, medical characteristics, and their vital status. The study population included all patients 25 years and older, living in the province of Québec, hospitalized for a myocardial infarction (MI) from 2000–2003. The date of discharge from the first hospitalization during the study period was defined as the index date; we thus exclude patients who died during the index hospitalization. In an attempt to include only new cases, we excluded all patients who had a previous hospitalization for MI during the year preceding the index admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711413371"><title>Variable definitions</title>
<p>Based on preliminary analyses, we used a modified three-level version of the Statistical Area Classification definition of rurality proposed by Statistics Canada:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711413371">18</xref></sup> (1) Census Metropolitan Areas, with a population of at least 100,000; (2) Census Agglomerations, with a population between 10,000 and 99,999; and (3) rural areas with less than 10,000 residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711413371">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>All-cause mortality was defined as deaths occurring in the study population within 365 days of discharge from the hospital following the initial cardiovascular event. CVD deaths were defined as the subset of these where the cause of death was assigned an International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 code 410–414 or 426–429, or ICD-10 code I20–I25 or I44–I52. CVD hospital re-admission was defined as hospitalization with one of the above ICD codes, and individual patients could be re-admitted multiple times.</p>
<p>Risk of outcomes was assessed using a time-varying model (see below), and accordingly we allowed our predictive variables to vary over time. For revascularization, we used a simple count of how many revascularization procedures had occurred up to a given day: 0, 1, or 2+. For physician utilization we used cumulative measures of number of outpatient visits to each type of physician: general practitioners, internists, and cardiologists. Outpatient visits were defined as visits recorded outside the date ranges of known hospital stays.</p>
<p>All models included sex and an age spline with six degrees of freedom as fixed covariates. We also included number of comorbidities as a fixed covariate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711413371">20</xref></sup> a weighted score of 16 comorbid conditions available in the hospital discharge database. Lastly, we controlled for cumulative hospitalization in case long hospital stays indicated poorer health independent of urban/rural status and number of doctor visits.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711413371"><title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 2.11.0 (64-bit).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711413371">21</xref></sup> After descriptive analyses, we ran a series of Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. This was accomplished with the coxph function in the survival package of R. For each outcome, four models were run designed to answer a specific series of questions. First, we analysed the effect of urban/rural residence controlling only for sex and age. This answers the question, ‘Given the demographic differences, is the outcome different in rural and urban areas?’ Second, we added comorbidities and cumulative hospitalization into the model. This indicates how much of this difference remains after we control for how sick people are in different areas. Third, we added in care utilization variables, separately for physician visits and revascularization. In comparison to the second model, this allows us to assess how much of the urban/rural difference is attributable to differences in care utilization. Fourth, we ran a combined model with both physician visits and revascularization, to confirm that this did not change the results.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711413371" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Among our 44,810 patients, we observed 3412 deaths, with 1767 due to CVD. There were 12,552 emergency hospital re-admissions for CVD. Age was relatively evenly distributed across urban/rural areas within our sample, but the proportion of males was slightly higher in rural areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711413371">Table 1</xref>). We assessed whether outcome measures differed between urban areas, rural areas, and small towns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711413371">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711413371">Table 1</xref>) and found that hospital re-admissions for CVD were substantially higher in rural areas and small towns than in urban areas. There was a slightly but significantly higher rate of CVD mortality in rural areas relative to urban areas and small towns, and accordingly there was a non-significant trend for higher all-cause mortality in rural areas.

<p>We analysed simple (uncontrolled) urban/rural trends in comorbidities and use of specialized care to see if urban/rural differences in health status or care utilization appeared to account for the outcome differences above. Comorbidities were generally comparable across urban/rural classifications, especially after accounting for the slightly older population in small towns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711413371">Table 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure 2, available online), so there was no evidence that health status contributes to the urban/rural differentials. However, we found substantially higher rates of utilization of specialized physicians in urban areas, potentially explaining the better re-admission outcomes there (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711413371">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711413371">Figure 1</xref>, Supplementary Figure 3). Likewise, revascularization was much more common in urban areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711413371">Table 1</xref>). We also found that comorbidities are lower for patients who saw more specialized doctors (Supplementary Figure 4). This result was robust when we stratified by urban/rural residence (data not shown).</p>
<p>We performed a more rigorous analysis of the associations between urban/rural residence and outcome measures using a series of Cox proportional hazards models (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711413371">Table 2</xref>). Basic demographic models controlling for age and sex (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711413371">Table 2</xref>, Model 1) showed patterns similar to the descriptive analysis above: slightly lower CVD mortality in rural areas, and substantially (∼25%) higher CVD hospital re-admissions in rural areas and small towns. Comorbidities and cumulative days hospitalized explained substantial variation (Supplementary Table 3), but did not change the urban/rural effect size (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711413371">Table 2</xref>, Model 2), confirming that the differences are not attributable to health status. However, in contrast to the descriptive analysis above, controlling for types of doctor seen and number of doctor visits, or for revascularization, also failed to reduce the urban/rural effect sizes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711413371">Table 2</xref>, Model 3), suggesting that differences in utilization of specialized care do not account for urban/rural differentials in outcomes. This was confirmed by Model 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711413371">Table 2</xref>), where inclusion of both revascularization and physician care variables also failed to produce changes in the effect size.

<p>We examined whether underlying health status modified the effect of revascularization on outcomes by (a) using interaction terms and (b) stratifying by comorbidities, 0 vs. 2 or more. For CVD mortality, the interaction terms for comorbidities or cumulative days hospitalized were not significant in separate models (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.2). For CVD re-admissions, both terms were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and negative, indicating that there was less effect of revascularization on re-admission in sicker patients. This was confirmed for comorbidities in the stratified model, where revascularizations positively predicted re-admission in patients with no comorbidities (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) but not in those with two or more comorbidities (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.2).</p>
<p>Additional analyses showed that effects of the main categories of variables (urban/rural, demographic, health status, care utilization) were largely independent in their effects on outcomes (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Relative risks for each variable were unchanged when other variables were added or deleted from models. Both comorbidities and cumulative days of hospitalization were strongly predictive of adverse outcomes (Supplementary Table 3). Revascularizations were highly protective against mortality, but increased the risk of re-admission (Supplementary Table 4). More visits to doctors increased risk of adverse outcomes (for mortality outcomes this was only significant for generalists, probably because of sample size: Supplementary Table 4).</p>

<sec id="sec7-1741826711413371" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have shown here that urban/rural differences in secondary cardiovascular disease outcomes in Québec (i.e. those following an initial cardiovascular hospitalization) are not simply or directly related to urban/rural differences in utilization of specialized care such as visits to cardiologists and revascularization procedures. It is intuitive to suggest that greater provision of specialized cardiological care to rural areas should improve outcomes there, and this intuition appears at first to be borne out by data showing that specialized care is used more in urban areas. However, survival analyses of urban/rural differences in risks for adverse outcomes are unchanged when measures of cumulative care utilization are included, and this intuition is not supported. It appears that urban/rural differences in outcomes are not due to any of the factors that we measured here, even though each factor measured is independently associated with risks of adverse outcomes. Other studies have also reported that urban/rural differences are due to many factors not easily measured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711413371">13</xref></sup> From a policy perspective, urban/rural differences in outcomes are often used as evidence to support policies that provide greater access to specialized care in rural areas. In some cases this may be justified, but in this case, we appear to have evidence that the urban/rural differences we observe are not amenable to straightforward policy interventions.</p>
<p>One puzzling aspect of our results is the generally contradictory trends in mortality and re-admission, with the former higher in urban areas and the latter lower there. Using a measure of CVD events to combine mortality and re-admission simply results in intermediate associations, but fails to clarify the reasons for the diverging trends. These trends are consistent with many other studies in Canada.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711413371">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711413371">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711413371">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711413371">23</xref></sup> Not only was urban/rural residence differently associated with the outcomes in our study, but almost every covariate we looked at was associated in opposite directions with mortality and re-admission. Taken together, these findings suggest that post-acute myocardial infarction hospital re-admission should not be interpreted as a negative outcome in Canada, even when restricted to emergency re-admissions. Although the necessity for an emergency re-admission is obviously a bad outcome, it seems likely that there are consistent biases in reporting or in who gets re-admitted that confound the interpretation of this variable in a Canadian setting.</p>
<p>Our results may suggest that specialized care is being overutilized in urban areas. Revascularizations are strongly protective against mortality in general, but many unnecessary procedures may nonetheless be performed. This is a plausible explanation for our results, and is supported by a non-significant trend for a greater protective effect of revascularization in rural areas (interaction term: relative risk = 0.81, <italic>p</italic> = 0.1). However our results may also be attributable to differences in the type of disease or patients found between urban and rural areas, and that people in urban areas are in greater need of revascularizations; more research is needed before a strong conclusion can be drawn.</p>
<p>Our analyses also suggest that cardiologists are not being optimally utilized by the health system in Québec. We see a clear trend for specialized physicians to see healthier patients and general practitioners to see sicker patients, the opposite of what should be expected. In some cases this may be due to the sickest patients needing care from other specialists rather than cardiologists; nonetheless, the strength of the trend and its presence across all levels of specialization suggests that even in a relatively egalitarian health system such as Québec’s, privileged people may obtain better access to specialized care. Comorbidities are not a proxy for privilege, but privilege differentials are the most likely explanation for patients with fewer comorbidities seeing more specialists. Some previous findings have suggested that SES does not affect access to advanced cardiac care in Québec.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711413371">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711413371">25</xref></sup> The discrepancy may be due to different outcomes studied, or to the fact that we are inferring an effect indirectly rather than measuring SES.</p>
<p>More generally, this study raises major questions about how to evaluate how well specialized care is being delivered to those who need it. Many studies have examined disparities in intermediate outcomes such as care utilization and CVD re-admissions;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711413371">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711413371">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711413371">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711413371">27</xref></sup> our data strongly suggest that these may be poor ways to measure meaningful health benefits. Associations between revascularization and mortality outcomes are likely at least partially attributable to selection effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711413371">16</xref></sup> and this potential confounding may reflect a more general pattern that physicians are making informed decisions for reasons that are not easily captured in epidemiological data. Even after controlling for comorbidities, cumulative hospitalization independently explains substantial variation in our outcomes; likewise, even after controlling for both, more doctor visits predict poor outcomes. This pattern suggests that we are incompletely measuring underlying health status, and that underlying health status is a major determinant of both subsequent treatment and outcomes, resulting in a textbook example of unmeasured confounding.</p>
<sec id="sec8-1741826711413371"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>The largest limitation of this study is our inability to fully model the factors contributing to urban/rural differences in both cardiovascular outcomes and care utilization. Many of these factors are difficult to measure, including behaviour (diet, physical activity, smoking, etc.) and attitudes toward health care; nonetheless, we were not able to identify a single variable that changed the effect size of the urban/rural variable, meaning that we do not understand why we observe this difference. This is an indication that the system we seek to understand is highly complex, and all interpretation needs to be made with caution, an interesting result in itself.</p>
<p>Next, we did not study many important aspects of cardiological care that could influence outcomes. We did not look at medication use, partly because our previous study found no urban/rural differences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711413371">1</xref></sup> and we also did not measure catheterization or angiography or distinguish between coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in our revascularization measure. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that including these variables would have changed our results. For example, catheterization has been shown to influence who gets revascularization, but there is no independent effect of SES on revascularization in Québec.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711413371">8</xref></sup> Thus, studying additional variables may have helped to understand pathways, but would not likely have changed the final outcomes which were of interest here.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we believe the approach here is the best possible at the moment, given the province-wide data sources available for Québec. Also, the consistency of our results provides substantial support for the conclusion that urban/rural differences are not attributable to utilization of specialized care or health status; our more specific conclusions are more tentative. We thus feel this study provides moderate evidence against increasing cardiological care to rural areas and suggests the need for further study of whether specialized cardiological care is being overutilized in urban areas and among privileged patients.</p>
