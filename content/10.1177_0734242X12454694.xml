<abstract>
<p>Spatial inequality in service delivery is a common feature in African cities. Several factors account for the phenomenon but there is growing attention towards urban governance and the role of the state. Urban governance policies such as privatization serve as key strategies through which the state regulates and (re)produces spatial inequality in service delivery. This study examined how governance practices related to privatization and the regulatory role of the state reinforce spatial inequalities in the delivery of solid waste services in Abuja, Nigeria. It focused primarily on the issue of cost recovery. Privatization became a major focus in Abuja in 2003 when the government launched a pilot scheme. Although it has brought improvements in service delivery, privatization has also increased the gap in the quality of services delivered in different parts of the city. Drawing on empirical data, the study revealed that little sensitivity to income and affordability, and to income differentials between neighbourhoods in the fixing of user charges and in the choice of the billing method is contributing to spatial inequalities in service delivery. Furthermore, the study suggests that these practices are linked to a broader issue, a failure of the government to see the people as partners. It therefore calls for more inclusive governance especially in decision-making processes. The study also emphasizes the need for a policy document on solid waste management, as this would encourage a critical assessment of vital issues including how privatization is to be funded, especially in low-income areas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The problem of urban inequality featured prominently in recent United Nations Habitat reports: <italic>State of the World’s Cities 2010/2011</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12454694">UN Habitat 2008</xref>) and <italic>The State of African Cities 2010</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12454694">UN Habitat, 2010</xref>). Inequality manifests in different forms: from income, to access to employment and services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734242X12454694">UN Habitat, 2008</xref>). While urban inequality is a global phenomenon, African cities exhibit the highest levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734242X12454694">UN Habitat, 2010</xref>). Spatial inequality, defined as significant differences in the levels of service delivery between different neighbourhoods is a notable form of urban inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12454694">Chakravorty, 1996</xref>). Privatization, a form of public–private partnership (PPP), where the state transfers some aspects of service delivery, or the whole operation to the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12454694">Batley, 1996</xref>) is a driving force behind spatial inequality in the delivery of solid waste services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12454694">Cointreau-Levine, 1994</xref>). In many cases, the benefits of privatization are often limited to high-income and commercial districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). In the search for explanations, the behaviour of private firms, particularly the privileging of high-income areas has received some attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734242X12454694">Post et al., 2005</xref>). However, as this article shows, what the state does or does not do also plays a crucial role in determining the quality and level of services provided in different parts of cities. As summed up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12454694">Jessop (1997)</xref>, the state is the site, generator and product of strategies with a tendency to privilege particular actors and spaces. Urban governance policies such as privatiation, serve as key strategies through which the state regulates; produces and reproduces configurations of urban space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12454694">Brenner, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to relocate Nigeria’s capital city from Lagos to Abuja was taken in 1976 and Abuja became the new capital in 1991. A major justification for relocation was that Lagos had become unsuitable as a national capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12454694">Federal Capital Development Authority, 1979</xref>). Lagos had gained notoriety for a host of problems including traffic congestions, lack of housing as well as environmental degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12454694">Mabogunje, 2001</xref>). Thus, the government decided to plan and develop a new capital city that would avoid all the problems associated with Lagos. Abuja was conceived as a modern city with emphasis on nature, spaciousness and environmental quality and was also meant to be functional and efficient but things have turned out differently. When a review of the Abuja master plan was conducted in 1999, the city was described as dysfunctional and physically deteriorating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12454694">Kalgo and Ayileka, 2001</xref>). The reference to ‘physical deterioration’ highlights the state of solid waste services. The solid waste sector is plagued with numerous problems ranging from inappropriate storage equipment to shortage of collection vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12454694">Imam et al., 2008</xref>). Some areas are left for months without receiving any collection services, making illegal disposal a common practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). There is no formal sorting or treatment of waste and waste is disposed of in an open dump. The government puts most of the blame for the problems in the solid waste sector on the rapid growth in population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12454694">Chukwuocha, 2003</xref>). Although Abuja has witnessed a huge increase in population, from 378 671 in 1991 to 1.4 million in 2006, population increase alone does not provide an adequate explanation for the situation in the solid waste sector. This article draws attention to urban governance practices.</p>
<p>Privatization became the preferred choice for service delivery in Abuja following the launch of a pilot scheme in 2003. The government cited the desire to reduce its financial burden, broaden participation and ensure sustainability as major justifications for privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). A government assessment of the pilot scheme noted improvements in service delivery, but also highlighted some problems including lack of commitment from the state; limited capacity of the private sector; and the unwillingness of users to pay for services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12454694">Mohammed, 2004</xref>). Crucially, the report identified a huge gap in the level and quality of services provided in different parts of the city. It is within this context that the study examined how urban governance practices, specifically the regulatory role of the state reinforce spatial inequalities in the delivery of solid waste services in Abuja, Nigeria.</p>
<p>The article is divided into four sections. The first is a brief conceptual discussion on urban governance and spatial inequality. The second is a background section highlighting the origins of spatial inequality in Abuja and the spatialized hierarchy that exists in the delivery of solid waste services. The third and fourth sections present the results and discussions under two headings: the fixing of user charges and the billing method.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>Primary data was first obtained during the author’s doctoral fieldwork in Abuja between 2003 and 2006. The data was updated between 2008 and 2011. The updated data is based on ten semi-structured and in-depth interviews conducted with officials of the Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB), the agency responsible for solid waste management, and a selection of contractors. Purposive sampling was adopted in the choice of interviewees. The analysis relies mainly on empirical data to support the major proposition that the regulatory role of the state play some role in the spatial inequalities that exists in the delivery of solid waste services in Abuja. Tables were useful not only in making data more accessible but also to draw conclusions and move to the next step of analysis.</p>

<title>Urban governance and spatial inequality</title>
<p>Urban governance is concerned with the institutions, processes and policies of city governance, and with the power relations between the multiplicity of actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12454694">Devas, 2002</xref>). In Africa, the term ‘governance’ is ideologically deployed in the rhetoric and practices of privatization, decentralization, democratization and liberalization and the most concrete discussions of governance have been in regard to the delivery of urban services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454694">Myers, 2011</xref>). Urban spatial inequality has received some attention within the governance discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12454694">Miraftab, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12454694">Smith, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454694">Myers (2011)</xref> reports that the (re)production of spatial inequality is a consistent feature of urban planning and policies in Africa. Much of the debate has been conducted within the context of neo-liberal policies, particularly privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12454694">Miraftab, 2004</xref>). Privatization remains a priority of African city governments and donors but the growing arguments against the policy are generating more interest in the role of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12454694">Freund, 2010</xref>). While the structural adjustment programme (SAP) imposed on African states by the Bretton Woods Institutions in the 1980s assumed an anti-state stance and saw the private sector as the main engine of growth, the concept of governance brought with it an acknowledgement that some level of state participation was necessary, but in partnership with the private sector and civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12454694">Igoe and Kelsall, 2005</xref>). The attempt to bring the state back in is strengthened by the belief that marketizing essential services without a strong state regulation undermines the entire process of devolving core responsibilities of the state to the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12454694">Smith, 2004</xref>). Although a strong state regulation is crucial, this article shows that how the state actually performs its regulatory role also deserve attention.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12454694">MacLeod and Goodwin (1999)</xref> refer to a mode of regulation as a range of institutional ensembles, formal procedures, and informal social norms, which articulate at certain times and in certain places to secure capitalist development. Crucially, processes of regulation are constituted through unevenly developed social practices and are spatially embedded (Goodwin and Painter, 1997). Goodwin and Painter go on to cite patchy administrative coverage and uneven levels of service provision as two key outcomes of uneven regulation. Following from above, this article contends that regulation is a major mechanism through which the discriminatory practices of the state are concretized and spatial inequality is (re)produced.</p>
<p>How the state handles issues of finance is an important part of its regulatory role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12454694">Freund, 2010</xref>). In the case of solid waste management, finance encompasses a wide range of issues such as how low-income areas are to be funded: how user charges will be fixed and collected: and the willingness of users to pay for services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12454694">Cointreau-Levine, 1994</xref>). Furthermore, full cost recovery is a key element of the market logic and the basis for the argument that privatization is a more efficient method for delivering public goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734242X12454694">Smith, 2004</xref>). As a result, non-payment often translates into the non-delivery of services as documented in the case of Abuja (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu, 2010</xref>), in Accra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12454694">Oteng-Ababio, 2010</xref>) and in Cape Town where the decision of municipalities to adopt measures aimed at maximizing cost recovery has been accompanied by extensive cut-offs for disadvantaged households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12454694">Miraftab, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that while privatization has received a lot of attention, it is not the only factor responsible for spatial inequalities in service delivery in African cities. There is the colonial legacy. Colonial administrations were primarily concerned with protecting European populations from diseases and thus concentrated solid waste services in areas inhabited by Europeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454694">Myers, 2011</xref>). The trend continued in post-colonial Africa, albeit in a different form as documented in Nigeria where the emerging elites moved into the areas previously occupied by Europeans, and such areas continued to receive better services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12454694">Olukoju, 2003</xref>). A more recent phenomenon is the tendency of urban planners in Africa to see informality as illegal, a notion which often leads to the marginalization of informal areas in service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12454694">Myers, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Spatial inequality in Abuja: the origins</title>
<p>Following the decision to relocate Nigeria’s capital from Lagos to Abuja, an American firm, International Planning Associates was hired to produce a master plan for the construction and development of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12454694">Federal Capital Development Authority, 1979</xref>). The firm recommended a central area urban plan, which resulted in a crescent-shaped urban design form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454694">Figure 1</xref>). Accordingly, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was designated into four phases: with phase 1 in the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12454694">Figure 2</xref>). The development of Abuja began in the early 1980s and Phase I, which consists of the Central Area, Garki, Wuse, Asokoro and Maitama has witnessed most of the development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12454694">Figure 1</xref>). The development has also been accompanied by the emergence of slums (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12454694">Mabogunje, 2001</xref>). A notable feature of the Abuja landscape is that the rich live in the main city area and the poor at the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12454694">Kalgo and Ayileka, 2001</xref>). The Abuja master plan is noted as having contributed to this spatial segregation through specifications of type of buildings and where they should be located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734242X12454694">Vale, 1992</xref>). Vale reports that the specifications meant only a few could afford to build houses in certain parts of the city.</p>

<p>Over the years, the provision of services in Abuja has followed a certain pattern: priority to the central area and high-income districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). For example, Asokoro and Maitama, located close to the centre have the most number of high-income households and receive the best services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu (2010)</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12454694">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, the low-income peripheral settlements such as Nyanya which are largely populated by traders, artisans and low-income civil servants receive the least services and are the filthiest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama (2007)</xref> and see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12454694">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The average waste generation rate in Abuja is estimated to be 0.55–0.58 per person per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12454694">Imam et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas the amount of waste generated has increased along with the increase in population, the capacity of the government to manage the waste lags behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12454694">Chukwuocha, 2003</xref>). Crucially, some areas are better served than others. For example, there are variations in the rate of collection. Over 90% of the waste generated in the high-income districts of Asokoro and Maitama is collected, whereas the figure is over 40% for the medium-income district of Gwarimpa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12454694">Table 1</xref> gives an indication of the differences in the rate of collection between different districts.</p>

<p>In the case of waste storage, not all areas of Abuja have the recommended standardized waste bins. Bins are highly visible in the main city districts but non-existent in peripheral areas such as Nyanya where residents resort to using all kinds of substandard equipment such as baskets and buckets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). In another example, during the 2003 pilot scheme, it emerged that one of the reasons given by residents of Lugbe, another peripheral settlement, for the refusal to pay user charges was that they were not given proper storage containers. Residents complained that it was easy for dogs to tear the polythene bags distributed to them for waste storage, thereby contributing to littering. There has been little improvement in Lugbe since the pilot scheme. Interviews conducted in December 2011 revealed that the settlement had been left without the services of a private contractor for about a year and AEPB could only provide ad-hoc services.</p>
<p>Evidently, the problem of spatial inequality in Abuja cannot be attributed to a single factor. The roles of the master plan and the preferential treatment given to high-income areas have both been highlighted above. It is also worth making a reference to the institutional arrangements. Decree No. 10 of 1997 gives responsibility for solid waste management in the FCT to AEPB but in practice, it is not clear who is responsible for what and where (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). The FCT is made up of six area councils including the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), which houses Abuja, the main city area. In an interview with the head of solid waste department in December 2011, he maintained that AEPB has responsibility only for the main city area and not for the peripheral settlements such as Nyanya which fall within the same municipal council. This position contrasts with that of his predecessor, who had opined that AEPB’s jurisdiction covers the entire FCT. What is not in doubt is that AMAC has no major role in solid waste management. It is AEPB that has been responsible for major functions such as the hiring and monitoring of contractors, and the direct provision of services, even in the peripheral settlements. The study revealed that a major result of the unclear picture surrounding the institutional arrangement is an ad-hoc and inconsistent approach to solid waste management in the low-income areas, an outcome that leaves such areas for long periods without services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0734242X12454694">
<title>The fixing of user charges</title>
<p>In Abuja, the government expected privatization to be funded largely from user charges. The payment of user charges was first introduced in 1993 when AEPB, citing inadequate finance made a decision to commercialize solid waste services. Households were asked to pay N200 (200 Naira) a month or the equivalent of US$1.27 (based on an exchange rate of N157 to US$1 obtained May 5 2012). However, AEPB made a deliberate decision to target only businesses and households willing to pay for services. The implication of this ‘no money, no service’ approach for poor users and neighbourhoods is obvious. In large part, the peripheral and low-income areas of the city were left without services. In addition to this development, corporate bodies challenged the authenticity of the rates fixed by AEPB based on the argument that the rates were arbitrary. AEPB had used criteria such as the number of wash hand basins and water closets (WCs) found in a premises to fix the rates.</p>
<p>In 1997, AEPB reviewed the tariffs. Commercial rates were fixed based on type of activities. For example, pharmacy; embassies; small-, medium- and large-scale enterprises were some of the categories identified. In the case of residential rates, AEPB took the decision to fix rates based on number of rooms. This was the situation until the 2003 pilot scheme. With no policy in place, it was hoped that experiences from the pilot scheme would provide answers to various questions including the controversy surrounding user charges. The government employed twelve contractors to cover different parts of the city.</p>
<p>Under the pilot scheme, the criteria adopted in the fixing of user charges included: type of house: number of rooms: estimated number of occupants: and anticipated volume of waste. However, AEPB conceded that it lacked reliable data on the criteria. The board made further adjustments to the charges in 2005. It retained the criteria used in 2003, but classified the city into three groups: I, II and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12454694">Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2005</xref>). Group 1 consists of peripheral areas such as Nyanya, Karu and Kubwa; whereas group II covers Garki I and II, Wuse I and Gwarimpa and group III is made up of Asokoro, Maitama and Wuse II among others. Residential charges were then released according to the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454694">Table 2</xref>). The document did not specify the criteria used to classify the city into groups. Crucially, it failed to highlight the income disparities between the groups. This omission was reflected in the lack of sensitivity to the income disparities in the user charges.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454694">Table 2</xref> shows the user charges according to the three groups identified by AEPB and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454694">Table 3</xref> gives a breakdown of income groups in selected districts. Based on the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454694">Table 2</xref>, a resident living in a detached bungalow in group II is expected to pay N1 875 (US$11.9). For group III, the figure is N2 250 (US$14.3). The figures show a difference of less than US$3 between the two groups. Meanwhile, Asokoro and Maitama which are in group III, have a high concentration of diplomatic and top government functionaries. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454694">Table 3</xref>, 85% of households in Asokoro earn above N200 000 a month (US$1 273) whereas the figure is 35% for Gwarimpa, which is in group II and largely inhabited by medium-income earners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu, 2010</xref>). Although these figures confirm that there are spatial disparities in income in Abuja, the user charges do not reflect these disparities. The neglect of income disparities and the arbitrary nature of the methods used by AEPB in the fixing of user fees are further reflected in the observation by a contractor that the charges were too high in some places and too low in others. It should be noted that over the years, AEPB has not deemed it necessary to consult users before fixing charges.</p>

<p>In addition to income differentials, it is important to examine a related issue: affordability. Income is a major determinant in households’ willingness to pay for solid waste services since it is linked to affordability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734242X12454694">Rahji and Oloruntoba, 2009</xref>). The approach adopted by AEPB in the fixing of user charges neglects the importance of affordability. AEPB conceded that it had no data on household income. It made no attempt to conduct a survey or obtain the relevant data from other sources. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is a federal government agency charged with the responsibility of gathering data on major indicators of national development. For example, NBS has data on poverty and on household income. Data on poverty headcount released by NBS reveal that 82.32% of Abuja residents are poor and 17.68% are non-poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12454694">National Bureau of Statistics 2009</xref>). The definition of poverty and how it should be measured is highly contested but it can be argued that if AEPB had used the available data on poverty, the charges fixed would have been more realistic.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12454694">Table 4</xref> shows that only 4.4% of households in Abuja have an income above N80 000 (US$509.4) whereas 39.1% earn between N20 000 to N49 999 (US$128 to US$319) and at the bottom, 4.0% earn N1000 (US$6.4). The figures not only highlight income disparities, they clearly suggest that affordability differs between income groups. In a confirmation of the spatial variations in income and affordability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu (2010)</xref> reports that even though defaults in payments cannot be attributed to income alone as other factors such as the perception that waste is a social service and should be provided free play a part, income is a crucial determinant in the higher default rates recorded in Gwarimpa and Garki.</p>

<title>The billing method</title>
<p>The billing method adds another dimension to the problem of spatial differentiation in service delivery in Abuja. While the charges shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12454694">Table 2</xref> are monthly rates, officially, AEPB has adopted a system whereby residents and all users are expected to pay annually.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Every owner, caretaker or occupier of any tenement or any person, authority, body corporate who lives, resides or carries on any activity within the Territory shall pay in advance to the Board on yearly basis such rates and charges as specified in the schedule hereto (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12454694">Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2005</xref>; p. 179).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The contractors interviewed maintained that the annual billing method is not practical. It is difficult to grasp the rationale behind this approach, in a city where the unwillingness to pay for services, is one of the greatest challenges facing privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12454694">Adama, 2007</xref>). Inevitably, the annual billing method is more problematic in some areas than in others. In the low- and medium-income areas where residents are predominantly tenants, most are against annual rates based on the argument that they might lose their money, if they have to move out before the one year period expires. This argument points to the relevance of tenancy. In addition, civil servants, who make up a sizeable proportion of the population of Abuja, are particularly against the method arguing that their salaries are not paid a year in advance. The argument draws attention to affordability. If income is closely linked to affordability and the majority of Abuja residents are poor, both of which have been established, the question is: can users afford to pay the annual rates, and even more crucial, is the capacity to pay the same in all districts?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu (2010)</xref>, reports that the annual rate charged by AEPB represents over 30% of the average income of households in Garki and Gwarimpa, whereas the figure is 15% for Asokoro and Maitama. From the figures in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12454694">Table 5</xref>, which shows the percentage of residents who prefer yearly or monthly charges in selected districts, the majority of residents of Asokoro (92%) prefer the annual billing method to monthly charges. Asokoro is closely followed by Maitama. It should be recalled that Asokoro and Maitama also follow each other at the top in terms of household income (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12454694">Table 3</xref>). The lowest figure for preference for annual billing 18% is recorded in Gwarimpa, which occupies the lowest position on the income ladder. There is an obvious correlation between income and the preferences for and against annual rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu (2010)</xref> attributes the high figures for preference for annual billing in Asokoro and Maitama to two factors: the residents belong to the high-income group bracket; and in many cases, they own the houses or the houses are owned by federal and state governments, embassies or multinationals. The two factors confirm the role of income and tenancy, respectively. The billing method has obvious spatial implications for service delivery. There is a correlation between willingness or ability to pay, and the quality of services delivered. The assessment of the 2003 pilot project noted that the high-income districts of Asokoro and Maitama generated the highest revenues and received the best services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X12454694">Mohammed, 2004</xref>).Of the five neighbourhoods commonly referred to in this article: Asokoro, Maitama, Wuse, Garki and Gwarimpa, the largest measure of uncollected waste is in Gwarimpa, and the least is in Asokoro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12454694">Awaisu, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has shown how urban governance practices reinforce spatial inequality in the delivery of solid waste services in Abuja, Nigeria. It confirms the role of regulation as a major mechanism through which spatial inequality is (re)produced. The problem of spatial inequality in service delivery is not unique to Abuja or to Nigeria but there is a need to investigate individual cases since policy environments and implementation strategies vary. The study revealed that little sensitivity to income and affordability in general, and to income differentials between neighbourhoods in the fixing of user charges and in the choice of billing method in particular, is reinforcing spatial inequalities in the delivery of solid waste services in Abuja. Furthermore, the study suggests that the problem of spatial inequality in solid waste services in Abuja is linked to a wider issue: a failure of the government to see the people as key partners in urban governance. The implication is that they are not consulted on key issues and thus their interests are not taken into consideration when decisions are made. While this is a general problem, the study confirms that the poor are particularly disadvantaged. A related problem is the tendency of the government to ignore the relevance of data in decision-making, a practice which leads to decisions becoming unrealistic and arbitrary and further marginalizing the already disadvantaged urban poor. The study calls for a more inclusive governance in general and a policy document on solid waste management in particular as this would encourage a critical assessment of issues such as data gathering, and how privatization is to be funded, especially in low-income areas.</p>
