<abstract>
<p>This report describes Daily Life Architecture (DLA), a structured retrospective diary method developed to document daily experience, and place it into social and cultural context. We also discuss open-access PROUST software that implements DLA for handheld computers, allowing participants to create 24-hour self-report records regarding nearly any domain of experience that can be described through discrete categories. Drawing from a study of the social contexts of physical activity among Mexican American young adults, we describe DLA data collection and validation procedures. DLA data are amenable to both quantitative and qualitative analysis, bolstering the methodological toolkit for social and cultural epidemiology and for ecocultural approaches to child and adolescent development.</p>

<p>Many recent innovations in self-reporting have been designed to mimic features of observational research (e.g., minimization of recall bias and ecological contextualization of behavior; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12443096">Martin and Bateson 1986</xref>), while also probing subjective aspects of experience and reducing investigator and participant burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman et al. 2008</xref>). This article describes data collection and validation procedures for Daily Life Architecture (DLA), a structured recall method in which participants create fine-grained, ecologically contextualized 24-hour diaries of their own recent experiences. We also describe open-access PROUST software implementing DLA on handheld computers.</p>
<p>Retrospective self-reporting is limited by systematic biases that affect autobiographical memory, even when research participants earnestly try to report their experiences truthfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman et al. 2008</xref>). One response has been a series of methods collectively called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA; also Experience Sampling), wherein participants document their very recent experiences at fixed intervals, at random times, or in response to some specified event as they go about their daily lives. The basic study design alternatives closely reflect behavioral observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12443096">Altmann 1974</xref>). Most studies follow focal individuals, but they may measure event frequencies or the distribution and duration of states through instantaneous, sequence, or one-zero sampling. Since there is only one rater (the participant), interrater reliability cannot be assessed directly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12443096">Zenk et al. 2007</xref>), but EMA generally validates well against simultaneous observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, frequent interruptions to participants' routines can become unmanageable, so true momentary sampling often will miss rare experiences and the extended sequences of events or contingencies that link diverse types of experience or contexts across the entire day. It also is difficult to sample time periods (e.g., late nights) and settings (e.g., some workplaces) where participants are unwilling or unable to be prompted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443096">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>). One way to address these limitations is through complementary ethnography, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12443096">Chick’s (1994)</xref> study of affective states throughout the work day, and work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525822X12443096">Weisner and colleagues (2001)</xref> regarding home activities among Latino children. Another response is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman and colleagues (2008)</xref> call a “coverage” strategy: At each prompt, participants fill gaps in their schedule since the last update. Less frequent updates yield lower burden but greater risk for recall bias.</p>
<p>Finally, several researchers have designed diary approaches that structure recall across 24 hours. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443096">Robinson and Godbey (1997)</xref> have participants reconstruct the sequence of their activities throughout the preceding 24 hours in their own words, identifying start and end times down to 15 minutes. Investigators then code activities to identify patterns in time use. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443096">Lam and colleagues (2010)</xref> ask parents to complete 24-hour diaries of their own and their infants' behavioral states, categorically coding each 5-minute block since their last update on handheld computers, several times each day. In Timeline Followback, participants reconstruct behaviors such as alcohol or drug consumption by stepping backward through the past weeks or months, one day at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12443096">Sobell et al. 1996</xref>). Diaries that structure recall around discrete time blocks reduce bias by never asking participants to estimate average states or the frequency of events over extended periods, and they are sensitive to within-individual variation. Such diaries also have performed well when validated against EMA or observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443096">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>DLA builds on these structured diary methods as well as the EMA “coverage” strategy. Several times per day, participants reconstruct their experiences since the last update, creating 24-hour records that embed an experiential domain of interest (e.g., physical activity, sleep, or child care) within a dense record of preceding, co-occurring, and succeeding contexts without requiring frequent prompts. We divide the day into 15-minute blocks and mimic instantaneous sampling by asking participants to recall what was happening at each interval. DLA can be implemented using paper or handheld computers. While we make no systematic comparison in this report, we focus on handheld computers, which observational and diary researchers increasingly have adopted to assist in the field collection of ethnographic and biobehavioral data. Major advantages of handheld computers include reductions in missing data, diminished labor for data entry and coding, easy field portability, and an enhanced ability to detect falsified data or simulated compliance through access logs or time-stamping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12443096">Gravlee et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12443096">Ice 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443096">Lam et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We and our collaborators became interested in tracking daily experience in light of ecocultural and bioecocultural models of child development, which posit that variant psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological outcomes are produced by regular patterns in children’s settings, companions, and activities, and the cultural meanings these carry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12443096">Worthman 2010</xref>). The first published DLA studies were research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X12443096">Worthman and Brown (2007)</xref> of sleep among adolescents in Cairo, Egypt, and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">2008</xref>) of family functioning and child stress during the transition into kindergarten in Atlanta, Georgia (the 21st Century Families Study).</p>
<p>DLA also allows us to explore in adults how structural and categorical risks translate into individual patterns of experience and produce differential well-being. Hence, we have begun to apply DLA outside child/adolescent development to questions of broader interest in social or cultural epidemiology, medical anthropology, and behavioral health. This parallels social–ecological models in public health research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525822X12443096">Dahlberg and Krug 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Health disparities provide an excellent case for a fine-grained ecological approach to daily life. To fully explain disparities, we must understand lives as people live them on a daily basis, embedded within a social and cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525822X12443096">Dressler et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525822X12443096">Zenk et al. 2007</xref>). Motivated by very high obesity rates in Alabama and high risk for Latinos compared to Anglo-Americans for physical inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525822X12443096">Marshall et al. 2007</xref>), we initiated a study to identify daily life pathways toward individual and group differences in physical activity patterns among two subpopulations of Mexican/Mexican American young adults in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. These are primarily English-speaking college students with at least one parent who had migrated from Mexico, although in some cases the students were also immigrants themselves, and primarily Spanish-speaking community members, all immigrants, not attending college but of approximately the same age.</p>
<p>Drawing from this study, we describe here for the first time in comprehensive detail DLA data collection methods using PROUST software on handheld computers. Next, we characterize DLA in terms of concurrent and ethnographic validity. We then replicate an individual-level index, previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">2008</xref>), that captures the frequency of transitions between settings across several days. We show that this index also predicts biological and behavioral outcomes related to physical activity in our sample of young adults. Given the complexity of the subject, in this initial report we focus in greatest detail on quantitative approaches to the validation and analysis of DLA data. However, we conclude by discussing broader implications of DLA for biocultural and mixed-methods research designs and for advancing social and cultural epidemiology.</p>

<title>Physical Activity Study Sample</title>
<p>We recruited a nonprobability sample of 34 Mexican or Mexican American young adults between ages 19 and 32 through a Tuscaloosa church congregation, an English-language class, a nonprofit community-based health promotion group, several campus Hispanic/Latino organizations, and snowball referrals. Sixteen participants were English-speaking current college students (eight males, eight females), and the other 18 were Spanish-speaking migrants to the United States from the Mexican states of Chiapas, Veracruz, Jalisco, and Baja California (11 males, 7 females). We collected 5-day DLA/PROUST records concerning general activity patterns, physical activity, companions, and settings; these procedures are described in detail below. Throughout 24 hours across that same 5-day period, participants also wore ActiGraph GT1M accelerometers around their waists. The waist accelerometer is a research-grade analog to the more familiar pedometers available on the mass market. The ActiGraph provides a continuous, objective measure of whole body movement that can be extrapolated to energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12443096">Rothney et al. 2010</xref>). ActiGraph data carry a digital time stamp and can be synchronized to PROUST records. At the end of the study, we measured participants' waist circumference using a flexible tape measure, among other anthropometrics.</p>

<title>Outline of the DLA Data Collection Process</title>
<p>DLA data collection proceeds through five stages. In brief, we first construct detailed categorical definitions for the discrete elements of daily experience that we will ask participants to record, along with a maximally intuitive and culturally appropriate icon for each category. Second, we construct a data entry template that allows participants to quickly identify which of these experiences apply to each block of time across 24 hours. We determine the size of these time blocks by balancing data needs (greater resolution is achieved using smaller intervals) against the validity of recall and degree of participant burden. In our and colleagues' experiences across studies that have used DLA, 15-minute blocks provide excellent resolution without overburdening participants.</p>
<p>Third, we train participants extensively regarding how to use the data entry template and the definition for each category of experience. We instruct participants to retrospectively complete records periodically throughout the day and have found three times daily to be a feasible balance between the desire for recent recall and the need to minimize disruption to routines. Reminder alarms can be set for specific days and times.</p>
<p>Fourth, participants complete their records, with periodic investigator contact at least once every 2–3 days to maximize compliance and identify ongoing problems. Finally, interviewers carefully review the records with participants, correcting errors, eliciting further details and context through narratives, and asking follow-up questions.</p>

<title>PROUST Software for Recording Daily Schedules</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525822X12443096">Worthman and Brown (2007)</xref>, in the Cairo sleep study, used paper grids on which participants identified activity types and companions using ink stamps. While this remains a viable alternative in studies where handheld computers are impractical, we worked with software engineers at Digital Arc Systems (Pittsburgh, PA) to devise PROUST software, which duplicates and extends the functionality of the paper grids in a portable, user-friendly format on handheld computers. Initially developed solely for devices running PalmOS v3.0 that were used in the 21st Century Families Study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman 2007</xref>), we and Digital Arc Systems have since reprogrammed the software in flexible Python script and to use a MySQL database for the storage of data. The current version of PROUST is only fully tested on the Hewlett-Packard hx4700 running Ångström Linux. However, the software is now device-portable with modest customization to reflect the requirements and capabilities of the platform onto which it will be deployed. We have released PROUST under an open source license. Details, including full documentation, are available by contacting the corresponding author.</p>
<p>PROUST comprises administrator and participant functions. The administrator uses a text-based configuration file and standard image editing software to configure the device with a menu structure, the size of each time block, and the icons and descriptions that represent experiential categories. PROUST can display prompts in most written languages using UTF-8 character encoding, although the investigator must provide translations and ensure the appropriate Unicode-based fonts are installed in the handheld device for non-European character sets (PROUST has been fully tested only using the extended Latin alphabet). The administrator sets a participant identification (ID) number, a name (if desired) which is not stored in the database, a password, reminder alarms, and start and stop dates for the study.</p>
<p>When the participant powers on the device, she or he enters the password and is presented with an ascending series of time blocks centered on the current time but movable to previous and subsequent days and times. Access times are logged to allow compliance monitoring. Tapping the touch screen launches menus for the time selected, prompting the participant to select applicable experiences within the domains of interest (e.g., activity types, companions, and locations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X12443096">Figure 1a</xref>). Up to 12 high-resolution full-color icons can be displayed per screen, along with question text and descriptions for each category. Menus may be sequential (e.g., the first may ask where the participant was, and the second who she or he was with), and/or nested (for instance, the first may ask whether physical activity occurred, and the second what kind, but only if “yes” was selected). Menus can be programmed to allow single or multiple selections.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1525822X12443096-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Once a participant has completed data entry, PROUST returns to the opening screen, which now displays miniaturized iconographic representations of all the participant’s choices for that time block. When choosing the immediate succeeding time block, the participant can copy all data if nothing has changed or enter new selections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1525822X12443096">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Once a study is complete, the investigator may export the data stored in the MySQL database to a comma-separated text file, which allows easy integration into analytical software. In the export file, each column represents the selection value for one icon (0 = <italic>not selected</italic>, 1 = <italic>selected</italic>), and each row represents a time block. The export file also contains the participant ID number, study name, dates, and times.</p>

<title>Physical Activity Study Procedures</title>
<sec id="section6-1525822X12443096">
<title>Defining categories of experience</title>
<p>Since DLA relies on the organization of daily experience into a series of discrete, predefined categories, the first step in study design is the selection of these categories and their definition in a codebook. General considerations regarding the definition of categories for behavioral research are discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12443096">Martin and Bateson (1986)</xref>. For DLA, selection of categories can be investigator- or participant-driven.</p>
<p>The physical activity study was investigator-driven. We wished to test a priori hypotheses and had specific ideas concerning the types of daily experience that should be tracked based on theory and prior research. The categories we used for general and physical activity are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1525822X12443096">Table 1</xref> (not shown are the full descriptions or the categories used for settings and companions). We patterned general categories on those used successfully in the 21st Century Families Study to permit replication of summary measures regarding busyness and stability in the daily routine. We added physical activity categories to reflect distinctions relevant in comparable literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12443096">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>This approach forces participants to code their experience according to the researcher’s model of what constitutes meaningful categories, which may not be the same as their own. A participant-driven approach may be superior for descriptive ethnography and for hypothesis-driven projects in which more latitude can be granted for a study population to define their own categories of experience. In this case, we recommend using the toolkit of cognitive anthropology (e.g., free lists and constrained pile sorts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525822X12443096">Bernard 2006</xref>) to define locally salient categories of daily experience and using these as the basis for subsequent data collection.</p>
<p>Regardless of how they are developed, categories and their definitions should be piloted and refined. In the physical activity study, we made several refinements, such as grouping biking together with running, clarifying that computer use is not a type of TV watching, and improving Spanish translations.</p>

<title>Training participants</title>
<p>Participants must be trained as to how to use the software and how to ensure that their interpretations of categories are similar to each other and to investigators. We reviewed every category in detail with participants at the start of the study. Then we asked participants to code hypothetical scenarios and/or several hours of recent activity into PROUST until the participant displayed comfort with the software. We left participants a written codebook to supplement the brief descriptions of each category in PROUST. We also allowed them the option of using paper-based grids, because we were concerned that some might be uncomfortable with handheld computers. However, no participants chose paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1525822X12443096">
<title>Debriefing, correction, and narrative elicitation</title>
<p>We made contact with participants at minimum every 2–3 days throughout their participation in the study for a process we call debriefing, correction, and narrative elicitation. There are several reasons for this. First, periodic contact creates an opportunity for ongoing training. At each meeting, while memories are still fresh and before errors proliferate, we can clarify questions regarding operation of the software, fill gaps in the diaries, and correct miscategorization of activities. Second, completing diaries in 15 minutes over many days is labor-intensive, and repeated contact with study personnel provides both impetus and reminder.</p>
<p>Finally, categorical descriptions of experience cannot fully illuminate cultural models or motives underlying the construction of a daily schedule. For instance, our category “social activities with family” does not distinguish types of social activities or family members, illuminate why such activities occurred at certain times and not others, or identify shared meanings surrounding family interactions. For this reason, during follow-up discussions we asked participants to “tell the story” of their day based on the diary records and prompted them to supply additional details regarding content, motivation, and social context. Additionally, we used follow-up questions to place these narratives within the broader context of daily experience beyond the specific time period that participants recorded. These procedures not only improve data quality but also permit a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative analysis of narratives and follow-up interviews with quantitative analysis of the corrected diary records.</p>

<sec id="section9-1525822X12443096">
<title>Validation Analysis</title>
<p>Each study and population will differ in the validity of diary data collected using DLA/PROUST and the criteria that should be used to evaluate validity. We therefore recommend including a validation step in every new study. In the physical activity study, first we compared PROUST data regarding physical activity patterns with simultaneously collected actigraphy records. Second, we evaluated ethnographically derived hypotheses regarding the association between gender, work, and exercise that should be found within the PROUST data. Third, we replicated an index of “schedule density” derived from PROUST data, which, in the 21st Century Families Study, predicted child and adult mood and psychobiology. We hypothesized that schedule density also would predict physical activity levels and waist circumference. If so, this provides evidence across multiple studies that DLA/PROUST data can be used to create a predictive index that summarizes experience over several days.</p>
<sec id="section10-1525822X12443096">
<title>Concurrent validity</title>
<p>To assess concurrent validity, we categorized all non-missing 15-minute time blocks as sleep, inactive (awake, but no physical activity reported), or active (physical activity reported), based on the PROUST diary records. If PROUST records are concurrently valid, ActiGraph counts should be lowest for sleep blocks, intermediate for inactive blocks, and highest for active blocks. We proposed that at least a 50% average increase in ActiGraph counts for reportedly “active” over “inactive” blocks suggests participants are capturing meaningful distinctions. This would distinguish, for instance, between a light activity, such as walking at low speeds, and a moderately intense activity, such as bicycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12443096">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1525822X12443096">
<title>Ethnographic validity</title>
<p>Another way to assess the validity of PROUST records is ethnographically, by determining whether patterns of association internal to the DLA/PROUST data are consistent with what we know from interviews or observations about the daily lives of those who participated. For instance, male, immigrant community members who participated in our study were predominantly working in physically demanding jobs, sometimes with highly variable hours. Female community members had more significant child care and domestic responsibilities, which comprised a major portion of their physical activity. Although some also held wage jobs, they worked fewer hours overall and almost never very late at night or early in the morning. Hence, we hypothesized that reported physical activity should track patterns of work strongly among men but weakly among female community members, and work should be dispersed across 24 hours among men only.</p>
<p>Testing these hypotheses highlights an analytical challenge common to identifying internal patterns within high-resolution diary data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12443096">Walls and Schafer 2006</xref>). In the physical activity study, we collected “yes/no” data regarding 12 general activity types, 12 physical activity types, 7 settings, and 6 types of companions for every 15-minute block across 5 days. That equates to 17,760 data points per participant. These data can, however, be reduced and analyzed manageably. We used two approaches: graphical visualization and formal hypothesis tests using statistics appropriate to repeated measures.</p>
<p>To produce graphs displaying average patterns of work and physical activity across the day, we used Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) through PROC GENMOD in SAS v9.2. In simplest terms, GEE may be understood as a substitute for ordinary least squares regression useful when observations are <italic>correlated</italic> rather than independent (e.g., activities at 9:15 are not independent of what the same person was doing at 9:00, and individual-level propensities for activities vary). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525822X12443096">Walls and Schafer (2006)</xref> provide a comprehensive reference, including a discussion of other alternatives, such as growth curves and multilevel models. We input all 15-minute blocks across all participants as individual data points. The model then predicted the probability of being at work or physically active at any given time of the day or night for each participant, and we graphed the average probability for each time block to show the pattern across the whole sample or within any subgroup. We also used GEE to formally test the association of work and physical activity. We modeled the probability that any given 15-minute block during waking hours would be reported as including physical activity from three independent variables: whether the community member is male or female; whether the same 15-minute block also was recorded as involving work; and the interaction between these two. The interaction term determines whether there is a <italic>difference</italic> between men and women in how strongly work and physical activity are associated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1525822X12443096">
<title>Replication of the schedule density index</title>
<p>DLA/PROUST data alternately may be reduced by generating an index that captures some meaningful characteristic of an individual’s <italic>entire</italic> schedule throughout the study and predicting individual-level biobehavioral outcomes from this index. Indices greatly simplify analysis, because each participant contributes only a single data point. This allows us to use conventional statistics that assume all observations are independent, although intra-individual variability is lost.</p>
<p>In the 21st Century Families Study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">2008</xref>) created an index of “schedule density” by counting the number of transitions per hour between physical settings across all weekdays for each participant. Transitions were coded whenever a participant switched his or her location or selected the “transit” activity. Higher weekday schedule density among married mothers with children entering kindergarten was shown to predict more positive maternal mood, lower parenting stress, and higher child vagal tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman 2008</xref>). We replicated this index and used it to predict physical activity levels and waist circumference in the physical activity study.</p>
<p>Daily routines built into the schedule for purposes other than exercise per se, such as transit, often will be just as important a source of energy expenditure and predictor of health outcomes as leisure activities like sports or gym workouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525822X12443096">Frank et al. 2004</xref>). Movement around the urban landscape should comprise a routine form of physical activity built into the schedule, especially for students on a walkable campus, but also to a lesser degree for community members with cars. Hence, if DLA/PROUST data are valid, we hypothesized that higher weekday schedule density would correlate with more minutes per day of moderately intense physical activity and with a smaller waist circumference. Moderately intense physical activity is defined as requiring energy expenditure equal to or greater than three times the resting metabolic rate, which is approximately 3.5 kcal/min for the average U.S. adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525822X12443096">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1999</xref>), and can be reliably identified using ActiGraph counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525822X12443096">Rothney et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-1525822X12443096">
<title>Concurrent Validity: Comparison with Actigraphy</title>
<p>We tested concurrent validity by comparing ActiGraph counts when participants reported in PROUST that they were asleep, awake but inactive (no form of physical activity coded), or active. For the full sample, using individual averages, there was an increase in mean total ActiGraph counts from 377.76 ± 265.45 when reportedly asleep, to 2556.10 ± 878.85 when reportedly awake but inactive, to 8420.13 ± 6418.23 when reportedly active. The average difference between inactive and active time blocks in total Actigraph counts, expressed as a percentage of inactive levels, was similar for male (367.04%) and female (369.03%) students, lower for male community members (194.91%), and lowest for female community members (60.52%); absolute differences follow a similar pattern.</p>
<p>For every subgroup, the differences in ActiGraph counts at the 15-minute level between reportedly inactive and active time blocks while awake were statistically significant (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). Hence, we judged concurrent validity of the PROUST physical activity records acceptable in aggregate. However, at the individual level the diaries of five participants (14.7%) were suspect by the criteria we had established, because they lacked at least a 50% average increase in activity counts between reportedly inactive and active time blocks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1525822X12443096">
<title>Ethnographic Validity: Patterns of Physical Activity and Work</title>
<p>As a second means to assess validity, we had proposed that work and physical activity should be distributed more broadly throughout the day, and be more strongly associated, in male than in female community members. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1525822X12443096">Figure 2</xref>, the top graphs represent the distribution of work across the weekday and the bottom graphs represent reported physical activity, for community member males and females, respectively. Among the men, work has a strong peak centered on daylight hours, with a maximum spanning approximately 7:00 a.m.–4:00 p.m. despite a brief decline at the lunch hour. However, a sufficient minority are working at all times of night and day to prevent the line from reaching zero, except for a single time block from 2:00–2:15 a.m. Among female community members, paid work is less frequent at all times of day, rare after 9:00 p.m., and absent between midnight and 8:00 a.m. Among males, patterns of work and physical activity are nearly identical, whereas they diverge among females. Moreover, the interaction between gender and work is significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that work is more strongly associated with physical activity in men than women. The confirmation of gender differences in the distribution and association of physical activity and work, hypothesized based on interviews and observations, affords ethnographic validity.</p>

<title>Indexing PROUST Data: Schedule Density Predicts Physical Activity Levels</title>
<p>Finally, we had hypothesized that participants with denser schedules according to their PROUST records should be engaged in more minutes per day of moderate physical activity judged through concurrent actigraphy and would have smaller waist circumference. Both of these predictions were confirmed (<italic>r</italic> = .45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 01, and <italic>r</italic> = −.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively). Hence, we find that DLA/PROUST records usefully predict behavior and biology when reduced to an individual-level index of schedule density, replicating findings from previous research.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>DLA complements methods such as observation and EMA and may prove useful for field researchers interested in the ecological contextualization of behavior and distribution of subjective experience across time. As implemented using PROUST software on handheld computers, DLA is minimally intrusive for participants and saves the investigator time by generating a precoded digital record. Relative to momentary or spot sampling, DLA achieves complete coverage of the day. This can be helpful for studies that seek to trace contingencies and sequences linking events or need to code for events that are short in duration or occur at times when participants will not respond to instantaneous prompts. Paper-based alternatives can be used in populations where deploying handheld computers would be problematic.</p>
<p>In the physical activity study, DLA displayed good concurrent validity with respect to actigraphy and good ethnographic validity with respect to hypothesized patterns in physical activity and work. Two separate studies now have shown that a summative index (schedule density) can predict biobehavioral outcomes at the individual level. With appropriate validation, DLA can be customized to nearly any research question concerning the temporal structure of discrete experiences, either using an investigator-driven approach or employing the techniques of cognitive anthropology to elicit meaningful experiential categories from the community under study. But we advise incorporating into any new study independent means to establish validity, rather than relying on an assumption that DLA and PROUST data are equally valid across designs and populations. Age, education levels, language barriers, familiarity with handheld computers, and degrees of regimentation of the day in terms of clock time are among a few factors expected to create individual and population-level differences in how well the method performs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12443096">Arning and Ziefle 2009</xref>). Moreover, certain discrete experiences may be easier to accurately recall than others (e.g., emotional states are recalled poorly; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525822X12443096">Chick 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525822X12443096">Shiffman et al. 2008</xref>). Finally, the quality of the preliminary work done to establish meaningful categories and train participants and interviewers likely will affect validity.</p>
<p>We have not systematically compared validity, compliance, or ease of use between paper and computerized versions of DLA. Instead, we refer the reader to an extensive literature on technological trade-offs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525822X12443096">Arning and Ziefle 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525822X12443096">Gravlee et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12443096">Ice 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443096">Lam et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525822X12443096">Sobell et al. 1996</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443096">Lam et al. (2010)</xref> found handheld computers preferred by participants over paper for self-report diaries, with better overall data quality, enhanced compliance monitoring, and reduced data entry labor, but handheld computers carry greater start-up costs and the potential for data loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525822X12443096">Ice 2004</xref>). In the physical activity study, all participants chose PROUST over paper and no data were lost. Configuring PROUST for a new study does not require specialized computer skills. For more advanced customizations, PROUST was programmed using open standards and a widely supported scripting language to maximize flexibility and cross-platform compatibility. Nevertheless, installing new fonts for extended language support or porting PROUST to different hardware will require a study team member with at least intermediate technical expertise. In the case of hardware porting, some modification of the source code may be necessary.</p>
<p>A primary limitation of DLA is the potential for recall bias, although the structured menus and follow-up debriefing sessions can help. Second, reliance on predefined categories limits the breadth and depth of experience that can be documented. DLA is not a substitute for comprehensive ethnography, although it can become one component of ethnographic description, especially when follow-up interviews are carefully constructed to elicit narratives regarding the experiences that were recorded. Third, DLA requires intensive interviewer and participant training, and enough effort during data collection that some time-limited participants may self-select out of the sample. Finally, resolution is limited to what occurred within each 15-minute block. Hence, state durations will tend to be overestimated, as in one-zero observational sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525822X12443096">Altmann 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525822X12443096">Martin and Bateson 1986</xref>). In contrast to what is possible in observational research, autobiographical memory is not sufficiently precise to identify exact start and end times for routine activities. This is a limitation widely shared among recall-based structured diary approaches that achieve 24-hour coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1525822X12443096">Lam et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443096">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>). The principal alternatives are true momentary sampling, which will tend to sacrifice complete coverage but enhance validity, or extended periods of observation with their attendant burden on participants and investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525822X12443096">Robinson and Godbey 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, we have found DLA/PROUST data helpful for examining how discrete daily experiences predict each other as well as other variable states, such as physical activity, energy expenditure, biomarkers of stress and arousal, and so on, as people go about their daily lives. DLA also can help identify concordances and discordances among perceived and objectively measured elements of daily experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">2008</xref>). These are social–ecological and biosocial questions amenable to quantitative analysis of the kind we have illustrated in this report. While useful for identifying patterns <italic>within</italic> daily schedules, it is not always necessary to use advanced statistical approaches such as GEE or multilevel models. Conventional statistics including <italic>t</italic>-tests, Pearson correlations, and ordinary least squares regression also can be fruitful so long as the researcher uses the <italic>individual</italic> as the unit of analysis by generating an average or index capturing a meaningful general characteristic of the entire recorded schedule.</p>
<p>We also developed DLA to address <italic>ecocultural</italic> and <italic>biocultural</italic> questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525822X12443096">Worthman 2010</xref>). Cultural analysis requires a mixed-methods approach wherein we code DLA debriefing narratives both inductively and deductively and consider motives, trade-offs, or constraints implicit in the daily routine. That is beyond the scope of this initial report, although a model does exist in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525822X12443096">DeCaro and Worthman 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525822X12443096">2008</xref>). Establishing baseline data collection procedures and validating the data quantitatively are necessary initial steps. By describing methods that operationalize daily experience in a manner amenable to statistical analysis with respect to health, behavior, and/or physiology, we aim to contribute toward the growing methodological literature on social and cultural epidemiology.</p>
