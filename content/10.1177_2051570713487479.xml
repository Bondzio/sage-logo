<abstract>
<p>In this study we propose conceptualizing Fair Trade as a form of social innovation. Our goal is to better understand its failure to gain general acceptance by examining consumer resistance to innovation. Research methods include observation (consumption behavior in a canteen) and face-to-face interviews. Our findings reveal that individual barriers are insufficient to explain resistance to Fair Trade. We discuss the reasons why consumers in our study showed low levels of identification with and appropriation of Fair Trade. We conclude with recommendations for facilitating the adoption of Fair Trade and social innovations.</p>

<title>Resistance to Fair Trade and social innovation</title>
<p>Fair Trade (FT) has been the subject of numerous academic studies, disproportionately to its importance in world trade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2051570713487479">1</xref></sup> This interest may be attributable to the complexity of FT, which is both an activist movement whose proponents aim to transform the rules of international trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487479">Huybrechts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2051570713487479">Wilkinson, 2007</xref>) and a responsible consumption movement for purchasers of FT products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2051570713487479">Gendron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-2051570713487479">Moore, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-2051570713487479">Nicholls and Opal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-2051570713487479">Renard, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>FT has been clearly defined by its proponents as a social innovation. Since its origin, its objectives have been to change the rules of international trade and to establish conditions to raise the standard of living and the social and environmental security of producers and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur et al., 2005</xref>). One of the first stumbling blocks associated with FT probably stems from the ambiguity of an activist movement that nevertheless lies within the commercial sphere. Moreover, the literature makes clear that despite the growing awareness of FT, only a small minority of consumers regularly buy its products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051570713487479">Belk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2051570713487479">Diaz Pedregal and Özçaglar-Toulouse, 2011</xref>). The discrepancy between the generally favorable attitude to FT and the low transformation of this attitude into purchasing behavior is therefore something of a paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051570713487479">Carrington et al., 2010</xref>). Our study aims to help shed light on the problems of FT diffusion by conceptualizing it as a social innovation and providing a holistic view of resistance to this innovation.</p>
<p>In the first part of the article, after reviewing work on the individual obstacles to the consumption of FT products, we propose conceptualizing FT as a social innovation and then analyzing the process of disseminating social innovations and possible resistance to them. Our approach aims to highlight the importance of the processes of appropriation and social identification by drawing on research on the diffusion of and resistance to innovations both in marketing and in the field of the sociology of translation. This first part concludes with a proposed framework for analyzing resistance to FT as a social innovation.</p>
<p>In the second part of the article, we present a two-stage field study. The first stage, which could be likened to a quasi-experiment, aims to examine, in real consumption conditions in a cafeteria (and not in the laboratory or on the basis of statements), the impact of the removal of various obstacles often mentioned in the literature (lack of information, unavailability of products, high prices) on the acceptability of the FT products used in our study. The second stage, with the same population, consists of an interpretative analysis of the discourses of customers in the cafeteria, linked to the preliminary observation of their choice or non-choice of the FT products offered. We seek to define the FT translation operations by consumers and non-consumers in order to understand the representations that shape FT’s signification system. The analysis of the interviews reveals resistance to FT, influenced by the lack of its appropriation and the absence of a group identity among FT consumers.</p>
<p>The conclusion presents the managerial implications of our findings in order to facilitate the spread of FT, then goes on to suggest possible future marketing research in relation to social innovation.</p>

<title>Theoretical framework</title>
<p>FT can be seen both as a consumer movement and as an activist movement in protest against the prevailing market system. An important part of research on FT consumption has focused on variables that influence the decision to purchase FT products, generally following the theory of planned behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2051570713487479">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). The studies have mainly been concerned with variables, from the individual standpoint, that influence whether or not FT products are purchased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2051570713487479">Auger et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2051570713487479">De Ferran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2051570713487479">De Pelsmacker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-2051570713487479">Loureiro and Lotade, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-2051570713487479">Tagbata and Sirieix, 2008</xref>). The impact of price, quality, information and the availability of products has thus been highlighted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, study of consumers of FT products has been situated within the broader movement of responsible consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-2051570713487479">Ferrando y Puig and Giamporcaro-Saunière, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2051570713487479">Özçaglar-Toulouse, 2009</xref>), defined as behavior aimed at transposing societal or political convictions into day-to-day consumption practices. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2051570713487479">Belk et al. (2005)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2051570713487479">Halkier and Holm (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-2051570713487479">Özçaglar-Toulouse (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051570713487479">Carrington et al. (2010)</xref> seek to understand the foundations of the consumption of FT products, or more generally of ethical or responsible products, while bringing out the meanings that these practices have for consumers who engage in them. An improved model incorporating intentions, the monitoring of behavior and the situational context has been proposed, but it has not yet been applied to a concrete situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2051570713487479">Carrington et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Daniel and Sirieix show also that commitment to FT can result in the public expression of ethical concerns, in two ways, the one silent, the other displayed and visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487479">Daniel and Sirieix, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond and Özçaglar-Toulouse (2011)</xref> have revealed the imaginary mobilized by FT purchasers to give meaning to their choice, thus showing that the question of meaning and value that FT may have for consumers is a key factor in their adopting it.</p>
<p>In addition, the activist movement and its organization has been studied in the fields both of marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2051570713487479">Özçaglar-Toulouse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond, 2008</xref>) and in the sociology of markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2051570713487479">Diaz Pedegral, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-2051570713487479">Le Velly, 2006</xref>). Some authors have examined the conditions for the spread of this ‘socio-economic innovation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond and Özçaglar-Toulouse, 2011</xref>) or conceptualize FT as an innovation advocating an ethics of markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2051570713487479">Hartlieb and Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487479">Huybrechts, 2010</xref>). However, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez (2004)</xref> have analyzed the spread of innovations to get a clearer understanding of the practices of the two main FT organizations in France (Artisans du Monde and Max Havelaar), to our knowledge this analysis has not been used to understand the obstacles to the spread of FT among consumers.</p>
<p>Consequently, our research aims to propose a framework for analyzing the diffusion of FT as a social innovation in order to clarify the mechanisms of resistance to it by most consumers. To do this, our literature review allows us to conceptualize FT as a social innovation, then to present the theoretical framework of the concept of the diffusion of a social innovation, so as to develop a framework for analyzing FT’s relative failure to gain acceptance as a resistance phenomenon.</p>
<sec id="section3-2051570713487479">
<title>Conceptualization of FT as social innovation</title>
<p>The concept of social innovation was introduced in 1970 in social psychology, with reference to the study of technical or technological innovations. Since then, to our knowledge, it has been only rarely applied in the field of marketing and consumer behavior. Social innovation refers to new ways of ‘doing things’ with the aim of meeting social needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2051570713487479">Taylor, 1970</xref>), or of fighting against economic inequalities by seeking to develop a new social order or new equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-2051570713487479">Gabor, 1970</xref>). It may be defined, by analogy with technological innovation, as ‘any new approach, practice or procedure or any new product developed to improve a situation or solve a social problem that has been taken up at the level of institutions, organizations or communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2051570713487479">Bouchard, 1999</xref>) or as ‘the complex process of introducing new products, processes or programs that profoundly change the basic routines, resource and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which the innovation occurs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2051570713487479">Westley and Antadze, 2010</xref>). Social innovation is defined not by its object (which makes it multiform), but by its innovative or exceptional character and by its overall aim of enhancing the well-being of individuals or specific communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2051570713487479">Cloutier, 2003</xref>). Therefore, to be successful, it requires cooperation between a variety of actors, including those who live in difficult circumstances which the innovation is intended to ameliorate.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-2051570713487479">Phills et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2051570713487479">Wilkinson (2007)</xref> present FT as an example of social innovation like any new solution to a social problem, because it makes changes throughout the value chain, from certification and the development and promotion of new standards through to the training of producers and consumer education.</p>
<p>FT has its origins in a challenge to the ‘unfair’ rules of international trade and is based on an alternative model of trade with the explicit goals of improving the lot of small farmers in the South and the enrollment of consumers in the North (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-2051570713487479">Low and Davenport, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-2051570713487479">Zadek and Tiffen, 1996</xref>). The main characteristics of FT, such as new ways of regulating North–South trade, the notion of a fair price, and the integration of small producers’ organizations into governance or distribution systems, entail a radically new approach to modern consumption. Such features vindicate its conceptualization as social innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-2051570713487479">Nicholls, 2010</xref>). Indeed FT represents a rupture with regard to empowerment in the market economy compared to other forms of organizing trade, by recalling the social construction of markets and the importance of economic principles of reciprocity and redistribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2051570713487479">Eshuis and Harmsen, 2003</xref>). For the pioneers of FT, it was a matter, within the market economy, of linking a challenge to trading conditions under globalization to social practices of economic citizenship (‘trade, not aid’), and of moving from a commercial transaction to a social relationship imbued with moral and political content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-2051570713487479">Gendron et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The three criteria put forward in the literature on social innovation – its innovative or exceptional character, the overall objective of meeting social needs and cooperation between actor networks – are thus found in FT, whose objective is to improve the living conditions of the producers of the South by changing the rules of international trade, which in turn requires the coordination, translation and mediation of a variety of actors ranging from producers (who have to organize themselves into cooperatives) through to consumers. Characterizing FT as a social innovation therefore allows theories of the diffusion of innovations to be mobilized. To do this, we will use work based, on the one hand, on the sociology of translation and, on the other, the marketing theory of the diffusion of innovations, in order to analyze the weaknesses of the FT diffusion process among consumers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2051570713487479">
<title>Theoretical framework of the social innovation diffusion process</title>
<p>In his analysis of the diffusion of social innovations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487479">Callon (2007)</xref> shows that networking and community practices allow certain ‘matters of concern’ promoted by minority groups to occupy a larger place in economic organization (even if this remains relative in the case of FT products). Such ‘matters of concern’ may originate in market frameworks and their ‘excesses’ that affect individuals or groups in unexpected ways: speculation on raw materials is not intended to increase the poverty of producers of the South, which eludes the market framework. Yet this ‘excess’ led to the emergence of groups who mobilized themselves in opposition and invented a new form of organization (Fair Trade), promoting the incursion of the social sphere into the economic sphere. The dynamic that developed between particular products that were ‘matters of concern’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-2051570713487479">2</xref></sup> (in this case, FT products) and activist groups (Artisans du Monde, for example) resulted in a social innovation, because it made possible the recognition and expression of new identities, particularly for consumers.</p>
<p>The diffusion of an innovation requires the adoption of a new practice by actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2051570713487479">Alter, 2003</xref>). Yet for everyday practices, the force of habit is such that changing them by means of intention-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2051570713487479">Verplanken and Wood, 2006</xref>) or goal-oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2051570713487479">Neal et al., 2012</xref>) action is not enough. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-2051570713487479">Taylor (1970)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2051570713487479">Henderson (1993)</xref> had already noted that social innovations aimed at solving social problems get a more mixed reception than technological innovations because they often require a significant change of identity on the part of those concerned. People’s identities, values and norms need to change if they are to mobilize and participate in the dissemination of social innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-2051570713487479">Mulgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-2051570713487479">Westley and Antadze, 2010</xref>). For innovative experiences and ‘inventions’ driven by ‘concerned groups’ to result in a transformation of the social system involving new forms of consumption, they must be able to reach a wider public and be taken up by a network of actors in a dynamic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2051570713487479">Cloutier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-2051570713487479">Petitclerc, 2003</xref>). The process involves four basic operations that mark the process of innovation (whether technological or social) and that the sociology of translation models by focusing on actors’ ‘smart tactics’ for a gradual translation of innovative discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487479">Latour, 1989</xref>), from problematization to mobilization.</p>
<p>Problematization, which Latour characterizes as a way of expressing the problem faced, is the process by which the promoters of the innovation seek to make it indispensable for the actors they want to enroll, so that their beliefs regarding use or purchase, for example, are carried along by the desire to belong to the network being constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2051570713487479">Roux and Rémy, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The ‘interessement’ (of actors whose ‘disparate interests are progressively allied’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487479">Latour 1989</xref>) is manifested by the process of recruiting the network’s participants, by means of psychological and cognitive mechanisms that confer meaning on the behavior and identity of the actors, through physical and discursive devices (for FT, by means of products, Max Havelaar or other labels, distribution channels, etc.).</p>
<p>Enrollment consists of coordinating actions to the point that they are distributed in the same way as roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487479">Latour, 1989</xref>). To enroll actors and obtain their commitment, the promoters of the innovation have to stabilize the roles prescribed by the problematization operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-2051570713487479">Roux and Rémy, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487479">Callon (2007)</xref> notes the need for social innovations to build a network and community practices, based on the distinguishability of the goods and services promoted by the networked markets. For FT, the products offered have a distinctiveness (by virtue of their ethical and solidarity character) which must articulate participation in a network and purchasing and consumption practices.</p>
<p>Finally, by mobilization, the hybrid movement being constructed acquires spokespersons who increase its resources by communicating them to initially uninvolved segments of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051570713487479">Callon 1986</xref>). Thus, though created mainly for distinctive food products, FT has evolved into clothing and shoes, worn by designers mobilized to the cause. Similarly, whereas FT was first offered to consumers at retail outlets, it has since been introduced into new channels, such as outside catering services and restaurants. Mobilizing the network requires that new players incorporate FT into their product offerings (Starbucks, for example, has since 2010 been selling ‘100% Fair Trade’ espresso).</p>
<p>In line with these studies, innovation is defined as a social process, the two main dimensions of which are the advent of a sense of normality and the emergence of normativity that strengthens it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2051570713487479">Gaglio, 2008</xref>). Gaglio proposes a three-stage model: the emergence of a consumption norm; crystallization, which allows people to anchor the innovation in their daily life; and transformation, with emergent unintended effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-2051570713487479">3</xref></sup> This process can also occur through imitation (Grandclément and Cochoy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-2051570713487479">4</xref></sup> 2006), which facilitates the adoption of a social innovation. The conceptualization of FT as social innovation thus allows us to understand the slow growth in the purchase of FT products, not only by using individual approaches as is usually the case in the literature, but also by studying the shortcomings of the development of operations (gradual translation) for the diffusion of innovation as a social process.</p>

<sec id="section5-2051570713487479">
<title>Shortcomings of the diffusion process and resistance to FT</title>
<p>In the case of FT as an innovation, shortcomings can be identified at different stages in its social diffusion. Regarding its problematization, it is hard to establish a consensus between the initial promoters of FT with the objective of challenging and changing the rules of international trade (an integrated approach, as with Artisans du Monde) and new entrants who place more emphasis on the goal of changing the life conditions of producers by offering ‘distinctive’ products for consumers (a labeling approach, as, for example, with Max Havelaar), including recourse to mass retail. This lack of agreement has implications for the interessement stage: the divergent emphases, on the one hand, of the integrated approach, which in particular rejects the distribution of FT products in conventional retail outlets and, on the other, the labeling approach that accepts it, make any compromise difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez, 2004</xref>). As for enrollment, this requires that people are federated around a project and that the overall interest is made   clear to all. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-2051570713487479">Wilkinson (2007)</xref>, consumer activists who contributed to the creation of FT networks constitute a genuine group and an essential component of the FT movement; but what about people who consume FT products in conventional channels? They can be categorized as a group by research (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2051570713487479">De Pelsmacker et al., 2005</xref>) without, however, having a shared representation of FT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2051570713487479">Sitz, 2009</xref>). The construction of the figure of the FT consumer does yet not seem to have stabilized. Based on the analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2051570713487479">Cova and Roncaglio (1999)</xref> of the consumption experience, we can wonder whether there is any common FT consumer identity between the mobilized and loyal adherents to the movement (consumers, but also volunteers for Artisans du Monde, for example), enrolled practitioners who regularly buy FT products and the majority of consumers, who might see themselves as ‘sympathizers’, but are not really involved in any activities apart from their occasional consumption of FT products. The issue for FT is then to truly enroll all or part of this majority into its innovative project, which is a necessary condition for the successful diffusion of this social innovation by mobilizing a network that broadens its scope. Such enrollment is based on consumers’ ability to integrate FT into their identity construction process by appropriation (the extended self) and identification with a social group (social identity). Appropriation is defined here as the device that will help transform an object into a means for self-expression and integrate it into one’s extended self, i.e. to adapt it in support of self-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2051570713487479">Belk, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2051570713487479">Roux and Brunel, 2006</xref>). It is a set of operations that result in making something one’s own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051570713487479">Carù and Cova, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2051570713487479">Cova and Cova, 2001</xref>). These appropriation operations allow the attribution of a given meaning to the consumption experience, not only a general meaning but one that is constructed by the individual, on the basis of his or her reference points and personal history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2051570713487479">Ladwein, 2003</xref>). Without these operations, appropriation by consumers of the FT consumption experience cannot occur, thus preventing the diffusion of this social innovation.</p>
<p>Finally, since the diffusion of a social innovation takes place through the complex process of setting up a network of actors mutually linked by the flow of values   and identity elements, it is necessary to take into account the influence of social identification processes, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2051570713487479">Bartels and Reinders (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2051570713487479">Bartels and Hoogendam (2011)</xref>, who showed that the success of green products was based on the development of an ‘organic consumers’ group social identity<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-2051570713487479">5</xref></sup> that can be identified by other consumers. Identification with a group, enhanced by imitation and learning, will facilitate the sense of normality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2051570713487479">Gaglio, 2008</xref>) and the diffusion of the innovation.</p>
<p>Conceptualizing FT as a social innovation thus brings out the importance of forming networks on the initiative of a minority group involved in a ‘subject of concern’, by means of operations of appropriation to and social identification with the group among consumers.</p>
<p>Work in marketing on resistance to innovation complements these approaches by identifying the processes elaborated through the cognitive abilities of individual consumers facing innovations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051570713487479">Bagozzi and Lee (1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2051570713487479">Ram (1987)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2051570713487479">Ram and Sheth (1989)</xref> define resistance to innovation as opposition by consumers to an innovation because it involves potential changes in relation to a satisfactory status quo (in this case, it is related to the force of habit of certain practices; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2051570713487479">Neal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2051570713487479">Verplanken and Wood, 2006</xref>), or because it conflicts with their belief system or the goals they pursue. The perception of dissonant elements is indeed one of the main determinants of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-2051570713487479">Roux, 2007</xref>). In his model of innovation, Ram identifies certain characteristics such as relative advantage or disadvantage, the degree of complexity or compatibility of the innovation, the perception of risk associated with the adoption of the innovation (physical, functional, psychological or social risk), which are likely to conflict with the consumer’s prior representations and influence his or her behavior in relation to the innovation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-2051570713487479">Ram, 1987</xref>). This model can be applied to FT. Thus lack of availability is one of the most frequently studied hindrances: buying FT products may seem difficult to reconcile with established buying habits pertaining to products or places of purchase. FT may also be viewed as a complex idea. Finally, the perceived advantage or disadvantage and the risk associated with adoption may be financial (a higher price for a product that is not always seen as better) or social in nature. If they have difficulty in estimating the perceived value of the innovation, people have no incentive to adopt it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2051570713487479">Bagozzi and Lee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2051570713487479">Ram and Sheth, 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>A proposed framework for analyzing resistance to FT</title>
<p>The marketing and sociology literature on social innovation and resistance to innovation sheds new light on the problem of the diffusion of FT. Analyzed as an individual decision-making process, opting for FT depends on assessing the value it brings, and especially obstacles due to price, lack of availability and information, the degree of complexity and perceived risk. Analyzed as a social innovation process, FT has to face the difficulty of appropriation and social identification with a group, which inhibits the translation of its innovative offering among ever broader layers of consumers.</p>
<p>Our empirical approach will use a study to examine both types of obstacle: individual obstacles and those related to resistance to FT as social innovation, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2051570713487479">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Methodological framework</title>
<p>The objective of the study is to identify the translation process of FT through the analysis of situations (meals with peers in a cafeteria), practices (choosing or not choosing FT products) and discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2051570713487479">Sitz, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, with the same population, we set up both a quasi-experiment by manipulating or neutralizing the obstacles usually cited (availability, information and price) to observe their practices, and a qualitative study based on interviews to access the discursive domain. We chose as our terrain the cafeteria of a higher education institution, frequented by students, teacher-researchers and administrative staff.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-2051570713487479">6</xref></sup> The choice of terrain involving meals eaten away from home is justified by the increase in this form of consumption and its strategic dimension for FT: according to the Plate-Forme Française du Commerce Equitable (PFCE – French Fairtrade Platform), although two-thirds of FT sales are in supermarkets, the ‘away from home’ sector is the most dynamic (57% increase in 2008). Our dual system allowed us to observe behavior in a real choice context and to identify discursive elements related to this behavior in the day-to-day lives of respondents.</p>
<p>In the course of the quasi-experiment, our manipulation centered on individual jars of stewed fruit compote of the FT brand Ethiquable, as compotes are frequently provided in the cafeteria, either in individual jars (with the brand label on the lid) or served in small ramekins. The procedure allowed us to directly measure the effect of availability and information<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-2051570713487479">7</xref></sup> on the consumption of FT, continuously for four weeks. The collection of observation data included a device to video record the trays and collection of sales receipts by a member of the research team, so as to be able to connect the identity of the person with his or her choices.</p>
<p>Analysis of these choices allowed us to identify those who selected or did not select the FT compotes, and to conduct 18 semi-structured targeted interviews, the content of which was coded and analyzed by the authors.</p>
<p>In addition, a self-administered questionnaire sent to regular users of the cafeteria enabled us collect their reported consumption of FT products.</p>
<sec id="section8-2051570713487479">
<title>The quasi-experiment and observation of behavior</title>
<p>The quasi-experiment comprised the following stages:</p>
<list id="list1-2051570713487479" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stage 0 (4 days during week W0<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-2051570713487479">8</xref></sup>), <italic>observation without manipulation</italic>: no changes made to the food available; videoed observation of trays and daily data collection by name tag.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Stage 1 (5 days during week W1), <italic>control of the taste variable</italic>: introduction of FT compotes (2 varieties: banana and banana–passion fruit) served in ramekins, with no information; videoed observation of trays and daily data collection. In the event of questions about the change of flavor, staff were instructed to say the fruit had been changed to vary the desserts on offer.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>continuation of compotes served in ramekins + introduction of the same two varieties in sealed jars with the ‘Fair Trade’ label on the lids. An information system was set up, with a display stand, leaflets by the compotes, and two ‘Fair Trade’ posters put up by the check-out counter. In this stage, we studied the positive impact of the information provided on the choice of FT products.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Distribution on the university intranet of a questionnaire about food purchasing in general, with a question about the frequency of buying FT products, in order to measure the interest in such products among this population.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-2051570713487479">
<title>Qualitative stage and discourse analysis</title>
<p>Eighteen interviews centered on the consumption of FT products in general (among eaters and non-eaters of FT compotes, identified by observation) were conducted on site during the last two days of the experiment. These lasted between 45 and 60 minutes, and were recorded, in order to be analyzed in parallel by the authors. The inventory of the themes of each interview, then of the entire corpus, enabled us to construct a coding grid that identifies the dimensions related to appropriation and social identification.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section10-2051570713487479">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Our complex twofold study sought on the one hand to use observation to understand how consumers responded to the mechanisms deployed in their practical choices in the cafeteria, and on the other by means of individual interviews to access the discursive dimension of their contribution to the construction of a system of significations and justifications giving meaning to their adoption of FT products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-2051570713487479">Sitz, 2009</xref>). Through the analysis of their practices and discourses, we were able to access the individual FT ‘translation’ processes as well as the collective process, by introducing FT products into the situation of having a meal with colleagues or other students in the cafeteria.</p>
<sec id="section11-2051570713487479">
<title>Observation of practices in the context of meals at the cafeteria (quasi-experiment)</title>
<p>Seventy-one regular customers of the cafeteria (a little less than half of total daily attendance) responded to the questionnaire on the intranet. The responses indicate that the study was conducted in an inherently very favorable context for the choice of a FT product, with the respondents reporting consumption of FT products higher than that shown by surveys of the French population in general (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2051570713487479">Table 1</xref>). Only 20% said they never buy them (17.7% of students and 23% of non-students). Those who said they regularly bought FT products (more than once per month) made up 39.4% of the sample, but the proportion was significantly higher among non-students (57.6%) than students (28.8%).</p>

<p>Despite this favorable context, the results obtained by the observation of practices (choice of dessert) were mixed. The observation period of four weeks allowed us to trace the cafeteria users’ choices, with regard to their consumption of compotes, in ramekins (without reference to FT) or jars (with Fair Trade indicated on the lid), before and during the information stage (posters and leaflets next to the compote jars) as shown on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2051570713487479">tables 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2051570713487479">5</xref>. The analysis of choices shows that though there was a ‘Fair Trade compote’ effect, it was limited in time. For each day of the experiment we calculated the choice of compotes as a proportion of total dessert choices, the choice of desserts as a proportion of total meals, the number of desserts chosen   and the number of customers: as variations in these last three measurements remained within the norms over the observation period (indicating a stable environment), we have only shown them for the first stage.</p>

<p>During the first week of observation without manipulation, except Friday when they were out of stock, the consumption of apple compote in the cafeteria was 25 to 30 servings per day, the usual number.</p>
<p>The second stage aimed to neutralize the influence of a change of flavor on the choices: the usual apple compote (in ramekins or jars) was replaced by FT banana–passion fruit, served in only ramekins, and therefore with no information provided. Note that there was no manipulation of prices throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>This phase was essential to neutralize the ‘taste’ effect, since the two compotes (FT and regular) are very different in terms of flavor. After finally withdrawing the apple compote (manipulation error the first day), we found that the compote proportion as a dessert choice remained stable. Overall, the choice of compote did not change significantly, despite the introduction of the new flavor. The preference ranking of the FT compote (but without any mention of FT) was higher than that of other desserts over the week.</p>
<p>In the third stage (weeks S2 and S3), the labeled FT product and FT information were introduced: in addition to the unidentified compotes served in ramekins, customers were now offered the same compotes, but this time clearly identified by the information provided by the brand – jar lid, posters and leaflets – about its FT-related value. During the first three days after its introduction in Week 2, the FT jars of compote were widely chosen in preference to the compote served in ramekins. However, from Thursday, the proportion was reversed. The following week (S3), FT consumption levels compared to total desserts did not rise and indeed fell to a lower level than before the introduction of the information. On the last day, the proportion of compote in ramekins was again higher than FT compotes in jars, though the two were intrinsically the same product.</p>
<p>An ANOVA conducted on S2 and S3 shows that the FT compotes were chosen significantly more than the same compotes served in ramekins, indicating a greater preference for the jars, and therefore the possible impact of the information on choosing FT products. But it also shows that over the period there was a significant decrease in the total compotes chosen (not observed when new flavors were introduced in W1). For this latter finding, however, we cannot exclude a possible effect due to the number of competing desserts or the appeal of certain gourmet desserts sometimes available during this period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-2051570713487479">12</xref></sup> However, when we analyze the results for weeks W2 and W3 separately, we see that the proportion of FT compotes chosen compared to total desserts drops significantly between W2 and W3 (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test 5%, <italic>p</italic>-value 0.024), whereas the change in the choice of compote in ramekins between W2 and W3 is not significant (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.444). Finally, if we test the relative proportions of the choice of compote in ramekins and of the FT compote, the latter is higher than the former for two weeks, significantly so in W2 (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.020) but not in W3 (<italic>p</italic>-value 0.167). These findings seem to indicate an effect on the customers’ practices due to the information given and the provision of FT products at the standard price, but it is not very great, especially if one takes into account the favorable environment suggested by the questionnaire. The effect was also limited in time.</p>
<p>The observed behavior does not confirm the interest in FT declared in the questionnaires. While the obstacles usually cited to explain the discrepancy between awareness and consumption of FT products are lack of availability, lack of information and price, our experiment shows that by removing these obstacles, consumers’ arousal of interest in FT products and their commitment through action remain quite low and are not very robust over time. The discourse analysis allows us to identify the components of resistance to the FT social innovation, as well as the obstacles to the diffusion of FT.</p>

<title>FT in the discourses of consumers and non-consumers</title>
<p>In our interviews, we made clear that we were working on the issue of FT. Respondents began by constructing their relationship with the abstract entity constituted by FT. To give FT consistency within their understanding of it, they were basically encouraged to become ‘spokespeople’, in the sense of the term in the sociology of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2051570713487479">Callon, 1986</xref>). For this, they tried to condense the abstract complexity of concept so as to construct a social representation able to affirm an identity and a social relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-2051570713487479">Jodelet, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation of practices and the analysis of discourses enabled us to distinguish FT consumers from non-consumers. However, as soon as it comes to the ‘translation’ of FT, by moving beyond their discourse on their practices, the differences between the discourses diminish. The interpretative analysis of the corpus of non-consumers immediately reveals two themes: the difficult appropriation of a complex and still new domain and a lack of identification with a group. By contrast, the discourse of consumers ‘translates’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-2051570713487479">Latour, 1989</xref>) the innovative nature of FT, which favors appropriation, despite questioning, among them too, the value of the FT offering. However, their identification with a group of FT consumers was expressed no more than among non-consumers; their consumption remains within an individual dynamic and leaves incomplete the dynamics of the diffusion of the social innovation constituted by FT.</p>
<p>In particular, the discourses about the situation of eating together in the cafeteria reveal the absence of the theme of FT in their conversations, and even its avoidance for some consumers: clearly, FT is not a social or group topic, but remains rooted in individual practices. These themes help to bring to light the obstacles to the diffusion of an innovation, difficulties of appropriation and lack of social identification.</p>
<sec id="section13-2051570713487479">
<title>Individual resistance to innovation</title>
<p>Some respondents resist FT because it does not provide a distinctive value that would meet an expectation or a dissatisfaction with the existing offering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-2051570713487479">Ram and Sheth, 1989</xref>). This applies both to Liliane, who chose FT compotes, and Jean-Michel who did not taste them.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We all saw the FT information and the Fair Trade compotes, but viewing them as something special, no … It’s just a new product and that’s all. (Liliane, consumer<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-2051570713487479">13</xref></sup>)</p>
<p>I didn’t choose a jar, not because it was Fair Trade, but because I wasn’t interested in trying out the product. Whether or not it’s Fair Trade doesn’t matter to me. (Jean-Michel, non-consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The discourses of non-consumers generally matched their practices: they did not choose FT products because they saw no particular advantage in FT compared to the standard offering.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t think the taste is any different with Fair Trade, like … I don’t usually choose them so I don’t see why I would choose it. (Charles, non-consumer).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Even among those who chose the FT compotes, there was doubt about the value provided by these products.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We all know the big food brands, but with FT, apart from Max Havelaar, well … we know that FT products help small farmers in developing countries, but other than that, are the products good and like what we usually consume? There’s a lack of information at this level. (Cécile, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At root, for most of the respondents, the main obstacles are related to the difficulty of giving a personal meaning to and appropriating FT, whose sourcing and marketing procedures are subject to controversy, and are indicative of the shortcomings in this social innovation during the problematization and interessement stages.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-2051570713487479">
<title>FT: Difficult to appropriate</title>
<p>Most of the non-consumer respondents said they had heard to FT, but for them it remains something new and is complicated and difficult to differentiate from other innovative sustainable food products, especially organic food.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>More money goes to the producer than with a standard mass retail product, and then maybe it’s organic, with a minimum of pesticides or no pesticides. (Sophie D, non-consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, those who chose the FT compotes expressed a discourse that set out the specificity of FT and through it could clearly expound its principles and mechanisms.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is a way of trading with generally small producers in the South, uh, in fact, it ensures farmers a fixed price and a fair price that allows them to … have a decent life for their families and have a longer-term view of their farm and already to make a living from it. And so FT is certified by labels, and these labels have criteria … (Julie, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>But while FT has existed since the 1950s, there is no sense of normality associated with the consumption of FT products, for both consumers and non-consumers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But otherwise, people are still not accustomed to buying Fair Trade, I think. Because it’s new, and then … everyone knows the terms Fair Trade, but doesn’t necessarily know what it is, there’s not much … there’s more communication about the form than the content in fact, one doesn’t really know what it is … (Charles, non-consumer).</p>
<p>These [organic and Fair Trade] are still two product categories that are a little out of the ordinary compared to conventional supermarket products. (Marion, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This difficulty in grasping the meaning of FT is also linked to the perception of the values it bears, thus bringing in the notion of dissonance.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Importing products from so far away, what does that mean in terms of the environment?… I don’t know … isn’t there a certain contradiction here? If on the one hand we help farmers manage their farm better, and improve quality and enable producers to prepare for the future a bit better and be able to invest and cope by themselves, aren’t we on the other hand destroying … well, not the ecosystem, but … Well, why not try to develop local trade instead of sending products half way around the globe? (Cécile, consumer)</p>
<p>Well, we know there are many problems in the world. The thing is with Fair Trade, it’s just for some producers, so it enables some producers to live better from what they produce, but given that the country has problems, you need to adopt political measures as well so as to improve the situation in the long term. (Jean Michel, non-consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The procedures adopted by the promoters of FT are also discussed. Given its intervention in the trade system, respondents criticize the movement’s lack of persuasive effectiveness, whether in regard to advertising or to distribution. They also find dissonant the fact of choosing mass retail, which could place FT in their normal source of supply, but without resorting to conventional persuasion techniques such as advertising, with the result that there is a lack of enrollment in the process of cooperation between actors in a network, even though this is necessary for the diffusion of a social innovation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Compared with other products, it lacks … not information, but what it is more commonplace in terms of advertisements. In fact, I think there’s a problem of advertising compared to other products, it’s too apart. It’s advertising, it’s … well, I think it’s a problem of communication. In terms of information and popularization, that’s what gets it more into people’s habits. (Cécile, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some consumers of the FT compote, however, do commit themselves to the network.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s a kind of win–win system maybe. The consumer pays a bit more but is sure that the product is made with more respect for the producer and fairer remuneration. (Romain, consumer)</p>
<p>I think these FT compotes are great. Well, I chose one to find out, and it was good, so … firstly because it was Fair Trade, I said, ‘hey, the good deed of the day’… then, banana compote, I liked that. I had it two or three times. It’s better to choose FT, given that the meals here aren’t expensive, one might as well do something worthwhile, it’s better. (Julie, consumer).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, whether or not they chose FT compotes, the respondents did not express any social identification with a potentially highly valued group of consumers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-2051570713487479">
<title>Lack of identification with the FT consumers as a group</title>
<p>For the non-consumers, there is no desire to enroll in a network that benefits people who are unknown to them. They do not feel personally interested in the economic and social problems faced by small producers of the global South.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s true, I didn’t have it, but I could have done … It’s simply that in the choice available, there was something I liked more. Well actually, I don’t necessarily think about helping small producers, it’s primarily that they provide us with original products … Then there’s awareness of doing a good deed, but that’s not basically my main concern. (Mélanie, non-consumer).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The notion of otherness does not apply only to producers. The respondents view consumers of FT products as a minority or marginalized. The non-consumers primarily see FT consumers as different from them: they are older, ‘women’ (for Charles and Jean-Michel), ‘not students’, ‘people who have more money’ (Charles). FT is limited to a minority; ‘people who are struggling to get by on their monthly income cannot afford FT’ (Charles). FT involves political choices that do not correspond to their values  .</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Who is it? Well, I think it is someone who’s green, and has leftwing ideas, and … for me, it’s someone who is concerned about social justice and who tried to … well, who is against everything to do with globalization, capitalism … someone who wants to take everyone’s wealth and help the poor … someone inspired by the events of May ’68 … I think that it’s someone who’s fairly political … who has an interest in politics. (Mélanie, non-consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Non-consumers also display a certain skepticism regarding the effectiveness of FT products.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I think they’re fairly expensive products, and are bought by a class of people who have more money. Students don’t want to spend more on a compote, things like that … like it’s a drop of water in the ocean. (Marthe, non-consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More surprisingly, even those who are FT consumers do not express any sense of belonging to a group. For them, FT consumption remains within the realm of personal identity and could even be a source of problems with other people, with whom they would need to ‘justify themselves’.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s even at times a subject that one avoids broaching, I think because there are always people who don’t have very nice ideas about this kind of process and that bothers me … I do it calmly in my own way, without talking about it, in fact. In any case if you hear people say it’s pointless, or that it’s false … I don’t want to defend my position, I don’t want to justify myself on anything, so I don’t necessarily want to talk about it … (Sophie C, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In relation to the situation of meals shared with peers in the cafeteria, the respondents, whether FT consumers or not, thus collectively make clear that FT is not included in their usual topics of conversation. However, in this quite small and rather friendly cafeteria, frequented exclusively by students, staff and faculty members of the school, its users always have their lunch in groups and, through selective affinity, sit in their usual places. The various devices introduced to provide information (posters, leaflets, products marked FT for a two-week period) did not succeed in mobilizing material and discursive practices.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We all noticed the leaflets, then, well … I think there was another person who took a leaflet but I’m not sure they were eating [the compote] … no, we didn’t discuss it, because in fact we didn’t take the leaflet, and I thought I’d read it later, so finally, we didn’t … maybe they did when I wasn’t there. (Cécile, consumer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Choosing a FT compote remains an individual act without any social identity dimension. Collective identity, the essential glue for the adoption of a social innovation in particular, remains absent from the respondents’ discourse on the personal experiences, whereas studies on social identity have shown that when a person identifies with a group, he or she has a positive attitude towards this group and willingly transmits a positive image of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2051570713487479">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, there is a better match between discourses and practices for non-consumers than for those who chose the FT compotes, with some of the latter even preferring not to discuss the subject of FT in order to avoid having to justify their choice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through our dual system of inquiry we found that the development of FT runs up against multifaceted resistance. Despite the removing of the obstacles usually cited (availability, information and price), FT products were not chosen to any great extent or on a regular basis for the duration of the experiment. Our study suggests that several reasons for resistance to FT can be identified, which concern its conceptualization as a social innovation. Recommendations for new actions can be offered to FT actors to overcome consumer resistance, and broaden the discussion of the diffusion of social innovations.</p>
<sec id="section17-2051570713487479">
<title>Shortcomings in the appropriation of FT as potential sources of resistance</title>
<p>Whether appropriation is addressed in terms of the construction of a social representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487479">Audebrand and Iacobus 2008</xref>), the search for anchorage points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2051570713487479">Carù and Cova, 2003</xref>) or a sense of normality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-2051570713487479">Gaglio, 2008</xref>), it entails the incorporation of a new object or new idea into a familiar realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-2051570713487479">Ladwein, 2003</xref>). As a key mechanism for the construction of identity, appropriation of an object is based both on experience (the dimension of voluntary action on an object) and on the transformation of the subject in return, with the appropriated object becoming a support for self-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-2051570713487479">Roux and Brunel, 2006</xref>). Our system reveals that only some consumers (for example, Romain) really manage to appropriate their consumption experience. For the rest, there is no appropriation, because the value of the offering cannot really be estimated as long as meaning cannot be ascribed to it and as long as it does not fit in with identity construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-2051570713487479">
<title>Lack of identification with a group</title>
<p>FT seems to be a system associated with a minority group with which it is not easy to identify; its consumption is not rooted in day-to-day practices, even for those who chose the FT product during the quasi-experiment. Consumption of FT products is situated in the realm of ‘occasional adoption’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2051570713487479">Daniel and Sirieix, 2012</xref>). Some people adopt it in a particular context without incorporating it into their everyday life. For others, distancing themselves from the ‘activist’ FT network goes hand in hand with resistance to this innovation, because it could pose a risk of social association with a group perceived as marginal, and prevents FT being seen as normal. Herein lies the twofold problem faced by FT. In its activist dimension, it involves and mobilizes consumers who find their identity by belonging to a network, but comes up against limited diffusion that thwarts the effectiveness of its mechanisms and limits the benefits for producers. In its solidarity consumption dimension, making FT available in mass retail outlets brings it into competition with national or distributor brands that have a more powerful discourse of persuasion, and so it is once again marginalized. Enrollment and mobilization are limited. People’s practices may occasionally respond to interessement processes but without any commitment to lasting and collective action. For almost all our respondents, the consumption of FT products is an individual practice that may even involve reluctance to talk about it with one’s entourage (as expressed by Sophie C.).</p>
<p>The problem of the lack of identification with the group of FT consumers by our respondents can be linked to FT’s communication methods. Wright has analyzed Cafédirect’s advertisement in the UK for its Fair trade coffees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-2051570713487479">Wright, 2004</xref>). This ad focuses both on the producers and on the environment in which they live. Detailed analysis of the texts shows that the way producers are shown in idealized environments contributes to their ‘exoticization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2051570713487479">Audebrand and Iacobus, 2008</xref>). Ultimately, the consumer of FT products is placed at a distance from the ‘Other’, the producers or promoters of FT, and there is no identification or sense of belonging to a possible group.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-2051570713487479">Lachèze (2005)</xref>, FT is a system with multiple points of support, comprising movements or market devices to which it has attached itself in order to survive (the notion of ‘coupling’ taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2051570713487479">Cochoy, 1999</xref>). The first point of support was the critique of the capitalist economy, the second was the market system, and the third sustainable development together with human rights (freedom of association, opposition to child labor). The current point of support is the desire to link FT to committed consumption, and to place the purchase of FT products in the collective of FT networks, by trying to connect consumers to other actors: the producers of the South and FT consumers in the developed world. The discourses we collected indicate that this is not working: there were few links expressed by our respondents between themselves and other FT actors; if the social innovation proposed by FT is the shift from an economy of goods to an economy of connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond, 2008</xref>), it is, however, not perceived as such by ordinary consumers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-2051570713487479">
<title>Managerial implications: Participation strategy and diffusion routes for social innovations</title>
<p>The goal for the proponents of social innovations is to help consumers translate what they offer into a subjective experience situated within a shared social representation that is a source of individual and collective identity, in order for there truly to be individualized collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-2051570713487479">Micheletti et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2051570713487479">Akrich et al. (1988)</xref> proposed linking the success of innovations in the art of interesting as differentiated as possible a set of people, who, to adopt an innovation, will adapt it after evaluating it in terms of their expectations, their interests and the problems they face. ‘We must accept the idea that something is taken up only if it manages to attract an ever increasing number of players’ (1988: 20). The interessement model emphasizes the existence of a whole bundle of links that bind the object to everyone who uses it and highlights the attachment points between the object and the interests it arouses. If its proponents want the FT model to become a real social innovation, it is probably in their interest to make use of mechanisms giving rise to appropriation and social identification rather than focusing only on the conventionally studied obstacles to purchase.</p>
<p>The purpose of social innovation is systemic change that includes a social movement and new forms of thought and action. For social innovations based on new forms of consumption, such change involves thinking and acting differently during often routine activities, especially for food or energy consumption. Consequently, the proponents of a social innovation will have to find new forms of appropriation, starting from users and not just producers. Research in consumer behavior and marketing tools can be used to encourage a change in consumption practices, by no longer focusing on the supply chain but on consumers’ views. In particular it is necessary to act both on existing behavior and on the new behavior that one wants to promote. Behavioral habits are strongly connected to the context in which they occur, which explains why a change of motivation or intention without a change in the associated context will fail to change people’s habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-2051570713487479">Neal et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-2051570713487479">2012</xref>). Thus it is essential to associate the promotion of FT with a new context and to support its consumption, so that it becomes a new habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-2051570713487479">Verplanken and Wood, 2006</xref>) and not merely an occasional act. In concrete terms, an annual communication event such as Fairtrade Fortnight is insufficient. Anchoring the consumption of FT products into out-of-home consumption places for example, can be achieved only through repeated changes of context, with involvement upstream of stakeholders (local councils, school management, etc.) and the introduction of mechanisms to bring about the change (a product range rather than isolated products, clearly showing products and changes in the choices available), as is done, for example, for organic products.</p>
<p>Finally, the promoters of FT should put an end to controversies and find spokespeople to interest consumers and other actors in such a way that they feel concerned about the issues raised by the FT. This is one of the roles of collectives such the Plateforme de Commerce Equitable in France.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-2051570713487479">14</xref></sup> In parallel, it is important to act at the level of communication, so as to strengthen the linkage of consumers with the FT project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-2051570713487479">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the coexistence of different models and logics in the FT sector can be a source of tension both between and within organizations; it is up to the extremely diverse stakeholders to decide to take up the challenge of developing this sector without compromising its ethical criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Beji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-2051570713487479">Huybrechts, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-2051570713487479">Özçaglar-Toulouse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond, 2008</xref>). Our study seems to point to the fact that the problematization of FT as a tool for radical questioning of the rules of international trade is now a handicap to its development beyond the circle of members and activists. Interesting a wider public remains a major challenge for the development of FT as a social innovation, along the same lines as other social innovations that are also likely to impact consumers’ usual practices and discourses (e.g. energy consumption, pollution practices, etc.) and require extensive work to construct a positive consumer identity.</p>

<title>Conclusion, limitations and future research</title>
<p>At a certain point in the history of FT, the decision was made to place FT products in conventional market channels rather than confine them to alternative distribution channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2051570713487479">Béji-Bécheur and Fosse-Gomez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-2051570713487479">Robert-Demontrond, 2008</xref>). How can FT now escape a process that changes its ethical qualities into a product characteristic like any other characteristic and that reduces it to a simple alternative product choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2051570713487479">Hartlieb and Jones 2009</xref>)?</p>
<p>In this article, we wanted to show that beyond individual or product approaches, FT could be seen as a social innovation, requiring appropriation by increasingly numerous consumers. The cafeteria experiment showed that consumers seem interested in FT information and are willing to choose FT products, but the interviews reveal the lack of appropriation and social identification, which leads the respondents to resist FT as an innovation. Like other social innovations brought in by activist movements promoting a change in consumption habits, FT needs to spread via networks if it is to become a consumption movement. These networks must allow consumers to be actors associated with the construction of their meaning. Actors in the industry are aware of the gap between the strong reputation and image of FT and what is seen in the market, the growth of which has not significantly altered FT’s marginal presence. The issue of interesting and enrolling a growing number of consumers as actors in the network is a key issue for the development of the movement. But the strategies of different promoters of FT do not always take account of all the elements contributing to the resistance to FT revealed by the literature and by our empirical study.</p>
<p>Our contribution thus consists of a conceptual renewal of FT, as a process of developing a social innovation, the resistance to the diffusion of which we analyze. The originality of our research lies in the analysis of resistance to this innovation by providing an analytic framework that incorporates both individual obstacles and obstacles linked to resistance to FT as a social innovation. Our empirical study was conducted in a real, non-laboratory situation for making FT-related choices, and was able to connect what was said in the interviews with the respondents’ observed behavior.</p>
<p>The limitations of our study are inherent in the methodologies used, leading to results that cannot be generalized. The quasi-experiment in particular has limitations due to the choice of product (compotes are not typical FT products) and to the possible effects on the respondents’ choices of variables such as variety seeking, competition with other desserts and the type of information provided. Furthermore, in our experiment the price barrier was removed, whereas under real purchase conditions price may be a major impediment. A further experiment that controls these variables and takes account of effects associated with different types of information or advertising would be useful for refining our results. These limitations do not, however, apply to the interviews, which were concerned with the consumption of FT products in general.</p>
<p>Apart from FT, this study helps show the need not only to disrupt old habits but also to support new ones, and to take more account of the social dimensions of consumption. To this end, the concepts of appropriation, social identity and social innovation need to be further explored in future research. In particular it would be interesting to study consumers’ adaptation strategies when faced with a social innovation, similarly to technological innovations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-2051570713487479">Mick and Fournier, 1998</xref>) or the consumption of local products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2051570713487479">Bingen et al., 2011</xref>). New forms of consumption in response to energy, environmental, ethical or social issues are growing, and offer opportunities for future marketing research on social innovation.</p>

<p>The essence of social innovation is based both on the existence of networks and collectives and on the development of the growing distinctiveness of goods, originally the pure effect of market forces (actor differentiation strategies), but which authorizes the ‘construction of subjectivity, in the form of the active and interactive individual attached to products and services which distinguish him and which he distinguishes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2051570713487479">Callon, 2007</xref>: 26).</p>

<p>These authors relate the story of the success of the supermarket cart – deliberately idealized by its inventor S.
