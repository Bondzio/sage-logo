<abstract>
<p>This study assesses the effects of Guided Written Disclosure Protocol on psychological distress in mothers and fathers of off-therapy acute lymphoblastic leukemia children. An experimental group participated in the writing intervention with a control group subject only to test-taking standards. The Symptom Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States were administered at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. Guided Written Disclosure Protocol had significant effects on the progressive reduction of anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, hostility, tension–anxiety, and fatigue–inertia within the experimental group. However, the control group distress levels tended to worsen over time. The mediating role of emotional processing was highlighted.</p>

<title>Parents and the oncological illness of their child</title>
<p>The onset of an illness such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in pediatric oncology is considered a traumatic event for parents accompanying their child’s difficult therapeutic process; a child’s cancer is seen as a “family illness” with consequences that affect all its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312462434">Martino, Freda and Camera, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312462434">Kazak et al., 2005</xref>). The welfare of the child is ensured by the ability of the parents to maintain the stability and cohesion of the family adapting to a changing environment. Therefore, it should be underlined, the importance of involving fathers in child cancer research and in structuring psychological intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312462434">Jones et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Mothers and fathers are characterized by their specific way of coping with their child’s oncological illness, and based on this, they may experience therapies and the gradual return to normal life differently. In general, research agrees that parents experience a variety of emotions, such as shock, disbelief, fear, anxiety, despair, sadness, anger, guilt, loss of control, and posttraumatic stress, as a result of the diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312462434">Jurbergs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312462434">Santacroce, 2002</xref>). Parent’s psychological stress, uncertainty, and loneliness can persist even up to 5 years or more after treatment cessation often resulting in psychopathological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312462434">Jantien Vrijmoet-Wiersma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312462434">Maurice-Stam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312462434">Norberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312462434">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This study focused on the off-therapy ALL phase in children—remission of malignant cells and interruption of radiochemotherapy after nearly 2 years post diagnosis. From an emotional point of view, our field observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312462434">Martino, Freda and Camera, 2010</xref>) suggest that this period corresponds to an extremely vulnerable time within which a progressive return to “normal” family and personal life takes place, where autonomy, privacy, and contact within the family are regained to a degree. The hospital, in the long recovery period, represents a containment for the regressed mother/child dyad. Suddenly, on remission from hospital, the parents feel confused, feel fragile, and lack restraint and solidity that can provide support during still vulnerable time. This causes depression, collapse, and anxiety, very similar to that experienced following the diagnosis. These feelings give rise to unprocessed emotions. Unless they are addressed with appropriate psychological support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312462434">Hobbie et al., 2010</xref>), these feelings may disrupt the path to the future and the quality of life. This phase offers the opportunity to rethink what has happened because concerns over survival and medical routine are reduced.</p>

<title>Narration and trauma: the role of reconstruction of writing</title>
<p>Trauma rips apart the psychic fabric, and the intensity of fear and suffering can compromise the mind’s ability to process thoughts and emotions, now dissociated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312462434">Seligman and Kirmayer, 2008</xref>). Recalling the events, thoughts, and emotions associated with it is a way to reconcile with the trauma by turning off any disturbing feelings connected with it or preventing their onset. The narrative approach helps parents to plan their own future and rebuild their selves and life story by sustaining the processes of semiotic connection and meaning-making of the experience through a reflective space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312462434">Angus and McLeod, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312462434">Freda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312462434">Salvatore and Freda, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312462434">Willig, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In this way, we aimed to offer psychological support, through writing, to parents of children with ALL, in off-therapy, to promote the integration of the traumatic experience by reducing psychological symptoms and dysfunctional mood states connected to it, and to prevent isolation. Research shows the beneficial psychological effects of writing on moods, on negative emotions, quality of life, anxiety, depression, stress, and reduction in the need for medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312462434">Baikie and Wilhelm, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312462434">Harris, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In the literature concerning specific interventions based on writing in pediatric oncology, few studies have dealt with parents of children with cancer. Some emphasize the effectiveness of writing on the psychological distress of cancer patients in both adults and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312462434">Morgan et al., 2008</xref>), and others emphasize the effectiveness of writing on the sense of adaptation to the experience in parents of children with chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312462434">Schwartz and Drotar, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Guided Written Disclosure Protocol</italic> (GDP) is the only device used for writing by parents of children suffering from advanced cancer with results with respect to the reduction of symptoms related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but not to depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312462434">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>). It is used with good clinical success, with the reduction of psychological stress, anxiety, and PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312462434">Duncan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312462434">Duncan and Gidron, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312462434">Gidron et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In addiction, the GDP seemed useful for the parents of children with ALL because it allows one to explore the trauma from multiple perspectives, fostering a sense of coherence with respect to events, making the event manageable within the lives of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312462434">Arden-Close et al., 2005</xref>). The GDP works on the interaction between three different aspects of the processing of the trauma: emotional inhibition, cognitive adaptation, and emotional expression. The GDP allows one to reevaluate the event in a comprehensive way, by implementing good skills for insight and self-regulation, encouraging the identification of functional coping strategies for future life experiences. Recent research shows that the combined effects of writing instructions focusing on emotional expression and cognitive reappraisal were most effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312462434">Lu and Stanton, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We proposed the use of GDP at the beginning of off-therapy phase to support parents emotionally during a vulnerable time and to act as a preventive and self-containment tool. The literature includes several individual variables found in effects of writing intervention, including the mediating role of emotional processing (EP). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312462434">Austenfeld et al. (2006)</xref> showed how high EP/emotional expression moderated the effect of experimental condition on depressive symptoms at 3 months post writing. The participants with high skills of EP reported less depressive symptoms in the writing group on traumatic event. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312462434">Middendorp and Geenen, 2008</xref>) showed that poor cognitive EP may impede the benefit of emotional disclosure interventions.</p>

<title>Objectives and hypotheses</title>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the existence of changes, over time, in test-taking and in the pattern of symptom levels (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and hostility) and dysfunctional mood states (tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility, fatigue–inertia, and confusion–bewilderment),comparing parents who have participated in the writing intervention (experimental group (EG)) with those who were exposed only to the administration of tests (control group (CG)).</p>
<p>The correlations between EP, detected at the beginning of the writing intervention, and scores of the scales of Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) tests, detected at the follow-up of the intervention, were measured to evaluate the strength of the association between the skill of EP and the outcome of the writing intervention. From the literature, we hypothesized that the EG would show, over time, a decrease in a broad spectrum of levels of psychological distress related to the traumatic event of the illness of a child as opposed to the CG, and we assumed that EP could play a mediating role in the writing intervention.</p>

<sec id="section6-1359105312462434">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants included 46 parents, mothers/father, whose children were at the beginning of ALL off-therapy phase. Ten fathers, mean age of 40.6 years (standard deviation (SD) = 5.68), and 13 mothers, mean age of 38.84 years (SD = 5.52), made up the EG of the study. The sample was made up of 10 couples of parents (of the same child) and 3 mothers. Their children were four males, mean age of 4.25 years (SD = .5), and nine females, mean age of 6.77 years (SD = 3.34). The CG participated only in the administration of the test materials on three occasions (baseline (T0), postintervention (T1), and follow-up (T2)), and it was composed of 13 fathers, mean age of 37.2 (SD = 6.89), and 10 mothers, mean age of 40.84 years (SD = 8.34). The sample was made up of 10 couples of parents (of the same child) and 3 mothers. Their children were five males, mean age of 8 years (SD = 2.44), and eight females, mean age of 6.87 (SD = 3.22).</p>

<title>Intervention tool</title>
<sec id="section8-1359105312462434">
<title>GDP</title>
<p>The GDP was structured into three sessions of writing. In the first session, people were asked to describe events as they occurred and evolved over time, in chronological order. This helped parents to look for the causal links among occurrences by helping each individual in cognitive processing of the event and contextualizing it in time. In the second session, participants were invited to write the emotions they felt at the time of the described events. This helped parents to increase their skills of insight. The combined verbal labeling and the development of negative emotions allow a cognitive restructuring of the event by implementing health benefits. Finally, parents were asked to look into the future, noting how they felt today compared to yesterday, the effects that this event had left on them, and how to tackle a difficult experience in their future life (coping). A study demonstrated that a serious illness of a child can promote a personal growth in parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312462434">Hungerbuehler et al., 2011</xref>). So, this session could potentially help them in skills of finding benefits and looking for positive resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312462434">King, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>The POMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312462434">McNair et al., 1971</xref>) is a self-report questionnaire study of specific affective states. The test consists of 58 adjectives that describe six different factors: tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility, vigor–activity, fatigue–inertia, and confusion–bewilderment. The participants have to choose (0 = not at all to 4 = extremely) the intensity with which they were affected by that particular mood last week.</p>
<p>The SQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312462434">Kellner, 1987</xref>) is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 92 items. It contains four factorial scales based on the analysis of the following psychological symptoms: anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and hostility. These scales are the result of eight subscales, four related to symptoms (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and hostility) and four related to the corresponding states of well-being (relaxation, contentment, physical well-being, and good–disposition). It consists of 92 adjectives related to internal states, positive or negative; the participant must answer in terms of true or false.</p>
<p>The EP Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312462434">Baker et al., 2007</xref>) is a self-report scale that identifies the presence of any difficulties and the skill/style of EP. It consists of 45 statements, which describe how the participant may have felt or behaved during the previous week, to which one responds (0 = strongly disagree to 9 = strongly agree). It is made up of eight factors: intrusion, suppression, lack of attunement, lack of control, dissociation, avoidance, discord, and externalization.</p>

<sec id="section10-1359105312462434">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The research-intervention took place at the “Santobono-Pausilipon” Hospital of Naples, the national reference for the treatment and care of children with neoplastic illness. The coconstruction of the research-intervention between Federico II University of Naples and the hospital’s psychology service was created to offer a means of effective support within the off-therapy phase of the illness, which is often difficult to assist in terms of psychological support due to the impossibility of finding spaces and practices of intervention that can support parents during the vulnerable time of remission from the hospital, promoting an integration of the trauma. The hospital’s psychology service has provided its location and facilities for monitoring meetings and taking charge of the parents who, after the writing intervention, wanted to continue with psychological and psychotherapeutic support over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105312462434">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Parents in the EG were identified from the medical reports. The recruitment of parents was carried out through phone call or meeting in a day hospital to explain the whole path of the research-intervention and its aims. The participation was voluntary, providing informed consent and privacy policy approved by the hospital. Because of the small rate of new diagnoses of ALL per year (30–40 new diagnoses per year) and the need to carry out the intervention with parents at the beginning of ALL off-therapy phase, our eligible criteria for participants, the work with parents was carried out during year 2009—to collect EG—and during year 2010—to collect CG.</p>
<p>In accordance with literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312462434">Martino M. L., Freda M. F. and Camera F. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312462434">Duncan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312462434">Jones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312462434">Kazak et al., 2005</xref>), we had proposed that both parents of the child participate, and in more than half cases, both the parents did participate; in any case, we had accepted the participation of only one parent.</p>
<p>The meetings took place within separated, and not joint, work setting (research psychologist and mother or research psychologist and father), in a quiet room of the hospital, to respect the different times of EP and the specific ways of re-experiencing the traumatic event.</p>
<p>Each parent carried out the path with the same psychologist present during each session of writing to reduce the risk that the experience was another “task” which fulfill, ready to explain the aim of the meeting and to support any difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312462434">Nicholls, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Out of a total of 20 couples of parents whose children were diagnosed in the year 2007, 17 parents—7 mothers/10 fathers—declined to participate (lack of time/do not want do it). Out of a total of 15 couples of parents whose children were diagnosed in the year 2008, 7 parents—5 fathers/2 mothers—declined to participate for the same reasons.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>An experimental plan was designed to use a multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical procedure for repeated measures with a two-way mixed factorial design. In particular, there were a series of ANOVA, where the dependent variable was the level of symptoms related to the scales of anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms/hostility of the SQ test and mood states related to the scales of tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility, fatigue–inertia, and /confusion–bewilderment of the POMS test detected at T0–T1–T2.</p>
<p>The factor between the groups is Group (experimental/control). The EP has been included as a covariate. It was performed a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the EP scores, at T0, and the scores of scales of the POMS and SQ test, at T2, for the EG (<italic>n</italic> = 23).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section19-1359105312462434">
<title>Role of EP</title>
<p>At the outset, we consider the effect of the EP covariate, since it is substantially constant for both the SQ scales of the test (anxiety, depression, and hostility) and those of the POMS test (tension–anxiety, depression–dejection, anger–hostility, fatigue–inertia, and confusion–bewilderment).</p>
<p>This proves that the EP plays a nonnegligible discriminating role between the groups, and it helps to explain the differences between groups on average. The EP seems to affect the different performances of the scores reported by parents according to the progression of T0–T1–T2. One exception is that EP is not significant for the somatic symptoms scale only of the SQ test as if to suggest that the EP can only influence psychological aspects but not symptomatic aspects involving interaction between psyche and soma.</p>
<p>Specifically, Pearson’s correlation coefficient shows that the increase of EP levels is correlated to the increase of the scores of the scales of SQ and POMS tests. According to the literature, it means that a poor EP (EP high score) may impede the benefit of GDP (high scores scales SQ and POMS test). In other words, the results suggest that the GDP is effective when the participants show a good/discrete skill of EP (EP low score). These data suggest to target, ab initio, the GDP to the participants who can obtain more benefits and minimize negative effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1359105312462434">
<title>Effectiveness of GDP</title>
<p>In line with the literature supporting the effectiveness of the paradigm of writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1359105312462434">Pennebaker et al., 2010</xref>) starting from the interaction Time × Group, the effectiveness of the GDP is supported for a wide spectrum of psychological symptoms and dysfunctional mood states: anxiety (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 20.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), depression (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 7.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), somatic symptoms (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 7.74, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), hostility (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) =14.01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), tension–anxiety (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 9.82, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and fatigue–inertia (<italic>F</italic>(1, 41) = 4.25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>This approach implements the psychological well-being of parents and advocates a process of integration of the traumatic event. The observation of the trend of average scores related to anxiety, depression, hostility, somatic symptoms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312462434">Table 1</xref>), tension–anxiety, and fatigue–inertia (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312462434">Table 2</xref>) allows us to state that the group that received the writing intervention, over time, showed a progressive reduction in the levels of psychological distress in contrast to the CG. So, when there is an improvement in the levels of psychological distress for the EG, a similar trend was not observed for the CG, which tends to worsen over time (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312462434">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312462434">2</xref>).</p>
<p>This allows us to assert that the mere passage of time and distance from the trauma of diagnosis does not favorably resolve issues of psychological distress if unaccompanied by appropriate psychological support. The ability to benefit from writing intervention, for a parent in distress, confirms the need for adequate support in this specific phase in the course of illness. Moreover, in contrast with research reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312462434">Duncan et al. (2007)</xref>, this study has also shown the effectiveness of GDP on the level of depression that tends to decrease gradually during test-taking.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that this outcome will emerge, within the present study, due to the time passed since the traumatic initial diagnosis and the promising prognosis of the child. Returning home also amplifies the family’s desire to put the pain behind them and invest in the future.</p>
<p>The average results show, in the EG for both tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105312462434">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312462434">2</xref>), how the effects of the writing intervention strengthen over time; therefore, the intervention seems to act as a promoter and activator of psychological development. The GDP, as well as having psychological health benefits, also showed effects on the physical health of the participants such as with somatic symptoms and fatigue–inertia.</p>

<sec id="section21-1359105312462434" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions, limitation, and future implications</title>
<p>The importance of including intervention in the clinical psychology service has proved to be a resource, especially in the final stages of the “writing space” offered, where about four mothers wanted to continue the support and find, during their outpatients’ visits, a space for listening and self-containment. In this sense, the GDP has been configured as an activator of self-awareness and a psychological demand.</p>
<p>In line with critical debate on expressing writing (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312462434">Murray, 2009</xref>), we highlight the significant role of providing an “holding space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312462434">Nicholls, 2009</xref>), in which the parents have been able to construct a self-awareness, and the specific phase, in which the intervention is proposed by placing itself at an appropriate distance between the diagnosis and a progressive return to “normal” life. The research confirms that unless the parents are addressed with appropriate psychological support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312462434">Hobbie, 2010</xref>), their psychological distress tends to worsen over time. In this sense, it has fulfilled a function of prevention, in order to avoid the chronicity of symptoms, which extends its effect throughout the health system in order to limit future cost of expenditure of the health system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, further analyses will be conducted in order to further evaluate the mediating role of EP on benefits of writing. We would propose meetings to explore the durability of benefits to parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312462434">Sloan et al., 2009</xref>). We also propose that further analyses should have a larger sample size, as a small sample size was a limitation of this present study.</p>
