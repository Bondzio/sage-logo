<p><bold>Special Issue: 25 Years Later: The New Europe</bold></p>
<p><bold>Editors: Kornelia Slavova and Barbara Einhorn</bold></p>
<p>What is the ‘New Europe’? Does it describe more accurately the new member states of the EU or has it simply replaced the label the ‘Other Europe’ that used to designate the countries of Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War? Until now, this term has suggested a hierarchy of unequal partners, constructed through binaries such as: ‘East’ and ‘West’; the EU and the ‘others’; the ‘bordering’ or ‘candidate’ countries; the established versus the ‘new’ and somehow – in this perception – ‘unfinished’ democracies; the supposedly successful market economies versus those economies on the periphery – whether that be to the east or to the south – which are perceived as either struggling or as liabilities, as somehow responsible for the crisis in the eurozone. This special issue suggests that the term ‘New Europe’ could signal a context in which we cease to conceptualise Europe as a relationship of masters and subalterns, but rather as a single entity or at least a project of desire for inclusivity, in which all European countries participate on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 the political, economic, and cultural landscapes in both former communist states in Central and Eastern Europe and Europe as a whole have been radically transformed, not least due to the persistent dominance of unhelpful neo-liberal conceptions of the state as problematic, a constraint on enterprise and creativity, while the unfettered market is conceived of as an unmitigated good. This special issue of <italic>The European Journal of Women’s Studies</italic> explores the gendered consequences of the social, political and cultural transformations within the context of the overall crisis currently affecting Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>Over the past 25 years women in both Central and Eastern Europe, and in ‘Western’ (Northern and Southern) Europe, have shown incredible survival skills in times of social instability. However, traditional notions of masculinity and male-dominated economic sectors have also been decimated. Yet while there have been shifts in gender roles and imaginings, they have not substantially altered the imbalances in gender relations as relations of power. Moreover, feminism continues to be met with suspicion and resistance in the former Soviet bloc, while there is a considerable ‘backlash’ against feminist political projects in Western Europe. What have women lost and what have they gained in the last two and a half decades of historic changes? How have notions of masculinity and femininity changed? In what ways has the diminished role of state and public social provision affected cultural and social perceptions, impacted on gender relations at the societal, family and personal level?</p>
<p>We welcome submissions that address, but are not limited to, the following concerns:</p>
<list id="list1-1350506812461979" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- Gender in the New Europe: What structures of inclusion and exclusion do women and men face on local, regional and European levels? What old and new lines of division still demarcate the topographies of Europe and how can they be transgressed?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Becoming European: Issues of European citizenship. Who belongs, who has rights within the EU and other European countries? How are gendered identities re/shaped in the framework of EU shared values, lifestyle(s), legal frameworks and institutions?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Private and Public Reconfigured: How has the relationship between women and the state changed? What about the problem of re-traditionalisation and re-positioning of women in the gender hierarchies of late capitalism?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Lost in ‘transition’ or in post-communist nostalgia? What social and economic anxieties have affected gender relations since 1989? How have poverty, privatisation and rising nationalism affected women?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Europeanisation and migration: Shifting dynamics in the relationship of Central and Eastern to Western, Northern and Southern Europe. The relationship between labour mobility, migration, trafficking in people and seeking asylum.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- European feminism: Feminism from below or from above (the impact of EU integration)? In what ways has the newly emerging feminism in Central and Eastern Europe complicated international feminism(s)? Is organized feminism in Western Europe dead?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We welcome contributions from diverse regions both in and outside Europe, as well as diverse approaches and perspectives such as historical, sociological, anthropological, political as well as literary, media, and film representations. We particularly welcome contributions from/on the countries of Central and South Eastern Europe.</p>
