<p>“The history of state revenue production is the history of the evolution of the state” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414013490668">Levi, 1988</xref>, p. 1). The breakdown of communist rule in East Europe and the Soviet Union provides a unique historical experience through which scholars of taxation can explore how the establishment of modern tax regime went hand in hand with post-communist state building. Gerald Easter’s <italic>Capital, Coercion, and Post-Communist States</italic> provides a skillful study of these dual processes. Built on rich historical evidence, the book answers the following questions by applying the fiscal sociology approach: Why have post-communist states, given their similar set of political and economic institutions at the outset of transition, developed substantial variations in their tax regimes? How do different types of tax regimes produce various forms of revenue bargaining and societal compliance? And how do differences in tax regimes eventually translate into variations in social and political institutions?</p>
<p>Easter compares two post-communist states, Poland and Russia, which represent two contrasting patterns of state building, contractual and predatory, respectively. A contractual state such as Poland puts institutional checks and balances on its political power. The state’s coercive resources were largely depoliticized and subject to civilian political control. Economic resources were transformed into legally protected property. The revenue claims in contractual states were based on consensus and therefore enjoyed more legitimacy. In contrast, a predatory state like Russia evolved with fewer constraints on political power, and political resources were highly concentrated in the hands of strong government executives. Coercion remained subject to politics, and as a result, capital was susceptible to predation. The extraction of revenue in the predatory state was mainly driven by coercion. A puzzle following this dichotomy is why do post-communist states diverge in the process of state building? Centering his analytical lens on taxation, Easter deploys his argument around four interrelated processes that include (a) initial conditions (chapter 2), (b) the politics of revenue bargaining (chapter 3), (c) transitional tax regimes (chapter 4), and (d) economic and institutional outcomes (chapters 5 and 6).</p>
<p>Poland and Russia shared many similarities in their initial conditions. Both countries were communist dictatorships dominated by a command economy system; both relied more on state-owned enterprises for taxes (in comparison with Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD] states which relied more on individual and household taxes); and both faced a fiscal crisis caused by the “twin dilemma” (p. 23) of communist rule—that the authority had to employ a reward-based compliance strategy on one hand, but rested on a command economy incapable of generating growth on the other. There were, however, slight differences between the ways in which the reward-based compliance strategy was carried out. In Poland, rewards (wage raises) were often delivered after collective labor protests, the earliest of which could be traced back to the Pozna worker strikes in 1956. In contrast, the Soviet Union’s ex ante delivery strategy seemed to achieve a greater degree of normative-based compliance. It is apparent that neither country’s strategy was sustainable in the long term without a comparable boost in their revenue sources. When the fiscal crisis eventually broke out in late 1980s, the two countries responded quite differently. Whereas the regime in Poland compromised on limited democratic reform (which later led to a semiopen election) in exchange for a labor truce, the Soviet central government relied more on negotiations with the national republics. These divergent responses, however, all hastened the ultimate demise of communist rule in both countries.</p>
<p>The first wave of tax reform following the transitions was not only aimed at raising sufficient revenue to cover expenses and debts but also at redirecting the state’s fiscal focus from “the point of production to consumption, from corporate to individual taxes payers, from big to small entities, and from closed to open market” (p. 51). Major figures that devised the reforms included Leszek Balcerowicz in Poland and Yegor Gaidar in Russia. These reforms brought different degrees of resistance. In Poland, the <italic>popiwek</italic> (p. 54)—two punitive taxes on state enterprises to discourage public employment—aroused massive labor protests. In Russia, regional leaders, directors of the large corporations, and newly arrived financers also challenged the new tax system on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>Different actors in two counties drove the revenue bargains: self-protecting workers in Poland and self-enriching elites in Russia. Poland’s government was able to increase the share of personal income taxes incrementally by making compromises to the protesting workers and by incorporating them in the policy-making process. Whereas in Russia, the successive revenue negotiations with the regional and corporate elites were largely subject to President Yeltsin’s own political agenda. Easter points out that the first wave of reform was largely a failure in both countries due to a high level of political contestations. The second wave of tax reforms that took place around the early 2000s was more successful as political contestation declined. In Poland, the goal of becoming a European Union member created a temporal alliance between fiscal foes, to eliminate many tax subsidies for the public sector and farmers. In Russia, the emergence of Putin as a strong political leader put an end to elite conflict and enacted a more radical tax reform that introduced the flat-rate personal income tax.</p>
<p>The degree of tax compliance varies according to the means of extraction. In a tax regime characterized by “legalistic consent,” such as in Poland, the cultivation of tax compliance is a nonconfrontational, ever bending, and gradual process. Under Russia’s “bureaucratic coercion” tax regime, tax compliance is mainly induced through the use of coercive threats. The difference in the compliance pattern is evidenced in the fact that the size of Russia’s shadow economy was at least 2 times larger than Poland’s. Russian society, according to the World Value Survey, also expressed greater tolerance to tax evasion than Poland did.</p>
<p>Poland’s consensus-based compliance was more conducive to creating the conditions leading to the expansion of the tax base and the wider spread of wealth. Meanwhile, Russia’s coercion-based compliance limited the state’s revenue base to the narrow resource extraction sector. The different performances by Poland and Russia in two financial crises (1998 and 2008) highlighted the difference in two countries’ fiscal capacities (chapter 5). The political battles over taxation also shaped the formation of their civil societies. The Polish tax system secured the wealth of the elites, facilitated the organization of autonomous civic associations, and also supported the independence of the church. By contrast, the coercion-based tax regime determined that economic elites could not be truly independent from the state, and thus the process of forging a civil society was largely curtailed in Russia.</p>
<p>Easter’s study contributes to the understanding of post-communist state building by challenging the neoliberal view of transitions. The neoliberal paradigm postulates a society constituted of self-interested individuals, with a minimalist utilitarian state, which comprises politically neutral institutions charged with private conflict resolutions and public safety. The unsuccessful application of the neoliberal blueprint in the post-communist world has proved that the paradigm is not flawless. Easter shifts the focus of the debate back to the state, and provides a framework that emphasizes the interactions between capital and coercion. The evolution of tax regimes (and also the state) is a constant battle between the state and social actors over the control of economic and coercive resources. Political trade-offs took place between capital and coercion when social actors were allowed to retain a portion of the revenues claimed by the state in exchange for their support of a particular set of state actors who were competing for control over political power. This is a dynamic framework that explains the changes and variations of tax regimes over time and across places.</p>
<p>Easter’s study is not only theoretically ambitious but also grounded on meticulous historical studies. Tracing back to the early ages of communist rule in Poland and Russia, the book provides evidence to a puzzle that studies narrowly focusing on the post-communist period are unable to answer: Why from the outset of transition has the political process in Poland been characterized by strong mass participation, whereas in Russia the politics has mainly been elite driven? This book suggests that the difference is an historical legacy of the two countries’ accumulative experiences in revenue bargaining between the state and society. The wage bargaining was driven by protesting workers in Poland as early as the 1950s, whereas in the Soviet Union revenue negotiations mainly took place between the state and elites (e.g., regional governor, corporate directors) in the late 1980s. A more ambitious inquiry would look at the factors that led to the variations in fiscal bargaining during the communist era.</p>
