<body>
<p>We are glad for the interest that our paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411912443013">1</xref></sup> has aroused. We especially appreciate the comments, given that their authors are leading scientists in the experimental quantification of interface micromotions between orthopedic hip implants and bone. We believe that our response will clarify some of the issues brought up by them.</p>
<p>By stating, ‘a single LVDT implant–bone relative motion measurement system is mounted transcortically by means of an anchorage set-up; the motion is measured between the pin connected to the stem and the LVDT support attached to the bone surface’, we meant that there is a single LVDT sensor per measurement location. Thus, even though the measurement system used by Monti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912443013">2</xref></sup> consisted of four LVDTs and one extensometer per measurement location, there was only one LVDT measuring shear motion in only one direction at the implant–bone interface. We used the term ‘a single LVDT’ to distinguish from a six LVDT system, as proposed by Berzins et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411912443013">3</xref></sup> to measure all six degrees of freedom of the implant–bone motion at a certain location. We do agree with the authors that the reference to Monti et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912443013">2</xref></sup> stating that the LVDT was attached to the bone surface, was incorrectly used in this phrase. Indeed, in that paper, the frame holding LVDT was connected to the bone close (500 micron) to the stem–bone interface.</p>
<p>The second comment concerned the following abstract phrases: ‘Given that the implant–bone system is not rigid, errors may be introduced. It is not possible to assess the magnitude of these errors with the currently available experimental methods.’ We meant to say that the errors owing to the elastic deformation cannot be corrected easily in an experimental measurement protocol. As Monti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912443013">2</xref></sup> show in their paper, the errors may increase linearly over the bone thickness. However, this relationship was found with a sawbone with rather constant material properties. Furthermore, the paper shows a shear motion of 0.9 micron at the surface and 2.6 micron close to the stem. One could argue that this is just 1.7 microns; one could also argue that there is almost a 300% difference. The effect of bone elastic deformation is likely to vary depending on the measurement location, way of fixation, and loading condition. Therefore, it remains difficult to quantify the effect of the implant–bone system deformation on micromotions around the complete prosthesis simultaneously using available experimental methods. It just illustrates that we should measure motions very, very close to the interface, and both research groups (Bologna and Nijmegen) agree on that.</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that we did not aim at assessing the error of experimental measurements, as stated in the final comment on our paper. Instead, our goal was to show that there are differences in the magnitude of interface micromotions when these are measured between points at the actual interface or between a point at the stem surface and an adjacent bony point in proximity to the interface. The elastic behaviour of the model was verified with deflection measurements, but we agree that this is not a validation of the predictive capacity of micromotions. Thus, the exact values of micromotions found at the implant–bone interface in our study (in fact not matching the results found by Monti et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411912443013">2</xref></sup>), are not of interest; it is the effect of taking measurement points further away from the interface on the quantity of these motions.</p>
<p>The authors of the comments underscore the fact that the errors are generated by elastic deformation when measured under dynamic circumstances. We do agree with this. It means that we should be careful interpreting cyclic motion measurements that are measured at some distance from the interface. The migration (so, not cyclic) values of a stem, relative to bone, are more reliable when they are taken at the same instant of loading (say, at maximal load application, or at minimal load application); in that way the elastic deformation in the system will be similar and errors will remain constant.</p>
<p>We are grateful for being given the opportunity to address the comments on our paper. We want to underline here that we did not state in our paper that all experimental measurement systems are equally burdened by the errors caused by elastic deformation of the implant–bone system. Our goal is to show that the researchers should be aware of unreliable measurements when bony reference points are not very, very close to the implant–bone interface. This is of particular relevance when cyclic motions at the interface are to be quantified.</p>
