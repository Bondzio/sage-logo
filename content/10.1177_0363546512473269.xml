<sec id="section1-0363546512473269">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Recent studies report a relatively high failure rate for tendon-bone healing after rotator cuff repair. Several studies have investigated biologically augmented rotator cuff repair; however, none has shown the application of synovial mesenchymal stem cells for such repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512473269">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To demonstrate whether cells derived from shoulder tissues have mesenchymal stem cell properties and to identify which tissue is the best source of the mesenchymal stem cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512473269">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Controlled laboratory study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512473269">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Forty-two patients with a diagnosed rotator cuff tear preoperatively were enrolled in this study. Human mesenchymal tissues were obtained during arthroscopic surgery for rotator cuff tears from 19 donors who met the inclusion criteria and had investigable amounts of tissue. Colony-forming units, yield obtained, expandability, differentiation potential, epitope profile, and gene expression were compared among the cells from 4 shoulder tissues: synovium of the glenohumeral joint, subacromial bursa, margin of the ruptured supraspinatus tendon, and residual tendon stump on the greater tuberosity (enthesis).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512473269">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The number of live passage 0 cells from whole tissue was significantly higher in cells derived from the subacromial bursa (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Subacromial bursa–derived cells retained their expandability even at passage 10. In adipogenesis experiments, the frequency of Oil Red O–positive colonies was significantly higher for synovium- and subacromial bursa–derived cells than for tendon- and enthesis-derived cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). In studies of osteogenesis, the rate of von Kossa– and alkaline phosphatase–positive colonies was highest in subacromial bursa–derived cells (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The chondrogenic potential was highest in cells derived from the enthesis. For epitope profiling, 11 surface antigens were measured, and most had similar epitope profiles, irrespective of cell source.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512473269">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The findings indicate that the subacromial bursa is a good candidate for the source of mesenchymal stem cells in rotator cuff tears.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0363546512473269">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>Synovial cells from the subacromial bursa in patients with rotator cuff tears are a superior cell source in vitro, suggesting that mesenchymal stem cells from this tissue could be good candidates for biological augmentation of rotator cuff repair.</p>

<body>
<p>A rotator cuff tear is a common cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction, especially in older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0363546512473269">52</xref></sup> Although arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has been widely used to obtain good or excellent results,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512473269">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0363546512473269">49</xref></sup> a relatively higher rate of tendon-bone healing failure has been reported in association with inferior techniques as well as massive tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512473269">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512473269">17</xref></sup> Various biological and pharmacological studies have been reported to suggest methods to improve the rotator cuff healing process after repair. Rodeo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546512473269">39</xref></sup> investigated the use of a mixture of osteoinductive growth factors including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)−2 through 7, transforming growth factor (TGF)−β1 to β3, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to improve the healing of the tendon-bone interface in an in vivo sheep model. Seeherman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546512473269">42</xref></sup> also demonstrated the role of recombinant human BMP-12 in the repair of rotator cuffs in sheep. Ide et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512473269">24</xref></sup> showed that FGF-2 accelerates bone ingrowth at the supraspinatus repair site in a Sprague-Dawley rat model. Bedi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512473269">4</xref></sup> demonstrated that the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases improves rotator cuff repair in a rat model. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methods has not been proved clinically.</p>
<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to improve tendon-bone healing. A previous study using a rat anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction model revealed that MSCs derived from knee synovium accelerated early remodeling of tendon-bone healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512473269">26</xref></sup> Nourissat et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512473269">34</xref></sup> found that MSC injection for a destroyed enthesis of the Achilles tendon led to organ regenerative healing in terms of an organized enthesis with columnar chondrocytes in a rat model. In contrast, an attempt by Gulotta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512473269">20</xref></sup> to demonstrate that MSCs derived from bone marrow augment healing at rotator cuff repair sites in a rat model yielded no significant differences from the control group.</p>
<p>We therefore isolated MSCs obtained from shoulder intra-articular tissue, including the synovium, and analyzed their expandability and multipotent potential. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether cells derived from shoulder tissues have MSC properties and to identify which tissue would be the best source of MSCs in patients who suffered from rotator cuff tears.</p>

<p>The study was approved by the local institutional review board, and all study participants provided informed consent. Forty-two patients with a rotator cuff tear preoperatively were enrolled in this study. We excluded patients with inflammatory diseases, such as infectious arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other systemic collagen diseases. Five patients with a partial rotator cuff tear were also excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473269">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Human subacromial bursa, synovium of the glenohumeral joint, margin of a ruptured supraspinatus tendon, and enthesis of the greater tuberosity of the humerus were obtained during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery under general anesthesia. To minimize variation in sampling, specimens were taken from the same anatomic locations. The subacromial bursa near the site of the torn rotator cuff was harvested with a rongeur under arthroscopic observation. The synovium of the glenohumeral joint was obtained from near the anterior labrum by using the same procedure. The margin of the ruptured supraspinatus tendon was carefully harvested only when necessary. We identified an enthesis as the point of the greater tuberosity where the supraspinatus tendon had attached before injury. The enthesis at the greater tuberosity of the humerus was obtained with a rongeur under arthroscopic observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512473269">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>The subacromial bursa, synovium, supraspinatus tendon, and enthesis of the greater tuberosity samples were digested in 3 mg/mL collagenase from type V (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) in α-modified Eagle’s medium (α-MEM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California) at 37°C. After 2 hours, digested cells were filtered through a 70-μm nylon filter (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), and the remaining tissue was discarded. The numbers of nucleated cells per milligram of a sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512473269">Table 1</xref>. We excluded 12 donors because the number of nucleated cells obtained from each tissue was smaller than 7.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> (tendon: 9 cases; enthesis: 7 cases; and synovium: 3 cases.

<p>The digested nucleated cells were plated at 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>4</sup>, and 10<sup>5</sup> cells per dish (60-cm<sup>2</sup> culture dish, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, New York), with 6 dishes for each cell concentration. Complete culture medium was used (α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum [lot selected for rapid growth of synovial fluid–derived MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546512473269">32</xref></sup>], 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B [all from Invitrogen]). The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% humidified CO<sub>2</sub>. After 3 to 4 days, the medium was changed to remove nonadherent cells, and the adherent cells were then cultured for 14 days as passage 0 without refeeding. Three dishes for each concentration were used for staining with 0.5% crystal violet. The optimal initial cell density was determined by (1) the resultant colony size being unaffected by contact inhibition and (2) a maximum number of colonies being reached (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512473269">Figure 2D</xref>). We then harvested the cells plated at optimal densities from the remaining 3 dishes with Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and determined the number of cells at passage 0. The passage 0 cells were cryopreserved by resuspension at a concentration of less than 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in α-MEM with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 20% fetal bovine serum. One-milliliter aliquots were slowly frozen and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen (passage 0). To expand the cells, we thawed a frozen vial of the cells, plated the cells in 60-cm<sup>2</sup> culture dishes, and incubated them for 4 days in a recovery plate. These cells (passage 1) were used for further analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512473269">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512473269">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> Six donors were excluded because it was impossible to gain a sufficient amount of passage 0 cells (enthesis: 4 cases; tendon: 3 cases.

<p>We finally investigated 14 men and 5 women (age [mean ± standard deviation], 64.0 ± 9.1 years) who had full-thickness rotator cuff tears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473269">Figure 1</xref>). The average size of the rotator cuff tear was 8.6 ± 7.7 cm<sup>2</sup>. According to the Goutallier classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512473269">19</xref></sup> 10 of the 19 tears were class 1, and 9 were class 2.

<title>In Vitro Expandability and Cell Viability Assay</title>
<p>To examine the in vitro expandability of cells from each type of mesenchymal tissue, passage 1 cells were replated at 50 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in 150-cm<sup>2</sup> culture dishes every 14 days until their expansion potential was lost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> To determine the live/dead status of cells in each passage, the cells were stained with use of LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit for mammalian cells (Invitrogen). In addition, a colorimetric assay for cell viability was conducted by plating passage 4 cells at 5000 cells in a 24-well multidish (Nalge Nunc International) and culturing them with 500 μL of complete medium for 7 days. After incubation of the cells, 50 μL of Cell Counting Kit-8 (highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt, WST-8, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well, and the dish was incubated for an additional 1 hour. Cells were counted by using a spectrophotometer multiplate reader at 450 nm (SH1000, Corona Electric, Ibaraki, Japan), and cell viability was evaluated. Cell viability was expressed as a percentage based on the viable cell count of the synovium (100%).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Four-micrometer-thick sections obtained from the tissue specimens were deparaffinized and treated with 20 μg/mL proteinase K (DakoCytomation, Copenhagen, Denmark) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After sections were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), they were placed in methanol containing 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase. The sections were washed again with PBS and treated with blocking reagent (Protein Block Serum-Free, DakoCytomation) at room temperature. Sections were incubated with primary anti-human collagen II antibody (ab34712, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) for 30 minutes and then with anti-human anti-collagen type X antibody (C7974, Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 hours at 4°C. The sections were rinsed again with PBS repeatedly and then incubated with immune peroxidase polymer secondary antibody (Histofine, Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 minutes. Antibodies were visualized by treating the sections with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (ChemMate DAB+ Chromogen, DakoCytomation) for 5 minutes. To assess the specificity of the collagen type X antibody, human chondrosarcoma underwent the same treatment as the sections and served as the positive control. Specificity of the immunoreactivities was confirmed by replacing the primary antibodies with normal rabbit serum.</p>

<title>Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)</title>
<p>Cells that entered adipogenesis or osteogenesis were trypsinized, and total RNA was obtained with use of the RNeasy Mini Plus kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μL reaction by use of High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. To determine mRNA expression levels in each sample, cDNA was assayed by use of 9 TaqMan probes: for adipogenesis, adipsin (complement factor D; Hs00157263_m1), peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPARG; Hs0111 5513_m1), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL; Hs00173425_m1); for calcification, collagen type I α 1 (COL1A1; Hs001 64004_m1), alkaline phosphatase placental type (ALPP; Hs03046558_s1), and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2; Hs00231692_m1); and for chondrogenesis, collagen type II α 1 (COL2A1; Hs00264051_m1), collagen type X α 1 (COL10A1; Hs00166657_m1), and sex determining region Y–box 9 (SOX9; Hs00165814_m1) probes (Applied Biosystems) were used.

<title>Histological Study</title>
<p>Histological study revealed that the synovium as well as subacromial bursa consisted of several layers of synovial cells and subsynovial tissue and that the supraspinatus tendon included collagen fiber covered by synovial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512473269">Figure 2B</xref>). The enthesis consisted of a smaller number of cells compared with the other 3 tissues.

<p>Sample weight obtained and nucleated cell number per milligram of a sample are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512473269">Table 1</xref>. The sample weight of the subacromial bursa was significantly higher than those of the synovium and enthesis (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05, Kruskal-Wallis test, post hoc Steel-Dwass test). The nucleated cell number per milligram of the subacromial bursa was the highest among 4 tissues; however, there were no significant differences among the other 3 tissues.</p>
<p>To gain a maximum number of colonies per amount of nucleated cells, we examined the effect of plating density on nucleated cells from each type of mesenchymal tissue from the 16 donors. For example, from subacromial bursa tissue, large single cell–derived colonies occurred when nucleated cells were plated at 10<sup>3</sup> or 10<sup>4</sup> cells/60-cm<sup>2</sup> dish. If nucleated cells were plated at 10<sup>5</sup> cells/60-cm<sup>2</sup> dish, the colonies were smaller or became indistinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512473269">Figure 2D</xref>) possibly because of contact inhibition. These data indicate that the optimal initial cell density for subacromial bursa tissue is 10<sup>4</sup> cells/60-cm<sup>2</sup> dish. The optimal initial cell density was 10<sup>4</sup>/60-cm<sup>2</sup> dish for all 4 mesenchymal tissues.

<p>In this study, we used patient-matched samples for comparisons because MSCs from different patients have different properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546512473269">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> These 4 tissues were simultaneously digested for 2 hours to control for collagenase cytotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512473269">43</xref></sup> Also, the nucleated cells were plated at a density that precluded interaction between cell colonies, while permitting expansion to occur at a maximum rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512473269">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512473269">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546512473269">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0363546512473269">45</xref></sup> Furthermore, cells were compared at the same passage because the differentiation potential decreases after every passage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512473269">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0363546512473269">44</xref></sup> Our findings were congruent with these studies.</p>
<p>A previous synovial MSC study revealed that the expansion potential of MSCs derived from the knee synovium is retained at later passages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> Similarly, our results showed that the expansion potential of cells derived from the subacromial bursa is retained at later passages than that of cells from the synovium, supraspinatus tendon, or enthesis. The MSCs derived from the subacromial bursa retained their proliferative ability even after passage 10, demonstrating that they have greater expandability than cells from the synovium, supraspinatus tendon, or enthesis.</p>
<p>With respect to differentiation, adipogenic potential was greater for cells derived from the subacromial bursa and synovium than for those from the supraspinatus tendon and enthesis. In addition, the cells derived from the subacromial bursa had significantly greater osteogenic potential than those from the other 3 mesenchymal tissues. Chondrogenic potential was greater in enthesis-derived cells than those from the synovium, subacromial bursa, or supraspinatus tendon. We determined that the differentiation potential of shoulder tissue–derived cells is dissimilar among the 4 tissues studied.</p>
<p>Microarray study yielded further information about differences between the 4 cell sources. <italic>IGF1</italic> is known to be one of the most potent natural activators of the AKT signal pathway, which can promote growth factor–mediated cell proliferation, both directly and indirectly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512473269">15</xref></sup> and bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0363546512473269">51</xref></sup> The higher expression of <italic>IGF1</italic> may link the greater proliferation ability and the osteogenic potential of subacromial bursa–derived cells.</p>
<p>Regarding surface markers, Sakaguchi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> and Segawa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0363546512473269">43</xref></sup> demonstrated that a population of cells derived from a human synovium and bone marrow was negative for CD34 and CD45 and positive for CD90, CD105, CD166, and CD44. Bi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512473269">6</xref></sup> also showed that a population of cells derived from a human hamstring tendon was negative for CD34 and CD45 and positive for CD90 and CD44. On the other hand, a population of circulating osteoblast lineage human cells was positive for CD34.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512473269">14</xref></sup> In our study, each population of cells was negative for CD34, CD45, CD31, CD117, NGFR, and VEGFR2 and positive for CD90, CD105, CD166, CD147, and CD44, confirming that the cells derived from the synovium, subacromial bursa, supraspinatus tendon, and enthesis had characteristics of MSCs and differed from circulating cells.</p>
<p>According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy position statement, the minimal criteria to define MSCs are as follows: (1) adherence to plastic, (2) specific surface antigen expression, and (3) multipotent differentiation potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512473269">12</xref></sup> The cells derived from shoulder tissues seem to meet these criteria. It seems that these cells must be identified as MSCs.</p>
<p>Bi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512473269">6</xref></sup> showed that cells derived from a human hamstring tendon are multipotent and distinct from bone marrow stromal cells. Additionally, Sakaguchi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> demonstrated that MSCs derived from the human synovium of the anterior cruciate ligament in an injured knee joint had greater potential for self-renewal and differentiation than those derived from bone marrow, periosteum, adipose tissue, or muscle. Results of our study indicate that the cells derived from the subacromial bursa and synovium have greater expansion and differentiation potential than those from the supraspinatus tendon. In a histopathological study, degenerative changes, including thinning and disorientation of collagen fibers, and myxoid and hyaline degeneration were observed in the margin of a torn supraspinatus tendon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512473269">22</xref></sup> We conclude that the degenerative change in the injured tendon is attributable to its poor MSC properties, which indicates that it is not a good source of MSCs.</p>
<p>As far as we are concerned, the present study is the first to show that cells derived from the enthesis are inferior to those derived from the subacromial bursa and synovium in terms of expandability, adipogenic potential, and osteogenic potential. Enthesis injuries such as lateral epicondylitis and Achilles tendinopathy are intractable disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512473269">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546512473269">38</xref></sup> which is consistent with our demonstration that enthesis cells are less capable of proliferation. In contrast, cells from the enthesis had greater chondrogenic potential than did the other 3 tissues. The rotator cuff insertion for the humerus has a fibrocartilage column<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512473269">5</xref></sup>; however, rotator cuff repair surgery leads to direct attachment of the tendon to bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512473269">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512473269">34</xref></sup> As Nourissat et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546512473269">34</xref></sup> reported, we believe that tendon-bone healing reconstructing the original enthesis must excel so that there is direct contact of the tendon to bone. Thus, we consider that the chondrogenic potential of MSCs is an important issue for tendon-bone healing. From this aspect, the enthesis seems to be a good candidate for the clinical application of rotator cuff repair surgery. To be practical for regenerative therapy, a cell source must be easy to harvest, and it must be possible to efficiently obtain nucleated cells after digestion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473269">16</xref></sup> In the present study, the subacromial bursa was the easiest tissue to harvest via arthroscopic surgery, and we were able to obtain a larger sample from the subacromial bursa than from the other 3 tissues. On the other hand, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512473269">Figure 1</xref>, we were unable to harvest a sufficient amount of tissue or to gain nucleated cells from the supraspinatus tendon or the enthesis on the greater tuberosity. We excluded 12 cases of insufficient harvest or culture from the supraspinatus tendon and similarly excluded 11 cases from the enthesis. There was a significantly higher rate of failure in collecting MSCs compared with the subacromial bursa (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, Fisher exact test). In addition, after digestion with collagenase, the number of nucleated cells per milligram of tissue was much higher for the subacromial bursa than for other tissues. Further, the yield obtained from the subacromial bursa was the highest among these 4 tissues. These results demonstrate that the subacromial bursa is the superior source of MSCs. However, the chondrogenic potential in subacromial bursa cells was lower than that in enthesis cells. Further studies are warranted to increase the chondrogenic potential of the subacromial bursa to meet the cell source for the enthesis.</p>
<p>The remodeling process of rotator cuff tears remains unknown. It is controversial whether the subacromial bursa should be preserved when an operation for rotator cuff repair is performed. Uhthoff and Sarkar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0363546512473269">50</xref></sup> examined rotator cuff tear specimens and maintained that the main source of the reparative tissue was the wall of the subacromial bursa. Using a rabbit rotator cuff tear model, Hirose et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512473269">23</xref></sup> showed that spontaneous healing of the rotator cuff occurs from the subacromial bursal side rather than the articular side. In addition, our present study demonstrates the greater expandability and multipotency of cells derived from the subacromial bursa. This evidence supports the subacromial bursa playing a very important role in rotator cuff healing. Thus, studies in animal models with rotator cuff tears are clearly necessary to evaluate the biological effect of subacromial bursa–derived cells.</p>
<p>In an attempt to augment tendon-bone healing in a rat rotator cuff repair model, Gulotta et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512473269">20</xref></sup> used bone marrow stromal cells but found they were not effective for healing. However, they later succeeded in demonstrating that adenoviral membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)–transduced bone marrow stromal cells can augment rotator cuff healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512473269">21</xref></sup> Mazzocca et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546512473269">30</xref></sup> performed arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using rapidly isolated bone marrow stromal cells, but no clinical improvement resulted. Recent studies demonstrated that circulating cells in peripheral blood have an osteogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512473269">14</xref></sup> and MSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512473269">10</xref></sup> potential. The origin of these circulating cells is not known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512473269">13</xref></sup> In their cell culture study, Sakaguchi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0363546512473269">41</xref></sup> showed that the synovium was superior as a cell source compared with bone marrow. To our knowledge, there has been no comparison of mesenchymal tissue–derived cells with circulating cells in peripheral blood. At present, synovial tissue appears to be a promising cell source for regenerative therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512473269">16</xref></sup> The present study indicates that the subacromial bursa is an excellent source of MSCs in vitro. Further studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms of biological augmentation for bone-tendon healing in vivo.</p>
<p>Limitations of the present study are as follows. First, this is an in vitro study, and we cannot describe the potential of these MSCs in vivo. Second, patients were older, and no adolescents or younger people were enrolled. Third, the profiles as well as the history of the patients were different in each case. Another limitation is that we did not compare the mesenchymal tissues to bone marrow or peripheral blood.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that human shoulder mesenchymal tissues, especially in the subacromial bursa, have mesenchymal properties. The subacromial bursa appears to be a good candidate for MSCs. Further animal studies are necessary to clarify the effectiveness of these cells in biological augmentation of rotator cuff repair surgery.</p>
