<p>This is a challenging and informative discussion paper that contextualises and debates the use of participatory media in nursing research. It starts by defining what is currently meant by participatory media in what is a fast-evolving and ever-developing field. They point out that the World Wide Web was only defined by Tim Berners-Lee in 1999, so the history of participatory media using Web 2.0 tools is very recent. It is argued that participatory media is just the latest in a distinguished line of mechanisms to promote information sharing and networking amongst academics that has occurred since Erasmus in the 15th century.</p>
<p>It is postulated that networking has furthered the advancement of scholarship in every generation, and those that were most successful used the most up-to-date technologies available to them. It is difficult to assess if other scientific breakthroughs have been lost in time because their discoverers were less adept at dissemination of their findings using the resources available to them.</p>
<p>It is also suggested that participatory media tools have two main functions in nursing research – data collection and dissemination of findings. It is also suggested that nursing has been slow, and even resistive, to the positive benefits that using participatory media can provide.</p>
<p>The paper goes on to explore if the speed of information sharing and dissemination of information using participatory media has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way that nursing research should be conducted. It is argued that it has not been embraced whole-heartedly, and that this has implications across the whole of health and social care. The need for service user involvement at every level of provision is evident in all facets of health and social care and it is argued that a vital instrument in gaining this participation is not being utilised as effectively as it could be.</p>
<p>The paper finally turns its attention to the researcher themselves. It is suggested that most nursing researchers are digital tourists rather than digital natives. Whilst arguing that this distinction is in itself is redundant, the need for a mindset for the researcher to be comfortable with and embrace the opportunities provided by participatory media technologies is recommended. The implications for future research are immediate and challenging. The speed of access and the availability of information mean that research could be outdated before it is published. This might be avoided by the very techniques being put forward in this paper.</p>
<p>It is concluded that the next 10–15 years will see an increase in the chasm between the existing research community and the next generation of researchers. Given the changes in the last 15 years, it would be a brave researcher that predicts what the world will look like in 2025.</p>
