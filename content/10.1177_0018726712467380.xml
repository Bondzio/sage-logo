<abstract>
<p>This article builds on the theorizing of body work through introducing a new concept: ‘maternal body work’. In so doing, it shows how progress towards a feminist politics of motherhood within organizations remains limited. Despite decades of feminist scholarship, dissonances remain between the private worlds of reproduction and public worlds of organization. With regard to this limited progress, the article reveals how, among a sample of 27 mothers (all professionally and managerially employed in the UK), 22 felt marginalized and undervalued at work, experiencing the borders between maternity and organization as unmalleable. By contrast, five women treated borders between reproduction and organization as more fluid than anticipated. Setting a high value on their skills, they developed strategies for parrying unfavourable revisions of their status. The article concludes by considering the potential development of resources for enhancing maternal coping strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research on the treatment of maternity within professional and managerial settings has for over 25 years been prolific across a range of perspectives including psychology, sociology and management (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712467380">Buzzanell and Liu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726712467380">Davidson and Cooper, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726712467380">Lyness <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). Within these rich veins of literature, many avow a feminist orientation and pursue agendas to secure the position of professionally and managerially employed mothers within organizations: what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712467380">Hausman (2004</xref>: 275) terms a ‘feminist politics of motherhood’.</p>
<p>Yet as this article demonstrates, the impact of such feminist politics on the organizational positioning of employed mothers has been limited. Despite a long history of theoretical endeavours, the ‘maternal body’ is still, often, unwelcome within professional and managerial settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>). The term ‘maternal body’ has become accepted parlance within sociological and management studies to describe women’s capacity for reproduction, with a focus on pregnancy and the nurturing of infant children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712467380">Tyler, 2000</xref> on pregnancy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008b</xref> on breastfeeding). Although there are differences between the experiences of pregnant and newly maternal women, especially relating to the transition from pregnancy to motherhood (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008b</xref>), the term maternal body aptly encapsulates those characteristics which link pregnancy and new maternity, such as exhaustion, anxiety and the potential of the maternal body to change shape and produce fluids. It also articulates employers’ discomfort around maternity. Within organizational contexts, mothers are often cast as ‘other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712467380">Young, 2005</xref>). Their position is ‘tenuous’ and may be unfavourably ‘revised’ during pregnancy and new maternity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>: 275; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712467380">Mäkelä, 2009</xref>). Employed mothers’ situation is thus much debated, yet continues to evade resolution.</p>
<p>It could be argued that discussions on the position of maternity within organizations are too well rehearsed for one more view to count. However, I believe this article contributes to debate in two ways. First, it explores whether, and how far, the situation of mothers has changed in the years since important studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis (2004)</xref>. In so doing, through a qualitative study of 27 professionally and managerially employed mothers, the article highlights the emphasis placed on the negotiation of metaphorical borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712467380">Clark, 2000</xref>) between women’s ‘private world … of reproduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>: 240) and the more public contexts of their organizations.</p>
<p>Second, the article extends the theoretical notion ‘body work’ through introducing a new but related concept: ‘maternal body work’, focusing on how professionally employed mothers manage the maternal labour of nurturing pregnancy and infant children, while also undertaking what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling (2008</xref>: 64) terms ‘presentational’ body work on the maternal self in order to comply with workplace norms.</p>
<p>Presently, theorizing on body work examines the labour involved in both the body work of intimate care for the bodies of others (e.g. care work and beauty therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712467380">Wolkowitz, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712467380">Wainwright <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and the body work required to mould individual bodies to comply with social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">2008</xref>). Yet despite these rich studies on body work, the experience of motherhood remains under-theorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726712467380">Wainwright <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). This is because the extant notion ‘body work’ is too broad to capture the intensive body work undertaken by women coping simultaneously with the conflicting demands of maternity (nurturing both the maternal and infant body) and employment (requiring ‘presentational’ body work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2008</xref>: 64). Additionally, the lived experience of maternity requires further reflection because motherhood is shown to remain obfuscated within some ‘malestream’ sociologies of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712467380">Tyler 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This article thus proposes the new concept ‘maternal body work’ for the purpose of illuminating the contrasting types of body work required of ‘good’ mothers (who nurture the maternal body, and infants’ bodies, as defined within health narratives: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Brewis and Warren, 2001</xref>), and ‘good’ employees who are expected to comport their bodies appropriately within professional and managerial contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>). In so doing, the article adopts an interpretive approach in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling’s (2008)</xref> view that bodies, and embodiment, remain contested concepts within the context of personal values and wider social structures (in particular labour markets). The concept maternal body work is framed around socio-cultural, feminist understandings of ‘mutable’ (or unpredictable) reproductive female bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz, 2000</xref>), which are often seen to be out of keeping with norms of professional embodiment at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Revising the place of the maternal body in organizations</title>
<p>More often than not, pregnancy and new maternity mark the point when professionally and managerially employed women find it most difficult to conform to organizational expectations about bodily comportment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). Within managerial and professional life, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712467380">Wolkowitz (2006</xref>: 90) observes, ‘implicit organizational rules concerning the presentation of the body’ are problematic for female workers. Even without the added complication of pregnancy and new motherhood, professionally and managerially employed women may engage in complex forms of body work, moulding their bodies to try and fit in with what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes (2011</xref>: 4) terms ‘prevailing masculine’ cultures (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712467380">Hopfl and Hornby Atkinson, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling (2008</xref>: 65), further observes how such women are under conflicting pressures as they navigate the embodied demands of masculine organizational cultures while also endeavouring to display ‘expected traits of a feminine persona’. Additionally, as women strive to be identified with the ‘symbolic order of professionalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>:11), they feel under pressure to present bodies which appear ‘controlled, self-contained and slender’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>: 12), such outward ‘control of the body’ symbolizing a form of self-regulation which is ‘central to the embodiment of the professional’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-0018726712467380">
<title>Leaky maternal bodies</title>
<p>In contrast to such idealized images of supposedly controlled and slender professional bodies, the maternal body has potential to change shape and to produce bodily fluids. By implication, the moulding of the maternal body to comply with the symbolic order of professionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>) will be very demanding during pregnancy and continue through new maternity, when problems associated with infant care (especially feeding) and sleep deprivation are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2005</xref>). Within socio-cultural feminist theory these changes in the pregnant and newly maternal body are articulated as forms of maternal ‘leakage’. The concept of the maternal body as ‘leaky’ is understood within socio-cultural theory both metaphorically and literally. Metaphorically, pregnant and newly maternal bodies may be assumed by employers to be ‘leaky’: boiling with hormones which threaten to spill over into workplace settings in the form of unpredictable emotional behaviours (as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712467380">Hopfl and Hornby Atkinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). Materially, socio-cultural theory interprets ‘leakage’ in relation to the potential for pregnant/newly maternal bodies literally to alter shape and to produce ‘liquid’ symptoms. Maternal ‘leakage’ – such as bleeding, breast milk, amniotic fluids/breaking waters, vomiting and tears (caused by supposedly unpredictable hormones) – is regarded as inappropriate within workplaces and most mothers feel under pressure to hide this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726712467380">Wolkowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726712467380">Young, 2005</xref>). Such maternal leakage (both literal and metaphorical) may incite fear and disgust among colleagues and sometimes among mothers themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling’s (2008</xref>: 115) related observations about the self-regulation of sick bodies, which may be classified as ‘transgressing’ if they are seen to be ‘out of control’ within public settings).</p>
<p>Such notions of disgust are associated with the theoretical concept of abjection, in which bodily fluids are seen to threaten social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726712467380">Blackman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726712467380">Kristeva, 1982</xref>). Due to its ‘troubling talent for making other bodies’ (Haraway, 1991 cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712467380">Tyler, 2000</xref>; cf. also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726712467380">Battersby, 1998</xref>) the maternal body may be treated as itself abject at work because it transgresses social norms due to its propensity to leak, bringing the private world of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>) into the public setting of organization. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst (2001</xref>: 41) observes: ‘Pregnant women’s body fluids pose a threat to social control and order. [Others] may try to confine the pregnant woman to the private realm because of the threat [posed by] her leaking, seeping body… to a rational [male] public world.’ Pregnant women and new mothers are known to fear being regarded as abject within their workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726712467380">Martin, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). As a result, many strive to evade the stigma of abjection through arduous maternal body work in an attempt to keep maternal leakage secret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712467380">Gatrell 2011a</xref>). Arguably, such efforts are doomed to failure. This is because, as Grosz (1994: 192) points out, the concept of abjection links the lived experience of the body with ‘social and culturally specific meanings of the body’. Thus, even the effective concealment of maternal fluids may fail to assure women’s disassociation from cultural assumptions about the maternal body as disruptive, and unwelcome in public space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, employed mothers remain motivated to blend in with professional norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2011a</xref>), attempting to control and contain their maternal bodies as outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712467380">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>The mutable maternal body</title>
<p>Assumptions about the leaky and abject maternal body relate to employers’ beliefs that leaky, or what Anne Witz describes as ‘mutable’, maternal bodies, correlate closely with lowered intellect. In this view, mothers are defined by their reproductive capacity and located primarily as corporeal (rather than intellectual) beings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz (2000</xref>: 12) has described how the mutability of maternity evokes ‘a sense of woman as saturated by her body and existing only in and through her body’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz (2000</xref>: 12) observes how associations between the ‘mutable’, abject maternal body and corporeality are damaging to employed women because they compromise employers’ perceptions of women’s ‘sociality’, or intellectual competence. ‘Mutable’ maternal bodies are associated unfairly with irrational decision making (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712467380">Annandale and Clark, 1996</xref>) and mothers may be judged as ‘fecund and unreliable … unfit for the cool rationality’ of professional settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726712467380">McDowell, 1997</xref>: 34). Consequently, co-workers may assume that maternal commitment to paid work is lowered (see, for example, studies in organizational psychology by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726712467380">Corse, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726712467380">Gueutal and Taylor, 1991</xref>). Unfavourable views about mothers’ work-orientation are sustained by Hakim’s research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726712467380">2010</xref>) which positions mothers as prioritizing maternity over paid work.</p>
<p>By contrast, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz (2000)</xref>, male workers are seen, within professional and managerial contexts, to exemplify traits of ‘sociality’. Men are valorized for supposedly possessing ‘immutable’ qualities of ‘sociality’ – i.e. consistently rational behaviours and intellectual competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz, 2000</xref>:11). In the context of such assumptions, organizations may position male workers as cerebral beings who are in control of both mind and body (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712467380">Annandale and Clark, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712467380">Hopfl, 2000</xref>). In this view, when professional performance is measured, men are evaluated in terms of intellectual function, not corporeality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712467380">Annandale and Clark, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz, 2000</xref>). In particular, male bodies are regarded as distant from the labour of reproduction. Thus, even when men become fathers, employers may (perhaps wrongly) assume that they are uninvolved in the ‘paternal body work’ of nourishing and caring for dependent bodies of infant children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726712467380">Tracy and Rivera, 2010</xref>). It is important to recognize that such notions of male immutability can be challenging and discomfiting for men who, for various reasons, may feel unable in practice to meet what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712467380">Hausman (2004</xref>: 276) has described as the ‘norms of male embodiment’ at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726712467380">Connell,1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, male bodies are depicted as often exempt from those associations of mutability, corporeality and unreliability which position pregnant and newly maternal bodies as abject within organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712467380">Hausman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726712467380">Hopfl, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz (2000</xref>: 12) states: ‘men have invested themselves with sociality while divesting themselves of their corporeality’. Men are, by implication, more able to blend in with professional norms than women – especially mothers – this amplifying the need for articulating the maternal body work required of women combining pregnancy and new motherhood and employment.</p>

<title>Marginalizing the maternal body in professional and managerial settings</title>
<p>For professionally employed mothers, the consequences of being potentially abject bodies may be the destabilization of their workplace status. As shown below, some pregnant women and new mothers feel compelled to engage in arduous maternal body work as they endeavour to maintain organizational status through minimizing the impact of pregnancy and new maternity on workplace routines. Nevertheless, the ‘private’ demands of maternity may be ‘invoked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>) as justification for marginalizing pregnant and newly maternal employees. The occlusion of such women from sites of influence occurs through a range of actions involving exclusion from decision making processes and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712467380">Blair-Loy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726712467380">Stead and Elliott, 2009</xref>). Sometimes, the manner of excluding pregnant and newly maternal women is explicit (e.g. the banning of breastfeeding MPs from parliament, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712467380">Puwar, 2004</xref>). At other times, ‘revision’ of mothers’ position is more subtle, but equally effective in consigning them to the margins of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726712467380">Mäkelä, 2009</xref>). As a result, the career progress of professionally employed mothers is constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726712467380">Blair Loy, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726712467380">Collinson, 2000</xref>). For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft (1999)</xref>, in her ethnographic study of executive succession, shows how the status of a pregnant company director was ‘revised’ due to colleagues’ assumptions that ‘nurturing’ qualities would replace her ‘tough edge’, and that her work-orientation would be reduced because ‘her attention is diverted by … more family-related concerns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>: 257). Women’s ‘embodied potential for maternity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2008</xref>: 2) may thus render them unwelcome within professional settings where: ‘their ability to procreate, their pregnancy, breastfeeding and childcare are treated as ‘suspect’, stigmatized and used as grounds for control and exclusion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712467380">Acker, 2003</xref>: 56).</p>

<title>Health narratives: Maternal body work, pregnancy and new maternity</title>
<p>While pregnant and newly maternal bodies may be considered a source of abjection at work, contemporary health narratives take a contrasting approach. In health contexts, the maternal body and its protective, nourishing fluids (e.g. amniotic fluid during pregnancy, and breastmilk post-maternity) are valorized as central to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Brewis and Warren (2001)</xref> term the ‘project’ of good mothering. Maternal body work within health narratives takes on a different meaning, privileging the nurture of developing babies in utero, and subsequently the bodies of new infants (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712467380">Table 1</xref>). The need to theorize, through health narratives, the maternal body work required for professionally and managerially employed pregnant and newly maternal women to perceive themselves as good mothers is pressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Brewis and Warren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712467380">Miller, 2005</xref>). This is because health perspectives on caring for the pregnant body, and the bodies of infant children, are central to wider cultural perceptions of how good mothering is defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712467380">Miller, 2005</xref>), and professionally employed women are ‘highly susceptible’ to such perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726712467380">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 1995</xref>: 117).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the level of maternal body work required of women during pregnancy and new maternity has proliferated over the past 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Brewis and Warren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726712467380">Pollock, 1999</xref>). Health obligations demand the maternal body work of: changing lifestyle and diet; attending clinics; and complying with ante-natal screening regimes (including invasive tests such as amniocentesis, which is uncomfortable and carries a risk of miscarriage). As illustrated in the excerpt below it is anticipated that mothers should prioritize maternal body work from the moment of conception, for life. This is in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Brewis and Warren’s (2001)</xref> observations about preserving human life through maternal assiduousness:<disp-quote>
<p>When you’re pregnant, you spend nine months worrying about eating the right things, avoiding potential health hazards to your unborn child. But what pregnancy books <italic>don’t</italic> point out is that pregnancy only lasts nine months. Then there is the rest of your life. You [are] responsible for your child from Delivery Day [onwards] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726712467380">Brown, 2010</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0018726712467380">Table 1</xref>, individual mothers are expected to cherish the pregnant body by getting plenty of rest, then to prioritize the maternal body work of breastfeeding exclusively for six months (using no formula milk or solid food) and, after weaning, to continue breastfeeding until babies are aged two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2007</xref>). Breastfeeding is time-consuming and requires skill and endurance. It is presented on the US Government website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726712467380">Women’s health.gov, 2010</xref>) as a non-negotiable aspect of maternal body work which benefits not just babies, but ‘the nation overall’. This requirement for mothers to breastfeed is argued on the basis of maternal responsibilities to employers and the US economy, the health of the population, and sustainability of the environment. Guidelines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0018726712467380">Table 2</xref>) indicate an expectation that women should foreground the maternal body work of breastfeeding above all else, though little advice is offered on how employed women should manage this liquid, mutable process for up to two years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712467380">Boswell-Penc and Boyer, 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>The contrasting nature of the maternal body work required of a professional employee who comports herself appropriately, and a supposedly good mother who cherishes the maternal fluids produced for protecting and nourishing her infant, suggests that pregnancy and new maternity must be challenging for professionally and managerially employed women. In the following qualitative study this article highlights the emphasis placed among mothers on the negotiation of metaphorical borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726712467380">Clark, 2000</xref>) between the ‘private world … of reproduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft,1999</xref>:240) and the more public contexts of their organizations.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>This article interrogates how 27 professionally and managerially employed pregnant and newly maternal women interpreted and negotiated the borders between the private world of reproduction and the more public context of their workplaces. It continues the author’s quest to pursue what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726712467380">Hausman (2004</xref>: 275) terms the ‘feminist politics of motherhood’, in which the position of pregnant and newly maternal workers would cease to be unfavourably revised on maternity. In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz (2000)</xref>, the study treats maternal bodies as sites of negotiation which are defined through social and cultural attitudes and practices. In the context of maternal bodies as culturally defined, and in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726712467380">Annandale and Clark (1996)</xref>, the study acknowledges the benefits of a post-structural approach in contesting workplace norms where mothers are commonly associated with corporeality, mutability, leakage and abjection but rarely with sociality, rationality and intellect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712467380">Hopfl and Hornby-Atkinson, 2000</xref>). At the same time, the study acknowledges tensions between sometimes abstract post-structural theoretical notions of maternal bodies as culturally defined, and women’s everyday experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726712467380">Mullin, 2005</xref>). In analysing empirical data it acknowledges maternal bodies as material, inhabited and sometimes tired and unwell.</p>
<sec id="section8-0018726712467380">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The qualitative empirical material considered below was guided by an exploratory research question: ‘How is being pregnant and/or newly maternal at work experienced, perceived and managed by professionally and/or managerially employed women?’ Interviews were undertaken with 27 women from within 23 UK organizations. Twenty-six were conducted face-to-face and one on the phone (due to the imminent arrival of the participant’s first child). Participants were all drawn from the UK, employed in managerial and/or professional roles, and ranged in age from 29 to 48 years, with a mean age of 39. Criteria for inclusion were based on the demographic evidence that professionally employed mothers qualified to degree level within the UK are more likely to maintain continuous employment than other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2005</xref>). Participants were included if they were qualified to first degree level or above; if they self-identified as pregnant and/or mothers, and if they were employed in a professional role.</p>
<p>In line with methods used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis (2004)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes (2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712467380">Pullen and Simpson (2009)</xref>, mothers were recruited through snowballing, beginning with five women, each of whom ‘spread the word’ to personal and work-related contacts who met the criteria. In addition two women, one of whom travelled 200 miles to be interviewed, contacted me having attended a presentation about my research area, and volunteered to take part. In all cases, interviewees were invited to choose the location of the interviews, which took place across the UK (in their homes, my home and my office). No interviewee chose to be interviewed in her own office, this relating to concerns about anonymity. In the sample, 25 interviewees had one child or more and five self-identified as pregnant. Of those interviewed, 24 indicated that they were in heterosexual relationships, one in a lesbian partnership. One woman self-identified as British Indian, two as White British and one North American. Others did not indicate their ethnicity and appeared to be White British. In order to protect anonymity, specificity about mothers’ line of work, numbers of children and gender of children is avoided.

<p>Interview questions were broad and underpinned by literatures discussed above that indicate the complexities of combining paid work with nurturing pregnant bodies and/or the bodies of dependent infants in the context of health advice. The overarching questions were based around the issues: ‘How do women interpret and negotiate the position of their maternal bodies at work? How do they mediate between health advice on good mothering and what do they perceive to be the embodied requirements within their professional settings?’ As a researcher, I focused on what participants had to say, conducting interviews rather than a conversation. Interviewees were invited to ask me questions about the research or my own situation, but few did. Looking at the transcripts, it is interesting to note how little I spoke other than to outline the overarching research questions, and to ask prompt questions such as ‘Tell me about your experiences of being pregnant at work’, ‘What was it like when you returned to work after maternity leave?’ and ‘Can you give me an example of this?’.</p>
<p>Although I am familiar with literatures on maternal employment, interviews were conducted using an inductive method from an interpretivist position, i.e. attempting as far as possible to understand participants’ experiences from their perspectives. The reason for this inductive/interpretivist approach was because, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726712467380">Hamilton (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726712467380">Pullen and Simpson (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis (2004)</xref>, the research was constructed as socially situated. Interviews were approached as contingent on particular situations on the basis that each respondent’s views on pregnancy and new motherhood may be shaped by differing experiences (e.g. the well-being or ill health experienced by participants and their infants).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0018726712467380">
<title>Analysing data and establishing the new concept ‘maternal body work’</title>
<p>A second reason for the adoption of an interpretive approach was the desire to collect and analyse data using fresh eyes – attempting to assimilate participants’ perceptions without making assumptions about key themes based on previous research, but allowing these to emerge and drawing upon participants’ accounts of the main issues. The challenge of attaining some distance from the data was assisted in the manner of analysis. Data were recorded and transcribed (totalling 1364 typed pages). To begin with, I entered all data into ‘w.matrix’, a software package which analyses key words and themes in relation to physiological and social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726712467380">Rayson, 2008</xref>) i.e. thematizing words such as ‘body’ and ‘anxiety’ within lists and word clouds. This approach produced new findings regarding women’s negotiation between the public settings of their workplace and the more private world of reproduction and motherhood. Following this computerized analysis, themes were explored manually, drawing upon transcripts and original recordings to allow mothers’ narratives to come to the fore. Manual analysis was important because, while computer aided analysis is helpful in identifying prominent themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726712467380">Crang, 1997</xref>) the use of manual analysis enabled closeness to detail within individual narratives, which could concurrently be ‘understood in relation to a larger whole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726712467380">Holloway and Jefferson, 2000</xref>: 68–69). Within the study, the interpretation of women’s narratives relates to the manner in which respondents make sense of their own experiences, as in the approach taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726712467380">Brown <italic>et al</italic>. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726712467380">Miller (2005)</xref>. In the findings reported below, attempts are not made to ‘represent’ the voice of every participant or, indeed, of all professionally employed mothers. Rather, narratives have been chosen to illustrate how the over-arching theme of maternal body work pervaded all aspects of mothers’ experience of being pregnant and newly maternal at work.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-0018726712467380">
<title>Maternal body work: Negotiating borders, self-regulation and maternal stoicism</title>
<p>Three key themes emerged as prominent within the narratives, each of which highlighted the complexities of negotiating two potentially competing discourses of the good mother (as defined within health narratives) and of the good professional (as defined within the aforementioned ‘symbolic order of professionalism’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>:11). These key themes comprised: <italic>negotiating borders</italic> between private worlds of good mothering and public organizational settings; <italic>self-regulation</italic> (required to contain leakage/mutability and to avoid being positioned as abject at work); and <italic>maternal stoicism</italic>. The themes all shared a common emphasis on embodied labour undertaken by women attempting to negotiate between these competing discourses. This over-arching narrative of embodied labour suggested the need for a new theoretical concept to articulating these embodied, maternal narratives. I propose the concept <italic>‘maternal body work’</italic>, which provides the core theme of this research.</p>
<p>Within their narratives, all women reflected on the managing of ‘good’ motherhood, according to health narratives, within their professional contexts. All demonstrated their perception that metaphorical borders existed between the private world of reproduction and their professional worlds, especially in relation to maternal leakage. All engaged in varied but intensive maternal body work as they sought to meet both professional and maternal requirements. Not one person reported receiving any formal support from her organization regarding the return from maternity leave but, as academic Jane described ‘everything is down to you: <italic>you</italic> manage it’. Among the research sample, 22 mothers experienced borders between reproduction and organization as unmalleable and difficult to negotiate. By contrast, five women treated these borders as more fluid than previously recorded (including by the present author) in order to parry unfavourable revisions of their workplace status.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0018726712467380">
<title>Good mothering and health narratives</title>
<p>In relation to maternal and infant health, all women gave examples of undertaking forms of maternal body work in order to comply with narratives of good mothering such as attending (sometimes invasive) antenatal and infant health screening (e.g. amniocentesis), changing their diet, giving up alcohol and cigarettes, and breastfeeding – in some cases for up to two years. Where women recounted having ‘failed’ to achieve particular targets, they expressed guilt. Senior manager Nita (private sector) related to her perception of good motherhood her inability to give up smoking (partly because this alleviated symptoms of morning sickness):<disp-quote>
<p>I had to smoke in secret. I felt so guilty, it’s not what good mothers do: good mothers don’t smoke because it’s bad for the baby. I still feel terrible; I tried and tried to give up but every so often I had to give in and have one, I felt so tired and so sick.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst engaging in the maternal body work necessary for compliance with health narratives, all participants demonstrated awareness of expectations that they should comport their bodies in keeping with the maintenance of a professional appearance at work so as to avoid being ‘marked out as diverging from the normative standard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712467380">Lewis and Simpson 2011</xref>:146). In addition, all women acknowledged how the maternal body work required to present their bodies in accordance with professional workplace ideals of ‘sociality’ and ‘immutability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz, 2000</xref>; cf also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>) could be at variance with health advice on good mothering, in which the mutability of the maternal body is valorized and the maternal body work of nurturing the pregnant and infant body (often involving forms of leakage) prioritized. Participants acknowledged that differing imperatives between private worlds of reproduction and more public workplace contexts required contrasting forms of maternal body work if appropriate standards in both were to be met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0018726712467380">
<title>Negotiating borders between private worlds of reproduction and public worlds of work</title>
<p>In 22 cases, mothers appeared torn between prioritizing the body work of good mothering according to health narratives, and a desire to conform to the norms of professional comportment at work (with which pregnancy and lactation sit uncomfortably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712467380">b</xref>). All reported seeking to control the mutability of their maternal bodies in accordance with professional norms of bodily comportment (as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2008</xref>). The maternal body work undertaken by these 22 women involved forms of stoicism and self-regulation and was intensified by vigilant attempts to maintain separately the borders between maternity and professional arenas regardless of health status. As scientist Ellie described:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt dreadful from the start; badly sick and I was worried about miscarrying … But I didn’t tell anybody at work … I don’t know if that is normal but … but I kept it separate, kept it to myself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among the 22 women who sought to maintain the borders between reproduction and paid work, the motivation for so doing appeared two-fold. Partly, attempts to prevent maternal leakage across the borders of organization occurred in response to mothers’ fears that pregnant and lactating maternal bodies may be treated as a site of disgust and abjection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726712467380">Acker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). University employee Eve, who had her first baby in her early twenties, recalled feeling abject and embarrassed about her mutable pregnant body within a workplace with a strong intellectual focus, where colleagues were older and nobody else was pregnant. Eve’s experience is symbolic of Witz’s contention that mothers may be evaluated in terms of the corporeality and the mutability of their maternal bodies, as opposed to intellectual competencies. Eve’s colleagues regarded her pregnancy as a sign of lowered work-commitment and ‘punished’ Eve for having ‘thrown away’ her chances. Eve:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt stigmatized by my line manager … she went insane at me. She was <italic>disgusted</italic> and shouting at me. ‘You are the reason why women shouldn’t get [opportunities]’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given colleagues’ response to her pregnancy (and reminiscent of research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726712467380">Tyler, 2000</xref>), Eve felt increasingly abject as she grew in size:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt really anxious and ashamed of my body, of the visibility of that. I really stood out and then towards the end you know, being the heavily pregnant body in that space was really embarrassing, <italic>really</italic> shameful. It was increasingly difficult to be in the workplace because, you know, I was pregnant obviously.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Eve, and in keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis’s (2004)</xref> study, many women reported embarrassment about being pregnant at work. To be fair, two women saw advantages in pregnancy, which they felt excused them having to control their body weight in the sense recorded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes (2011)</xref>. Public sector manager Anne recounted: ‘I have always struggled with my weight so at that point when I could say “well I am pregnant not fat”, that took the pressure off a bit.’ Many women, however, felt compelled to engage in the body work of regulating and controlling their mutable, growing pregnant bodies: a challenge which was difficult in summer. Senior manager Carina (public sector) recalls investing time trying to clothe her pregnant body so as to regulate its increasing size:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt <italic>so</italic> self-conscious about my pregnant body because by the time I got large it was … a hot summer…where I was getting large. I do remember clothes being a big issue for me. I didn’t … this will sound a bit pathetic but I did feel when you are pregnant … I felt <italic>disempowered</italic> being large and pregnant. It was like <italic>pointing</italic> to my femaleness.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Carina’s self-consciousness is reminiscent of observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726712467380">Lewis and Simpson (2011</xref>:146) that women’s ‘different embodiments of femininity’ are constrained by fear of ‘marginalization and ridicule’ if they disrupt borders between home and work roles.</p>
<sec id="section13-0018726712467380">
<title>Self-regulation – the maternal body work of avoiding abjection</title>
<p>After maternity leave, fear of being treated as a site of abjection continued to influence the behaviour of 22 respondents as they struggled, in various ways, to regulate mutability and corporeality, keeping maternity separate from professional and managerial workplace settings in a bid to avoid abjection. Eve, quoted above, recalled how she was keen to breastfeed but:<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t want to bring the baby on to the [workplace site] because I felt – well, it would be like wearing a badge of shame.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to anxieties about becoming a source of abjection and disgust, women’s desire to regulate maternity also emanated from fears that their workplace position may be unfavourably revised due to pregnancy and/or new maternity. Such fears are unsurprising, given the research evidence on how maternity impedes career progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726712467380">Buzzanell and Liu, 2007</xref>). Twenty-two women worried that they would be classified as intellectually compromised and less work-oriented than previously if their pregnancy/new maternity appeared to disrupt workplace patterns. Scientist Gina articulated fears that, as it grew ‘larger’, her mutable pregnant body might ‘freak out’ colleagues and might compromise her ability to ‘move around quickly’. Gina engaged in the maternal body work of refusing to pace herself at work, pouring all her energy into maintaining the physical agility she was used to achieving ‘normally’. As a consequence, Gina arrived home ‘exhausted’:<disp-quote>
<p>… lying down on the sofa or going to bed. …when not at work I was horizontal all the time. … I did make up for it by going to bed so I got enough rest.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This strategy was manageable during Gina’s first pregnancy but more difficult once she had another child to care for. Gina continued this way of working on return from maternity leave, despite exhaustion due to breastfeeding her infant during the night.</p>

<sec id="section14-0018726712467380">
<title>The maternal body work of stoicism</title>
<p>In attempts to avoid marginalization, 22 women engaged in the maternal body work of stoicism: ‘working through’ periods of ill health without complaint during pregnancy and new maternity. The practice of stoicism (especially when unwell) has previously been observed among pregnant women and defined as ‘pregnant presenteeism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2011b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726712467380">Warren and Brewis, 2004</xref>). However, there remain uncertainties regarding why some mothers continue stoically ‘working through’ ill health. Reflecting on reasons for their stoical approach to paid work, mothers in this study cited their wish to maintain separation between the borders of the ‘private’ world of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>) and their workplaces. They feared that if leakage occurred between these borders, colleagues would become focused on the corporeality and mutability of their maternal bodies, causing their intellectual capital, or ‘sociality’ to diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726712467380">Witz, 2000</xref>). Mothers’ desire to avoid marginalization induced them to ‘work through’ tiredness and ill health in an attempt to associate themselves with the traits of immutability, sociality and intellect. Communications officer Annika stoically kept private the maternal body work of undergoing amniocentesis (checking for chromosomal abnormalities) and subsequent enforced bed-rest:<disp-quote>
<p>I had this horrible test where they stick a needle in your womb and draw out a large amount of amniotic fluid. I didn’t realize it would be quite so awful. I had to lie still for a day and a half which I am no good at, then wait two weeks for the results. I felt very stressed as it puts the baby at risk … this dreadful test and a lot of cramping.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At work, Annika continued to emphasize her intellectual capability and professional appearance. She contained the stressful maternal body work of undergoing amniocentesis within the borders of the private world of reproduction. Annika stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I hadn’t even mentioned this pregnancy or the test at work. I didn’t tell anyone, they thought I was on a shopping break which is kind of funny really … So I was trying to act normal you know, doing a great job, <italic>better</italic> than normal and looking good. You are expected to look good and I was really having to work at hiding the stress of waiting … While all the time looking good, like cramming my feet into these high boots and performing to a top standard, when I felt like crap.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, senior manager Patsy who was physically ‘sick several times a day for over four months’, continued stoically at work ‘as normal’ throughout. When recounting her decision not to take sick leave, Pasty recalled the irony of being asked for sympathy by a male colleague who had been away from work with gastric flu:<disp-quote>
<p>This man had had gastric flu and he is not a whinger … But I must admit, when he came in and said to me: ‘I have been sick for five days’, my first reaction was wanting to say to him: What, only five days? Well, lucky you!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the event, Patsy refrained from making this remark: ‘I ended up, I just said “Oh, poor you!” ’ When asked why she offered sympathy to her sick colleague Patsy replied:<disp-quote>
<p>I have tried to analyse why I did that. I suppose … he was very ill. But then during pregnancy I also felt very ill. But you shouldn’t take time off work if you are feeling sick due to pregnancy, you should just get on with it and work through it – especially if you want to keep your place, you know. I <italic>really</italic> don’t want to be sidelined.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patsy undertook the maternal body work of stoicism, ‘working through’ her ill health and morning sickness in a desire to avoid being ‘sidelined’. She managed her morning sickness as discreetly as possible, hiding this form of maternal ‘leakage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">2008</xref>) so that she could present herself as intellectually in control of her mutable pregnant body.</p>

<sec id="section15-0018726712467380">
<title>Breastfeeding</title>
<p>The issue of breastfeeding was significant in women’s desire to prioritize the maternal body work of nurturing new infants in accordance with health imperatives. All women reported striving to engage in the maternal body work of breastfeeding, acknowledging the valorization of this form of maternal liquid within health advice. Some referred to it as ‘satisfying’ and important for ‘bonding’ with infants. However, at variance with health narratives which present breastfeeding as a natural element of mothering, over two thirds of mothers described breastfeeding as variously ‘difficult,’ ‘painful’ and ‘exhausting’, with some women rapidly switching to infant formula. This finding is in keeping with research which defines the maternal body work of breastfeeding as time-consuming and draining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712467380">Bailey and Pain, 2001</xref>). Of women who continued beyond two or three weeks (with the exception of Cath below), some mothers gave up breastfeeding because they could not envisage keeping separate the borders between public reproductive and private workplace imperatives due to fears of leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726712467380">Bailey and Pain, 2001</xref>). Some women reported feeling ‘ready’ to give up, others found it difficult; for example, hospital doctor Megan ‘wept at the thought of him being fed formula by someone else, not me’.</p>
<p>However, six mothers reported self-regulating their maternal bodies so that their breasts produced milk supplies only in the late evening before babies’ last feed. The maternal body work of prioritizing breastfeeding while concurrently keeping this ‘leaky’ project well away from workplaces is under-reported within the wealth of literature on breastfeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726712467380">Gatrell, 2007</xref>). However, while some mothers (e.g. those in Warren and Brewis’ 2004 study) may be unaware of this option, it appears to be a shared ‘secret’ among some employed mothers who seek to prolong breastfeeding but fear being regarded as socially abject at work due to leakage of milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">2008</xref>). Hospital-based scientist Cath explained how self-regulating the flow of breast milk facilitated her desire to continue breastfeeding in accordance with health advice on good mothering while keeping the (literal) fluidity of the maternal body well away from her workplace:<disp-quote>
<p>I managed to do this thing of just breastfeeding at night and first thing in the morning. And in between [baby] had formula milk. I didn’t feel I could express milk at work. I was <italic>not</italic> going to put my expressed milk in the communal fridge … And nobody asked me ‘would I like a fridge…?’ and my colleagues are men, so I couldn’t say anything. So I just did this extraordinary thing that women do: where your body regulates itself and produces milk only when you need it and absolutely <italic>not</italic> during the working day.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The regulating of Cath’s body so that it produced milk to order required stoicism and determination to discipline the maternal body to her requirements:<disp-quote>
<p>At the beginning you have these two mounds that are so painful and so awful … but in the end you can regulate; control it. You grit your teeth till your body just does it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite such efforts to regulate their bodies and to contain maternal leakage in order to avoid the stigma of abjection, many mothers reported instances where the maternal body work of prioritizing pregnancy/new maternity spilled across workplace borders. In keeping with observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft (1999)</xref> Gatrell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726712467380">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726712467380">b</xref>), and Haynes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726712467380">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726712467380">b</xref>), mothers’ efforts to safeguard intellectual status by erasing the corporeality of maternity from workplace space through self-regulation were thus compromised. Participants reported incidents where the mutable maternal body leaked (sometimes literally) into professional contexts because women failed to regulate and control the maternal body work of pregnancy and breastfeeding. For example, while breastfeeding accountant Louise sat a three hour exam, her desire to appear intellectually and physically in control of her mutable, lactating body was thwarted by the literal leakage of breast milk:<disp-quote>
<p>I was determined to sit the exam and it never occurred to me to ask for special circumstances; this is the hallowed halls of my professional institute. So I didn’t tell anyone, I just did it. I did sit the exam. And it was just awful. I don’t know how I passed it. My breasts were leaking, they leaked badly… I had breast pads on but my shirt became soaked with milk. I had to leave, to go to the toilet in the middle of the exam and change because I was just drenched with milk.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section16-0018726712467380">
<title>Workplace revising of mothers’ position</title>
<p>Despite the maternal body work invested by Louise and others in trying to regulate leakage so as to maintain separation between the borders of reproduction and paid work, most of these women found their organizational position was to some extent unfavourably ‘revised’ during pregnancy and maternity leave. Mothers’ access to sites of influence and decision-making processes within their workplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft, 1999</xref>) was diminished and the tasks to which they were assigned during pregnancy and after maternity leave involved increased operational duties, with less strategic content.</p>
<p>Sometimes, ‘revision’ of women’s position at work was explicit. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726712467380">Puwar’s (2004)</xref> examples, it appeared that maternal bodies both pre and post birth were a source of abjection, with colleagues purposefully excluding the private world of reproduction from public sites of influence. Five women (in the fields of medicine, accountancy, science, higher education and private sector management) reported being expelled from their offices into areas symbolizing a downshift in status, one for example ‘from the main office’ into a ‘sort of corridor’ another ‘out of my private office to a shared space away from our unit, sharing with a student’. Scientist May recalled how ‘it’s an emotional time anyway when you leave your new baby and come back to work, so to find everything gone from my office was just dreadful’.</p>
<p>Revision of mothers’ place at work also took more subtle but equally damaging forms, such as exclusion from strategic decisions into which they might have expected to have an input. Mothers stated variously: ‘They took away all my client-facing work and sidelined me’ (accountant Louise); ‘I was taken off all the exciting projects’ (engineer Molly); ‘Previously everything was shared [but] they made decisions while I was on maternity leave which they knew I would be against’ (senior manager Elise). Senior manager Claire’s belongings were removed from her office without consultation during her maternity leave:<disp-quote>
<p>I felt bewildered, undervalued and not clear whether I still had a role or not. I [felt I] couldn’t make a fuss, so I didn’t. I … put up with it. I was completely demoralized and the confidence was knocked out of me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Claire and other women whose position was unfavourably ‘revised’ felt disempowered and under-valued, in the sense described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0018726712467380">Hopfl and Hornby Atkinson (2000)</xref>.</p>

<title>Maternal revision and ‘control’ of reproductive/workplace borders</title>
<p>In contrast to the experiences of 22 women who felt demoralized and disempowered following revision of their workplace position, five mothers found ways of revising their own position at work in a manner which enabled them to remain less isolated from sites of influence and decision making. Each of these women had more than one child, all emphasized a desire to take better ‘control’ of her situation than on previous occasions and each had a high sense of her own value to her organization. This group retained their status by re-interpreting the borders between work and family and integrating <italic>within their workplace activities</italic> the ‘private’ maternal body work of pregnancy/new maternity. Rather than engaging in the maternal body work of trying to contain and conceal the mutability of their maternal bodies, these women manoeuvred themselves into workplace positions where they maintained status while continuing to prioritize maternal body work in accordance with health advice. This was achieved partly because each of these five invested time strategically establishing herself as expert within a niche area where her skills were of value and difficult to replicate. Three women in particular revised the borders between paid work and reproduction by arranging important meetings within their homes which, in effect, became sites of influence and decision making. Thus Pamela, a senior lawyer with two children, gained a partnership at work by:<disp-quote>
<p>. . . being very strategic. I developed this unique knowledge about a lucrative area … compensation stuff. I did this very quietly and over a long time so no one realized. When I asked to go part-time and the line manager said ‘no’ [but]… The managing partner stepped in and said ‘what do you want?’ So now I work three days in the office and one day at home. If one of the partners needs something they come to me at home and if there are kids around, well, they accept it. They know I make them a lot of money. And no one else really ‘gets’ my area even though we are a big group.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, finance director Liz proactively integrated the borders between her ‘private’ world of reproduction and her workplace role. Having established intellectual command of key financial questions to which only she had answers, Liz invited senior colleagues into her home during four months maternity leave, engaging in the maternal body work of feeding and nurturing her new baby while dealing with high level organization issues:<disp-quote>
<p>There were things that only I knew about. So the MD came over [to my house] and sat with the baby and I was … occasionally nipping upstairs to breastfeed and we got through the figures. The HR manager and the finance manager would both come over to talk about [problems] and one of the other finance director guys … he came over and I gave him guidance how to deal with [certain problems]. So (I took) responsibility for these work issues and I made sure I was available.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In revising the borders between the private world of reproduction and the more public boundaries of her workplace, Liz felt she had demonstrated that the maternal body work required to nurture small children did not alter her work-orientation or her intellectual competencies. After four months maternity leave, Liz maintained her access to sites of influence and decision making. She is now the finance director in a major public institution.</p>
<p>Similarly, Kitty works in human resource development (private sector) and, following her first pregnancy which she ‘kept hidden’ for seventeen weeks, she reported ‘wanting to be in control second time around’. Within her organization Kitty had built a strong relationship with long standing (and lucrative) clients who avowed strong loyalties to her personally. She negotiated a situation where she left the employment of the company but was ‘bought back as a private contractor’ to continue working with these clients. Kitty also addressed her fear of abjection differently during her second pregnancy through a more open strategy, addressing the boundaries between the private world of reproduction and the public world of work:<disp-quote>
<p>I am helping colleagues and clients to deal with the elephant in the room: the fact that there is a pregnant woman in front of them. I am taking a risk by bringing pregnancy and birth into the work environment. By raising it I am acknowledging that it might have a bad effect or could upset people. But I think getting it into the open, then dealing with people’s response is better than hiding it – that way I am more in control.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beth, a senior midwife, established herself in a new public health role, promoting breastfeeding in her region. This revision of her workplace position afforded her the capacity to engage in strategic and professional development and also legitimated her ability to breastfeed her children during the working day. As Beth recounts:<disp-quote>
<p>[baby] stayed with me right through, I used to take her a lot to meetings and she used to come to the hospital quite a lot … if she made a noise I used to feed her … (and occasionally) she threw up which was an absolute nightmare but … I was really lucky a lot of the time because I kept her with me. Due to my role, no one said anything.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It could be assumed that Beth would have found this option easy to access due to the nature of her job. However she had worked hard to negotiate the role partly because, interestingly, she had found things difficult following the birth of her first child while working as a midwife on a hospital ward. At that time, Beth had to ‘write a letter to say I was coming back breastfeeding’ and her mother was obliged to meet her in the car park with the baby, as there were no private facilities for breastfeeding or expressing milk in her hospital setting.</p>
<p>The five women who reported blurring/crossing the boundaries between the private world of reproduction and paid work prioritized personal contact as in Caren’s case below:<disp-quote>
<p>I was ill at the end of my pregnancy but I kept in touch. Face-to-face contact was important. I was huge and self conscious but …. My research associate, he was… kind of fascinated … so we talked a bit about it. Once we had got over the embarrassment it was fine. I felt less like an alien (and) I could reassure him that pregnancy made me a mother but the research mattered and my brain still worked – they all needed me to get the project done and I didn’t let them forget that.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the possibilities of remote working on offer, this emphasis on face-to-face communication is perhaps surprising. However Caren, principal investigator on a research project, saw such personal contact as key to maintaining her position at work.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In articulating the maternal tensions of negotiating borders between private and public worlds of reproduction and work, this article proposes a new theoretical concept – ‘maternal body work’. In so doing, it responds to calls by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">Longhurst (2008)</xref> for reflection on the complexities of body work undertaken by employed mothers, who are faced with conflicting sets of social expectations (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2008</xref>). The article extends theorizing on body work by making explicit two contrasting forms of maternal body work undertaken by professionally employed pregnant/newly maternal women, specifically:</p>
<list id="list1-0018726712467380" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Maternal body work concerning good mothering according to health narratives, which requires prioritization of mutability and maternal fluids in order to nurture the pregnant body and, subsequently, the bodies of dependent infants</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Maternal body work concerning maternal obligations to conform to embodied norms within professional and managerial workplaces, keeping maternal leakage secret, i.e. negotiating borders between motherhood and work, self-regulation, and stoicism.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the incompatibility of these contrasting forms of maternal body work, the study has shown how 22 women found it difficult to prevent leakage between the borders of reproduction and work. While mothers were on some occasions able to control mutable symptoms of maternity such as sickness and exhaustion, the maternal body work of containing leakage and mutability was not sustainable and did not prevent the unfavourable revision of mothers’ workplace position. Despite mothers’ best endeavours, and well over a decade after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726712467380">Ashcraft’s (1999</xref>: 275) study it appears that still, for some women ‘little has changed: the conflict between “public” and “private” mothering remains’ in place.</p>
<p>However, the articulating of maternal body work in its contrasting forms distinguishes this article from previous studies. First, it highlights problems experienced by mothers regarding expectations that they should keep separate from workplace environments the extensive labour of good mothering as defined within health narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726712467380">1</xref></sup> Second, it extends knowledge on maternity and work through the discovery that five mothers made strategic decisions to integrate the borders between their workplaces and the private world of reproduction. These five mothers all had at least one child and desired to ‘take control’ of a situation which they had found unsatisfactory the first time around. They resisted being marginalized, associated with lowered work-orientation, and excluded from sites of decision making using two strategies. First, they set a value on their own skills and accumulated specialist knowledge which they knew would be esteemed by employers. Second, each blended the borders between the maternal body work of reproduction and paid work by inviting colleagues into their homes and re-focusing their jobs, enabling them to maintain greater ‘control’ regarding their workplace position.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726712467380">2</xref></sup> The strategies of integrating borders between reproduction and work shows a departure from previous studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2001</xref>) in which mothers engaged in stoicism – prioritizing the maternal body work of concealing and containing leakage both during pregnancy and post maternity, in order to survive at work.</p>
<p>In this study, among all 27 interviewees (regardless of whether they used strategies of stoicism or integration to negotiate the borders between workplace and reproduction), not one reported receiving pro-active support from her organization regarding the management of career alongside pregnancy and new maternity. Conversely, it was left to mothers themselves to negotiate their position. In an ideal world, the protecting of mothers’ position should be an organizational priority. However, in the context of organizational failures to support mothers effectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726712467380">Longhurst, 2008</xref>), alternative strategies may be required. Given the long history of dissonance between the narratives of good mother and good employee, the likelihood of finding a single solution for eliminating such dissonance seems unrealistic. Furthermore, the notion of concluding on a managerial note a discussion which is intended as critical and analytical could be seen as inappropriate. Yet the alternative – reflecting on the tensions and pressures imposed on professionally employed mothers, while avoiding questions about how such tensions may be eased – feels equally uncomfortable. Thus, some recommendations for future research and practice are offered below.</p>
<p>Possibly, if mothers were better supported in developing personal strategies for negotiating boundaries between reproduction and organization, their capacity to parry unfavourable revisions of workplace position might be augmented. Such support may be very important for first time mothers, who appear unprepared for the impact of maternity on status. It would be important to establish, via theoretically driven research, what resources would be most effective in enhancing maternal ability to resist marginalization. One such enhancement could involve the expansion of internet support, given how many pregnant women/new mothers already draw upon the internet for advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726712467380">Lagan <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Another could be the introduction, within more organizations, of maternity coaching, which is shown to assist mothers in maintaining workplace status following maternity leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726712467380">Bussell, 2008</xref>). Undoubtedly, such ideas would require further exploration. For example, the above proposals could be seen as problematic because they reproduce the situation described earlier by Jane, in which responsibility for managing maternity and career continues to rest with individuals, leaving mothers (as opposed to organizations) to wrestle with the challenge of conforming to the masculine ‘demands of corporate culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726712467380">Shilling, 2008</xref>: 65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726712467380">Haynes, 2011</xref>) while also prioritizing the project of maternity. Furthermore, there are issues of access – for example, maternity coaching is less likely to be offered to low-paid workers such as child-carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726712467380">Boswell-Penc and Boyer, 2007</xref>) than to professional women.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as noted at the start of this article, feminist theorists have waited in vain for organizations to be pro-active in securing mothers’ position. Perhaps further research, which investigates some pragmatic alternatives for preserving mothers’ status, could offer a more acceptable alternative than the commonly used strategy of maternal stoicism. And perhaps, if organizations were under greater obligation to recognize and value mothers’ contribution at work, a small step might be taken towards achieving a feminist politics of motherhood.</p>

<p>It is acknowledged that there might be dangers inherent in such integration of maternal body work if, for example, women were to feel pressured into foregrounding paid work when unwell or due to give birth (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726712467380">Martin’s [1990]</xref> case of a woman who organizes her caesarean section to fit around work timetables).</p>

<p>Caroline J Gatrell is Senior Lecturer at Lancaster University Management School, UK, where she is also Director of Doctoral Programmes. Caroline’s research centres on sociologies of health, work and family. Caroline’s primary research interests focus on how the reproductive labour of parenting interconnects with the productive labour of employment. From a sociological perspective she explores how working parents (both mothers and fathers) manage their health, their work–life balance, and the health and nutrition of babies and infant children. Caroline’s work has been published in journals including: <italic>Social Science and Medicine, International Journal of Management Reviews, International Journal of Human Resource Management</italic> and <italic>Gender, Work and Organization</italic>. She currently serves on the editorial boards of <italic>International Journal of Management Reviews</italic> and <italic>British Journal of Management</italic>.
