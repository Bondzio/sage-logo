<p>This book makes a significant contribution to criminology and, more specifically, to the field of probation practice. The book merges academic theory and the practice of ‘offender management’ reflecting the background of the author, Anne Robinson, who worked as a probation officer and youth justice manager before joining Sheffield Hallam University, where she teaches professional development courses and pursues research in resettlement and offender accommodation. The book is divided into three parts, each of which has numerous sub-sections that are clearly introduced and concluded in order to assist the reader to navigate the volume.</p>
<p>Part One, which is entitled ‘Offender Management: Key Considerations’, has four sub-sections which look at key ‘management’ issues such as structure, partnership and inter-agency working. Often considered to be rather dry topics, the author provides sufficient detail to provide the reader with a thorough overview of the issues and identifies a list of further reading that will prove useful for new criminology students and practitioners alike. The ‘partnership and inter-agency working’ section (pp. 35–49) is particularly interesting and examines numerous examples of partnerships ranging from schemes such as the Prolific and Other Priority Offender programmes – where the basis of the programme is inter-agency work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473225411435618b">Millie and Erol, 2006</xref>) – to youth offending teams (YOTs).</p>
<p>Part Two is important in terms of the overall aims of the book as it looks at key law and policy areas that affect all aspects of ‘offender management’. Topics such as human rights, safeguarding children, and equalities are covered as well as separate sections devoted to court procedures, community sentencing and custodial sentencing. Each section is well thought out with the author using diagrams and tables where possible to illustrate processes. For example, the court system in England and Wales is represented using a flow chart (p. 144) that makes a rather complicated system easy to digest and understand. Similarly, models of engagement with offenders are presented in matrix form (p. 163) accessibly presenting a large amount of essential information. The language style, whilst academically sound, is not exclusive thus allowing practitioners to use the book to full benefit. Out of the eight sub-sections in Part Two, the most interesting and perhaps often neglected by academics is that of ‘engagement and enforcement’. With reference to the previous chapters on community and custodial sentencing, this sub-section looks at how legislation such as the Criminal Justice Act 1991 provides the procedures of enforcement, with the author successfully giving practitioners the relevant information that they need in order to practice. However the chapter also provides academics with an interesting debate over the use of concepts such as discretion and compliance. The discussion surrounding discretion is particularly insightful, as it is often only associated with police work not that of offender managers in probation and youth justice contexts. The author offers a list of potential points where professional discretion and judgement have important parts to play, ranging from increasing minimum contact to advising the court on breach procedures (p. 200). The list is thought-provoking and offers a clear chronological point-by-point list of all the potential times an ‘offender manager’ may be faced with a discretionary decision during the course of a court sentence.</p>
<p>The final part is focused on key areas of practice, containing six sub-sections which look at the management of specific categories of offender ranging from young offenders to sex offenders. Significantly there is a sub-section dedicated to working with victims, a traditionally neglected area of both academic research and offender management practice (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473225411435618b">Crawford and Enterkin, 2001</xref>). It covers policy developments in work with victims and the implications that changes such as the introduction of restorative justice have had for ‘offender management’ practice. As the author herself recognizes, ‘knowledge and understanding of these frameworks is important to develop not just as a practitioner but as a critically reflective practitioner’ (p. vii). The author encourages practitioners through the language and style of the book to do what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473225411435618b">Thompson and Thompson (2008</xref>: 27) say is ‘characterised by questioning and not taking things for granted- especially social arrangements that are based on inequality and disadvantage’.</p>
<p>Overall, the book is a welcome addition to both the academic fields of criminology and penology as well as the realm of professional practice. It is well intended and ultimately achieves its aim of ‘influencing interventions in a positive rather than a punitive direction’ – a very timely notion given the current policy and political climate in the UK.</p>
