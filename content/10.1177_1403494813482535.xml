<title>Background</title>
<p>Lack of social network and social support are great public health concerns as these are important and well-established risk factors for morbidity and mortality in general populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813482535">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813482535">2</xref>]. In persons with chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and cancer, good social relations are associated with better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813482535">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813482535">4</xref>]. Among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, strong social networks and good social support are associated with fewer psychosocial problems and better diabetes self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813482535">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813482535"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813482535">7</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, only a Finnish study from 1996 has compared persons with type 2 diabetes to a general population in terms of social relations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813482535">8</xref>]. The study showed that persons with type 2 diabetes had poorer social relations. However, it is uncertain whether this can be found in a Danish context, and whether the study is applicable in 2010, the year in which our data were collected, as the diabetes prevalence in Denmark has more than doubled since 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813482535">9</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social relations, such as living without a partner, contact with a social network, and expected social support from the network, differed between persons with type 2 diabetes and the general population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813482535" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>In 2010, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in three populations. The first survey was conducted among persons with type 2 diabetes from a diabetes specialist clinic in the Copenhagen area of Denmark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813482535">10</xref>]. Patients from specialist clinics are characterized by long disease duration, high complication rates and insulin dependence. A letter containing information about the survey and a web address for the online questionnaire was sent to 2045 persons with type 2 diabetes. Two reminders were mailed; the second included a paper version of the questionnaire. When the data collection ended after 6 weeks, 1084 persons (55%) had answered the questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813482535">10</xref>]. The web panel survey consisted of 1491 persons who completed an online questionnaire after self-reporting a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813482535">7</xref>]. The web panel was drawn from a market research web panel consisting of 150,000 Danes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.userneeds.dk">http://www.userneeds.dk</ext-link>), who are regular citizens who can register and participate in various online surveys. The web population was better educated, younger and had shorter diabetes-duration than persons with type 2 diabetes from the specialist clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813482535">7</xref>]. The third population derives from the 2010 Danish Health and Morbidity Survey of the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813482535">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813482535">12</xref>]. A letter invited individuals either to complete a web questionnaire or to fill out the enclosed paper questionnaire. Furthermore, individuals received two postal reminders. In all, 25,000 persons received the survey questionnaire, out of which 15,165 (61%) completed it.</p>
<p>We assessed structural and functional aspects of social relations. Social structure was measured as living without a partner and contact with family and friends and function was measured as whether persons could count on help from others in case of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813482535">13</xref>]. For both aspects of social relations, we used standard questions from the Danish Health and Morbidity Surveys conducted at the National Institute of Public Health. Using multivariate logistic regression models, we examined differences in social relations. In stepwise fashion, analyses were adjusted for age, gender, educational level, BMI and smoking and remaining social relations variables. Information about BMI, smoking and educational level was self-reported. Data were analysed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Compared with the general population, persons with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be male, older, better educated and have a high BMI. Furthermore, they were less likely to smoke, less likely to have contact with family and less certain that they could count on help from others in case of illness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813482535">Table I</xref>). Compared to respondents, non-respondents in the clinic population were more likely to be older and female and have a higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and longer disease duration. Compared to respondents, non-respondents in the general population were more likely to be male, younger, unmarried and a member of an ethnic minority. We were unable to identify non-respondents in the web panel population.</p>

<p>With respect to social support and compared to the general population, both populations with type 2 diabetes reported being less certain they could count on help from others in case of illness. However, for the clinic population, this difference was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494813482535">Table II</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494813482535" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings suggest that, compared to the general population, persons with type 2 diabetes have poorer social relations, particularly in terms of living without a partner and contact with family. Persons of the web population were less likely to feel certain of counting on help from others, even after adjustment for network contacts and living without a partner.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study are the inclusion of two large diabetes populations spanning disease severity, including individuals with long disease duration and several complications as well as newly diagnosed patients and a web panel including, primarily, persons with less severe diabetes. A limitation is that the web panel is likely to represent a selected group, as the survey only included members of a market research panel with access to the Internet. Finally, the questions assessing smoking and cohabitation differed slightly across populations; we expect this minimally affected the results.</p>
<p>Studies report slight but still significant poorer quality of life and well-being in persons with type 2 diabetes, compared to a control group or general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813482535">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813482535">15</xref>]. Among older persons, the network size of those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes was similar to that of persons without chronic disease, but those with diabetes received less social support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813482535">16</xref>]. The Finnish study from 1996 showed that persons with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be single, meet less often with friends and less often get adequate social support, compared with a general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813482535">8</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of very few that sheds light on differences in social relations between persons with type 2 diabetes and the general population. Our findings may be generalizable to other Western countries; however, generalizability may vary with, for example, diabetes prevalence, access to health care and patient support initiatives.</p>
<p>Compared to the general population, persons with type 2 diabetes had particularly poor contact with family. This contrasts with other research documenting that illness specifically limits relationships with friends and acquaintances rather than intimate relationships with partners and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494813482535">16</xref>]. The fact that the web population reported receiving poor social support and that this association was not influenced notably by quantity of contact with the social network indicates the importance of establishing supporting networks or strengthening the network’s abilities to provide social support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1403494813482535" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found that persons with type 2 diabetes more often live without a partner, have poorer contact with their social network, and expect less social support from their network than is the case for the general population. Given the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, our findings have public health-implications to promoting and supporting establishment of social relations in persons with type 2 diabetes and thereby enhance self-management and well-being, and possibly reduce morbidity and mortality. Further research is required to more fully understand social relations of persons with type 2 diabetes, including exploring causal relationships between social support and disease and developing and testing interventions that provide alternative support or establish and strengthen social networks.</p>
