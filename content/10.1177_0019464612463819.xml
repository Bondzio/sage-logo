<p><italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic>, ‘part epic, part romance’, is a metaphor of tragic love. It is embedded in many histories, stories and performances. It has nurtured literary traditions and imagination. It continues to have an enduring resonance in both the Punjabs overlooking borders and fences. <italic>HirRanjha</italic> belongs to the <italic>qissa</italic>(story) genre, which was widely appropriated by different audiences in the colonial period. In 1849, Ganesh Das attached the story of <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic> to the narrative of <italic>Char Bagh-i Punjab</italic>. In 1940, Udham Singh, the revolutionary nationalist, took an oath on Waris Shah’s rendition of <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic>. Amrita Pritam invoked <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic> in her celebrated poem, ‘To Waris Shah’, at the time of Partition. Farina Mir’s pioneering work introduces us to these multiple meanings, readings and renditions of the Punjabi <italic>qissa</italic> in the nineteenth and early twentieth century.</p>
<p>Mir lays bare the language policy under colonial rule, when Urdu not only became an officially patronized language, but was also chosen by the litterateurs. Some interesting local cultural histories were produced, including the <italic>Tarikh</italic> literature of different cities and regions in Punjab. Mir probes how and why the British favoured Urdu over Punjabi. Part of the explanation lies in the colonial equation of Punjabi with the language of Sikhs and the official anxiety about Sikh political claims. Moreover, Punjabi, for these officials, was not even a language, but ‘merely a patois of the Urdu’. She reveals that officials in Punjab insisted that Urdu was the language of elites, and its promotion was a way to protect elite interests as well as their own.</p>
<p>The entangled story of Urdu and Punjabi is one of the key themes in this interesting and detailed work. Urdu as an official provincial and vernacular language became the language of record in courts, local administration, and education, and Punjabi was marginal to official discourse. Mir’s nuanced study maintains that despite colonial efforts, Punjabi didn’t disappear. A British divisional commissioner’s prophecy in 1863, ‘The Punjabee [language] itself is dying out’, turned hollow as Punjabi language and literature were alive and kicking in the colonial period.</p>
<p>However, it appears to me that Punjabi got increasingly sanitized in colonial times. For instance, one finds that the influences of <italic>riti</italic> (Hindi mannerist) poetry on Waris Shah’s <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic> (1766) were excised and expletives were removed by none other than Charles Frederick Usborne, perhaps the first colonial officer to translate <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic> into English. Also, I understand it was under colonial rule that the Punjabi <italic>qissa’s</italic> intimate relationship with <italic>rekhti</italic>(Urdu poetic genre in feminine language) and <italic>riti</italic> poetry turned fragile. Mir, however, does not engage with such excisions and ruptures in Punjabi narratives in the colonial context. Instead, she points to the resilience of the <italic>qissa</italic> tradition, the continuity between pre-colonial and colonial <italic>qissa</italic> production.</p>
<p> In an innovative analysis, Mir calls the <italic>qissa</italic> tradition the foundation of ‘Punjabi literary formation’, and reveals the religious, class, caste, and gender heterogeneity of this unique formation. The ‘affective attachments’ along with a host of devotional practices, social relations, vocations, and commerce helped in preserving the <italic>qissa</italic> tradition in the colonial period. Composers, performers, readers and listeners nurtured it. Mir discusses the content of Punjabi <italic>qisse</italic>, particularly its key themes as: <italic>zat</italic> (caste or kinship group), the significance of locality, the conduct of women, and the performance of piety. She underscores the different renditions of a single narrative, <italic>Hir-Ranjha.Hir-Ranjha</italic> texts, argues Mir, mark <italic>zat</italic> as a critical constituent of self and community, not religious community. Their representation of women defies the prevailing conservative reformist discourses. These texts emphasise the local at the expense of the nation and even the region and express the accommodative aspects of religious identity and shared piety. Further, Mir unfolds the complex relationship between print and the colonial state, in the light of <italic>qisse</italic> being among the most popular publications. The printing press must have triggered issues of censorship and politics to the fore. Another important facet of the <italic>qisse</italic> was the intertwining of print with oral performance.</p>
<p>Through a study of vernacular culture, this book reveals the ambiguities and limits of the colonial project, a point that could be further developed into a more complex understanding of the colonial power. At another level, the notion of love, marriage and intimacy needs to be critically examined, and here Anshu Malhotra’s interesting work comes to my mind which strives to disturb an unproblematic understanding of women’s agency, choice and identity in colonial north India. Interestingly, Mir regards <italic>Hir-Ranjha</italic> texts as subversive in their presentation of ‘alternative models of womanhood’. But, I am compelled to ask: What are the limits of such subversion? Is Hir’s character able to effectively disturb the prescribed gendered and religious norms? Or is her voice of dissent somewhat lost in the chorus and fog of tragic love, popular entertainment and fascination? However, Mir does offer a multilayered understanding of female agency and opens up the subtle world of women’s experience and identity in colonial Punjab. A passing thought—Punjab’s present record of ‘honour-killing’ and patriarchal violence is a living testimony to the intensification of subordination of female subjects. Sadly, Hir’s so-called transgression and subversion does not seem to have any transformative effect on the collective Punjabi consciousness in contemporary times.</p>
<p><italic>The Social Space of Language</italic> takes us to the cultural formations away from the limits of religious identities and nationalist politics, and in contrast to ‘communalism’ and communalist interpretation in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century north India, the staple of modern historiography. Mir’s book resonates well with other new writings, which have been exploring different kinds of alternative sources and narratives to rewrite the social history of north India. Let me mention at least two works on colonial Punjab: my own, <italic>Forming an Identity: A Social History of the Jats</italic> (1999) looked at <italic>qaumi</italic> (communitarian)narratives and popular culture that helped shape a local caste, community and peasant identity, while Anshu Malhotra’s work (2002) critically explored <italic>jhagrras</italic>(quarrel-narratives) and <italic>qissas</italic> via an interplay of gender, caste and religious identities. In this light, Farina Mir’s work is of immense significance in understanding the complex cultural history of colonial Punjab. It makes us rethink the history of Partition and late colonial India. Books like the <italic>Social Space of Language</italic> push the boundaries and frames of history-writing and historical imagination.</p>
