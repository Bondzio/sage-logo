<p>In the business world, the prime mover of business, unlike in the past, happens to be providing sound organisational structure, business policy framework—supported by good governance, concerns for human development and the society at large, ecology, energy and environmental security to achieve long-term sustainability. Similarly, human development index is also increasingly seen to be receiving more universal attention and acceptability over Global Competitive Index—even in a hypercompetitive business scenario, for achieving a balanced and sustained economic growth rhythm. To add a fillip to this, addressing the concerns over Employment and Social Justice aspects are also seemingly spearheading the ‘Inclusive Growth’ landscapes universally. In fine, these are the shape of things that have made deep inroads, impacting, especially the developed as well as emerging economy.</p>
<p>In our third issue of the journal—an article on ‘Inflation–Unemployment Trade-off: Evidence from Bangladesh Economy’, authored by Haider and Dutta, studies inflation dynamics as well as the relationship between unemployment and inflation in Bangladesh during the period: 1987–2009, with the help of Phillips curve hypothesis testing. The study results reveal that inflation lag, which is positively associated with inflation, strongly explains the current inflation dynamics. The other influencing factors, such as unemployment gap and change in exchange rate, are negatively correlated, and change in international price of crude oil is positively correlated with inflation.</p>
<p>Arora and Marwaha have made an exploratory attempt to analyse investment pattern of individual stock investors of Punjab. To study the investment pattern, the preferences for various financial products, factors influencing such preferences, time spent on monitoring investments and the sources of information, etc., are taken into consideration. Their findings should be helpful for financial service providers in understanding the investment preferences of the individual stock investors and tracking the factors that influence individual investors to invest. Similarly, Manikandan et al. examined the relationship between bank credit and industrial production in India using time-series data for 18 years. The study employs Granger Causality test in Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model to examine the direction of causality between bank credit deployment and industrial production. The main contribution of the study is that it has opened up avenues for further research on finding causality of relationship between various categories of financial system and relevant components contributing to economic growth adopting VAR framework.</p>
<p>Tripathi and Jain examine the short-term return effect (in domestic market) of international listing of stocks by six pharmaceutical and chemical companies in India, using conventional event study methodology. Contrary to the results of the previous studies, which have shown substantially lower post-listing returns for the internationally listed stocks, the authors found no substantial difference in pre- and post-listing returns of sample stocks found in the domestic market.</p>
<p>Purohit and Khanna have analysed the important determinants of capital structure in Indian manufacturing industries in India in the last decade. In this regard, researchers have given their perspective in the form of theories, since Modigliani and Miller’s famous propositions on the capital structure, to test the ground realities of capital market imperfections such as taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs and information asymmetries. To bring more clarity on it, this research attempts to test the important determinants of the capital structure of companies.</p>
<p>The Fractal Dimension Index (FDI) is a specialised tool that applies the principles of chaos theory and fractals. With FDI, one can determine the persistence or anti-persistence of any equity or commodity. Using these statistical techniques, data from Indian Mutual Funds and Indian Stock Markets are analysed by Priyadarshini and Babu for finding the most persistent of the financial series and the long-term memory content of these series.</p>
<p>Deo and Shah’s article on ‘Scaling Properties of Systematic Risk: A New Evidence from Wavelet Analysis’ applies to the multi-scale beta estimation approach based on wavelet analysis to all stocks comprising BSE-Sensex. The article shows that the multi-scale beta estimation approach is useful in Indian Stock Market. Gupta and Chander’s study presents a comparative analysis of retail and non-retail mutual fund investors with respect to attributes related to mutual fund schemes in the context of their selection of various mutual funds. The findings of the study may help in improving strategies of asset management companies.</p>
<p>India has a vibrant micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector contributing significantly to the manufacturing output, employment and exports of the country. A study was undertaken by Kathuria and Mamta to analyse the financing practices and constraints faced while availing finance of small and medium enterprises in textiles and clothing sector of an industrial city in India. The study highlighted that in the past, majority of units started their business with internal funds only. But, during the current year, majority of the respondent units employed external funds. Singla and Grover made a similar study pertaining to the relationship between Credit Flow by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and Growth of MSME sector in India using Regression Analysis. The study attempted a comparative analysis of the Credit Flow to MSMEs by Domestic SCBs in two states of India, that is, Punjab and Haryana.</p>
<p>Brand personality is an effective tool to create positive perceived values and brand trust. Kang and Sharma studied a relationship between brand personality, perceived value and brand trust. Their results suggest that Lux as a brand enjoys positively perceived personality characteristics, which can be leveraged for developing higher trust index. The results also show that trust in a brand is important when customers choose personal care products and that perceived value is significantly enhanced when customers have positive connotations of brand personality.</p>
<p>There is an increasing demand for diversity of board in an effort to enhance their performance in an ever-changing global environment. Jhunjhunwala examines the diversity of Boards in terms of experience in two important Asian economies, such as India and Singapore. Boards in these countries have members with different functional, industry and domain expertise. The findings suggest that a Board having members with varied experience has a positive impact on financial performance of the company.</p>
<p>Chaudhary et al. examine the psychometric properties of Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES). The UWES was administered to a 450-representative employees from both public and private sector manufacturing and service organisations in India. Though the internal consistencies for sub-scales were acceptable, internal consistencies of the complete scales were found to be higher than that of the three sub-scales. Shortened UWES was found to display better psychometric properties and results than the original UWES samples.</p>
<p>Work–life balance harmonises human life’s professional accomplishment and the quality of life. In this context, the study conducted by Aiswarya and Ramasundaram on the ‘Interference of Work–Life Conflict between Organisational Climate and Job Satisfaction of Women Employees in Information Technology Sector’ is relevant, well-timed and interesting. Their article focuses on the impact of Organisational Climate as an antecedent on the Job Satisfaction of the women employees in IT sector in Chennai.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the readers will find the current issue of APJMRI informative and stimulating. I would like to express my deepest sense of appreciation and gratitude to the contributors of articles who have shared their thoughts, experiences and wisdom with the other research workers through this journal to help put together some innovative ways to manage changes in the business environment in the emerging and diverse fields of economic growth.</p>
