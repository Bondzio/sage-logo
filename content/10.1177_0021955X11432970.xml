<abstract>
<p>There are several methods of producing open porous polymer structures for medical use. However, very few are applicable to industries and are therefore limited to both number of samples and batch variations. This study presents an industrial microcellular injection molding process, known as MuCell® technology, which was used to produce highly porous scaffolds of thermoplastic polyurethane. A parameter study was performed to quantify and analyze the effect of the processing parameters on the porous structure. Six key parameters (gas content, weight reduction, injection speed, mold temperature, plasticizing pressure, and temperature) were tested with an iteration method. The pore structure was determined with advanced micro Computer Tomography algorithm. All key processing parameters were identified. Gas content and weight reduction showed a more profound effect on the pore morphology than other parameters on the pore structure. It was possible to produce scaffolds with open porosity as high as 71%. The study concludes that MuCell® technology is an accurate and liable production method for large-scale production of open porous thermoplastic polyurethane scaffolds, and supercritical fluid could, therefore, be a potential production method for polymer scaffolds.</p>

Scaffolds usually serve at least one of the following purposes: (1) allow cell attachment and migration, (2) deliver and retain cells and biochemical factors, (3) enable diffusion of vital cell nutrients and expressed products, and (4) exert certain mechanical and biological influences to modify the behavior of the cell phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X11432970">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X11432970">11</xref></sup> Porous polymer like polyurethane has been suggested for different uses, such as orthopaedic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X11432970">12</xref></sup> neo-meniscal tissue,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X11432970">6</xref></sup> and bone tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X11432970">13</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X11432970">16</xref></sup> At present, various techniques are used to produce a scaffold with a microcellular structure, such as thermally induced phase separation, solvent casting/particle leaching, electro-spinning, etc.;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X11432970">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X11432970">19</xref></sup> however, very few are applicable to industries for producing large number of samples at a low cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X11432970">20</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X11432970">22</xref></sup> Batch variations could also be a problem. Turng and Kramschuster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X11432970">23</xref></sup> utilized supercritical fluid within injection molding and particulate leaching techniques to produce highly porous and interconnected structures of polylactide and polyvinyl alcohol). The only work on industry-applicable processing methods for polyurethanes is by Leicher et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X11432970">24</xref></sup> which was the initiator for this study.</p>
<p>In this study, an industrial microcellular injection foaming process, known as MuCell® technology, was chosen to produce a scaffold with an open porous structure. An industry-applicable processing method such as the MuCell® was preferred due to its large capacity and high accuracy. MuCell® technology is a polymer process method that is normally used in automobile and furniture industries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X11432970">25</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021955X11432970">28</xref></sup> It uses supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as a blowing agent, which is injected into the plasticization section of the injection molding machine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X11432970">Figure 1</xref>). The blowing agent is injected into the polymer melt through the gas supply line and injector, in its supercritical state, by the plasticization phase of the injection molding machine. After plasticization, the mixture of polymer melt and gas is injected through the nozzle into the mold, where the foam structure can be generated due to the quick pressure drop in the mold. The main products which are produced today using MuCell® technology have closed cellular foam in order to reduce weight, but they retain the mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021955X11432970">29</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021955X11432970">31</xref></sup> Closed pore structure is of no use in tissue engineering applications, as cell and tissue need entrances to the pore structure. In addition, transfer of nutrients and waste products are only possible with an open porous structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021955X11432970">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021955X11432970">33</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec5-0021955X11432970"><title>Characterization of macro- and microstructures</title>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Jeol JSM-6060LV, JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the observation of pore morphology of the cross-section of the scaffold. The samples were sliced with a scalpel and then coated with a thin layer of gold using a sputter-coater (SCD 005, BAL-TEC AG, Balzers, Lichtenstein) under high vacuum with a current range between 5 and 15 kV. Characteristics of the porous structure such as pore size and porosity can be calculated by counting the average cell number and size of several SEM images from one sample.</p>
<p>MicroCT (SkyScan 1172, SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium) was used to quantitatively measure the porous interconnectivity of scaffolds: three 8 × 11 mm<sup>2</sup> cylindrical samples from each scaffold (<italic>n</italic> = 3) at 7 µm resolution using a voltage of 59 kV and a current 167 µA. Samples were rotated 180° around their long axis and three absorption images were recorded every 0.400° of rotation.</p>
<p>The image analysis of the reconstructed axial bitmap images was performed using the standard SkyScan software (CTan, SkyScan, Kontich, Belgium). The threshold value was set between 65 and 225 for this study. Additional noise was removed by the ‘despeckling’ function. All objects smaller than 500 voxels and not connected to the 3-D body were thus removed prior to further analysis. In order to eliminate the potential edge effects, a cylindrical volume of interest (VOI) with a diameter 5 mm and height 2.5 mm was selected in the center of the scaffold. Scaffold porosity was then calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021955X11432970"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X11432970-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>All images underwent 3-D analysis, followed by the quantification of interconnectivity using the advanced ‘shrink-wrap’ function, which allows to measure the interconnectivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021955X11432970">43</xref></sup> A shrink–wrap process was performed between two 3-D measurements to shrink the outside boundary of the VOI in a scaffold through any openings, the size of which was equal to or larger than a threshold value (0–280 µm was used in this study). One can visualize this ‘shrink–wrap’ function as placing a sphere inside the scaffold and observing if this sphere can reach the entire porous structure. The algorithm calculates how much of the porous structure is accessible to this sphere and it is defined as ‘percentage of connective porosity.’ The first calculation is done with a sphere diameter of 2 µm and continued stepwise until a diameter of 280 µm.</p>
<p>The algorithm calculates the interconnectivity as follows:

<sec id="sec7-0021955X11432970"><title>Influence of the weight reduction and gas content</title>
<p>In this study, the gas content was varied from 1% to 6%; the degree of weight reduction was also varied from 35% to 65%. The injection speed, plasticizing temperature, plasticizing pressure, and mold temperature were fixed as 120 mm/s, 190°C, 170 bar and 25°C, respectively. SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X11432970">Figure 3</xref>) showed qualitatively differences of the pore structures. The porous diameter at 35% weight reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X11432970">Figure 3(a)</xref>) was significantly smaller than the value at a higher degree of 55% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X11432970">Figure 3(b)</xref>). The graphs for every degree of weight reduction showed the same tendency; increasing gas content led to a reduction in pore size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11432970">Figure 4(a)</xref>). The rise of gas content led to higher nucleus formation and consequently more pores. As a result, the mean pore size decreased because of the unchanged volume for the foam structure. The mean pore size dropped quickly for a gas content from 1% to 2%; the rate changed with higher content and reached a plateau at 6%. At the same gas content, the mean pore size also increased with the rise in weight reduction. At 1% of the gas content, the mean pore size increased from 230 to 864 µm with the rise of weight reduction from 35% to 65%; whereas, this change range of mean pore size was small at higher gas content of 6%, from 135 to 339 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11432970">Figure 4(a)</xref>). The change of cell density of the foamed sample agreed with the mean pore size change on the other side. The cell density by 35% weight reduction was increased from 1.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> to 7.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> per cm<sup>3</sup> for the gas content ranges from 1% to 6%. The other degrees of weight reduction showed also similar cell density curves.

<p>Another important factor of pore morphology was the porosity which indicated the foaming degree of the foamed samples. The porosity changes were similar to the finding with the mean pore size. The rise of gas content led to an increase of porosity, which corresponded to the relevant rise of cell density. The porosity of 35% weight reduction had a range between 60% and 69% with rising gas content and the increase of weight reduction up to 65% shifted this porosity range to a higher value, between 73% and 79%, which means rising both gas content and weight reduction led to a higher porosity in the MuCell® process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11432970">Figure 4(b)</xref>). The SEM images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X11432970">Figure 4(c)</xref>–(e) show the pore morphology at different gas contents (1%, 3% and 6%) with constant weight reduction of 55%. The change of pore morphology was obvious; with rise of the gas content, the pore size decreased obviously. The values of interconnection size, which means the window between two connective pores, in relation to the gas content and weight reduction are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X11432970">Figure 5(a)</xref> and (b). Interconnections display the ‘openness’ of the porous structure and is a vital parameter for allowing cellular ingrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021955X11432970">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021955X11432970">45</xref></sup> The change in trend of the interconnection size was just as same as the mean pore size. Rising gas content led to a decrease of both mean pore size and interconnection size; for example, by 35% weight reduction, the range of interconnection pore size was between 108 and 40 µm. By higher weight reduction of 65%, the interconnection pore size changed from 131 μm to 52 μm by increasing the gas content from 1 to 6 wt.% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X11432970">Figure 5(a)</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X11432970">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows the connective porosity depending on interconnection size of the foamed sample. The connective porosity compared with normally measured porosity means the porosity which consists of all the connective pores larger than the defined interconnective pore size. This value shows the interconnectivity of the foamed sample and was one of the most important characteristics of the porous structure. If the defined interconnection size was 0 µm, all the pores will be counted in the porosity, which means 100% measured porosity was effective. With rising of the defined interconnection size from 0 to 70 µm (interval 14 µm), the amount of connective pores as well as the connective porosity decreased. By weight reduction of 65% and with 1% gas content, the relative porosity decreased from 100% to 68%, but with 6% gas content, this range was between 100% and 5.5%. Therefore, the increase of gas content can lead to not only a lower interconnectivity but also a rapid decrease of the interconnectivity of the foamed sample. Similarly, low weight reduction of 45% with gas content 3% means less free volume for the pore formation; therefore, the interconnectivity (from 100% to 1.5%) showed a faster plunge in comparison to the same gas content but a higher weight reduction of 65%, relative porosity from 100% to 28%.

According to the nucleation theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021955X11432970">46</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0021955X11432970">48</xref></sup> the main driving force of cell nucleation in MuCell® process was the pressure decrease at a very short time period. The injection speed of the polymer–gas–solution directly decides the pressure of the mixture at the point out of the nozzle as well as the pressure drop range; therefore, the effect of injection speed on the porous structure of the foamed part was expected. The range of injection speed in this study was 30–300 mm/s with an interval of 30 mm/s. The other fixed parameters were weight reduction (55%), gas content (2%), mold temperature (25°C), and plasticizing pressure and temperature (170 bar, 190°C). It was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11432970">Figure 6(a)</xref>) that the mean pore size became smaller with rising the injection speed. This change can be attributed to more cell nucleation of the decrease in higher pressure induced by the higher injection speed. As a result, the smaller mean pore size and higher cell density was observed. In this case, the mean pore size decreased from 340 to 246 µm with the rise in injection speed from 30 to 300 mm/s, whereas the cell density increased from 5.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 1.6 × 10<sup>6</sup> per cm<sup>3</sup>. Theoretically, this change in trend should be independent of the material used and also was observed by Kawashima et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021955X11432970">35</xref></sup> when studying polystyrene (PS), but nothing was found about other commercial materials such as polyethylene or polypropylene. The porosity at different injection speeds is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11432970">Figure 6(b)</xref>. At an injection speed range from 30 to 60 mm/s, the porosity showed a slight drop from 76% to 73%, but after 60 mm/s, the porosity increased continuously from 73% to 79%. The findings from the microCT analysis can also be confirmed in the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X11432970">Figure 6</xref>(c)–(e)). The size of the interconnection did not show a regular change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11432970">Figure 7(a)</xref>). A peak of 135 µm was found at the injection speed of 150 mm/s, whereas at speed ranges 30–120 and 210–300 mm/s, the size of the interconnections stayed in a small range 107–116 µm. No relevant report was found about this phenomenon by other materials; so, the generality of this rule needs to be further researched. It was also observed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021955X11432970">Figure 7(b)</xref> that injection speed change had nearly no effect on the connective porosity except at the speed of 150 mm/s. The curve of injection speed 150 mm/s showed a higher percentage of connective porosity at every defined interconnective pore size, which was consistent with the larger size of interconnection at 150 mm/s.

<sec id="sec9-0021955X11432970"><title>Influence of the plasticizing temperature</title>
<p>The plasticizing temperature decided the solubility and solution speed of gas in the polymer melt; e.g., higher temperature induces possibly more homogeneous and faster gas dissolution in the polymer melt, which gave the possibility to change the morphology of the foamed part by varying the plasticizing temperature. The plasticizing temperature varied from 180°C to 210°C with an interval of 15°C. The fixed parameters were degree of weight reduction (55%), gas content (2%), injection speed (120 mm/s), plasticizing pressure (170 bar), and mold temperature (25°C). From the SEM images it is observed that with rising plasticizing temperature the pore diameter shows a profound decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X11432970">Figure 8</xref>(d)–(f)). The qualitative changes of the mean pore size and cell density are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X11432970">Figure 8(a)</xref>. The mean pore size decreased slightly from 353 to 304 µm by temperature elevation from 180°C to 210°C, whereas the cell density increased quickly from 3.3 × 10<sup>5</sup> to 8.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> per cm<sup>3</sup>. A similar result was also reported by producing soft rubber foams of poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) using CO<sub>2</sub> as a gas foam agent in the expansion process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021955X11432970">49</xref></sup> The higher temperature led to a more homogenous distribution of gas in the polymer melt. Consequently, more pores were generated and decreased mean pore size and increased cell density were observed. The temperature-dependent porosity showed a slight increase from 68% to 71% corresponding to the reduction of mean size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X11432970">Figure 8(b)</xref>). The interconnection size indicated a slight decrease from 129 to 113 µm. These small changes in porosity and interconnection size can be normally disregarded if compared with the results from the influences of weight reduction and gas content.

<p>Despite the imperceptible changes of porosity and interconnection size at different plasticizing temperatures, the percentage of connective porosity showed different results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021955X11432970">Figure 8(c)</xref>). At a low plasticizing temperature of 180°C, the connective porosity was significantly larger than at high temperatures of 195°C and 210°C. The foamed sample at a high plasticizing temperature had almost no connective porosity if the effective pores were defined as having an interconnective pore size larger than 42 µm, but at a temperature of 180°C, this connective porosity was even at 29.69% with an interconnective pore size of 70 µm.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021955X11432970"><title>Influence of the plasticizing pressure</title>
<p>The plasticizing pressure was defined as the pressure at which the polymer was plasticized and gas was injected into the polymer melt. Changing this pressure could affect the gas dissolution in polymer melt and result in the change of pore structure. The plasticizing pressure varied from 110 to 200 bar with an interval of 30 bar. The other parameters were degree of weight reduction (55%), gas content (2%), injection speed (120 mm/s), plasticizing temperature (190°C), and mold temperature (25°C). Quantitative curves of mean pore size, cell density, porosity, and size of connection are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11432970">Figure 9(a)</xref>. The mean pore size decreased from 330 to 275 µm with changes in plasticizing pressure from 110 to 200 bar, corresponding to a cell density increase from 4.4 × 105 to 9.1 × 105 per cm<sup>2</sup>. The visual effect can also be viewed in the SEM section at different plasticizing pressures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11432970">Figure 9</xref>(d)–(g)). This can be explained by the more homogeneous gas dissolution with higher degree induced by high pressure. Similar effect of pressure on the mean pore size and cell density has also been reported in literatures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0021955X11432970">49</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021955X11432970">51</xref></sup> and its effect was believed to be linked to an improved dissolution behavior of gas in the polymer melt at elevated pressures. The porosity of the foamed sample at the different plasticizing pressures indicated a slight drop from 75% to 68% with plasticizing range up to 140 bar and remained nearly unchanged up to 200 bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11432970">Figure 9(b)</xref>), despite a continuous increase in cell density. Concurrently, the interconnective pore size did not show a regular change, but just two plateaus of 116 and 86 µm. The porosity was more sensitive to the change in plasticizing pressure at the low area. The percentage of connective porosity in relation to the defined interconnective pore size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021955X11432970">Figure 9(c)</xref>) showed a significant change with varying the plasticizing pressure. At 110 bar, the curve indicated a low interconnectivity. The connective porosity increased continuously with rise of the plasticizing pressure from 110 to 200 bar. This enabled the enhancement of interconnectivity through increasing the plasticizing pressure.

<sec id="sec11-0021955X11432970"><title>Influence of the mold temperature</title>
<p>The mold temperature was the environment temperature at which the cell growth and cell stabilization take place. This temperature decided the change of viscosity of the injected polymer melt and consequently the cooling time of the polymer melt in the mold. Short cooling time could lead to an incomplete cell growth with a small cell size (&lt;10°C). On the contrary, longer cooling time could also induce smaller cell sizes. This is due to the fact that the polymer structure collapses. Therefore, the mold temperature must be accurately adjusted to make sure that the polymer–gas–solution in the mold has a proper cooling time for the desired pore morphology. In this study, the mold temperature varied from 25°C to 85°C with interval of 20°C. The other parameters were degree of weight reduction (55%), gas content (2%), injection speed (120 mm/s), plasticizing temperature (190°C), and plasticizing pressure (170 bar).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11432970">Figure 10(a)</xref> shows quantitative changes of mean pore size and cell density at different mold temperatures. The mean pore size decreased from 371 to 240 µm by varying the mold temperature from 25°C to 85°C, whereas the cell density was just in the range 9.45 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 1.15 × 10<sup>6</sup> per cm<sup>3</sup>. No regular change of cell density was found. An increase of mean pore size with rising mold temperature was found by foaming PS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021955X11432970">35</xref></sup> But in the other case of foaming polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with different chemical structures, the reduction of mean pore size with increase of the mold temperature was also found,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0021955X11432970">50</xref></sup> although different processes were used in the foaming of PET. It can be consequently assumed that the influence of mold temperature on the pore morphology was rather material dependent, but further experiments need to be performed. Slices of the scaffold were also observed in SEM, where one can see the same behavior for the pore morphology for the different mold temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11432970">Figure 10</xref>(d)–(g)). The porosity has slightly decreased from 73% to 66% as well as the size of interconnections, respectively, from 110 to 82 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11432970">Figure 10(b)</xref>), by varying the mold temperature from 25°C to 85°C. The porosity here was also in inverse proportion to the cell density on varying the plasticizing pressure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021955X11432970">Figure 10(c)</xref> shows the interconnectivity of the foamed samples at different mold temperatures. The curve of 25°C indicated a worst interconnectivity despite the highest porosity and biggest mean pore size, but on the other hand, the best interconnectivity was found at the temperature of 45°C, not the highest temperature; so, no relation between the mold temperature and connective porosity was observed.

<p>The main goal of this study was to produce an open porous scaffold through the MuCell® process and to determine the relationship between the resulting porous morphology and the processing parameters. This aim was fully achieved as an open porous structure with a porosity of 71% and proven interconnections could be made. The detailed relation between process parameter changes and pore morphology was hereby described. It was found that gas content and weight reduction were the prime influence factors of pore morphology in the MuCell® process. The gas content directly decided the amount of nucleus formation; the degree of weight reduction, which means, how many percentage of mold cavity was filled compared with compact injection, gave a space for the formation of a foamed structure. The higher gas content can lead to a larger foaming potential, but the gas solubility in the polymer melt had a limit; on the other side, without enough expandable volume for the foaming, the porous structure cannot form. Injection speed, plasticizing pressure, plasticizing temperature, and mold temperature were the second prime influence factors of pore morphology. It is believed that other open porous polymers would behave accordingly; however, the investigation of this hypothesis is out of scope for this study.</p>
<p>The pore size of the foamed scaffolds during the whole study ranged from 130 to 870 µm. The maximal porosity and interconnective pore size were 75% and 135 µm. It was proved that open porous scaffolds could be made on a large scale of using the MuCell® process, and that the pore morphology was controllable through varying the key processing parameters. Even though the foaming theory could be applied to describe the pore development, interaction of different parameters must be taken into account to fit the experimental data into the theory.</p>
