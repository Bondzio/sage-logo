<p>Nurses across the world provide support to many people with disabilities but this does not necessarily mean they all have positive attitudes towards members of the general public or colleagues with disabilities. In undertaking their project the authors have shown generally positive attitudes towards nurses with disabilities, and they demonstrate that the Nurses’ Attitudes toward Nurses with Disabilities Scale (NANDS) has potential in assessing the attitudes of nurses towards nursing colleagues with disabilities. They go on to suggest that this may be of use in evaluating the disability climate within hospitals and start to address environments and attitudes that may present challenges for nurses with disabilities, and I accept these assertions.</p>
<p>However, nurses rejecting stereotypes about people with disabilities and recognizing their potential to be effective nursing colleagues continues to be a challenge, as evidenced in the reported findings. Across many countries there are now established legislative provisions that make it illegal to discriminate against people on the grounds that they have disabilities. These laws require service providers and employers to make changes that are reasonable accommodations or adjustments (depending on the term used in different countries) in order to facilitate the inclusion of people with disabilities, either in using a wide range of services or in employment. Only limited exemptions in respect of employment are permitted and nursing is not one of these areas, therefore it is important that individual nurses, nurse managers, nurse educators and policy makers are mindful of the need to support people with disabilities who may wish to become nurses were this is ‘reasonable’ and support nurses with disability to continue to work as safe and effective nurses.</p>
<p>Alongside the generally positive attitudes the authors report, there are also clear indications that stereotypes about nurses with disability exist among respondents. A particular challenge at times in changing attitudes can be that it appears to be that stereotypes have a rational logic, for instance nurses with disabilities may be less effective in more acute areas of care, because they have to respond quickly. Despite the apparent logic of this viewpoint it still risks stereotyping people, as it is based on perceptions of people with disabilities rather than knowledge of the actual nurse with disabilities.</p>
<p>Indeed, even from a logic point of view such views are open to question, for example, in many acute or critical care areas nurses may be less physically active than colleagues working in environments that would be considered less acute and their disabilities may not be relevant. Nurses should be very aware from their work that the nature of a person’s disability can varying widely, it may be clearly visible or unseen, it may have an impact on mobility, thinking or other functions, the impact may be at a consistent level or fluctuate depending on other factors in the person, people they meet or the wider environment. Any decisions based on the perceptions of a group of people (including nurses with disabilities), rather than knowledge of an individual will always risk perpetuating stereotypes, both positive and negative.</p>
<p>The importance of positive contact with people with disabilities is recognized across many areas of disability, and the authors also highlight the importance of contact with people who have disabilities and how this can have a positive impact on attitudes towards nurses with disabilities, this point should not be lost on the reader.</p>
<p>Society regularly celebrates the achievement of a wide range of people, including athletes, children and many others who do not have disabilities, and also celebrates and the contribution and achievements of people with disabilities. This presents a challenge and an opportunity to nursing to not just celebrate the success of nurses who do not have disabilities, but to also equally value the contribution and achievement of nurses who do have disabilities. The nursing profession should where appropriate highlight the abilities of nurses with disabilities as valued members of the nursing professions and demonstrate the value they may bring to nursing. This value may arise, as it does for all nurses, from their knowledge, skills and experience and may be further added to, for example, by the understanding nurses with disabilities may have gained through their own personal journeys, in the coping strategies they have developed and resilience with which they lead their lives. All nurses should remain mindful of the professional and legal requirements under which they are expected to equally value our colleagues with disabilities, as we value all other people with disabilities and without disabilities.</p>
