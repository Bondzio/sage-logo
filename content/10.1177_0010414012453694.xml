<abstract>
<p>Presidential elections with few candidates held in temporal proximity to legislative elections are believed to promote the nationalization and consolidation of the legislative party system. However, contrary to the existing literature, the authors argue here that the shadow presidential elections cast over legislative elections is contingent on the relative powers of the president vis-à-vis the legislature. Specifically, the authors find that proximate presidential elections with few presidential candidates promote the nationalization and consolidation of the legislative party system only when the president is neither very weak nor very powerful. They also find that proximate presidential elections with many presidential candidates promote the denationalization and fragmentation of the legislative party system only when the president is at least reasonably powerful.</p>

<p>A defining feature of presidential democracy is the separate election of the chief executive and the legislature. Yet even as scholars acknowledge the importance of separate electoral origins, they also recognize that presidential and legislative elections are not independent of one another. As Juan Linz noted more than a decade ago, the choice among presidentialism, parliamentarism, or a hybrid regime is more than simply a question of who will exercise executive power. These core constitutional engineering decisions have profound effects on a variety of outcomes. From France to Indonesia and from Israel to Russia, constitutional reforms either creating or strengthening the office of the president have had the effect (sometimes intended, sometimes not) of reshaping the legislative party system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453694">Linz, 1994</xref>, p. 3; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453694">Hazan &amp; Rahat, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453694">Moser, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453694">Suleiman, 1994</xref>). The most noted of these effects is the deflationary impact of presidentialism, by which popular presidential elections with few candidates encourage the consolidation of the legislative party system.</p>
<p>As good as existing studies are, they are not without their shortcomings. Although they acknowledge the ways in which different types of presidential and legislative electoral rules can affect strategic behavior, they tend to treat the institutions themselves as uniform, black boxes. Comparative scholars know, however, that variations in the characteristics of the presidency and the legislature have important implications in other contexts. For example, the relative power of the president and legislature is known to affect such things as the propensity for policy-making gridlock, the proximity of policy outcomes to the median voter, and even overall government and regime stability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453694">Linz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453694">Mainwaring &amp; Shugart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart &amp; Carey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453694">Tsebelis, 1995</xref>). We argue here that the power of the presidency relative to the legislature should also have a fundamental, independent effect prior to the formation of any government. Namely, it should also shape the legislative party system.</p>
<p>Accordingly, this article explores how the size of the presidential prize directly shapes the legislative party system. Our hypothesis is that presidential elections will significantly promote the nationalization and consolidation of the legislative party system only when the size of the presidential prize is neither negligible nor overwhelming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453694">1</xref></sup> Hence, contrary to the existing literature, we argue that the nationalizing and consolidatory effect of presidential elections is <italic>contingent</italic> on the characteristics of the presidential office—specifically, on the horizontal centralization of authority in the presidency, that is, the relative powers of the president vis-à-vis the legislature. In so doing, we build on previous work that demonstrates the effect of executive power on the presidential party system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2008</xref>) and the ways in which presidential elections shape competition both within and between legislative electoral constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We test our argument on two sets of cases. The first is a data set of 590 elections in 64 countries from 1900 to 2005 that we ourselves compiled. For robustness, we also use a data set of 603 elections in 84 democracies from 1946 to 2000 compiled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453694">Golder (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">2006</xref>), which yields results even more supportive of our hypotheses. However, in the interest of space, we solely report the results from our broader data set in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453694">2</xref></sup> As hypothesized, we find that for presidential elections held in temporal proximity to legislative elections, when there are few presidential candidates, these elections promote the nationalization and consolidation of the legislative party system only when presidents are moderately powerful to powerful. Moreover, when there are many presidential candidates, only elections for powerful and very powerful presidents are found to contribute to the denationalization and fragmentation of the legislative party system.</p>
<sec id="section1-0010414012453694">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>In many democracies, voters elect a head of state-cum-chief executive, an office that is usually referred to as the “presidency,” in addition to a legislature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart &amp; Carey, 1992</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0010414012453694">3</xref></sup> Political scientists have regularly observed that these presidential elections cast a shadow over the country’s legislative elections, particularly when the elections for the two offices are temporally proximate, but even—if to a lesser degree—when they are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453694">Shugart, 1995</xref>). This shadow takes the form of fewer legislative parties when there are few viable presidential candidates, and more legislative parties when there are many viable presidential candidates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453694">Amorim Neto &amp; Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012453694">Jones, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453694">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart &amp; Carey, 1992</xref>). The former is usually referred to as the deflationary effect of presidential elections, resulting in a more consolidated legislative party system, and the latter as the inflationary effect, resulting in a more fragmented legislative party system.</p>
<p>Contingent though it may be, the deflationary effect of presidential elections is widely recognized by both academics and constitutional engineers—so much so that the introduction of a popularly elected president is sometimes proposed as a way to reduce the fragmentation of the legislative party system. A prominent recent example is Israel’s experiment with the direct election of its prime minister from 1996 to 2001. Although this office is still nominally called a prime minister, the switch to directly electing the chief executive transformed the Israeli system from a parliamentary regime into the type of regime that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart and Carey (1992)</xref> label “president-parliamentary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012453694">Hazan, 1996</xref>). This reform was proposed for a variety of reasons, but among them was a desire to reshape the Israeli party system: “to reduce the size, number, and influence of the smaller parties in the Knesset” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453694">Hazan &amp; Rahat, 2000</xref>, p. 1318).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0010414012453694">4</xref></sup> Likewise, reformers during the French Fourth Republic saw the introduction of popular presidential elections as a remedy to France’s fragmented and disorganized party system, and hence to its chronically unstable “régime des partis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453694">Suleiman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Both reformers’ expectations and scholars’ predictions about the effect of presidential elections are typically based on the assumption that “[t]he presidency is nearly always the most important electoral prize in a presidential regime” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>, p. 35). In other words, all presidents are created equal, and all presidents equally trump legislatures in importance. Competition for the presidency shapes competition for the legislature precisely because the presidency is important enough that presidential candidates draw attention from the national media; from legislative candidates, donors, and other political elites; and, of course, from voters. This attention has wide-ranging repercussions for the legislative contest, as is well discussed in the existing literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0010414012453694">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the assumptions that the presidency is the most important electoral prize and that the size of this prize is more or less constant across polities are more problematic than the literature recognizes. Take the president of Ireland, effectively a popularly elected head of state charged with performing ceremonial functions. It seems implausible to argue that the Irish presidency is more important an electoral prize than the Dáil, the lower house of the Irish parliament. Now take the president of the United States, the head of state but also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the wielder of a legislative veto, and the maker of treaties. Here it becomes plausible to claim that the presidency is a more important electoral prize than the Congress. Should not elections for the relatively more important American presidency attract more candidate, media, donor, and voter attention than elections for the relatively less important Irish presidency? And should not the latter elections accordingly cast a much larger shadow over the legislative contest than the former? We think that the answer to both questions is a resounding yes. Or consider a less extreme comparison. Should we expect the shadow cast by presidential elections in the United States, where the president’s power is checked by the legislature, to be of the same magnitude as presidential elections in a system where the president’s power is less constrained, such as in Brazil?</p>
<p>This leads us to our central claim: All popularly elected presidents, and hence all presidential elections, are <italic>not</italic> in fact created equal. Although this is not a novel claim in general (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart &amp; Carey, 1992</xref>), it is novel for the study of legislative party systems. To date, scholars studying the shadow cast by presidential elections have largely overlooked the implications of this variation in presidential power. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox (1997</xref>, p. 189) has argued that presidentialism will lead to a smaller number of national level parties in legislative elections only when the presidency is “a big prize, worth considerable effort to attain,” there has been little other theoretical and no empirical attention paid to the conditioning variable of presidential importance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0010414012453694">6</xref></sup> Rather, scholars have treated all presidential elections as interchangeable, after taking account of the presidential party system and the temporal proximity of legislative and presidential elections (i.e., the electoral cycle).</p>
<p>So what determines whether or not the presidency is the most important electoral prize? The key factor is the degree to which power at the national level of government is concentrated in the presidency. Elsewhere this has been dubbed the “horizontal centralization” of policy-making authority, the primary determinant of “the size of the presidential prize,” or the payoff to being aligned with the party of the president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0010414012453694">7</xref></sup> We focus here on the powers that the president wields vis-à-vis the legislature, the institution that most scholars view as the key competitor to the presidency. Hence, we argue that only if the horizontal size of the presidential prize is sufficiently large (i.e., if the president wields a fair amount of policy-making authority vis-à-vis the legislature) will the presidency indeed be the most important electoral prize, as the literature has assumed.</p>
<p>Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken and Stoll (2008)</xref> found that the size of the presidential prize, in addition to factors previously studied such as the presidential electoral system, shapes the number of presidential candidates. This means that the size of the prize <italic>indirectly</italic> plays a role in shaping the legislative party system: It directly shapes the number of presidential candidates, and the number of presidential candidates in turn directly shapes the number of legislative parties, as discussed above. In this article, we also hypothesize that the size of the presidential prize has a <italic>direct</italic>, independent effect on the relationship between presidential and legislative elections. Our argument is that the greater the horizontal centralization of authority in the presidency, the greater the size of the presidential prize and hence the greater the shadow the presidential election casts over the legislative one, controlling for the number of presidential candidates and the temporal proximity of the elections. Conversely, the weaker the president, the less of a shadow the presidential election casts over its legislative counterpart, even when the two elections are concurrent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0010414012453694">8</xref></sup> This leads to the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0010414012453694" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1 (H1)</italic>: Temporally proximate presidential and legislative elections are associated with a smaller (larger) number of parties in legislative elections, conditional on (a) there being few (many) presidential candidates and (b) policy-making authority being horizontally centralized in the presidency.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Another way to study the effect of presidential elections is to examine the extent to which political parties coordinate across legislative electoral districts. This is referred to in the literature as the aggregation of the legislative party system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453694">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453694">2004</xref>), one of several ways of conceptualizing party nationalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0010414012453694">9</xref></sup> Many scholars have posited that the primary mechanism by which presidential elections with few candidates lead to fewer legislative parties at the national level is by facilitating cross-district linkages and thereby promoting better aggregation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453694">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453694">Cox &amp; Knoll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>). In keeping with the prior hypothesis, we argue that the effect of presidential elections on this characteristic of the legislative party system should also be conditional on the size of the presidential prize. Hence, a second hypothesis is,</p>
<list id="list2-0010414012453694" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2 (H2)</italic>: Temporally proximate presidential and legislative elections are associated with greater (lesser) cross-district coordination in legislative elections, conditional on (a) there being few (many) presidential candidates and (b) policy-making authority being horizontally centralized in the presidency.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, there is reason to believe that the ability of proximate presidential elections with few presidential candidates to promote the aggregation and consolidation of the legislative party system either diminishes or disappears for <italic>extremely</italic> powerful presidents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken and Stoll (2008)</xref> found that candidates and voters fail to coordinate on a small number of candidates in presidential elections when the president is very powerful. We believe that a similar dynamic should be at work in legislative elections held in temporal proximity to these presidential elections: Specifically, in countries with very powerful presidencies, the stakes become so high that they hinder rather than induce strategic coordination by legislative candidates. The logic is as follows. When power is extremely concentrated in the office of the presidency, the elections approach a zero-sum contest—either you are part of the party that captures the executive, or you are left wandering in the political wilderness until the next election. Under this scenario, candidates from trailing parties might rationally choose to avoid throwing their hat in with one of the two front-runners before the election for fear of choosing incorrectly and alienating the eventual winner. A sounder strategy would be to wait until after the election when the outcome is certain and then align with the winner. There are several testable implications of this hypothesis that could be explored in future work, including the pattern of party switching before and after elections,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0010414012453694">10</xref></sup> as well as the difference between coordination during concurrent presidential elections (when the president’s party is not known with certainty) and coordination during midterm elections (when the president’s party is known with certainty). Here we simply test whether the aggregatory and deflationary effect of presidential elections dissipates in systems with very powerful presidents:</p>
<list id="list3-0010414012453694" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (H3)</italic>: Where presidents are very powerful, their elections should not have a significant aggregatory and deflationary effect, even if they are temporally proximate to legislative elections and there are few presidential candidates.</p></list-item>
</list>

<sec id="section2-0010414012453694">
<title>Variable Descriptions</title>
<p>We now turn to the operationalization and measurement of the variables appearing in our hypotheses. We have two dependent variables. The first is simply the number of electoral parties competing in a national level legislative election. We operationalize this variable in the conventional manner as the <italic>size-weighted</italic> or effective number of electoral parties (ENEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453694">Laakso &amp; Taagepera, 1979</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0010414012453694">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The second dependent variable is the extent of cross-district coordination or party system aggregation in a national legislative election. A common way to operationalize this concept is to calculate the difference between the effective number of electoral parties in the legislative election nationally (calculated as just described) and the average effective number of electoral parties in the legislative districts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453694">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453694">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>). Formally, this difference score (D) is calculated as follows:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>where “Mean District ENEP” is the average effective number of electoral parties in the districts. To illustrate, a country that has an average of two effective parties per district would have a difference score of five if the effective number of parties nationally was seven. That same country would have a difference score of zero if there were only two parties nationally. Larger difference scores signal poorer cross-district coordination. To provide a real-world example, a country that often has a large difference score and hence poor cross-district coordination is South Korea, where region-specific parties commonly contest national legislative elections. Conversely, a country that usually has a small difference score and hence good cross-district coordination is the United States, where two nationally competitive parties have dominated politics in the post–World War II era.</p>
<p>We construct measures of both dependent variables using district level electoral returns from the Constituency Level Electoral Archive at the University of Michigan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0010414012453694">12</xref></sup> Although not shown here for reasons of space, a scatterplot of these two variables shows that although countries with highly aggregated party systems tend to have a small effective number of national electoral parties (e.g., Greece), and that countries with poorly aggregated party systems tend to have a large effective number of national electoral parties (e.g., India), the relationship is far from perfect: In particular, there are many countries with highly aggregated party systems that nevertheless have a large number of electoral parties at the national level (e.g., Norway). Quantifying this, the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the national ENEP and D is 0.79, which means that only about 60% of the two variables’ variance is shared. We accordingly believe it is useful to investigate the effect of presidential elections on both of these variables.</p>
<p>Turning to our independent variables, to operationalize the temporal proximity of legislative and presidential elections, we use a continuous measure originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453694">Amorim Neto and Cox (1997)</xref> that has been the measure of choice in many recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453694">Clark &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>). It ranges from zero (minimally proximate, i.e., the legislative election either occurs at the presidential midterm or in a nonpresidential regime) to one (maximally proximate, i.e., concurrent).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0010414012453694">13</xref></sup> The second independent variable is the number of national-level presidential candidates. For presidential regimes, this variable is operationalized as the effective number of (electoral) presidential candidates in either the concurrent (if there is one) or preceding presidential election (if not).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0010414012453694">14</xref></sup> In nonpresidential regimes, the variable takes the value of zero, again following the standard practice in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453694">Clark &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>). Our data for both of these independent variables were obtained by extending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453694">Golder’s (2005)</xref> original data.</p>
<p>Our third independent variable, the horizontal centralization of policy-making authority in the presidency, is the focus of this article. Drawing on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken and Stoll (2008)</xref>, we employ two operationalizations of this variable. The first and most preferred is an index of de jure presidential powers at the time of the legislative election. To create this index, Hicken and Stoll relied on a coding scheme first developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart and Carey (1992)</xref> and later modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453694">Frye, Hellman, and Tucker (2000)</xref>. This scheme measures 10 dimensions of presidential power. The first 6 dimensions concern the president’s legislative powers and include package veto/override, partial veto/override, decree power, exclusive introduction of legislation (in reserved policy areas), budgetary powers, and referenda proposal. The remaining 4 dimensions concern nonlegislative powers: cabinet formation, cabinet dismissal, censure, and dissolution of the assembly. For each election, countries with a popularly elected president are assigned a score ranging from 0 (minimal presidential authority) to 4 (maximal presidential authority) on each dimension, based on the constitution in effect at that time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0010414012453694">15</xref></sup> An overall index of presidential powers is then created by adding the scores on all 10 dimensions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken and Stoll’s (2008)</xref> original data were generated by obtaining copies of countries’ constitutions from a variety of sources and using the coding scheme just described to code them through 2005. We built on this data by extending it to the cases included in our sample that did not appear in theirs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0010414012453694">16</xref></sup> The observed values of the index range from 0 to 21.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0010414012453694">17</xref></sup> However, we still need to accommodate regimes without a popularly elected president. For consistency with the other independent variables, nonpresidential regimes are assigned a value of 0 and 1 is added to the index values of presidential regimes, so that the latter cases range in value from 1 to 22.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0010414012453694">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although a recent survey of different methods of measuring presidential power identifies this approach as the most useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453694">Metcalf, 2000</xref>, p. 660), the index of presidential powers is not without its flaws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0010414012453694">19</xref></sup> Accordingly, like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken and Stoll (2008)</xref>, we employ a more holistic classificatory scheme as a second, alternative operationalization: the type of political regime in effect at the time of an election. For our set of cases, we classify countries with popularly elected presidents as taking one of three regime types that capture fundamental differences in presidential authority: the parliamentary (a weak presidency), the mixed (a moderately powerful presidency), and the true presidential (a powerful presidency). This typology is a slightly modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453694">Shugart and Carey’s (1992)</xref>: As is conventional, we have combined their rare president-parliamentary regime and the more common premier or semipresidential regime in one “mixed” category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0010414012453694">20</xref></sup> To illustrate, Ireland is coded as a parliamentary regime even following the introduction of a popularly elected president with the 1937 constitution; France is classified as a mixed regime from 1962 onward, when popular elections for the president were introduced to the Fifth Republic by referendum, and as a parliamentary regime prior to 1962; and the United States is always coded as a true or pure presidential regime.</p>
<p>For regimes with popularly elected presidents, the presidential powers index varies predictably with the three basic types of political regimes, as expected. Presidential power increases on average from parliamentary to mixed regimes, as well as from mixed to presidential regimes. Nevertheless, the index of presidential powers reveals variation in the size of the presidential prize within each type of regime, especially true presidential regimes, that the simple trichotomy obscures. Accordingly, we rely on the full index of presidential powers to test H3.</p>

<title>Model Specifications and Data</title>
<p>Before turning to the specifics of the models estimated to test the three hypotheses, the issue of which cases are included in our empirical analysis deserves special attention. As alluded to in the discussion of how our variables are operationalized, elections in nonpresidential regimes, which means “pure” parliamentary regimes lacking a popularly elected chief executive- cum-head of state (e.g., the United Kingdom), are included in the analysis alongside elections in presidential regimes. The reason for this is simple: When trying to assess the effect of presidential elections on the legislative party system, the ultimate counterfactual to a presidential election being held concurrently with a legislative election is no presidential election at all. In other words, at the most basic level, the experimental “treatment” is the existence of a presidential election. To determine the effect of presidential elections, we compare the legislative party systems of the treatment group (legislative elections in regimes with a popularly elected president) to the legislative party systems of the control group (legislative elections in regimes without a popularly elected president). This is why all existing quantitative studies of which we are aware have included elections in nonpresidential regimes in their analyses (to name just a few, see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453694">Amorim Neto &amp; Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453694">Clark &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453694">Cox, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0010414012453694">21</xref></sup> More details about the cases used to estimate our models appear below.</p>
<p>We begin our empirical analysis by replicating the state-of-the-art model for the overall effect of presidential elections on the national-level legislative party system (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>):</p>

<p>This model, which we label Model 1, has as its dependent variable the effective number of electoral parties at the national level (ENEP). It posits a two-way interaction between the temporal proximity of presidential and legislative elections (Proximity) and the effective number of presidential candidates (ENPRES). The model also controls for the interaction between two other variables that have been found to shape the national level party system: the logged average lower tier district magnitude (Log Magnitude), measured using data from various sources such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453694">Golder (2005)</xref>, and the effective number of ethnic groups (ENETHNIC), measured using data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453694">Fearon (2003)</xref>. Note that <italic>i</italic> indexes countries and <italic>t</italic> indexes elections throughout.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0010414012453694">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Estimating this model serves two purposes. First, it demonstrates that we replicate the literature’s findings using our different set of cases (described below) and our own data. Second and more important, it allows us to vary the baseline model in ways that are relevant for testing H1. In the three additional versions of this model that we estimate, legislative elections in regimes without popularly elected presidents (e.g., pure parliamentary regimes such as the United Kingdom) are compared to legislative elections in regimes with either weak, moderately powerful, or powerful popularly elected presidents, respectively. To elaborate, in what we label Model 2, Equation 2 is estimated using both legislative elections in pure parliamentary regimes and legislative elections in extremely weak presidential regimes (those that are classified as parliamentary using our threefold typology), such as Ireland. In Model 3, legislative elections where the president is moderately powerful (i.e., presidential regimes that are classified as mixed), such as France, are paired with legislative elections in pure parliamentary regimes. Finally, in Model 4, the presidential regime elections are those where the president is powerful (i.e., presidential regimes that are classified as “true” presidential according to our threefold typology), such as the United States and Brazil. By comparing the effects of proximate presidential elections in these three models, we can see how the size of the presidential prize affects the shadow proximate presidential elections cast over legislative elections, conditional on the number of presidential candidates, à la H1.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0010414012453694">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>We next provide an alternate test of H1 and a first test of H3 by explicitly conditioning on our preferred measure of horizontal centralization, the index of presidential powers:</p>

<title>Discussion: The Number of Electoral Parties</title>
<p>Although it is not discussed here in the interests of space, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453694">Table 1</xref> and the first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453694">Figure 1</xref> show that, using our original data set, we obtain similar findings to the extant literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>) regarding the overall effect of presidential elections (Model 1). But what happens when we estimate Model 1 with different subsets of presidential regime elections, and hence vary the size of the presidential prize? In Models 2–4, we compare the effects of presidential elections in parliamentary, mixed, and true presidential regimes, respectively, an implicit way of testing H1. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0010414012453694">Table 1</xref> shows that we obtain the same signs for the terms involving proximity (β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>3</sub>) as when we use all elections (Model 1). The magnitudes of the estimated coefficients vary, however, as do their statistical significances. For example, the coefficient on the interaction term between proximity and the effective number of presidential candidates (β<sub>3</sub>) is statistically significant only when the presidential elections occur in true presidential regimes (Model 4), and it is estimated to be of much greater substantive magnitude for these presidential elections than for those in either parliamentary (Model 2) or mixed (Model 3) regimes.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0010414012453694-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>Yet we know that looking at the coefficient on the interaction term alone is misleading (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453694">Brambor, Clark, &amp; Golder, 2006</xref>). Instead, the nature of the conditional relationship between these two independent variables and the dependent variable is more precisely conveyed by plotting the interaction effects, as we do in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453694">Figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>For each of Models 1–4, this figure graphs the marginal effect of temporally proximate (concurrent) presidential elections over the range of the observed effective number of presidential candidates in presidential elections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0010414012453694">33</xref></sup> The estimated marginal effects are banded by 90% two-sided confidence intervals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0010414012453694">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beginning with the hypothesized deflationary effect, we see from this figure that temporally proximate presidential elections with few presidential candidates cast a weak shadow in parliamentary regimes, as hypothesized by H1. It is surprising that we do find a statistically significant deflationary effect, but the effect is substantively small, and holds only when there are very few (approximately two) presidential candidates. However, the most consequential difference between the results from the two data sets is that using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder’s (2006)</xref> data set, the deflationary effect is statistically insignificant and substantively even smaller. Second, when we turn to mixed presidential regimes, where the presidency is a larger prize, the deflationary effect of concurrent presidential elections has a larger substantive impact and is statistically significant for a greater number of presidential candidates (up to approximately three). Third and finally, we see that concurrent presidential elections in true presidential regimes, where the presidency is an even larger prize, are predicted to have a statistically significant deflationary impact for approximately the same range of presidential candidates. But this effect is now of even greater substantive magnitude, as predicted. To illustrate, concurrent presidential elections that are a perfect two-party contest are predicted to decrease the effective number of electoral parties in the legislative election by approximately 1.5.</p>
<p>Turning to the hypothesized <italic>inflationary</italic> effect, we see that proximate presidential elections with large numbers of presidential candidates do not have a statistically significant effect on the number of legislative parties when the president is either weak (parliamentary regimes) or moderately powerful (mixed regimes). By way of contrast, proximate presidential elections in true presidential regimes are predicted to have a statistically significant inflationary effect when there are many presidential candidates (specifically, when the effective number of presidential candidates is more than approximately 4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0010414012453694">35</xref></sup> This effect is also substantively significant. For example, when the effective number of presidential candidates is equal to 6 (as in the 1995 French presidential election), concurrent presidential elections in a true presidential regime are predicted to increase the effective number of electoral parties in the legislative election by 1.3, ceteris paribus. Accordingly, this part of the empirical analysis is generally supportive of H1.</p>
<p>The prior analysis is useful for its comparability with the existing literature. Yet Model 5, to which we now turn, provides us with a more nuanced test of H1, and hence with the first test of H3. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453694">Table 2</xref> reveals that only one term attains conventional levels of statistical significance: the main effect of proximity (β<sub>1</sub> in Equation 3). However, as before, the real action is not in this table’s coefficients themselves, but in a quantity derived from them: the marginal effect of proximity, which is what <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453694">Figure 2</xref> graphically conveys.</p>

<p>The first column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453694">Figure 2</xref> graphs the estimated marginal effect of concurrent presidential elections on the effective number of electoral parties. Each row represents a different value of the size of the presidential prize, operationalized in Model 5 as the index of presidential powers: respectively, an index value of 1 (the minimum value), a very weak president such as post-1937 Ireland’s; 7, a moderately powerful president such as the French Fifth Republic’s; 14, a powerful president such as the United States’s; and 22 (the maximum), a very powerful president such as post-1994 Argentina’s. By comparing the marginal effect graphs across the rows, we can explore how the effect of presidential elections varies with (i.e., is conditional on) the powers of the president.</p>
<p>One can see from this figure that as hypothesized, the slope of the marginal effects line increases as presidential powers increase, indicating that an increase in the number of presidential candidates has a larger effect when the president is more powerful. More specifically, with respect to the deflationary effect, proximate presidential elections for moderately powerful (e.g., France) to powerful (e.g., the United States) presidents with few candidates are predicted to have a statistically and substantively significant negative effect on the effective number of electoral parties in legislative elections, in accordance with H1. For example, with concurrent presidential elections, two presidential candidates, and a presidency with powers akin to the French president’s, the model predicts that the number of effective electoral parties in the legislative contest will decrease by 1.4. By way of contrast, although the model predicts that concurrent presidential elections may have a statistically significant deflationary effect on the legislative party system even when the presidency is exceedingly weak (e.g., Ireland), contrary to H1, this is the case <italic>only</italic> when the presidential party system is extremely consolidated (i.e., when the presidential race is a perfect two party contest).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0010414012453694">36</xref></sup> Turning to elections for very powerful presidencies (e.g., contemporary Argentina), when there are few presidential candidates, they are found to have little of a deflationary effect, in accordance with H3: Their predicted effect is negative for a smaller range of presidential candidates and never statistically significant.</p>
<p>With respect to the <italic>inflationary</italic> effect, Model 5 finds that when there are many presidential candidates, proximate presidential elections only have a statistically significant positive effect on the effective number of electoral parties in legislative elections when the presidency is powerful (i.e., as powerful as or slightly more powerful than the United States’s president). The effective number of presidential candidates must be a minimum of 6 for this effect to manifest. Although this is admittedly a relatively rare occurrence,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0010414012453694">37</xref></sup> if the presidential race has fragmented to this extent, the inflationary impact on the legislative party system will be substantial: a predicted increase in the effective number of electoral parties of at least 1.7. When the president is extremely powerful, the inflationary effect is found to be statistically insignificant but of an even larger substantive magnitude. Combining this finding with the prior finding that elections for very powerful presidents lack a statistically significant deflationary effect, we arrive at the conclusion that elections for very powerful presidencies are almost as unlikely to encourage coordination in legislative elections as elections for very weak presidencies. In fact, it is possible that they will further fragment the legislative party system instead of simply failing to consolidate it, consistent with H3.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0010414012453694">38</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section6-0010414012453694">
<title>Discussion: Party System Aggregation</title>
<p>Finally, we turn to H2: the extent of cross-district coordination in legislative elections. Only the proximity main effect term (β<sub>1</sub> in Equation 4) attains statistical significance in Model 6, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0010414012453694">Table 2</xref>. But as before, examining this table alone does not suffice: We need to calculate the marginal effect of proximate (concurrent) presidential elections to draw conclusions about H2. The second column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453694">Figure 2</xref> presents these estimated effects.</p>
<p>Akin to our findings regarding the number of electoral parties (H1), we see from this figure that with few presidential candidates, proximate presidential elections for moderately powerful to powerful presidencies are predicted to encourage cross-district coordination, in accordance with H2. This aggregatory effect is both statistically and substantively significant. For example, concurrent elections for a powerful president akin to that of the United States are predicted to decrease the difference between the national and district effective number of electoral parties in legislative elections by almost 1 (specifically, by 0.86) when there are two presidential candidates. Also comparable to our earlier findings, Model 6 fails to find a statistically significant aggregatory effect for proximate presidential elections with few presidential candidates when the presidency is very powerful, in accordance with H3. However, commensurate with H2 and contrary to our earlier findings, concurrent presidential elections with few presidential candidates are not predicted to have a significant aggregatory effect when the presidency is very weak, except in the unusual situation when the effective number of presidential candidates is less than 2 (specifically, at most 1.8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0010414012453694">39</xref></sup> Last but not least, with many presidential candidates (more than approximately four), Model 6 predicts that proximate presidential elections for powerful and all but the most extremely powerful presidencies can significantly discourage cross-district coordination in legislative contests. The latter is another facet of the inflationary shadow cast by elections for very powerful presidencies.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>On balance, we find evidence that the size of the presidential prize conditions the effect of presidential elections on the legislative party system, as hypothesized. Contrary to the empirical approach that the literature has taken up until now, all presidents are not created equal in terms of the shadows that their elections cast over legislative elections.</p>
<p>First, as the powers of the president increase, we found that the effect of an increase in the number of presidential candidates is amplified. Second, we found that when the presidency is moderately powerful to powerful, proximate presidential elections with few presidential candidates promote the <italic>nationalization</italic> and <italic>consolidation</italic> of the legislative party system, also known as the aggregatory and deflationary effect of presidential elections. However, this effect disappears when presidents are extremely powerful. There is also some evidence that presidential elections with few candidates will not promote the nationalization and consolidation of the legislative party system when the presidency is very weak. Although elections for figurehead presidents were found to have a statistically significant deflationary effect in our main model, this effect was quite small, required perfect coordination on two candidates in the presidential race, and disappeared in the alternative specifications. Nevertheless, this was contrary to our prediction. Future work might explore whether the arrow of causality instead runs from legislative to presidential elections in these regimes, as seems plausible. Third, proximate presidential elections with a large number of presidential candidates were found to significantly promote the <italic>denationalization</italic> and <italic>fragmentation</italic> of the legislative party system only when the presidency is powerful to extremely powerful.</p>
<p>Hence, this analysis has two important take-away lessons for constitutional engineers. First, if the goal is to use the presidency to develop fewer, more aggregated parties in the legislature, then ensure that the presidency is not very weak. Specifically, to produce the desired aggregatory and deflationary effect, the presidency should be at least moderately powerful—for example, a French-style president. Second, be wary of powerful presidencies, which at minimum may not contribute to the consolidation and aggregation of legislative party systems and at most may contribute to their fragmentation and deaggregation. If powerful presidencies are to promote the consolidation and aggregation of the legislative party system, they must be paired with electoral rules that will tend to produce few (ideally, two) presidential candidates, such as a simple plurality. However, for <italic>extremely</italic> powerful, “imperial” presidencies, it is not clear that even restrictive electoral rules will do the job: Two presidential candidates may still not suffice to produce a deflationary and aggregatory effect when the size of the presidential prize is this substantial.</p>

<p>A second factor is the degree to which policy-making authority is centralized in the national level of government vis-à-vis the subnational level, which has previously been called “vertical centralization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453694">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453694">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453694">Samuels, 2003</xref>). However, because the national level of government always exercises substantial authority in the post–World War II era, the vertical dimension effectively does not constrain the horizontal dimension for our cases. Little is therefore lost by focusing on horizontal centralization alone. Moreover, weak and contradictory findings have been obtained regarding vertical centralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453694">Chhibber &amp; Kollman, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453694">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453694">Hicken, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453694">Hicken &amp; Stoll, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453694">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453694">Samuels, 2003</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453694">Brancati, 2008</xref>).

This is an issue that future work should revisit. For now, we simply note that eliminating midterm elections from the analysis leads to similar conclusions about the hypotheses.

<p>In fused elections, voters cast a single ballot for the presidency and the legislature, but separate legislative and presidential electoral systems then translate the votes into seats (e.g., Bolivia since the 1980s). These elections bias the results in favor of finding an effect of presidential elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>, p. 38), which is why they have generally been excluded from quantitative analyses.</p>

<p>The Newey–West standard errors are modified for time series cross-sectional data and assume a first order autoregressive lag structure. We prefer the Newey–West robust estimator to the increasingly popular country-clustered because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453694">Kezdi (2004)</xref> has shown the latter to be biased when the number of clusters (countries) is fewer than 50, and we have only slightly more than this many countries in our data set. However, we note that using country-clustered instead of Newey–West robust standard errors does not substantively alter our conclusions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453694">Beck and Katz’s (1995)</xref> panel-corrected standard errors are not appropriate because there is little theoretical reason to expect cross-country contemporaneous correlation in our models, and it is moreover difficult to obtain a good estimate of this correlation when there are hardly any common time periods across countries, as is the case here.</p>

<p>This marginal effect is the partial derivative of Equation 2 with respect to proximity. Using the notation of Equation 2, it is calculated as follows: β<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>3</sub> ENPRES <sub>i, t</sub>. Marginal effects for other models are calculated similarly. The standard errors of these marginal effects are then calculated using the well-known rule for calculating the variance of sums of random variables. Note that these marginal effects represent the <italic>maximal</italic> effect of presidential elections, which it is conventional to report (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>We use 90% two-sided confidence intervals for two reasons: first, for consistency with previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453694">Golder, 2006</xref>, p. 41) and, second, because our hypotheses are directional, making one-sided tests technically more appropriate than two-sided tests, and 90% two-sided confidence intervals are equivalent to 95% one-sided confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Although not common, presidential elections with this many candidates are not rare, either: For example, in our data set, there are 32 legislative elections (about 5%) where the concurrent or preceding presidential election was contested by more than 4 presidential candidates. Legislative elections where the presidential election was contested by more than 6 presidential candidates are rarer (about 1%), but they still do occur (see below).</p>

<p>Something we do not explore here but that is worth considering is whether causality instead runs from legislative to presidential elections in these weak presidential regimes.</p>

<p>To ensure that these results were not being unduly driven by individual countries’ experiences, we separately eliminated elections in regimes with very powerful presidencies (those with an index score of at least 18). The only difference is that dropping post-1986 elections in the Philippines keeps the inflationary effect from attaining conventional levels of significance in Model 5. A future extension of this work is to expand the set of legislative elections in regimes with extremely powerful presidencies as new data become available and see whether the results still hold. Another is to identify and conduct case studies of quasi-experiments where presidential power has changed.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn39-0010414012453694">
<label>39.</label>
<p>This happens rarely (in approximately 6% of the legislative elections in presidential regimes in our data set), almost all occurrences of which are uncontested presidential elections.</p>
