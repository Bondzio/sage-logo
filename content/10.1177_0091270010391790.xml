<abstract>
<p>Ifosfamide (IFO), which is used in the treatment of pediatric solid tumors, causes high rates of nephrotoxicity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antidote for acetaminophen overdose, has been shown to prevent IFO-induced renal cell death and nephrotoxicity in both LLCPK-1 cells and a rat model. To facilitate the use of NAC in preventing IFO-induced nephrotoxicity in children, the authors compared the systemic exposure to NAC in children treated for acetaminophen overdose to the systemic exposure of the therapeutically effective rat model. The mean systemic exposure in the rat model was 18.72 mM·h (range, 9.92-30.02 mM·h), compared to the mean systemic exposure found in treated children (14.48 mM·h; range, 6.22-32.96 mM·h). They also report 2 pediatric cases in which NAC-attenuated acute renal failure associated with IFO when given concurrently with their chemotherapy treatment. Systemic exposure to NAC measured in 1 of these cases was comparable to that in the children treated for acetaminophen overdose. These results corroborate NAC’s potential to protect against IFO-induced nephrotoxicity in children when used in its clinically approved dose schedule and supports a clinical trial in children.</p>

<p>The chemotherapeutic agent ifosfamide (IFO) is widely used for the treatment of solid tumors in children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091270010391790">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091270010391790">2</xref></sup> Although highly effective, it is associated with high rates of both urotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091270010391790">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091270010391790">4</xref></sup> Although severe hemorrhagic cystitis can be effectively mitigated with the concurrent administration of 2-mercaptoenthansulphonate (MESNA),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091270010391790">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091270010391790">6</xref></sup> there is currently no preventive measure available for the serious nephrotoxicity. The importance of such prophylactic strategy becomes evident when considering the high rate of adverse renal effects occurring as a consequence of IFO therapy. It has been demonstrated that as many as 30% of children treated with IFO will have some degree of renal impairment, and 5% of these children will develop full-fledged Fanconi syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010391790">7</xref></sup> Although surviving their cancer, these children will continue to suffer from renal impairment throughout their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091270010391790">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ifosfamide is a prodrug metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4, 3A5, and 2B6, resulting in the production of several metabolites including the active antineoplastic agent IFO mustard, the urotoxic metabolite acrolein, and the nephrotoxic metabolite chloroacetaldehyde (CAA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091270010391790">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091270010391790">11</xref></sup> The nephrotoxic CAA has been identified by us to be produced in toxic quantities by the kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091270010391790">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091270010391790">15</xref></sup> The mechanism of CAA toxicity is believed to be primarily through oxidative stress with a critical depletion of glutathione (GSH). As a result of exposure to CAA, ATP depletion, increased lipid peroxidation, and decreased glutathione-S-transferase activity also occur in kidney cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010391790">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010391790">17</xref></sup> Increases in intracellular Ca<sup>+2</sup> and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-β2, and IL-6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091270010391790">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010391790">19</xref></sup> as well as decreased Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> exchanger activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010391790">20</xref></sup> have also been described. As a result of this mode of toxicity, the use of an antioxidant in the prevention of IFO-induced nephrotoxicity is biologically plausible.</p>
<p>N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant varying from the amino acid L-cysteine by 1 acetyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091270010391790">Figure 1</xref>). N-acetylcysteine provides protection as a GSH precursor, increasing its synthesis and replenishing its stores. It also increases glutathione-S-transferase activity, as well as neutralizes free radicals through its nucleophilic activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091270010391790">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091270010391790">23</xref></sup> It has current clinical use as a topical antimucolytic agent but primarily as an antidote for acetaminophen overdose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091270010391790">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091270010391790">25</xref></sup> Importantly, it has also been shown to have a protective effect on the kidney in ischemia/reperfusion injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091270010391790">26</xref></sup> and cisplatin and cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity in experimental systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091270010391790">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091270010391790">28</xref></sup> All of these characteristics suggest NAC as a potentially effective candidate for renal protection against IFO.</p>

<p>Using both in vitro and in vivo models, our group has successfully shown NAC to exhibit a protective effect against IFO-induced renal cell damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010391790">17</xref></sup> and nephrotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010391790">16</xref></sup> Attenuating both cell death and GSH depletion, NAC demonstrated the ability to protect LLCPK-1 cells against IFO-induced damage at a clinically relevant concentration (0.4 mM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091270010391790">17</xref></sup> Similarly in a rodent model, NAC conferred protection against depleted GSH levels, diminished GSH-S-transferase activity, elevated lipid peroxide levels, and morphological damage to the proximal tubules and glomeruli, all seen to occur as a result of IFO therapy. N-acetylcysteine also diminished the severity of tubule dysfunction with significant attenuation of elevated serum creatinine, as well as elevated beta 2-microglobulin and magnesium urinary excretion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091270010391790">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, despite being the drug of choice for acetaminophen overdose, there are very limited data on the pharmacokinetics of NAC in children, knowledge that is of critical importance in determining an effective therapeutic dose for preventing IFO-induced nephrotoxicity. The routine clinical use of intravenous (IV) NAC as a standard therapy in children poisoned by acetaminophen overdose provides not only information about its safety and efficacy in children but also an opportunity to explore its use in children affected by acetaminophen overdose, in the context of preventing IFO-induced nephrotoxicity. Blood samples are routinely drawn during treatment to assess acetaminophen levels and liver function, allowing us the opportunity to characterize the systemic exposure of NAC in children. Our objective was to compare the systemic exposure to NAC in children treated for acetaminophen overdose (in terms of area under the curve [AUC] over time) to the systemic exposure to NAC associated with prevention of nephrotoxicity in our experimental rat model. This pharmacokinetic comparison is critical in translating the systemic exposure associated with a therapeutic effect in the rat to the needed systemic exposure in children.</p>

<p>A 10-year-old girl was hospitalized at the University Children’s Hospital Belgrade, Serbia, with primitive neuroectodermal tumor and acute renal failure. Her tumor was aggressive with liver metastases. She underwent surgery; however, some tumor masses could not be removed. The patient received the following protocol:</p>

<title>Day 3</title>
<p>Ifosfamide 3g/m<sup>2</sup> and MESNA without NAC. After 12 hours, face fasciculations appeared, and electroencephalogram confirmed encephalopathy, so she underwent dialysis after 15 hours. After continuous dialysis, the patient recovered.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nephrotoxicity is a serious adverse effect of IFO therapy, affecting 30% of children treated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091270010391790">7</xref></sup> As this renal toxicity is likely mediated primarily by oxidative stress, the use of NAC, an antioxidant, as a prophylactic treatment for its prevention has been proposed. This study is one of the first to examine the pharmacokinetics of NAC in the pediatric age group. The goal of this study was to determine whether NAC plasma concentrations (in terms of AUC) in these young patients are producing sufficiently high systemic exposure compared to our successful experimental rat model. Our results show that therapeutically effective levels of NAC in preventing IFO-induced nephrotoxicity in a rat model are comparable to systemic exposure in children being treated with the 20-hour IV NAC protocol for acetaminophen overdose. Mean systemic exposure in the rat model was 18.72 mM·h, compared to 14.48 mM·h in children. The distribution of systemic exposures in the rat model and in children was also similar, with the lowest exposures being 9.92 mM·h and 6.22 mM·h in the rat model and in children, respectively. Similarly, the highest range systemic exposure seen in the rat model and in children was 30.02 mM·h and 32.96 mM·h, respectively. These results suggest that the current therapy of NAC for pediatric acetaminophen overdose shows promise in providing renal protection for children who are on IFO therapy. These results have been corroborated by us by 2 cases of IFO-induced nephrotoxicity, where NAC appeared to mitigate nephrotoxicity. Measurement of NAC in 1 case further corroborates the level of systemic exposure to NAC needed to protect against nephrotoxicity. Out of these 2 cases described by us, 1 child was dialyzed, and hence in said case clinical improvement may not be directly related to NAC. A randomized control trial is needed to quantify the efficacy of NAC for IFO-induced nephrotoxicity.</p>
<p>Of importance, in comparing the systemic exposure of the rats and children, the systemic exposure in the pediatric acetaminophen overdose cases might have been an underestimate. Blood obtained for calculating the AUC of NAC in children was based on discarded samples; therefore, we were limited in our ability to obtain a specific preset number of samples or samples at predetermined time points. On AUC calculation, we had to assume that the highest NAC concentration measured was the peak concentration, although blood levels could potentially still be increasing; hence, our calculated AUC is an underestimation of the actual systemic exposure. In addition, the difference in length of treatment between the rat model and the children has to be considered. Our therapeutically effective rat model was treated with NAC for 6 days, whereas children treated for acetaminophen overdose were treated only once for a 20-hour period. Our goal was to conclude if the 20-hour IV protocol provides an overall systemic exposure equivalent to the rat model, in terms of total body exposure to NAC not length of exposure. However, we may also consider that children receiving a similar number of NAC treatments as those in the rat model would achieve a systemic exposure that well exceeds the AUCs found to be therapeutically effective in our rodent model. Moreover, there are descriptions of NAC protocols for pediatric acetaminophen toxicity that extend several days.</p>
<p>Although several antioxidants, including resveratrol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091270010391790">19</xref></sup> melatonin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091270010391790">20</xref></sup> taurine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091270010391790">29</xref></sup> glycine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091270010391790">30</xref></sup> L-histidinol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091270010391790">31</xref></sup> and thymoquinone,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091270010391790">32</xref></sup> have also been shown to prevent IFO-induced nephrotoxicity in rat models, in the clinical setting, NAC is currently the only 1 approved for and commonly used in children. Although the antioxidants melatonin and resveratrol are being assessed for use in children for sleep disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091270010391790">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091270010391790">34</xref></sup> and obesity prevention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091270010391790">35</xref></sup> little to no information on their safety in children is available, making their use for an alternative indication, such as renal protection during IFO therapy, years from being realized. N-acetylcysteine is widely used clinically in both children and adults as treatment for acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen is the most regularly used pain-relieving agent worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091270010391790">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091270010391790">37</xref></sup> and is the most common cause of both intentional and unintentional drug overdoses. In the United States, more than 30 000 hospitalizations occur annually involving acetaminophen overdose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091270010391790">38</xref></sup> Because NAC is used as an antidote under these circumstances, this provides a wealth of information on the safety and efficacy of NAC in children. This information is critical when assessing the use of NAC for an alternative indication in children, in this case renal protective strategies when using nephrotoxic agent, and from a time perspective makes NAC the most relevant choice.</p>
<p>The most commonly used protocol for acetaminophen overdose is the 20-hour IV protocol, which has been used for decades by Canada, Europe, and Australia and since 2004 by the United States. The 20-hour IV protocol includes a 150 mg/kg loading dose infused for 60 minutes and 2 maintenance IV doses: 50 mg/kg for 4 hours and 100 mg/kg for 16 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091270010391790">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091270010391790">40</xref></sup> As this is the standard therapy associated with acetaminophen overdose in Canada, the systemic exposures of NAC measured in our patients adequately represent this course of therapy. Overall, it provides a total of 300 mg/kg of NAC over 20 hours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0091270010391790">Table III</xref>). Before 2004 in the United States, a 72-hour oral protocol for NAC was the standard therapy in cases of acetaminophen overdose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091270010391790">40</xref></sup> This protocol includes a 140 mg/kg loading dose, followed by seventeen 70 mg/kg maintenance doses every 4 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091270010391790">41</xref></sup> It allows a total of 1330 mg/kg over 72 hours or 53.2 to 133 mg/kg systemically over 72 hours in consideration of the oral bioavailability of NAC, found to range from 4% to 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091270010391790">42</xref></sup> Alternatively, a 36-hour oral protocol and 48-hour IV protocol have also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091270010391790">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091270010391790">44</xref></sup> Although the 36-hour protocol is a truncated version of the 72-hour oral protocol, the 48-hour IV protocol involves a 140 mg/kg loading dose and twelve 70 mg/kg maintenance doses every 4 hours, providing of total of 980 mg/kg over 48 hours. When compared in terms of safety and efficacy in treating acetaminophen overdose, all 3 protocols, the 20-hour IV, 48-hour IV, and 72-hour oral protocols, were found to be equivalent, with the 48-hour and 72-hour protocols appearing superior in late-treated patients. In the context of this translational research, a 2- to 3-fold higher systemic exposure to NAC than the one used by us has also been shown to be safe in children. This may be of importance if the pharmacodynamics of NAC in IFO-induced nephrotoxicity necessitate more NAC than was effective in the rat model.</p>

<p>In terms of safety, both oral NAC and IV NAC have been shown to be safe with an uncommon incidence of adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091270010391790">45</xref></sup> Nausea and vomiting are common side effects associated with administration of both oral and IV NAC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091270010391790">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091270010391790">47</xref></sup> Anaphylactoid reactions are more commonly associated with IV NAC, as opposed to oral NAC, occurring at a rate of 0% to 48%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091270010391790">45</xref></sup> This is thought to be attributed to the infusion rate; however, most cases are minor and easily manageable.

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to determine NAC pharmacokinetics in a pediatric age group. The conventional dosage schedule used in the 20-hour IV NAC treatment for acetaminophen overdose in children produced systemic exposure comparable to that of our rat model associated with therapeutic effect in nephrotoxicity prevention. Similarly, with NAC protocols that provide an overall higher dose existing, the ability to achieve systemic exposures closer to or greater than our successfully treated rodent model becomes possible, even further supporting the use of NAC for this alternative indication. We describe here the first 2 case reports of NAC given during IFO therapy, associated with successful prevention of acute renal toxicity. Case report 1 presents the successful use of the 20-hour IV protocol, and case 2 shows the successful use of oral NAC (600 mg orally, twice per day), despite its low oral bioavailability (4%-10%). These cases suggest not only that the current NAC protocol used for acetaminophen overdose, for which pharmacokinetics in children was assessed in this study, will be successful as a prophylactic treatment for IFO-induced nephrotoxicity but that other formulations and doses may also provide adequate protection. These cases also corroborate the safe and effective use of NAC in children, as reported by previous studies. Together with our recent data on the lack of effect of NAC on IFO efficacy (unpublished), the present study, as well as the case reports, further strengthens the choice of NAC as a therapeutic option to prevent IFO nephrotoxicity in children. Our results support a randomized control trial to quantify the effects of NAC on IFO nephrotoxicity. Based on the preliminary clinical results available to us, it is reasonable to consider NAC treatment when the first signs of IFO-induced nephrotoxicity emerge. Furthermore, our study looks at the systemic exposure in children treated only with the standard 20-hour IV protocol; the existence of protocols varying in route of administration, overall dose, and length affords future opportunity to assess the utility of such protocols.</p>

<p>Blood samples were obtained from children and adolescents who were admitted for acetaminophen overdose while being treated with IV NAC at the Children’s Hospital of Western Ontario (London, Ontario) and from hospitals surrounding the Greater Toronto Area and counseled by the Ontario Poison Control Center in Toronto. All children received the recommended dosing schedule for acetaminophen at 150 mg/kg for 60 minutes, 50 mg/kg for the next 4 hours, and 100 mg/kg for another 16 hours. Blood samples were collected during routine measurements of acetaminophen levels and liver function tests according to the management schedule at the hospital. We received discarded blood samples from these patients after these routine measurements were completed. The number of blood samples varied among patients as per the discretion of their treating physicians. It is a standard practice to keep the blood samples that have already been analyzed for 1 week in the core laboratory. We were notified of any cases. Additional information on gender, date of birth, and the time NAC therapy was started was collected for each patient. In a parallel line of investigation, we have documented the stability of NAC in frozen samples for more than a month.</p>
<p>Two pediatric case reports were also obtained describing 2 children receiving IFO in combination therapy who developed acute renal failure and were subsequently treated with NAC.

<p>Total NAC concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography, modified from the method of Jacobsen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091270010391790">53</xref></sup> To reduce surface tension, N-isoamyl alcohol was added to each sample, followed by sodium borohydride, which was used as a reducing agent for dithiol bonds. After a brief incubation, hydrochloric acid was added to neutralize excess sodium borohydride. Thiols in the samples were derivatized with monobromobimane, a fluorescent labeling agent. To prevent any large proteins from eluding through the chromatography column, perchloric acid was used to precipitate the proteins, after which the samples were centrifuged at 9000 g for 5 minutes. To neutralize the acid, the sample pH was raised to 3.5 by adding a solution of 2 M citrate in 10 M sodium hydroxide. The samples were centrifuged at 9000 g for an additional 3 minutes. One hundred microliters of the supernatant of each sample were transferred into a glass insert, and 5 uL was injected into a 15 cm × 3.9 mm, 5 u Novapak C18 column maintained at 40°C in a Hewlett Packard 1090 LC.

Analytes were separated with a CHIRAL-AGP column (150 × 4.0 mm, 5 µM, Chrom Tech, Apple Valley, Minnesota) using 10 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH, 7.00) (A) and 30 mM ammonium acetate in water (pH 4.00) (B) with the following gradient: time 0.0 minutes, A 5 100%, flow 400 mL/min; time 4.5 minutes, A 5 50%, flow 400 mL/min; time 7.10 minutes, A 5 100%, flow 600 mL/minute. Samples were introduced into the chromatographic system using an Agilent 1100 Series Autosampler (Agilent Technologies). Analysis was carried out under ambient temperatures. The mass spectrometric detection was performed on an LC-MS/MS API4000 Triple-Quadrupole (Applied Biosystems, MDS SCIEX, Foster City, California) equipped with an API turbo ion spray ionization (PIS) source. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode, and the analytes were quantified using multiple reactions monitored. The transitions monitored for IFO were m/z 261.1 to 154. The ion spray voltage was set at 5.5 kV, and the source temperature was maintained at 500°C. Data acquisition was performed using MDS-SCIEX Analyst software (version 1.4).</p>
