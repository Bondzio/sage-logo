<p>Any study on the historical development of Xinjiang is inseparable from that of Central Asia because of geographical, ethnic, cultural and religious affinity between the two entities. Over the last two decades several books, monographs and articles on different aspects and issues related to Xinjiang and Central Asia have been published. Michael E. Clarke, the author of the book under review, himself co-edited a book titled <italic>China, Xinjiang and Central Asia: History, Transition and Crossborder Interaction in the 21st Century</italic> in 2009. In the latest volume, Clarke has attempted to systematically explore two separate ‘tracks’ or themes—the evolution of the Chinese state’s integrationist strategies in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and the impact of the strategies on Chinese foreign policy in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The focus and core arguments of the book, as the author writes in the preface, were sketched out nearly a decade ago when he decided to work on Xinjiang for his doctoral study. Despite the long period of gestation of the book, the two concepts of his arguments—territoriality and governmentality—proved to be more valid and robust after the violent unrest in early July 2009 in the XUAR capital Urumqi.</p>
<p>The book starts with an excellent analysis of the July riots and cites five government responses following the incident. Like many observers on the contemporary politics of Xinjiang, Clarke pointed out the somewhat incongruous responses of the Chinese government to the violence in Urumqi. The central leadership seemed to be completely taken aback by the development in the region which, according to the author, ‘appeared more secure than at any previous time in the sixty-year history of the PRC’ (p. 2). The Chairman of Hong Kong-based Southern Democratic Alliance, Long Weiwen, in his blog described this as an outstanding weakness of Chinese administration in Xinjiang. He noted that despite the presence of all high-ranking cadres in the country, President Hu Jintao cut short his visit to Italy where he was attending a G-20 summit meeting and returned to China (Long 2009). Why is the leadership so uncertain about the future of Xinjiang? Why does the Chinese party-state remain as sensitive as ever regarding its position in Xinjiang? Why does China often need to issue statements that Xinjiang is an inseparable part of the national territory?</p>
<p>The first ‘track’ of the book explains why China is not confident about its rule in Xinjiang. The author has captured well the issue of integration of Xinjiang in three questions: ‘what was defined and claimed as constituting “China’s Xinjiang”, who was deemed to constitute the population of the region and thus became Chinese citizens, and finally, how-through what strategies, techniques or policies-has the Chinese state sought to make good on these claims?’ (p. 2). According to Clarke, the main source of weakness of Chinese rule in the region is that Xinjiang from the nineteenth century onwards can be ‘seen as an integral yet uncompleted part of the territorialisation’ (p. 2) of modern China. The author develops his argument on the basis of Charles Maier’s definition of territoriality. In this sense, Westphalian sovereignty is a system of political authority based on territory and autonomy. According to this line of argument, conquering and holding supreme authority over a territory and even getting recognition by the international community do not necessarily make a region an integral part of a nation-state. Territoriality in this sense is not just an acquisition of territory or creating a security buffer, but a means of power and rule (p. 6).</p>
<p>Here, Clarke establishes a connection between territoriality and the other concept of his core arguments which he has borrowed from Michel Foucault’s idea of governmentality and ‘permanent provocation’ in power relations. It is argued that the manner in which the central government intended to address the issue of population and power relationship in XUAR since 1949 have constituted a system that continuously provokes the ethnic subjects to revolt for freedom. This has also shaped the state’s perception of Xinjiang and its strategies and tactics for the integration which has at its ‘core a concern to establish legitimacy of Chinese sovereignty in the eyes of the region’s non-Han population’ (p. 5). The above two concepts, which appeared vital in the beginning of the book have unfortunately however, not been given due importance anywhere else in the book, other than the mere reference to them again in the concluding chapter.</p>
<p>The third major argument in the book derives from the above discussion. Clarke contends that under the PRC, Xinjiang is no longer considered as a strategic buffer region in the traditional sense, but treated as a potential strategic and economic asset that can actively contribute to the power of the nation-state. The book suggests that there exists a three-tiered pattern of interests and a complementary relationship between Xinjiang, Central Asia and ‘grand-strategy derived interests’ which not only shape China’s diplomacy in Central Asia but also its approaches to the governance of Xinjiang. By grand strategy, the author means China’s quest for ‘peaceful rise’ and its vision of inter-state relations as opposed to the West (pp. 6–7). Based on this, he develops the central argument of his book, that ‘China’s foreign policy in Central Asia has reflected the preeminence of the goal of integration for Xinjiang, with an emphasis placed on the establishment of political, economic and infrastructural links with the Central Asian states’ (p. 176).</p>
<p>The author argues that in order to acquire legitimacy for its rule over Xinjiang, China in two distinct phases adopted two distinct integrationist approaches—the revolutionary Maoist model and the reformist model based on economic growth and development. The major portion of the book deals with the issue of integration starting from the Qing conquest in 1750 to the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. All the chapters of the book throw light on the influence of Central Asia in the political, economic, social and cultural development of Xinjiang, but the penultimate chapter is especially devoted to establishing connections between integration of Xinjiang and China’s grand strategic ambition of securing its power status in Central Asia.</p>
<p>The evolution of the state’s integrationist strategies has been traced in the pre-modern expansionism of the peripheral lands of imperial China especially since the mid-Qing period (Chapter 2). Some of the weakest arguments of the book are where the author seems to have uncritically accepted Owen Lattimore’s views based on ecological determinism. There is no denying that imperial China had a very limited period of effective control over Xinjiang, but it is hardly convincing to state that geographical and ecological factors are responsible for this. Recent studies on Lattimore suggests that he had began to question his own ‘systemic theory of human-environmental reciprocal integration’ and to acknowledge that nature only has a very limited role in shaping human history (Rowe 2007: 765).</p>
<p>The author has rightly mentioned that the initial goal of the Qing rule in Xinjiang was not to integrate but to segregate and isolate the region from China (p. 18). The tendency of withdrawal from the region is evident even in periods when China had a strong hold over the region such as, for example, in the Qing court’s hesitation on sending Gen. Zuo Zongtang to carry out military campaigns against Yaqub Beg in the second half of the nineteenth century (p. 26). Yang Zengxin, the first of the three warlords of Xinjiang in the Republican period, in fact, enhanced his authority in the region by segregating it from China proper (p. 29). Even in the last leg of the Republican period, Chinese officials considered the costs and benefits of maintaining or relinquishing Xinjiang (p. 41). This is possibly the main reason why Chinese penetration in Xinjiang remained weak until the PRC abandoned the traditional strategy of integration characterised by indirect rule after taking charge of the region in 1949.</p>
<p>Between 1949 and 1976, communist China focused on integration of Xinjiang into the political and economic system of the country. The methods followed during this period can be termed as revolutionary, assimilationist and isolationist. In contrast to the previous phase, the central government during this period made great efforts to insulate Xinjiang from Soviet Central Asia (Chapter 3). The next three chapters cover the development of Xinjiang in the three decades of the reform period. The reform leadership was ready to provide political space for the region’s ethnic minorities in exchange for their allegiance to the reform policies in the first decade. Externally, Xinjiang was however still under the Soviet threat until the mid-1980s (Chapter 4).</p>
<p>The significance of Central Asia in shaping PRC’s integrationist strategies in Xinjiang began to increase following the collapse of Soviet Union and the establishment of independent Central Asian states. In the post-Cold War period, the threat to Chinese rule in Xinjiang had changed from that of state to non-state movements and organisations. It was against this backdrop, that China redesigned its grand strategy of integration of Xinjiang and foreign policy towards Central Asian countries (Chapters 5 and 6). According to the author, China’s integrationist policy in the post-1991 period is based on the ‘double-opening’ to both the rest of China and Central Asia. This new strategy also ensures significant security, economic and strategic benefits for China and has helped to further consolidate Beijing’s control over Xinjiang and the expansion of Chinese power in Central Asia (p. 149).</p>
<p>Clarke develops his central argument by combining three major developments in the areas of China’s regional economy and foreign policy—the Great Western Development (GWD) strategy, multilateral (new regionalism) and bilateral (vassalisation) relations with Central Asia and a grand strategy of ‘peaceful rise’ (Chapter 7). It is however questionable whether the policy of using economic development through GWD to mitigate ethnic tension and maintain stability in Xinjiang has been successful. There is no doubt that China has not only dissuaded the Central Asian countries from providing any support to Uyghur separatist groups but that these countries are also willing to impose strict restrictions on the life of ordinary Uyghur citizens. However, it does not really make any sense to view China’s bilateral relations with the Central Asian countries as vassalisation on basis of these countries’ treatment of the Uyghur cause—there are several other dimensions to the bilateral relations between China and the Central Asian countries. Moreover, not only has the violence in Urumqi proved the weakness of China’s integrationist policy in Xinjiang, it is now even more evident that China is far from realising its grand vision of developing an alternative to existing inter-state relations.</p>
