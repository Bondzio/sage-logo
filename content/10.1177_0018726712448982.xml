<p>It has been over 30 years since China embarked on its new economic development strategy that has resulted in the dramatic and sustained economic growth rates unparalleled for large economies during the last five decades. This rapid economic growth has been accompanied by transformations in most arenas, such as economic policy, trade, education, internal and external migration, law, and managerial practices, all of which have been the subject of considerable scholarship.</p>
<p>There is comparatively little published scholarship (in English) about how the economic transformation in China is influencing changes in the nature and quality of work, employment conditions, the strategies of workers, unions and labour activist organizations (NGOs), and on the nature and quality of labour-management relations in China. The absence of abundant scholarship in this area (in contrast to scholarship on human resource management) is striking given current developments, particularly the growth of informal employment and labour militancy (there has been a very large number of work stoppages and strikes during the last few years).</p>
<p>Several recent developments make this call for papers opportune –</p>
