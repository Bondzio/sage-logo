<p>“What can you do for yourself, your students, your school, your community, your state, and your nation in the name of gifted education?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What does teacher professionalism mean? Standards from various stakeholders including the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the National Association for Gifted Children (NAGC), and the Council for Exceptional Children–The Association for the Gifted (CEC-TAG) havїe clearly articulated knowledge and skill standards for teachers of the gifted. These standards frequently guide the level of expectations for educators working with gifted children.</p>
<p>However, as Coleman, Gallagher, and Job explain, the definition of “professionalism” has evolved and includes not only knowledge of research-based practices and the skills to implement them but also reflective thinking and the production of new knowledge and skills. Moreover, professionals are now expected to collaborate with others and fill leadership roles in an increasingly complex and diverse society. The articles in this issue elaborate and describe different thoughts and perspectives about professionalism for preservice teachers, in-service teachers, and teachers continuing their professional growth.</p>
<p>Johnsen focuses on a comparison of four sets of teacher standards in the field. This foundation defines professional competence and helps to legitimize the field. Moreover, research suggests that standards have a positive effect on professional competence and offer guidance for developing programs at the university, state, and local levels.</p>
<p>VanTassel-Baska provides an overview of the Classroom Observation Scale (COS-R) for analyzing differentiation in the classroom for this very purpose. She reinforces the need for a more systematic approach to observing teacher behaviors that promote differentiation.</p>
<p>Alternative routes to teacher education are presented in Kaplan’s article. She provides a comparison of the general components of alternative routes in general education teacher preparation with alternative routes to gifted education teacher preparation. She warns practitioners to be vigilant of the means in which programs become alternative and to be aware of the existing political climate in which such programs emerge.</p>
<p>Roberts and Siegle emphasize the role of the teacher as an advocate. They provide a clear and concise set of guidelines for getting involved. They raise the question, “If not you, then who?” With this challenge in mind, one cannot fail to become involved in being an advocate for gifted education.</p>
<p>Berman, Schultz, and Weber relate how in-service teachers, preservice teacher candidates, and preservice education students viewed gifted and talented students and teacher training that is specific to the nature and needs of gifted and talented learners. Preconceived beliefs appear to guide the willingness and approaches used to teach children.</p>
<p>Coleman, Gallagher, and Job explore a new paradigm of professionalism. They recommend a shared vision with a long-range plan of action, the development of fidelity with flexibility tools to describe and clarify best practices, and the creation of a collaborative infrastructure to support professionalism in practice.</p>
<p>On a lighter yet just as serious note, Delisle brings us the 5 <italic>C</italic>s of student engagement: <italic>c</italic>ontrol, <italic>c</italic>omplexity, <italic>c</italic>ommon bonds, <italic>c</italic>hoice, and <italic>c</italic>aring teachers. It brings the voices and ideas of the students regarding their education.</p>
<p>There is a wealth of information to digest in these articles. Reflect on your own practice. What can you do for yourself, your students, your school, your community, your state, and your nation in the name of gifted education? Could this be the key in which the answer to what is teacher professionalism lies?</p>
