<abstract>
<p>This study compared perceptions of adolescents’ friendships between adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents, examined factors associated with friendship qualities, and investigated the adolescents’ reports on the activities they did with friends and how activity patterns differed by gender. Ninety-one adolescents with an ASD and their parents completed mail-based surveys during the summer months. Adolescents with an ASD identified more friends than did their parents, but they agreed on the friends’ characteristics. About half of the adolescents spent an average of 4 hours per day with friends during the summer months. Male adolescents with an ASD most frequently played video games with friends, whereas females most frequently had conversations with friends. The findings suggest that adolescents with an ASD and their parents identify different peers as the adolescent’s friends. The findings also reveal similarities and differences in friendships between adolescents with an ASD and typically developing adolescents.</p>

<p>Social impairments and difficulties with social communication and interpersonal interaction are core features of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362361311416380">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). These social impairments affect the ability of individuals with an ASD to develop and maintain friendships, which require an ability to understand what another person is thinking and feeling. Moreover, social skill impairments do not lessen over time. Impairment and distress may increase as children with an ASD approach adolescence. Adolescence may be particularly difficult for adolescents with an ASD as the social environment becomes more complex and the adolescents become more aware of their social impairment (Tantam, 2003).</p>
<p>Difficulties in establishing peer relationships are frequently observed in adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but friendships are not completely absent in individuals with an ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362361311416380">Bauminger et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362361311416380">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362361311416380">Howard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362361311416380">Orsmond et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Kasari (2000)</xref> found that children with an ASD have an average of two best friends, and children with an ASD reported fewer friends than their mothers did. Bauminger and colleagues, based on maternal reports, found that children and adolescents with an ASD were more likely to have friends who were of similar age, gender and disability status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362361311416380">Bauminger et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362361311416380">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman, 2003</xref>). Their research also indicates that children and adolescents with an ASD perceive less closeness, intimacy and help than do their peers who are typically developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362361311416380">Bauminger et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1362361311416380">Solomon et al., 2011</xref>). In our previous research we found that adolescents with an ASD spend less time with peers compared with the time spent with adults and paid professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362361311416380">Orsmond and Kuo, 2011</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1362361311416380">Solish et al. (2010)</xref> also found that children with an ASD, as compared with typically developing children, were more likely to engage in social activities with their parents and other adults than with their peers.</p>
<p>Previous research on friendships in adolescents with an ASD has been limited by small sample sizes, the inclusion of only school-age children with an ASD or the use of mixed samples with both children and adolescents, and the focus on individuals who had at least one friend. The present study explored friendship characteristics of adolescents with an ASD and their activity patterns with friends. We focused exclusively on adolescence because it is a period when peer relationships are the most significant factor associated with adolescents’ quality of life and may take precedence over family relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362361311416380">Helseth and Misvær, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>To our knowledge, only one study compared mother and child reports of number of friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>), and there are no studies of whether individuals with an ASD would identify the same people as their friends as their parents or caregivers do. The first goal of this study was to investigate friendship characteristics of adolescents with an ASD in terms of number of friends and friends’ characteristics (e.g. age, gender, with or without disabilities). We also examined agreement between adolescent and parent perceptions of the adolescents’ friendships, as well as the potential factors (e.g. adolescents’ characteristics, friends’ characteristics) that may be associated with adolescents’ friendships.</p>
<p>Companionship, or doing things together, is one of the features of friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362361311416380">Berndt, 1996</xref>). It helps maintain the relationship, and is a way to make the relationship stronger and closer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362361311416380">Aboud and Mendelson, 1996</xref>). Research shows that typically developing adolescents spend 52% of their waking time with friends and 19% with family per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362361311416380">Csikszentmihalyi and Larson, 1984</xref>). When with friends, typically developing adolescents are likely to attend parties and dances; to attend popular entertainment events, such as movies and concerts, and watch television; and to participate in sports and sporting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362361311416380">Fuligni and Stevenson, 1995</xref>). Generally, the amount of time with friends increases throughout adolescence for girls but not for boys, who spend a stable amount of time with friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362361311416380">Larson and Richards, 1991</xref>). As adolescents get older, they, especially girls, spend more time with opposite-gender peers than with same-gender peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362361311416380">Csikszentmihalyi and Larson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362361311416380">Richards et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Companionship has been reported to be a primary focus in the friendships of adolescents with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362361311416380">Matheson et al., 2007</xref>). Research, based on maternal reports, shows that adolescents with an ASD spend only 14% of their waking time with friends and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362361311416380">Orsmond and Kuo, 2011</xref>), which is considerably less than typically developing adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362361311416380">Fuligni and Stevenson, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman (2003)</xref>, also based on maternal reports, found that children with an ASD spent time with friends less frequently than typically developing children. When together, they frequently played board games, talked together, played on the computer, and watched video and/or television with their friends.</p>
<p>Information on how children and adolescents with an ASD spend time with friends has previously been based mainly on qualitative data collected from mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman, 2003</xref>). Because mothers are not together with their adolescents all day, they are not able to account for the adolescents’ time as accurately as the adolescents themselves. Accordingly, the second goal of this study was to collect data directly from adolescents with an ASD to explore the activities they engage in with their friends, the gender differences in activity patterns, and the types of friends with whom the adolescents spend time. By conducting this study, we hoped to expand current knowledge on friendships of individuals with an ASD. We also hoped to better understand the opportunities and social environments that adolescents with an ASD encounter.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1362361311416380">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through clinical practitioners or private school teachers who were working with adolescents with an ASD, advertisements posted on autism-related web pages, forums, or e-newsletters. Participants were also recruited with the assistance of the Interactive Autism Network (IAN) Research Database at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins Medicine – Baltimore, sponsored by the Autism Speaks Foundation.</p>
<p>A short telephone interview with the parents of the adolescent was conducted to assess whether the adolescent met the inclusion criteria: (1) the adolescent had a reading level at 5th grade or higher, so that the adolescent could complete the measures independently (a 5th-grade reading level criterion was chosen because it is the lowest required reading level for our measures); (2) the adolescent had been diagnosed with an ASD by a licensed professional; and (3) the adolescent scored 15 points or higher on the lifetime form of the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362361311416380">Rutter et al., 2003</xref>) administered during the phone interview. Adolescents and parents each received a $20 gift card as compensation for their participation in the research.</p>

<sec id="section3-1362361311416380">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and nineteen screens via phone interview were conducted with parents; 113 adolescents qualified for the study and 6 adolescents did not meet inclusion criteria. A total of 91 adolescents and their parents completed the surveys, resulting in an 81% completion rate. The data were collected during summer months (May 2009 to August 2009). Participants were from 27 states in the United States. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362361311416380">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1362361311416380">2</xref> show the demographic characteristics of the adolescents with an ASD and their parents, respectively.</p>

<title>Adolescents with an ASD</title>
<p>Adolescents with an ASD ranged in age from 12 to 18 years and were on average 14.8 years old. More boys (n = 74) than girls (n = 18) participated, which corresponds to the epidemiology of this population. Most adolescents attended junior high or middle school, and only one adolescent attended an ungraded special education program. About half of them had a reading level higher than their education level by parent report. More than half were diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome. They were diagnosed on average at 7 years old, mostly by psychologists. Almost half of them were co-diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Only six adolescents had intellectual disability. Almost all adolescents could speak in full sentences, and almost everything they said could be understood by a stranger. All adolescents were co-residing with their parent(s).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1362361311416380">
<title>Parents</title>
<p>Parents were on average 47 years old. Ninety-two percent of parents who completed the surveys were mothers, and 2% were fathers. Only one parent was African American, and the others were white non-Hispanic. Most parents had at least a bachelor degree, were married, and had either a full-time or a part-time job. The median household income of our participants in 2008 was $85,000, which is considerably higher than the 2008 US median household income ($52,029; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1362361311416380">U.S. Department of Commerce, 2009</xref>), although a range of incomes was represented.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1362361311416380">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>In this study, we collected data from adolescents with an ASD and their parents through mail-based paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Adolescents were asked to complete two activity reports about their time spent with friends and one questionnaire about their relationship with their best friend. Parents were asked to complete one questionnaire about family background information and adolescents’ friends, as well as the current form of the SCQ about the adolescents’ autism symptoms. Parents completed the lifetime form of the SCQ during the phone screening interviews.</p>
<sec id="section7-1362361311416380">
<title>Background information and friend’s characteristics</title>
<p>The questionnaire for the parents asked comprehensive background information, including adolescent characteristics (e.g. age, gender, language skills), and family characteristics (e.g. parental education status, household income). The parent questionnaire also contained a friendship grid, which was based on the Playmates and Friends: Questionnaire for Teachers, Revised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362361311416380">Goldman and Buysse, 2005</xref>). The friendship grid queried information about the adolescent’s first three closest friends. The information included the friend’s first name, age, gender, type of friend (friend from school, friend from the neighborhood, friend from sports or leisure, childhood friend, friend of the family, cousin, brother/sister, boyfriend/girlfriend), the duration that the adolescent and the friend have known each other, and whether the friend had a disability or not. Adolescents with an ASD were also asked to report their first three closest friends’ names, ages, genders, and types of friends (friend from school, friend from the neighborhood, friend from sports or leisure, childhood friend, friend of the family, cousin, brother/sister, boyfriend/girlfriend). Parents and adolescents were instructed to report the friends in the order of closeness, beginning with the closest friend.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1362361311416380">
<title>Activities engaged in with friends</title>
<p>Adolescents were asked to complete one activity report for an upcoming weekday and one for an upcoming weekend day. They were instructed to fill out the activity reports at the end of their chosen day. The activity reports asked adolescents about their time spent with friends. First, adolescents were asked whether they spent time with friend(s); if yes, they were asked to report what activities they did with the friend(s). They were asked to report the gender of the friend(s) with whom they engaged in activities by choosing one of the following categories: a male friend, a female friend, a group of male friends, a group of female friends, and a group of male and female friends. A total of 175 activities done with friends were reported by the adolescents. The reported activities were coded by the first author and a graduate student (who was blind to the study purposes). The activities were coded into the following categories: eating, doing physical activities, doing outdoor activities, doing education-related activities, having a conversation, surfing websites, watching TV/movies, visiting, playing, reading, listening to music, hanging out, participating in a community excursion, doing artistic activities, playing video games, and other. Appendix A shows the definition of each category.</p>
<p>An inter-rater reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic was performed to determine consistency among the two raters. The inter-rater reliability Kappa was .939 (p &lt; .001), which indicated an almost perfect agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362361311416380">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>). Discrepancies were coded by a second graduate student using the same coding scheme. The codes that the majority of raters chose were used in the analyses. When three coders chose different codes, the first and the second authors made a consensus decision about which code was the most appropriate.</p>

<title>Autism symptoms</title>
<p>The lifetime form and the current form of the SCQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362361311416380">Rutter et al., 2003</xref>) were used as a screener to verify diagnosis and as a tool to evaluate adolescents’ current level of symptoms, respectively. Both the lifetime form and the current form of the SCQ include 40 yes-no items. The lifetime form of the SCQ was used to screen participants during the phone interview. The items in the lifetime form include questions regarding reciprocal social interaction; language and communication; and repetitive, stereotyped patterns of behavior. A cutoff score of 15 was established and it was determined that individuals scoring at or above that level are likely to have an ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362361311416380">Rutter et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The items in the current form of the SCQ examined adolescents’ symptoms over the most recent 3-month period. Parents were asked to complete the current form when they completed the mailed questionnaire. The scoring method in the current form is similar to that in the lifetime form. Also, the sub-scores in the current form were developed on the basis of three domains of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R): the reciprocal social interaction domain; the communication domain; and the restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1362361311416380">Rutter et al., 2003</xref>). Studies have reported good psychometric properties of the SCQ in terms of its sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362361311416380">Chandler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362361311416380">Witwer and Lecavalier, 2008</xref>) and correlations with the ADI-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1362361311416380">Witwer and Lecavalier, 2008</xref>).

<title>Friendship qualities</title>
<p>The Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362361311416380">Bukowski et al., 1994</xref>) was used to assess adolescents’ perceptions of their friendship qualities. Adolescents were asked to answer the questions on the FQS in reference to the relationship with their best friend. If the adolescent did not have a best friend, they could skip the FQS. This 23-item self-report scale measures five dimensions of friendship – companionship, closeness, helpfulness, security, and conflict. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strong disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), and the total score is calculated using the mean score in each dimension. High scores reflect friendships perceived to be high in the named dimension. Scores on companionship, closeness, helpfulness, and security were averaged to create a single variable measuring the ‘positive qualities’ of friendship. The conflict subscale was not aggregated with the others. Good validity and reliability of the FQS have been reported by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362361311416380">Bukowski et al., 1994</xref>). The FQS has been successfully completed by children and adolescents with an ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362361311416380">Bauminger et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362361311416380">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1362361311416380">Whitehouse et al., 2009</xref>).

<title>Friendship characteristics</title>
<p>We examined friendship characteristics in terms of the number of friends, the agreement of the people who were identified as adolescents’ friends, and friends’ characteristics by comparing adolescents’ first three closest friends reported separately by adolescents with an ASD and their parents.</p>
<sec id="section13-1362361311416380">
<title>Number of friends</title>
<p>Almost all adolescents with an ASD (96%) reported that they had at least one friend, and 86% of parents reported that the adolescents had at least one friend. A Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare adolescent and parental reports. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362361311416380">Table 3</xref>, adolescents identified a significantly greater number of friends than did their parents (Z = −3.36, p = .001). That is, more adolescents reported that they had at least three friends than did parents (79% versus 65%), and fewer adolescents reported they had no friends than did parents (4% versus 14%).</p>

<title>Agreement of friendships</title>
<p>To examine the agreement of the people who were identified as the adolescents’ friends, we calculated the number of the same people listed by the adolescent and the parent. We used friends’ first names as a cue to identify the same friends. The agreement between adolescents and parents was 60% on the adolescent’s best friend, and 24% on the adolescent’s first three closest friends in order. For 21% of the cases, the adolescent and parent listed completely different names of friends. We further examined whether these adolescents had different characteristics as compared with the adolescents who had at least one similar friend as reported by their parents. We found that the severity of autism symptoms was the only significant factor. The adolescents who reported completely different friends had more severe autism symptoms than those who reported at least one similar friend to their parents (SCQ scores 20.3 ± 6.3 versus 16.0 ± 5.6; t (89) = 2.86, p = .005).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1362361311416380">
<title>Friend’s characteristics – first three closest friends</title>
<p>We also examined the characteristics of adolescents’ first three closest friends (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362361311416380">Table 3</xref>). About half of adolescents reported their first three best friends were all males. According to adolescent reports, their friends were on average 14 years old. The average age span between adolescents and their friends was 1 year. About two-thirds of friends were younger than the adolescent with an ASD, and most friends were the same gender as the adolescent. About half of the friends were from school, and a small proportion of the friends were cousins, siblings or either a boyfriend or a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Friends’ characteristics reported by parents were similar to adolescent reports. When comparing adolescent and parental reports on friends’ characteristics, paired t-tests were used to compare parametric data, including age and age span. Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests were used to compare non-parametric data, including age order (younger versus older), friends’ gender and gender composition (same gender versus opposite gender). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362361311416380">Table 3</xref>, adolescents with an ASD and parents reported similar characteristics of the friends. On the basis of the parental reports, the mean friendship duration between adolescents with an ASD and their friends was 4 years, and about a half of the friends had a disability, with ASDs as the most common disability, followed by ADHD and learning disabilities. Other disabilities included Down syndrome, bipolar disorder, depression, dyslexia, epilepsy, hand dysfunction, Tourette syndrome, and hemiplegia. Over half (56%) of the adolescents had at least a friend with a disability.</p>

<sec id="section16-1362361311416380">
<title>Associations between number of friends and adolescents’ characteristics</title>
<p>We used bivariate correlations and t-tests to examine the associations between the number of friends reported by adolescents with an ASD and their own characteristics, including age, gender, and severity of autism symptoms. Older adolescents with an ASD reported fewer friends (r = −.24, p = .021). Age was also associated with the number of same-gender friends. Older adolescents reported fewer same-gender friends (r = −.27, p = .009), but there was no clear association between age and number of opposite-gender friends (r = .07, p = .509). Neither gender (t (89) = .70, p = .489) nor severity of autism symptoms (r = .09, p = .423) were significantly associated with the number of friends. Similarly, the adolescents’ diagnosis (Asperger’s syndrome versus other diagnoses) was not significantly associated with the number of friends (t (89) = −.97, p = .335).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1362361311416380">
<title>Associations between friendship characteristics and friendship qualities</title>
<p>Bivariate correlations and t-tests were used to examine the associations between friendship characteristics (the number of friends and the best friend’s characteristics) reported by adolescents with an ASD and their perceived friendship qualities, as measured by the FQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362361311416380">Bukowski et al., 1994</xref>). Having more friends was significantly associated with more positive friendship quality with the listed best friend (r = .23, p = .026) and greater companionship in this friendship (r = .21, p = .047). No significant associations were found between the adolescents’ severity of autism symptoms (SCQ scores) and positive friendship quality (r = −.11, p = .317) or conflict in the friendships (r = .13, p = .899). Similarly, we did not find significantly associations between adolescents’ diagnosis (Asperger’s syndrome versus other diagnoses) and either their positive friendship qualities (t (89) = .92, p = .361) or conflict (t (89) = .67, p = .504).</p>
<p>Friends’ age (based on adolescent self-reports) was not significantly related to friendship qualities, but the friend’s gender was. That is, with female friends, adolescents with an ASD reported greater helpfulness (t (85) = −2.5, p = .014) and greater closeness (t (85) = −2.45, p = .016) in friendships, compared with male friends. The types of friends were significantly associated with adolescents’ perceived conflict. Adolescents reported less conflict with school friends (t (84) = −2.09, p = .040), and more conflict with friends who were either childhood friends (t (84) = 2.27, p = .026) or identified as siblings (t (84) = 2.25, p = .027).</p>

<title>Amount of time</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1362361311416380">Table 4</xref>, 47% of adolescents with an ASD (n = 43) did activities with their friends on weekdays, and 33% of adolescents with an ASD (n = 30) did activities with their friends on weekend days. Adolescents who spent time with friends spent an average of 4 hours with friends on weekdays and 5 hours with friends on weekend days. A McNemar test showed no significant difference between weekdays and weekend days in whether adolescents spent time with friends (p = .500), and a paired t-test showed no significant difference in the amount of time they spent with friends between weekdays and weekend days (t (90) = −.52, p = .603). Therefore, we combined weekday and weekend data. For the amount of time on any given day, we calculated the average daily hours spent with friends across the weekday and weekend activity reports by multiplying the weekday hours by 5 and multiplying the weekend hours by 2, and then dividing the sum of these two calculations by 7. Thus, the average time shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1362361311416380">Table 4</xref> is not merely an average of the weekday and weekend hours, but is weighted to reflect more weekday than weekend days in a week. On any given day, a total of 52 adolescents with an ASD (57%) spent time with friends. Adolescents who reported that they did activities with friends spent an average of 3.1 hours with them on any given day.</p>

<p>We also examined whether the activity patterns with friends differed by gender. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1362361311416380">Table 5</xref>, male adolescents with an ASD most frequently played video games with friends, whereas female adolescents most frequently engaged in conversation with friends. Also, on any given day, male adolescents were more likely to play video games than girls (36.5% versus 0%; x<sup>2</sup> (1) = 8.82, p = .003), whereas female adolescents were more likely to engage in conversations with friends than boys (24.9% versus 9.5%; x<sup>2</sup> (1) = 4.81, p = .028). When playing video games and having conversations were excluded, doing physical activities was the category that both male and female adolescents most frequently engaged in with friends. Generally, male adolescents were more likely to engage in indoor activities (such as playing video games, watching television, eating) with friends, and female adolescents were more likely to spending time with friends outside the house (such as hanging out, doing outdoor activities, doing community excursion). We also used t-tests to see whether the activity patterns and the amount of time spent with friends differed by the regions where the adolescents lived, as well as whether these two variables differed by the adolescents’ diagnosis. We found that neither the amount of time spent with friends nor the activity patterns with friends differed by the four regions or the adolescents’ diagnosis.</p>

<title>Associations between activity engagement and friendship qualities</title>
<p>We examined whether engaging in activities with friends was associated with friendship qualities reported by adolescents with an ASD. On any given day, adolescents with an ASD who spent time with friends reported more overall positive friendship qualities (t (89) = −2.33, p = .22) and greater companionship with their best friend (t (89) = −3.49, p = .001) than those who did not spend time with friends.</p>
<p>We also examined the associations between friendship qualities and each of activities that adolescents with an ASD engaged in with friends. Playing video games was the only activity significantly associated with adolescents’ perceptions of friendship qualities. Adolescents with an ASD who played video games with friends on any given day reported more overall positive friendship qualities (t (89) = −2.20, p = .030) and greater companionship (t (89) = −2.91, p = .005) with their best friend than those who did not play video games with friends.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study expands our knowledge about friendships of adolescents with an ASD by comparing adolescents’ and parents’ perceptions of friendship characteristics, as well as by collecting data directly from adolescents with an ASD on their time spent with friends. The findings reveal characteristics of people whom adolescents with an ASD and their parents recognize as the adolescents’ friends, and show that adolescents with an ASD and their parents may have different ideas about who the adolescent’s friends are. In terms of time spent with friends, about a half of adolescents with an ASD spend time with friends on any given day during the summer months, and the activities that they engaged in together differed by gender. The findings also reflect some similarities and differences in friendships between adolescents with an ASD and typically developing adolescents.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that adolescents with an ASD and their parents tended to list friends with similar characteristics, they differed in the number of peers perceived to be friends and in the people whom they identified as the adolescents’ friends. The differences may be explained by different descriptions of friendships of the adolescents and their parents. Previous research indicates that adolescents with an ASD most frequently describe friends as other peers who have similar interests and with whom they can do or talk about the same things together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362361311416380">Carrington et al., 2003</xref>). However, research indicated that most parents reported that the relationships between adolescents and adults with an ASD and their peers lacked reciprocity, and often only occurred during prearranged settings, which may not represent true friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1362361311416380">Orsmond et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, with respect to friendships, adolescents with an ASD may consider friends to be peers who have similar interests and with whom they spend time, whereas their parents may only consider a friendship if it includes mutual interactions and emotion interchanges.</p>
<p>We also found that adolescents who reported completely different friends had more severe autism symptoms than those who reported at least one similar friend to their parents. It is possible that the adolescents with more severe autism symptoms were more likely to overestimate their relationships with other peers than those with less severe autism symptoms. It is also possible that the parents of these adolescents were more likely to underestimate the adolescents’ friendships than the parents of the adolescents with less severe autism symptoms.</p>
<p>We found that most adolescents with an ASD reported friends of the same gender, and most frequently spent time with same-gender friends. However, older adolescents reported fewer same-gender friends, but the number of opposite-gender friends remained relatively constant. This pattern of change of gender-based friend preferences is different from that of typically developing adolescents, whose same-gender peer networks remain about the same but whose opposite-gender peer networks increase in size with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362361311416380">Richards et al., 1998</xref>). For typically developing adolescents, one feature of adolescence is a transition from extreme engagement with same-gender friends to opposite-gender friendships. That is, their preferences for same-gender friends decline in adolescence relative to childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362361311416380">Poulin and Pedersen, 2007</xref>), and the time spent with opposite-gender friends increases from early to mid-adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1362361311416380">Richards et al., 1998</xref>). Because spending time with opposite-gender friends prepares an individual to develop future romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362361311416380">Mehta and Strough, 2009</xref>), the lack of opposite-gender friends may prevent adolescents with an ASD from developing the skills or experiences that provide the foundation for deeper romantic or marital relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362361311416380">Stokes et al., 2007</xref>). Because adolescents with an ASD have been reported to desire romantic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1362361311416380">Stokes and Kaur, 2005</xref>), there may be a need to develop supports to help them gain the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed to relate more successfully with opposite-gender peers.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found that when adolescents with an ASD spent time with mixed- or opposite-gender friends, they most frequently engaged in physical activities. Most of these physical activities (e.g. playing basketball, playing softball, swimming) are structured activities, which involve rules and often have a formally designated coach or instructor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362361311416380">King et al., 2009</xref>). We suspect that these types of activities may create a more comfortable context for adolescents with an ASD to interact with opposite-gender peers. However, future studies are needed to further explore adolescents’ perspectives about their activities.</p>
<p>Consistent with research on typically developing adolescents’ friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362361311416380">Poulin and Pedersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362361311416380">Sears et al., 2009</xref>), female adolescents with an ASD perceived higher levels of help from their same-gender friends, and male adolescents perceived more help and closeness from their opposite-gender friends. Previous studies have suggested that females are socialized to be more supportive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1362361311416380">Poulin and Pedersen, 2007</xref>), and are often perceived as a better source of help than males regardless of the gender composition of the friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1362361311416380">Rose and Rudolph, 2006</xref>). Therefore, adolescents with an ASD may turn to their female friends with problems because they anticipate receiving support from them. Females have been reported to be less likely to ridicule or judge people who ask them for help as weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1362361311416380">Sears et al., 2009</xref>). This lack of judging may be another reason motivating adolescents with an ASD to seek assistance from their female friends. It is also possible that female friends are more likely to actively provide support to adolescents with an ASD when these adolescents require assistance.</p>
<p>Similar to typically developing adolescents, both male and female adolescents with an ASD perceived more closeness with their female friends than with their male friends. The femaleness principle can be used to explain this finding. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362361311416380">Akiyama et al. (1996)</xref> proposed that the gender differences in personal relationships are a function of the ‘femaleness’ of the dyad. For example, female siblings are the closest and most involved sibling dyads, followed by female-male sibling pairs, with male dyads being the least close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362361311416380">Cicirelli, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>We also found that adolescents with an ASD perceived less conflict in friendships if the friend was from school, whereas they perceive more conflict if the friend was identified as a sibling. The nature of different types of relationships may explain this finding. Relationships with school friends may be likely to dissolve if frequent conflict occurs. To maintain friendships, adolescents with an ASD and their school friends need to develop strategies to prevent the conflict from occurring frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362361311416380">Furman and Buhrmester, 1985</xref>). Adolescents with an ASD and their school friends have more opportunities than other types of friends to collaborate to complete school projects or homework, and collaboration between friends has been found to reduce conflict in friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1362361311416380">Shulman and Laursen, 2002</xref>). In contrast to friendships among school friends, siblings are bound by involuntary ties that are primarily based on kinship and have long histories of interactions. Siblings have been found to frequently have conflict during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362361311416380">Furman and Buhrmester, 1985</xref>). Sibling relationships can withstand conflict without fear of dissolution of the relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362361311416380">Furman and Buhrmester, 1985</xref>) and, therefore, siblings may be less likely to work on resolving the conflict.</p>
<p>Consistent with findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman (2003)</xref>, playing, watching television, and playing with a computer were the most frequent activities that adolescents with an ASD engaged in with friends. It was interesting to find that playing video games (either on a computer or on a video-game console) was the most common activity that adolescents with an ASD engaged in with their friends, and playing video games with friends was associated with overall positive friendship qualities. Adolescents with an ASD have been found to frequently play video games and surf websites containing information about video games during their leisure time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362361311416380">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1362361311416380">Orsmond and Kuo, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362361311416380">Kuo et al. (2010)</xref> suggest that the intense engagement in video-game activities could be associated with one of their autism symptoms – repetitive and stereotyped interests. Because adolescents with an ASD often spend time with friends engaging in activities of special interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362361311416380">Carrington et al., 2003</xref>), playing video games with friends may enable adolescents with an ASD to pursue their intense and restricted interests. Moreover, adolescents with an ASD have reported that video games serve as a social bridge for them to fit in with peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1362361311416380">Winter-Messiers, 2007</xref>). Thus, it is possible that video-game playing creates a context for adolescents with an ASD to socialize. Future studies are needed to explore the social context of this activity.</p>
<p>Gender differences were also found in the activities that adolescents with an ASD engaged in with their friends. Male adolescents with an ASD frequently spent time with friends engaging in passive activities (e.g. playing video games, watching television) that were less likely to involve direct social interactions than other activities (e.g. having conversation, hanging out). However, female adolescents with an ASD most frequently spent their time with friends on conversations. These gender differences in activity patterns with friends are similar to those of typically developing adolescents, who also have different activity preferences. Typically developing female adolescents tend to socialize more than males, whereas males tend to be more interested in computers, television, and sports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362361311416380">Larson and Verma, 1999</xref>). Moreover, longitudinal data show that typically developing female adolescents increase their time spent socializing with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362361311416380">McHale et al., 2004</xref>). The gender patterns in social activities in adolescents with an ASD are similar to typically developing adolescents.</p>
<p>Our study was limited in that we did not know the adolescents’ and parents’ definitions of friendships, such as what criteria they used to identify a person as a friend, and thus we were unable to examine the factors associated with their different perceptions of friendships. We did not collect data from the adolescents’ nominated friends, and therefore we were unable to validate whether these adolescent friendships were reciprocal. Although we knew the kinds of activities that adolescents and their friends engaged in, we did not know the social contexts within which these activities occurred. For example, we did not know where they engaged in activities together (e.g. adolescent’s home, friend’s home, somewhere else), the person who initiated the interactions (e.g. adolescents themselves, friends, parents), how they interacted with each other (e.g. playing adjacent to each other but not trying to influence one another’s behavior or playing cooperatively to solve problems), or whether there were any adults involved in guiding their interactions. Another limitation is that we did not include a typically developing adolescent comparison sample to investigate the similarities and differences in their activity patterns with friends. Without these data, it is difficult to know whether the adolescents with an ASD experienced similar or different activity patterns as compared with typically developing counterparts. Also, our findings are limited to higher functioning individuals, as they had to have the reading skills to independently participate in the study. The ethnic homogeneity of our sample may also limit the generalizability of the results.</p>
<p>A strength of this study is that data were collected when the adolescents were away from school during summer months so they had more discretionary time and opportunities to engage in activities of their own choice, and were not restricted by academic work. Thus, we were able to learn more about their activity engagement with friends outside of prearranged settings. The findings of this study strengthen links to research on friendships among adolescents with an ASD. Moreover, the gender differences in activity patterns were also taken into consideration. The sample size of this study was larger than most of previous studies on friendships of children and adolescents with an ASD (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Kasari, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362361311416380">Bauminger and Shulman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362361311416380">Bauminger et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362361311416380">2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>There are important implications to be drawn from the findings for practitioners and for future research directions. Helping individuals with an ASD participate in social activities is often a professional’s goal; however, professionals also have a responsibility to recognize and value different people’s perspectives about friendship. In order to support friendship desires among adolescents with an ASD, it is important to explore how they define friends and what characteristics of friendships they value. There is also a need to develop a better understanding of the social opportunities offered by participation in different activities with friends. Future intervention programs could build on this information to better use the social opportunities embedded in the adolescents’ activities to scaffold and promote opportunities to support friendships. Finally, the low rates of opposite-gender friends in adolescence cannot be neglected. Future studies are needed to investigate the interests, knowledge and peer interaction skills needed by adolescents with an ASD to interact effectively with peers of different genders.</p>
