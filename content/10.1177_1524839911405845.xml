<abstract>
<p>This study explored Facebook™ to capture the prevalence of driving safety promotion user groups, obtain user demographic information, to understand if Facebook™ user groups influence reported driving behaviors, and to gather a sense of perceived effectiveness of Facebook™ for driving safety promotion targeted to young adults. In total, 96 driving safety Facebook™ groups (DSFGs) were identified with a total of 33,368 members, 168 administrators, 156 officers, 1,598 wall posts representing 12 countries. A total of 85 individuals participated in the survey. Demographic findings of this study suggest that driving safety promotion can be targeted to young and older adults. Respondents’ ages ranged from 18 to 66 years. A total of 62% of respondents aged ≤24 years and 57.8% of respondents aged ≥25 years reported changing their driving-related behaviors as a result of reading information on the DSFGs to which they belonged. A higher proportion of respondents ≥25 years were significantly more likely to report Facebook™ and YouTube™ as an effective technology for driving safety promotion. This preliminary study indicates that DSFGs may be effective tools for driving safety promotion among young adults. More research is needed to understand the cognition of Facebook™ users as it relates to adopting safe driving behavior. The findings from this study present descriptive data to guide public health practitioners for future health promotion activities on Facebook™.</p>

<p>The social networks of the World Wide Web such as Facebook™, Twitter™, and YouTube™ have added a new dimension to the way people make friends, find and share information, and work inpartnership with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839911405845">Eysenbach, 2008</xref>). In addition, online social networking websites have provided public health practitioners with several new platforms to disseminate health promotion messages. Currently, the heaviest users of online social networks are young adults between the ages of 18 and 29 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405845">Madden, 2010</xref>). Thus, online social networks may be effective conduits to positively influence health behaviors among young adults.</p>
<p>Motor vehicle crashes among young adults are a major public health problem. Public health practitioners have used social marketing campaigns through conventional media such as radio and television to affect motor vehicle driving behavior among young adults. Given the wide spread use of online social networking among this age group, health promotion activity on websites such as Facebook™ may be effective at positively changing motor vehicle driving behavior. Because of the paucity of published research exploring behavioral effects of online social networking health promotion on driving behaviors, this study sought to fill this gap of knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524839911405845">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The potential of online social networks for health promotion practice is tremendous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839911405845">Thackeray, Neiger, Hanson, &amp; McKenzie, 2008</xref>). In particular, online social networking presents a new way for health promotion practitioners to reach young adults. In today’s information age, young adults commonly use social media to communicate with their friends and to gather information. Findings from the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project’s most recent surveys on social media and Internet use among 18- to 29-year-olds reported that 86% use online social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405845">Madden, 2010</xref>); 30% share online content; 33% comment on news groups, blogs, or photo sites; and some users have used social networking websites to collaborate with others for a cause or issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839911405845">Fox, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405845">Lenhart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839911405845">Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &amp; Zickuhr, 2010</xref>). The most popular social networking website among 18- to 29-year-olds is Facebook™, with approximately 71% of these individuals having profiles on the website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839911405845">Lenhart, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In developed nations, youth are commonly involved in traffic accidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839911405845">Toroyan &amp; Penden, 2007</xref>). A significant number of traffic accidents in developed nations among youth are because of motor vehicle crashes. In the United States alone, motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405845">National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2006</xref>). Injury and mortality caused by motor vehicle crashes among young adults present a significant burden on health care systems and cause psychosocial distress on affected families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839911405845">World Health Organization, 2009</xref>). In the United States alone, motor vehicle crashes among young adults, aged 18 to 24 years, account for 64.4% of the 13,278 lives that are lost due to unintentional injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405845">National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2006</xref>). In the United States, the economic cost of motor vehicle crashes among 15- to 24-year-olds cost 19 billion dollars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839911405845">National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2006</xref>). Many motor vehicle crashes involving young adults are preventable. Crashes within this age group have been attributed to several preventable risk factors such as such as cell phone use, passenger disruptions, intoxication, and speeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839911405845">Ferguson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839911405845">Heck &amp; Carlos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839911405845">Hingson, Heeren, Winter, &amp; Wechsler, 2005</xref>). In addition, lack of seatbelt use is a major issue with young drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839911405845">Williams, McCartt, &amp; Geary, 2003</xref>). It has been found that risky driving behavior such as speeding and driving intoxicated heightens during the ages of 18 to 25 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405845">Arnott, 2000</xref>). It is believed that the high propensity for young adults to engage in risky driving behaviors is because of their developmental transitory period where many of these individuals in this age group are experimenting with a range of experiences before adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839911405845">Arnott, 2000</xref>). In developed countries, many countermeasures have been implemented to mitigate this safety problem. Traditional countermeasures, such as graduated licensing, driver education, and reality-based interventions, are tailored to increase young driver skills and to improve their knowledge and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839911405845">Mayhew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839911405845">Small, 2008</xref>). In addition, several social marketing campaigns on the television and the radio have tried to dissuade young adults from engaging in risky driving behaviors. In spite of the implementation of these safety measures, a disparate number of young drivers are still being injured and killed by motor vehicle crashes. With the popularity of Facebook™ among young adults and the platform’s potential as an effective tool for health promotion, this study sought to explore the landscape of driving safety Facebook™ groups (DSFG) on Facebook™. The aims of this study were to (1) identify, categorize, and detail the number of DSFGs on Facebook™; (2) gather the demographics of DSFG members, administrators, and users; and (3) understand if DSFGs influence driving behaviors and are perceived as effective promotional tools for driving safety promotion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1524839911405845">
<title>Theory</title>
<p>Even though it has become commonplace for health promotion activities to occur on online social networking websites, little is known about which theoretical constructs best predict adoption of safe driving behaviors through health promotion activity via online social networks websites. Extended versions of the theory of planned behavior have been applied to understand why young adults use online social networks. In general terms, the theory of planned behavior purports that an individual’s propensity to engage in a behavior depends on their attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839911405845">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839911405845">Pelling and White (2009)</xref>, in a study with university students, found that self-identity and belongingness were variables that significantly helped to explained individual inclination to engage in online social networks. Given the infancy of the field of online social networking research and driving safety health promotion, this study sought to gauge the climate of driving safety health promotion activity by determining the prevalence of driving safety–related health promotion groups on Facebook™ and polling opinions of users in these groups to gather an understanding of their perceived influence and promotional effectiveness on driving-related behaviors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839911405845" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To gain an understanding of driving safety promotion on Facebook™, an online ethnographic inventory and survey research design were employed. First, an inventory of DSFGs was conducted on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Facebook™.com">www.Facebook™.com</ext-link> to discern the number of DSFGs. Second, a survey was given to group administrators and members. To accomplish this, a new Facebook™ account for the study was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1524839911405845">Figure 1</xref>). Next, the inventory of DSFGs was conducted from September 5, 2009 to September 26, 2009. Afterward, a survey was administered to a convenience sample of users of the DSFG that were identified from the inventory.</p>

</fig>
<sec id="section4-1524839911405845">
<title>Inclusion Criteria for Inventory</title>
<p>A search was conducted to indentify DSFG groups for inclusion by entering the search terms “driving” and “safety” into the Facebook™ search engine. The search was then refined into three searches: (1) “groups” then filtered to “common interest” with the subtype “health and wellness”; (2) “groups” then filtered to “student groups—all”; and (3) “groups” then filtered to “organizations—all.” Each search provided results categorized under each respective filter. In total, 295 groups were identified, 96 of which met the inclusion criteria.</p>
<p>The researchers assessed all groups for inclusion. Included groups were identified as having primarily English content written on an open group page and a related focus on driving safety. All groups that met the three inclusion criteria above were classified into one of the eight categories based on the group’s description presented in its profile. The categories were developed through coding the included group descriptions. The following eight categories emerged: (1) driving awareness, (2) driving education, (3) designated driver, (4) driving safety initiative, (5) driving safety promotion, (6) support, (7) memorial, and (8) other. Driving awareness groups were identified as a group that had a primary focus on providing statistics on the severity of motor vehicle crashes. Driving education groups were defined as groups offering driver’s education classes or peer educator groups. Designated driver groups were defined as groups offering information about a safe ride program to prevent drinking and driving. Driving safety initiative groups were identified as groups that disseminated information on a campaign, or a group of students banding around a driving safety initiative. Driving safety promotion groups were defined as groups that were primarily focused around supporting a specific driving safety measure, that is, seatbelt use or no texting while driving. Support groups were defined as groups that were supporting a loved one who survived a car crash. Memorial groups were identified as groups remembering the loss of a loved one in a car crash or a driving safety campaign that was clearly identified as being born out of the grief of surviving family and friends of a loved one lost in a car crash. DSFG descriptions that did not fit into one of the seven categories were classified under “other.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839911405845">
<title>Exclusion Criteria for Inventory</title>
<p>Excluded groups were defined as not having a clear mission related to motor vehicle driving safety, promoting alternative transportation such as walking and hybrid cars, personal crusades petitioning against driving laws, safety cameras and specific drivers, groups that had an aim to solicit votes for a video competition, class president, or political figure support gathering groups were excluded, content written in another language, groups that were not open to the public.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839911405845">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>A survey was administered to DSFG users to gather their demographic information, Facebook™ usage and perceptions on the effectiveness of driving safety promotion to 18- to 24-year-olds. The survey instrument was first piloted to a convenience sample of 10 Facebook™ users to test the readability of the survey questions. Three individual assessors reviewed the survey for face validity. Last, the final version of the survey was uploaded to SurveyMonkey.</p>
<p>The online survey was active from November 20, 2009 to January 17, 2010. A convenience sample (<italic>n</italic> = 85) of DSFG members, officers, and administrators completed the survey. The survey was posted to 43 DSFG walls (a wall is an open discussion board that allows group members to discuss and comment on various topics within the group) that included a SurveyMonkey link to the online survey on 43 walls of DSFGs that met the inclusion criteria. After posting the link on the walls, a warning message appeared stating
<disp-quote>
<p>Warning message from Facebook™:</p>
<p>Security Check</p>
<p><italic>Warning! You are engaging in behavior that may be considered annoying or abusive by other users.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Facebook™’s systems determined that you were going too fast when sending web addresses (URLs) through messages. You must significantly slow down. Further misuse of site features may result in a temporary block or your account being permanently disabled. For further information, please visit our FAQ page.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because of the receipt of the warning messages, posting to groups’ walls was discontinued. Messages with the survey link were sent to group administrators asking them to circulate the survey link to their respective DSFG members. A few administrators provided additional DSFGs and group administrators that should receive the survey link. Reminder messages were sent to the DSFG administrators who either received a wall post or an initial message. Both initial and reminder messages were sent by spacing out the time between consecutive messages to avoid further warning notices from Facebook™. Participants were instructed to click on the web link that first brought them to a consent form. Participants provided implied consent by clicking “Next.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839911405845">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The web-based survey asked respondents to answer four demographic items: sex, age, country of residence, and highest level of education. Respondents answered one item asking whether they worked or volunteered for an organization whose mission involved driving safety promotion. Respondents were asked to indicate their Facebook™ usage by answering questions from the validated Facebook™ intensity scale used as a measure of Facebook™ usage and behavior, emotional connectedness to Facebook™, and integrated use of Facebook™ in everyday activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839911405845">Ellison, Steinfield, &amp; Lampe, 2007</xref>). The response options for the first two items from the Facebook™ intensity scale were modified to categorical options due to feedback from pilot testing. Next, participants answered a battery of questions regarding their DSFG membership characteristics, DSFG group characteristics, perceived influence of DSFG, and perceived effectiveness of DSFG.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839911405845">
<title>Perceived Influence of DSFGs</title>
<p>Two items were used to measure the influence of driving safety groups on respondents driving behavior. The item asked respondents: “As a result of reading information on the DSFG(s) you belong to, have you changed any driving related behaviors?” Response options were “Yes” or “No.” For those respondents who reported changing driving related behaviors an additional item asked, “In what way(s) have you changed your driving related behaviors (check all that apply)?” Response options included “Obey speed limits,” “Obey traffic signs,” and “Reduce cell phone use while driving.” “Avoid driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs,” “Signaled turns and lane changes more often,” and “Using seatbelts.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839911405845">
<title>Perceived Effectiveness of DSFGs</title>
<p>To assess the perceived effectiveness of various technologies for driving safety promotion targeted at young adults aged 18 to 24 years, respondents were asked to rate Facebook™, YouTube™, Twitter™, cell phone applications, and global positioning system (GPS) units on a 5-point Likert-type scale: “Very effective,” “Effective,” “Neither effective nor not effective,” “Not effective,” and “Not very effective.”</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-1524839911405845">
<title>Inventory Results</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the inventory findings. In total 33,368 members, 168 administrators, 154 officers, 1,598 wall posts, 12 countries/regions affiliations (Australia, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, Jamaica, Lebanon, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States), and one virtual location <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myspace.com">www.myspace.com</ext-link> were identified attributed to 96 unique DSFGs. The most common type of DSFGs were the driving safety initiative groups 24/96 (25%), then driving awareness–related groups 23/96 (23.9%), driver education groups 21/96 (21.8%), memorial groups 12/96 (12.5%), then driving safety promotion groups 7/96 (7.6%), designated driver groups both accounted for 4/96 (4.16%) and last, “other” groups (1.04%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839911405845">
<title>Survey Results: Major Findings</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics were calculated (e.g., frequencies, means, and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for demographic variables. To compare respondents of different age groups (≤24 years, ≥25 years) chi-square analyses were conducted to examine differences in perceived influence of DSFGs and perceived effectiveness of Facebook™ for driving safety promotion. For perceived effectiveness, responses were transformed into a dichotomous outcome where “Very effective and effective” were classified as “Effective,” whereas responses of “Neither effective nor not effective,” “Not effective,” and “Not very effective” were grouped as “Not effective.”</p>
<p>A total of 85 participants completed the survey. Respondent ages ranged from 18 to 66 years (<italic>M</italic> = 29.2 years, 95% CI = 26.3-32.1). The sample consisted of 55.8% males, and 90.9% drove a car (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839911405845">Table 1</xref>). Most (61.2%; 52/85) of the respondents did not work or volunteer for an organization whose mission focused on driving.</p>

<p>Participants reported living in various countries; representation was from Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, Europe, Middle East, and North America. However, 55.3% of the sample lived in the United States. The majority 88.4% of the sample population had obtained a high school/GED or higher.</p>
<p>We examined whether there were any differences in perceived influence of DSFGs and perceived effectiveness of Facebook™ for driving safety promotion between respondents who were aged ≤24years and ≥25years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839911405845">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839911405845">3</xref>). In all, 62% of respondents aged ≤24 years and 57.8% of respondents aged ≥25 years reported changing their driving-related behaviors as a result of reading information on the DSFG(s) to which they belonged. Respondents ≤24 years old were significantly more likely than ≥25-year-olds to report avoiding driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs and using seatbelts (<italic>p</italic> = .033 and <italic>p</italic> = .026, respectively). Also, it was found that a higher proportion of respondents ≥25 years were significantly more likely to report Facebook™ and YouTube™ as an effective technology for driving safety promotion targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds (<italic>p</italic> = .025 and <italic>p</italic> = .032, respectively).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This exploratory study revealed that there were 96 DSFGs with 33,368 members, 168 administrators, 154 officers, 1,598 wall posts representing 12 countries/affiliations. There were several types of DSFGs. Of note, driver’s education groups promoted several drivers education courses from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The DSFGs promoted safe driving topics that are reflected real-world issues that prevail among young drivers such as cell phone use, speeding, and drinking and driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839911405845">Williams, 2006</xref>). Memorial groups designated driver DSFGs typically were centered on a student or group of students promoting their designator driver services to college students. Public health practitioners should consider pairing with the various types of DSFGs to strengthen health promotion messaging and to broaden the reach of their driving safety interventions Although it was not possible to calculate the total information prevalence and incidence of DSFG on Facebook™, it can be inferred that there is a worldwide interest and activity around driving safety on Facebook™.</p>
<p>Adults, teenagers, young adults, grass roots and government agencies are all using Facebook™ to communicate driving safety messages or to reach out to the community to get the public involved in driving safety promotion. The majority of the sample that responded to the survey had a mean age of 29.2 years. Additionally, there were a number of respondents who were older than 50 years. This finding supports the emerging trend of older adults using social networks. In a recent Pew Internet &amp; American Life project report, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839911405845">Madden (2010)</xref> found that social use among those aged 50 years and older nearly doubled over the past year state that 47% of Internet users aged 50 to 64 years and 26% users aged 65 years and older now use social networking sites. A higher proportion of respondents ≥25 years were significantly more likely to report Facebook™ and YouTube™ as effective technologies for driving safety promotion. The demographic findings of this study suggest that driving safety promotion can be targeted to young and older adults. Overall, 62% of respondents aged ≤24 years and 57.8% of respondents ≥25 years reported changing their driving-related behaviors as a result of reading information on the DSFG(s) to which they belonged. Respondents ≤24 years old were significantly more likely than ≥25-year-olds to report avoiding driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs and using seatbelts. It appears that reading information on DSFGS for young adults ≤24 years had an impact on young adult driving behaviors, particularly on dissuading driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs and seatbelt use. It is unclear why a DSFG would affect some young adults’ driving behavior; however, it could be that respondents in the sample had a close experience with a friend or a loved one involved in a car crash due to driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or not using a seatbelt that resulted in the change in behavior. Therefore more research is needed to understand people’s cognitions in health-related online social networking groups to understand why some people would be more inclined than others to change a health related behavior. Also, more research is needed to construct theoretical models to understand the mechanism(s) through which DSFGs help facilitate safe driving–related behaviors and to see if participation in other health-related Facebook™ user groups positively influences health behavior.</p>
<p>It is not certain why a higher proportion of respondents ≥25 years were significantly more likely to report Facebook™ and YouTube™ as effective technologies for driving safety promotion targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds. An online survey of a larger randomized sample would help gather a better understanding of young adults’ perceptions of DSFGs effectiveness for driving safety promotion.</p>
<p>This study represents the first study to explore driving safety promotion on Facebook™ groups that conducted an inventory and a survey to DSFG members and administrators. Furthermore, this study provides a lesson that sending a survey URL multiple times in a short time span on Facebook™ is seen as intrusive behavior. Given this fact, Facebook™ administrators, public health practitioners, and policy makers need to come together to form ethical standard research protocols on this platform to protect vulnerable populations. This is not the first study to make such recommendations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839911405845">Farmer, Bruckner Holt, Cook, and Hearing (2009)</xref> made similar recommendations in a study that sought to assess Facebook™ for the breadth of groups related to common medical diseases.</p>
<sec id="section14-1524839911405845">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. First, this study only explored the English version of Facebook™, therefore the results are not generalizable to other Facebook™ platforms. The search terms used for the inventory were not extensive. Only “driving” and “safety” were used to search three group filters that limited the scope of the inventory. The survey instrument only contained one validated scale. In addition, the sample size of bivariate tests was small. Additionally, the sample was a convenience sample; therefore, the findings from this study cannot be generalized to the entire DSFG population. Also, given the global representation of the study samples, the results of this study may not be generalizable to various country contexts. Additionally, historical effects could be a possible reason for why many respondents stated that they changed their driving safety behavior.</p>
