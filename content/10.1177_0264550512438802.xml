By aged ten he was sleeping rough when he gained his first criminal conviction, for the burglary of a sweet shop. This led to James being taken into care. He left the care home at 15 and spent the rest of his teenage and early adult years drifting, living with extended family members, and again often sleeping rough. During that time he worked in various labouring jobs, but also committed relatively petty, mostly acquisitive, but occasionally violent crimes (criminal damage, common assault.) His directionless way of life continued until August 1984 when he began his life sentence for murder. During his time in prison he engaged with part-time education and after gaining a degree he developed an interest in writing and began writing a regular column for a broadsheet paper entitled <italic>A Life Inside</italic> in 2000. Since his release he has worked as a full-time freelance writer.

In the 1990s he became immersed in the drugs and music of the rave scene, emerging addicted to heroin and crack. He finally left crime, drink and drugs behind him in 2000. Since then he has set up his own business focusing on employing ex-offenders and recovering addicts. Mark is now employed as a consultant on the criminal justice system at national and international level. Johnson’s website includes the opportunity to ask him questions. His site can be accessed at www.mark-johnson.org.uk</p><p>Both websites have links to their publications and links to support groups and other information about their other work and interests within the criminal justice field.</p><p>ex-offender.co.uk is a website being developed to highlight the issues of rehabilitation from crime within society. The focus of the website is to bring together opinion and news as well as information for those in the process or wishing to rehabilitate themselves or others. The website has been developed by an ex-offender, Raymond Lunn, who actively uses his blog to discuss topical issues faced by prisoners and ex-offenders. The website also has other links to debates on desistance, policy and links to videos and presentations of rehabilitation, crime and desistance including prisons, stories describing the rehabilitation of offenders and campaigns.

The service is provided with the assistance and co-operation of the prison service and prison staff. By enabling more frequent communication the email website service aims to help prisoners prepare for life after their release through partnerships with the employment agency, social services, and housing associations and reduce the risk of self-harm and suicide through improved communication with friends and family. The service can be accessed worldwide and so is particularly useful for foreign nationals wanting to maintain family ties. By logging on to the website and registering, users are then able to send emails. The cost is 30p per email. A minimum of £5 credit can be purchased. There is no administrative fee so all credit covers email costs. A paper copy of the email is given to the prisoner that includes the name of the recipient. The email address is removed. The sender needs to have the prisoner’s number and prison location. Legal bodies and related organizations who share a professional interest in the welfare of prisoners are also able to utilize our services. Email a Prisoner enables messages to be sent to prisoners in the majority of prisons in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The service is currently available in 100 prisoners in the UK. To sign up and access the service visit www.emailaprisoner.com, and click on 'Sign Up’.</p></sec></body></article>
