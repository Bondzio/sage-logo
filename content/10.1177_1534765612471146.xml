<abstract>
<p>This study explored posttraumatic growth (PTG) among refugee citizens of Cote d’Ivoire (aged 18 to 56 years; <italic>M</italic> = 37.4 years) affected by living in asylum in Liberia (<italic>M</italic> = 167.5 days). Research focused on use of the Companion Recovery (CR) model as a means to educate participants on how to process trauma, focus on finding meaning, and implementing positive change as a result of the traumatic struggles they experienced. The hypothesis was that the CR model would promote PTG in Ivorian participants. Results suggest that the use of the CR model was instrumental in increasing PTG in the participants. Implications for future research, as well as research in a cross-cultural emergent environment, are addressed.</p>

<body>
<p><italic>Trauma</italic> is a word used to describe a wide range of physical or emotional injuries experienced by people. This may include a single traumatic incident or large-scale accidents and natural disasters. In this study, the term <italic>profound catastrophic trauma</italic> (PCT) was defined as the sudden, unexpected, dangerous, and overwhelming removal of the three fundamental levels of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534765612471146">Maslow (1970)</xref> hierarchy of needs theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612471146">Gregory &amp; Embrey, 2009b</xref>). The three fundamental levels are the following: (a) <italic>physiological</italic> needs, which include the most basic needs such as air, water, food, sleep, and sex; (b) <italic>safety</italic> needs with regard to establishing psychological stability and consistency; and (c) <italic>love and belonging</italic> needs, which are linked to the innate desire for a sense of belonging to a family and/or a community.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534765612471146">van der Kolk, McFarlane, and Weisaeth (1996)</xref> stated, “[There is a need] to summarize the current state of knowledge about the effects of trauma on psychological, biological, and social systems and to examine the interrelationships among these different realms” (p. i). They said that traumatology and the study of the “black hole . . . as a horrible experience” (p. xviii) is complex and draws from many disciplines. The various realms of traumatology include human development, psychology, psychiatry, mental health, social work, sociology, economics, counseling, biology, neurology and brain development, diversity, values and ethics, religion, politics, and government.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534765612471146">Kleber, Figley, and Gersons (1995)</xref> stated, “Enduring meanings, evolving over time, are what count, rather than diagnosis” (p. 20). Providing opportunity to learn how to make meaning of PCT in the various realms was addressed throughout this study.</p>
<p>Making meaning out of traumatic events was addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534765612471146">Calhoun and Tedeschi (1998)</xref> and referred to as posttraumatic growth (PTG). They identified PTG as a process and an outcome. The focus is used to support the intentional processing of trauma, both in cognition and verbal communication, to facilitate managing “the emotional toll” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534765612471146">Tedeschi, Calhoun, &amp; Cann, 2007</xref>, p. 396) that profound catastrophic trauma creates.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534765612471146">Westphal and Bananno (2007)</xref> identified PTG as an “intriguing construct,” conveying “hope amidst the increasing threat of global terrorism and man-made catastrophes.”</p>
<p>In the development of PTG, the clinician’s role is described as “an expert companion” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534765612471146">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2008</xref>). The purpose is to focus attention on the kind of relationship that can be most helpful to persons dealing with highly challenging life circumstances. A clinical relationship such as this is not readily available in circumstances that include war, refugee, or third-world environs. Training local/indigenous “expert companions” during the CR training supported the ongoing development and sustainment of an individual’s PTG.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534765612471146">
<title>Companion Recovery Model</title>
<p>The CR model was developed within an ecological, transdisciplinary framework providing education regarding trauma focused interventions, highlighting the benefits of resilience and posttraumatic growth. The CR model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534765612471146">Figure 1</xref>) is composed of 10 modules shown to reduce symptoms of traumatic stress of individuals who have experienced PCT. Sustainment and cultural sensitivity of this form of intervention is supported through peer counseling concepts.</p>

</fig>
<p>The 10 modules are placed in three sequential categories: (a) Trauma Impact Reduction and Education (Overwhelming Event, Encapsulation, Recognition), (b) Resilience (Release and Resilience), (c) Posttraumatic growth (New Self, Rebuilding Community, and Commencement).</p>
<p>The CR model begins with group training for the first four modules (Overwhelming Events, Encapsulation, Somatization, and Recognition). Participants learn to recognize the overwhelming impact of trauma, the tendency to bury emotional pain, and the influence the events may have on the mind and body of participants. The fifth module (Release) is used to teach each participant to select a <italic>companion.</italic> A voluntary period of sharing is encouraged. A companion is an individual who reflects genuine character, empathy, and has an unconditional positive regard for another traumatized individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534765612471146">Rogers, 1961</xref>). Each companion is taught to maintain confidentiality, apply effective listening skills, and understand the importance of debriefing. Using these guidelines, the approach to painful memories is honored and recognized. Willingness, self-honesty, and open mindedness are used to foster the effectiveness of the intervention. The direct approach makes it possible for participants to share thoughts and feelings with others and organize the emotion and thought “cupboard” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534765612471146">Ehlers &amp; Clark, 2000</xref>), where impressions, events, and feelings get <italic>thrown</italic> during the catastrophic moments of trauma. A companion is taught to offer ongoing support throughout the training and after it is completed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534765612471146">Herman (1997)</xref> reported,
<disp-quote>
<p>People who have survived atrocities often tell their stories in a highly emotional, contradictory, and fragmented manner that undermines their credibility and thereby serves the twin imperatives of truth-telling and secrecy. When the truth is finally recognized, survivors can begin their recovery. (p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through understanding and embracing the concepts of the 10 modules, participants become the “expert companion” necessary for PTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534765612471146">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The CR model was completed with the teaching of the last five modules (Resilience, Integration, New Self, Rebuilding, and Commencement). Presented in experiential and didactic form, the intent of the modules was to support individuals and community in discovering how to move forward after experiencing a PCT through creating an intentional awareness and development of PTG. Participants were trained to recognize and access their resilience based on their inherent strengths. Integration required participants to examine facets of their traumatic experience and reconcile them into their daily lives.</p>
<p>The <italic>commencement</italic> was considered an essential component of the CR model. The celebration was used to solidify the concepts of <italic>Resilience, Integration, New self</italic>, and <italic>Rebuilding</italic>. The participants asked friends and family to attend the commencement, establishing a bridge between the participants and their camp/community. The celebration was used as a visible community event to represent a new beginning for each of the participants.</p>
<p>In attending to the social, cultural, and political context of victimization, and acknowledging that survivors of traumatic experiences may recover without benefit of clinical intervention, the CR model highlights the phenomena of peer support, resiliency, posttraumatic growth, and the relevance of community intervention efforts.</p>
<sec id="section2-1534765612471146">
<title>Supporting Theories of the CR Model</title>
<p>The CR model evolved from collaboration with world-renowned scholars, literature reviews, and extensive personal experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612471146">Gregory &amp; Embrey, 2009b</xref>). The model is consistent with current research and state-of-the-art clinical practices. The original model was cost-effective, reproducible, and generalizable. It attempts to address the strength of a multimodal approach to trauma intervention while keeping a “critical eye in investigating the ‘theory behind the treatment’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534765612471146">Figley, 2002</xref>, p. 6). This is accomplished through an eclectic collection of theories that incorporate the following elements:</p>
<list id="list1-1534765612471146" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Peer support theory is a system of giving and receiving help founded on principles of respect, shared responsibility, and mutual agreement. This theory emphasizes the importance of understanding the situation of others empathically through the shared experience of emotional and psychological pain, providing holistic understanding based on mutual experience and acceptance without the constraint of traditional relationships. Peers feel mutually empowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534765612471146">Miller &amp; Stiver, 1997</xref>). By participating as a “companion,” the individual is empowered to support their peer; providing intervention, sustainment, and cultural respect. Natural mechanisms are built into the CR model to prevent compassion fatigue/secondary trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534765612471146">Figley, 1995</xref>) using peer support.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gestalt therapy is experientially guided intervention designed to assist clients in overcoming symptoms caused by trauma, enabling them to become more fully and creatively alive. This approach assists in discovering a freedom from symptoms as a result of unresolved issues negatively affecting emotional growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534765612471146">Latner, 1992</xref>). This method of intervention was used in significant ways during the Release portion of the CR model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cognitive behavioral therapy assists clients in appreciating the important role of thought in determining both feelings and actions. If unwanted feelings and behaviors are recognized, it is important to identify the underlying thinking that may be causing them. Clients learn the importance of reframing counterproductive thinking with thoughts leading to more desirable actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534765612471146">Beck, 1995</xref>). This form of educational redirection was offered throughout the 36-hour training.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Traumatic-incident reduction (TIR) theory is a brief one on one, person-centered method for eliminating negative effects of past trauma. Theoretically, once TIR has been implemented to fully and calmly view a painful memory, life events no longer “trigger” flashbacks causing distressing symptoms. TIR has been proven useful in relieving a wide range of fears, restrictive beliefs, and suffering due to loss including unresolved grief and mourning, depression, and other posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. TIR is implemented within a person-centered, nonjudgmental, and nonevaluative context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534765612471146">French &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>). Coupled with peer support, TIR was offered throughout the training.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resilience training and dependable strengths articulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534765612471146">Haldane, 1975</xref>) exposes participants to nature and characteristics of resilience and the relationship self-care plays, and includes identification of personal strengths. Much like building muscles, clients are taught to practice specialized “bounce back” strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534765612471146">Grotberg, 2003</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The development of a successful CR model is critical when working in an environment with members of a fluctuating population who have extensive needs, limited funding, staff members who are stretched beyond their abilities to meet the needs of the population, the culture and/or geography of the area restrict easy access, and there are qualified indigenous people who are willing to (a) process their own traumatic experiences and (b) be trained and able to support recovery from within the constructs of the community.</p>
<p>The CR model has been offered internationally with evidence of reducing the impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612471146">Gregory &amp; Embrey, 2009b</xref>). Evaluating the CR model for the support of PTG, in light of the political status of the refugees and the catastrophic results of participants’ experiences, was timely and appropriate.</p>
<p>The CR model appeared to support the five functions of individual growth noted in PTG: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life.</p>

<title>Political Turmoil of Cote d’Ivoire</title>
<p>From January to April 2011, more than 180,000 citizens of Côte d’Ivoire ran for their lives as a result of political upheaval in their country; currently (as of October 11, 2011), the displaced citizens remain in neighboring Liberia as refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612471146">Stearns, 2011</xref>). While some refugees desire to return to their homes, they cannot because of political reasons. Many refugees have nothing to return to in their homeland.</p>
<p>Côte d’Ivoire’s crisis stemmed from the disputed presidential election in November 2010. Both Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara declared themselves the winner of the election. Members of both political parties began acts of violence. On April 11, 2011, Gbagbo was apprehended and arrested, but not before 4 months of brutal civil unrest drove thousands of people from their homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534765612471146">“Ivory Coast,” 2012</xref>). As many as 1,500 people have been killed; 300,000 more have been displaced within the country. An additional 180,000 people crossed the border into neighboring countries, including Liberia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612471146">Stearns, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Liberia is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534765612471146">Anderson &amp;Taylor, 2007</xref>). Liberian government officials are ill equipped to deal with refugees. In currently destitute communities, people do not have the food, shelter, water, and sanitation to serve thousands of additional people. What Liberians do have is the memory of the generosity of the Ivorian people who received the Liberians when they ran for their lives during 14 years of civil war from 1989 to 2003. Hence, approximately 100,000 Ivorian refugees have found temporary homes in Liberian refugee camps and private homes.</p>
<p>While the modern political friction was resolved in April 2011, the status of refugees is likely to remain unresolved. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534765612471146">Malone (2011)</xref> identified the concern of refugees who see little point in returning home because everything they had was taken. While refugee camp administrators offer some safety and security, the United Nations (UN) officials may not be able to help the refugees much longer. The UN officials reported the mission has been downgraded and is $70 million short in funding to care for the thousands in exile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534765612471146">Stearns, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Currently, the location for the study is managed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and Liberia Relief for Refugee Resource Commission (LRRRC). The facilities were designed to handle 10,000 Ivory Coast refugees. The population is currently at 6,750 refugees and growing at a rate of 500 to 750 people per week (as of October 2011). Understanding the cultural context and background on how the refugees came to be in Liberia supported the manner in which the CR model was presented, as well as heightening the research teams’ empathy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1534765612471146">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>Understanding aspects of history/culture assists in supporting learning by participants. Singing, dancing, and artistic expression are integral components of the culture. These were woven into the experiential teaching components. Vigorous dialogue between community members are common practice when leaders are striving to make decisions. Many times, the didactic portion of the training were interrupted while participants held robust discussions to get understanding. This required flexibility and time not allotted for during the training. Social class, standing, and success/recognition are important in the culture. That meant refugee leadership required recognition during the training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534765612471146">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to determine if posttraumatic growth (PTG) would measurably increase among Ivorian refugees by learning the 10 modules taught in the CR model. Although found to reduce PTSD symptoms in a sample of child soldiers in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534765612471146">Gregory and Embrey (2009a)</xref>, its benefit in supporting the paradigm of PTG was unknown. How do people make meaning and experience PTG in their lives from such violence, displacement, and trauma as what might be expected from a refugee running for their lives? Can the concept of PTG be cross-culturally relevant and encouraged in a 36-hour training using a classroom setting with individuals who have survived sacred wounds inflicted from profound catastrophic trauma (PCT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534765612471146">Gregory &amp; Embrey, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>The research question for the study was, “Does the Companion Recovery model enhance PTG in Ivorian refugees displaced to Liberia?”</p>
<p>In addition to enhancing PTG in participants, the intention was to provide sustainable and effective tools that would encourage and support continued growth, creating meaning out of senseless and life altering violence, supporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534765612471146">Frankl’s (1961)</xref> proposition that people can find meaning in life through creativity, love, and suffering.</p>

<title>Approval/Ethics/Oversight</title>
<p>The “Ethical Approaches to Gathering Information from Children and Adolescents in International Settings” was followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534765612471146">Schenk &amp; Williamson, 2005</xref>). In adherence to Schenk and Williamson’s ethical direction, the Liberian-Ivory Coast Advisory Committee was established for this study.</p>
<p>In establishing this committee, initial contact was made with Reverend Caleb Dormah, executive director of the Tufeia Foundation. His knowledge of the CR model, understanding of Ivorian culture, awareness of safety for participants and research team, coupled with his contacts in the United Nations, LRRRC, and primary nongovernmental organizations, made this an obvious choice.</p>
<p>He established relationship with the Lutheran Church of Liberia (LCL). LCL staff was responsible for all psychosocial programming in Ivorian refugee camps in Liberia and had received specialized training in providing educational and psychosocial support to individuals experiencing PCT. Other participants on the Advisory Committee included refugee camp management, leadership of the Refugee Council, and government leaders for a total of five men and five women. Reverend Dormah met with this group prior to the arrival of the research team for planning and exposure to the CR model.</p>
<p>LCL staff informed potential participants of the opportunity of participating through word of mouth and written advertisement. Self-selection, as well as encouragement from the leadership of LCL and Camp Management, was used for recruitment. Final participation was confirmed through review of LCL staff, camp management, and Refugee Council. This was done to ensure safety and stability of participants.</p>
<p>Members of the committee were present for each participant interview, assisted in acquisition of informed consent forms, and explained the training process to participants. Committee members explained cultural norms of Liberia and Ivory Coast to the research team. UNHCR officials and LRRRC officials provided management, approving the research project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534765612471146">
<title>Research Team</title>
<p>The research team comprised Dr. Jeni Gregory (principal) and Dr. Helen Prana. Gregory has offered CR model training internationally multiple times. Dr. Prana has decades of service in the military and currently works with medical providers suffering from trauma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534765612471146">
<title>CR Training</title>
<p>The training of the CR model occurred during 36 hours of instruction over a 6-day period. A coeducational class was presented by the research team members in English, translated into French, and then translated into Yakuba (indigenous tribal language). Questions from participants were translated in the same manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534765612471146">
<title>Measurement Tool</title>
<p>Training was given for the use of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) prior to departure from the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534765612471146">Tedeschi &amp; Calhoun, 1996</xref>). The 21-item PTGI was used to measure personal growth in the following domains: (a) relationships with others, (b) realization of new possibilities, (c) increased personal strength, (d) spirituality, and (e) appreciation of life. Participants rated items on a 6-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of change as a result of the crisis. The PTGI has been shown to have high convergent validity and correlated well with spouses’ reports of partner PTG (<italic>r</italic> = .51; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534765612471146">Weiss, 2002</xref>). The PTGI was used with Bosnian war refugees, showing a slightly different factor structure in a translated and altered version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534765612471146">Powell, Rosner, Butollo, Tedeschi, &amp; Calhoun, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the PTGI was designed to be used as a self-reporting tool, in the study it was necessary for the questions to be read to the participants because of literacy and translation concerns. The self-reporting tool was read in English, translated into French or Yakuba. The answers were translated into English and recorded. The translators were Côte d’Ivoire citizens, trained by LCL staff and researchers. Each researcher had the same translator for all pre- and posttesting. Equally essential were the Liberian and Ivorian teaching facilitators who were able to support divergent cultures, gender biases, economic and educational disparities, and provide direct translation of didactic and experiential teaching.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<sec id="section12-1534765612471146">
<title>Participant Demographics</title>
<p>Certainly, the participants in this study experienced PCT. Refugees running for their lives in Côte d’Ivoire typically experienced the repeated loss of Maslow’s three fundamental human needs over a protracted period of time. Their physical needs (i.e., food, shelter, and water) were ripped away. Their safety needs were affected: the AK47, the razor sharp edges of machetes against their neck, witnessing loved ones terrorized/tortured. All participants (100%) reported that their lives were threatened. Many of the participants were brutally tortured, watched their homes burned and ransacked, and experienced their family and friends being killed, beaten, or raped. The sense of love and belonging were eliminated when participants were forced to survive singularly or in small clusters in the bush, seeking to escape violence. Individual narratives were voluntarily offered during testing or shared with the whole group during the training.</p>
<p>Staff from the LCL trauma counseling program conducted face to face interviews with 50 refugees who were between 18 and 56 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 37.4) to ensure understanding, willingness, and stability of participant prior to research. The specific location of refugee camp is not revealed for security reasons. Of the initial interviewees, 49 of 50 interviewed refugees agreed to participate in the research. One interviewee agreed to participate in the training only. There were 29 women and 20 men (<italic>N</italic> = 49). People reported living in four primary areas in Côte d’Ivoire (identified as A, B, C, D, and other locations, respectively). Of the participants, 35% came from Area “A,” 20% came from Area “B,” 17% were from Area “C,” 17% were from Area “D,” and the remaining 11% were from other village locations.</p>
<p>All 49 Côte d’Ivoire participants reported leaving their homes in Côte d’Ivoire under imminent threat of death. Additionally, 100% of participants (<italic>N</italic> = 49) reported having all physical property destroyed or taken; 82% of participants witnessed loved ones brutally murdered, many reporting they were within arm’s reach of their murdered loved ones.</p>
<p>Of the participants, 77% brought children, both biological and unaccompanied (<italic>M</italic> = 4.7 children). The number of children brought extended from 0 to 10. Of the 49 participants, 61% reported that some or all of their children were killed or seriously wounded by rebels during their escape from Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>At the time of the research, the average time participants spent in the camp was 5 months (<italic>M</italic> = 167.5 days). PTSD symptoms were not measured.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The operational definition of the independent variable was the 36 hours of CR model training. All participants attended for each of the 36 hours of the training. The operational definition of the dependent variable was the pre–post test scoring on the PTGI.</p>
<p>A 95% (α = 0.5) of confidence was used. If the value in <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic> ≤ <italic>t</italic>) one-tail is less than <italic>t</italic> critical one-tail, or if <italic>P</italic>(<italic>T</italic> ≤ <italic>t</italic>) two-tail is less than <italic>t</italic> critical two-tail, then there is greater than 95% probability that the difference is not explained by random data (noise). All the functional tests and totals were significant. Any value that had an “E-04,” “E-05,” “E-06,” and so forth was a very small number (10 to the −4 power, 10 to the −5 power, etc.). Microsoft® Excel® <italic>t</italic>-test Paired Sample for Means Analysis tool was used to evaluate the data statistically. The posttest scores were statistically significantly different than the pretest scores. It is unlikely (improbable) that the difference was the result of other variables. The statistics suggest if the study were repeated 100 times, with the same conditions, more than 95 times one would make the same conclusion. In reality, due to the significance of the data, if the study were repeated 10,000 times, the same conclusion could be reached 9,999 times. The cultural norms for Côte d’Ivoire people may have influenced some of the PTGI scoring. The “Spiritual Change” domain (F4) had the lowest increase for men and women (<italic>M</italic> = 1.2 and 0.6 change, respectively). The results may reflect the strong traditional beliefs practiced regularly in the Ivorian culture. Informal sharing between participants showed that most participants had a strong faith system that was active and apparently important to them. Informal sharing between researchers and participants, and public sharing by participants with each other, included traditional hymns, prayers, and speaking of the importance of a relationship with a Higher Power. The greatest increase in pre–post scoring for men was noted in “New Possibilities” (F2) and in “Personal Strengths” (F3; <italic>M</italic> = 6.8 and 7, respectively). The scoring for women in the same domains was <italic>M</italic> = 2.1 and 5.0, respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534765612471146">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section15-1534765612471146">
<title>Culture</title>
<p>The cultural norm for the Ivorian family construct is a patriarchal system. Men lost everything; having very little control over their environment. They were circumstantially disempowered; dependent for themselves and their family for all things. Gaining insight into the possibility they could successfully integrate their painful experiences, make the experiences count for good, seemed to strengthen their self-esteem. Also, recognition as “Companion Ambassadors” by community leaders appeared to contribute to the men’s sense of duty and purpose. Men were given, and freely accepted, leadership roles in the training experience.</p>
<p>A patrilineal society traces familial lineage from father to son through oral history. Because the male participants were displaced from their villages, family members, and friends, some men may have experienced an increased sense of despair at the potential loss of their legacy. During the Release module, it was possible that men came to understand the importance of making meaning out of their trauma narrative and determined that it would <italic>add</italic> to their oral histories and legacies.</p>
<p>Some individual scores had very minor changes in their pre and post scores. There is a possibility that there are people who do not need to reconstitute their relation to others or experience action focused growth following trauma, but rather continue to be able to fulfill personal and interpersonal demands even in the face of considerable adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471146">Hobfoll et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the fact the participants had experienced tremendous upheaval, coupled with terror, researchers and advisory committee members experienced the participants as warm and nurturing. Respect and self-care were evidenced by good hygiene, clean clothes, good manners, appropriate interactions, and pride in community. It is important to note, while details such as attending class in clean clothes may seem inconsequential, it required a great deal of commitment on behalf of participants. Many refugees left their homes with only clothing on their backs, had no access to running water, and had only the most basic of needs.</p>
<p>One female Liberian staff reported, “I know it is my purpose to work here. This is how I will give back and teach what I learned as a refugee for all those years.” Her comments indicated that PTG may actually be a “genuine marker of positive adaptation because it is accompanied by actions, not solely cognitive maneuvers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534765612471146">Hobfoll et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For the participants, it appeared a <italic>new self</italic> emerged when they recognized the power of surviving PCT. Participants learned that rebuilding their social structure empowered them to reach out to influence their community in positive and meaningful ways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534765612471146">
<title>Bias</title>
<p>The participants were recruited by staff working in the LCL psychosocial program through word of mouth advertisement and self-selection. It is possible that some of the participants self-selected because of loyalty to LCL staff, or enthusiasm for learning more about recovery. This could be controlled for in future studies through the use of a PTSD screening test.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534765612471146">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>International trauma research is complex, with many challenges and limitations. Traveling into a country in an immediate postconflict situation and crossing cultures where challenges of war and political unrest exist requires flexibility and a strong in-country liaison. Data gathering was limited by an environment of political tensions in Liberia with additional limitations by time, money, and security. The limitations had unique aspects.</p>
<p>The PTGI was shared with the Liberian Advisory team for relevance and cultural sensitivity. However, it was not validated for this population, necessitating layers of translation.</p>
<p>Liberia (host country) was experiencing postconflict challenges. Liberia’s first full democratic election since President Sirleaf Johnson was initially voted into position occurred within 30 days of the research. The potentially volatile political event affected security and money for the research.</p>
<p>The cost of the logistical support (i.e., drivers, gas, food, and housing) increased <italic>after</italic> the team landed. Many international election observers poured into Liberia, increasing costs exponentially.</p>
<p>The research was conducted in a remote location in Liberia, 90 minutes from the Côte d’Ivoire border, and more than 100 miles from the capital city of Liberia. The primary concern was safety. While at no time was there imminent danger, attention to pending Liberian elections and growing potential security concerns limited the time spent conducting research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The number of participants for this research effort was very small. Continued examination of the CR model as a means of enhancing PTG is necessary. While difficult to do in third world emergent circumstances, the benefits would be great. There must be ways to empower indigenous people to support and care for themselves. Too often, programs are brought to bear with external financial resources, which quickly disappear with the next crisis. The CR model provides education and sustainable tools, fostering knowledge and supporting continued implementation of trauma recovery without the requirement of well meaning, but finance limited, outsiders.</p>
<p>The concept of PTG in the Ivorian culture seemed to be thoroughly embraced. The power of the human spirit to apply meaning and lessons learned from terrible tragedy did not seem to be bound by culture but would need to be further reviewed in continuing research efforts.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Commencement, one participant came and asked to address the entire group. He reported all his earthly possessions taken, his house burned to the ground, his clothing stripped from him, and his wife and children were missing. He believed they were alive but had no way to contact them. His grief and sense of loss were visible on his face, and noticed in the way he carried himself. His shoulders were hunched, had shuffling footsteps, his focus was cast down while he reported his great sense of loss. Then he said, “There is a song that captures my hope.” While he started to sing a hymn, he straightened up; shoulders went back as if in defiance to his grief. He lifted his head and began to sing with robust energy. Others quietly joined in while he presented himself in this new way. His grief was real. He cried the entire time he sang, but his voice never faltered. One line of the French hymn was translated clearly: “My name is written in the Lamb’s Book of Life, and no matter what occurs, no one can take that from me.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534765612471146">Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel (1993)</xref> observed, “There are three ascending levels of how one mourns: With tears—that is the lowest. With silence—that is higher. And with a song—that is the highest” (p. ix.). The participant and his peers, voicing their grief, worked their way to making meaning of their experiences, as they were recognized as Companion Ambassadors for their community members.</p>
