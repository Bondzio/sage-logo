<abstract>
<p>In an effort aimed at predicting the combustion behavior of a new fuel in a conventional diesel engine, cetane (n-hexadecane) fuel was used in a military engine across the entire speed–load operating range. The ignition delay was characterized for this fuel at each operating condition. A chemical ignition delay was also predicted across the speed–load range using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism with a constant pressure reactor model. At each operating condition, the measured in-cylinder pressure and predicted temperature at the start of injection were applied to the detailed n-hexadecane kinetic mechanism, and the chemical ignition delay was predicted without any kinetic mechanism calibration. The modeling results show that fuel–air parcels developed from the diesel spray with an equivalence ratio of 4 are the first to ignite. The chemical ignition delay results also showed decreasing igntion delays with increasing engine load and speed, just as the experimental data revealed. At lower engine speeds and loads, the kinetic modeling results show the characteristic two-stage negative temperature coefficient behavior of hydrocarbon fuels. However, at high engine speeds and loads, the reactions do not display negative temperature coefficient behavior, as the reactions proceed directly into high-temperature pathways due to higher temperatures and pressure at injection. A moderate difference between the total and chemical ignition delays was then characterized as a phyical delay period that scales inversely with engine speed. This physical delay time is representative of the diesel spray development time and is seen to become a minority fraction of the total igntion delay at higher engine speeds. The approach used in this study suggests that the ignition delay and thus start of combustion may be predicted with reasonable accuracy using kinetic modeling to determine the chemical igntion delay. Then, in conjunction with the physical delay time (experimental or modeling based), a new fuel’s acceptability in a conventional engine could be assessed by determining that the total ignition delay is not too short or too long.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>First-generation bio-diesel fuels have been available for over a decade. These bio-diesel fuels have been frequently produced from rapeseed or soybean oils by chemically reacting the vegetable (or animal based) oil with methanol and a catalyst (KOH) to produce mono-alkylesters from the fatty acids present in the oil.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412446884">1</xref></sup> While the renewable nature of bio-diesel is attractive, its marginal stability and cold flow properties are significant challenges. In addition, susceptibility to water-based biocontamination could pose major problems for any water-based operational environment (e.g. maritime diesels).</p>
<p>Alternative diesel and jet engine fuels produced from hydrotreated renewable sources have begun to receive attention in recent years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412446884">2</xref></sup> with the resulting fuel having a paraffinic base. Hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) fuels come from renewable feedstock oils that are then hydrotreated and refined to produce a fuel that has similar molecular structure to Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412446884">3</xref></sup> The absence of aromatics and cyclo-alkanes clearly aids in raising the cetane number of FT fuels,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412446884">4</xref></sup> as well as HVO-based fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412446884">5</xref></sup> The US Navy is looking into hydrotreated renewable algae oil as a diesel fuel replacement (HRD) as well as hydrotreated renewable camelina oil (<italic>Camelina sativa</italic>) as a jet fuel replacement (HRJ). Jet fuel is used in some military diesel engines. These HVOs are not the ester-based ‘bio-diesel’ of recent years, but rather pure paraffinic hydrocarbon (HC) fuels with no molecularly bound oxygen.</p>
<p>Due to its unique operational requirements, as well as the lack of published technical data, the Navy is currently broadly evaluating two HVOs. The Navy is developing an all-inclusive generic test and certification protocol that can be used to evaluate these potential alternative fuels for tactical Naval use. This study includes evaluating the basic properties of these alternative fuels in order to ensure a potential future fuel meets military specification and fit for purpose requirements. If these basic requirements are met, the Navy will then move forward with larger scale tests, such as testing the performance with fuel distribution and propulsion system components, and finally move to full-scale testing of the entire propulsion system. The goal of this certification process is to root out any anomalies in fuel chemistry or performance that would make it unsuitable for Naval use.</p>
<p>As part of this Navy effort, the authors have tested both an HRD fuel from algae and an HRJ fuel from camelina in a conventional military ‘Humvee’ (high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle; HMMWV) diesel engine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412446884">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412446884">7</xref></sup> Besides these published results, it is interesting that very little other published engine research data exist using these HVO fuels. The higher cetane nature of this fuel generally leads to shorter ignition delays (IGDs) with correspondingly longer overall burn durations with lower peak cylinder pressures. Overall however, the combustion performance, while modestly different, has been acceptable. Engine brake metric differences of up to 10% have been observed using these new fuels.</p>
<p>While the operational performance of these new HVO fuels was acceptable in the Humvee engine, other Navy engines have very different engine geometry, fuel-injection systems, and operating speed–load maps. It would be cost prohibitive to test a new fuel option in every possible application. Thus, due to the high cost involved in full-scale large marine engine testing, it would be advantageous to be able to predictively model the performance of a new fuel in a variety of existing engines. The challenge, however, is the complex nature of conventional diesel engine fuels and combustion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, new HVO fuels have a simpler structure compared to conventional petroleum fuels, and this fact may allow combustion modeling to be pursued with reasonable fidelity. As mentioned above, HVO fuels have only paraffinic HC components, lacking aromatics, cyclo-paraffins, and olefins, which are standard components in conventional fuel. Combustion researchers have advanced both detailed and reduced chemical kinetic mechanisms for paraffinic HC compounds; thus, modeling their combustion performance in a diesel-like setting appears promising.</p>
<p>In this work, the authors compare experimental results from operation of a pure paraffinic fuel (single component) in a typical military diesel engine with the predictive results from a simple model based in chemical reaction kinetics. Clearly, diesel combustion is a complex multi-phase, unsteady, reacting turbulent flow system, which makes predictive modeling difficult, particularly across many types and sizes of engines. However, the authors believe that a more simple view of focusing analytically on IGD can produce reasonably accurate indicators of acceptable engine performance. Thus, the authors here focus only on IGD and develop a simple constant pressure reactor model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics to capture the start of combustion (SOC; e.g. IGD).</p>
<p>From previous work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412446884">8</xref></sup> the authors have shown that if the SOC (e.g. IGD) occurs within a modestly sized ‘window’ of time after injection, then the engine will successfully operate and likely show reasonable combustion metrics. However, IGD that is outside this operational window will not result in viable engine operation. In other words, to first order, many important diesel engine combustion metrics can be tied closely with IGD. Since a large component of IGD is derived from a chemical induction period, as a first approach to evaluate the suitability of a new fuel, chemical kinetic modeling of the new fuel can lead to valuable insights.</p>
<p>Thus, the objective of this paper is to show how a relatively simple model based on detailed chemical kinetics can be utilized to elucidate and, to first order, predict corresponding trends in IGD. To this end, a typical and legacy military diesel engine was utilized with a pure paraffinic fuel (single component) fuel, n-hexadecane. The overall purpose is to demonstrate how low-cost modeling could be utilized to assess the viability of candidate future fuels across a variety of legacy diesel engines.</p>

<title>Experimental setup</title>
<p>The engine used in this study is an AM General Engine Products™ (GEP) 6.5 L V-8 Humvee turbocharged diesel engine, manufactured in 2007. The engine is an indirect-injection diesel with no electronic control in order to maximize reliability and durability in the field. It is equipped with 150 bar single-hole injectors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087412446884">Table 1</xref> lists the basic specifications of this engine and the operating conditions used in this study. A Kistler™ 6056 pressure transducer was mounted in the engine head (cylinder 1 only) and used in conjunction with a Kistler™ 5010B charge amplifier. A Kistler™ 4046 fuel line pressure transducer was utilized to determine start of injection (SOI). Airflow was measured with a Meriam™ laminar flow element. A BEI™ two-channel shaft encoder with crank angle degree (CAD) resolution and the top center (TC) pulse was used for indicating the engine crankshaft position. A diagram of the engine configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412446884">Figure 1</xref>. Data were collected with a National Instruments™ LabView data acquisition system sampling at a rate of 50 kHz. Approximately 100 engine cycles were collected at a given engine operating condition.</p>

<p>The exhaust gas was analyzed using a steady-state analyzer system and sampled from the exhaust flow using a heated filter approximately 10 cm downstream of the exhaust port. HCs were measured on a wet basis using a CAI™ model 600 heated flame ionization detector (HFID). Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured with a CAI™ model 602P combined non-dispersive infrared absorption (NDIR) and paramagnetic sensor. Nitric oxide (NO) emissions were measured using a CAI™ model 600 heated chemiluminescent analyzer on a dry basis. An ETAS™ LA4.2 wide-band oxygen sensor was used to measure the air–fuel ratio at all operating conditions; combined with the airflow measurement, this measurement allowed calculation of the fuel flow rate.</p>

<p>Data were collected at approximately 20 speed–load operating points.

<p>For a given engine speed, BMEP increases with <italic>φ</italic> due to the increased fueling per cycle. At a given equivalence ratio, BMEP decreases modestly with increasing speed due to the increased importance of friction with increasing speed. The maximum BMEP running cetane is approximately 10% lower than engine operation on diesel fuel due to the reduced density of cetane (0.77 v. 0.86 specific gravity) since the fuel-injection pump delivers a fixed maximum volume of fuel at maximum load. Corresponding maximum engine power is down approximately 10% (130 v. 143 kW) running the engine with pure cetane fuel.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412446884">Figure 3</xref> shows the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) characteristics of the Humvee engine running cetane fuel.

This result is due to the nearly constant friction mean effective pressure (FMEP) friction behavior of the engine at a given speed. Thus, the relative importance of friction diminishes as load increases at a given engine speed. As engine speed increases, BSFC worsens (increases) due to increasing engine friction.</p>

<title>Experimental IGD</title>
<p>A conventional engine heat-release analysis modeled using MIT’s single-zone approach,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412446884">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412446884"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412446884">11</xref></sup> was used to further analyze the engine’s in-cylinder pressure data. This single-zone model uses a first-law energy balance with combined unburned and burned single-zone average properties to determine the rate of energy release. The latent heat of fuel vaporization was not included in this heat-release analysis. As this is a legacy (low-pressure) mechanically injected engine, the fuel-injection event is characteristically twice as long as the IGD period, thus the authors believe that combustion begins before the majority of fuel has been injected and vaporized. Fast data sampling was converted to CAD and engine wall heat transfer was accomplished with the conventional instantaneous spatially averaged Woschni coefficient. This analysis is useful to characterize SOC and burn durations. SOI was determined from an injector pressure sensor. SOC was determined analytically as the 5% rise in instantaneous heat release above the SOI level. IGD was then determined experimentally as the difference between the SOI and SOC. A sample of these results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412446884">Figure 4</xref> for the 1500 r/min, lightest load case. Experimental in-cylinder pressure and injector fuel line pressure data are also shown in this figure. SOI is seen to occur at 348° (12° before top center (BTC)), and is denoted by the left-most dashed vertical line. SOC as determined by 5% of the maximum instantaneous heat-release rate (HRR) occurs at 351° (9° BTC) is shown by the next vertical dashed line. Thus, IGD is determined to be the difference of SOC and SOI, which for this operating condition is 3 CAD.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in-cylinder pressure was measured in the pre-chamber of this Humvee engine. The Humvee pre-chamber is the principle combustion chamber volume of the engine (only a small dish exists on the piston crown), with a relatively large and short passageway (cross-sectional area of approximately 1 cm<sup>2</sup> with transfer tube less than 1 cm in length) that connects the pre-chamber to the main engine cylinder. It is possible that a small pressure difference could exist between the pre-chamber and the main chamber during periods of high pre-chamber flow (e.g. mid-intake-stroke and during the bulk burn); however, this is expected to only modestly affect indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) calculations and not the heat-release analysis, which is the focus of this study.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412446884">Figure 5</xref> shows a summary of IGD characteristics on a time basis (ms) across the speed–load map running with cetane fuel operation.

Experimental variability in the determination of IGD is modest, especially at lower engine speeds, and will be shown as confidence interval bars in a later figure.

<title>IGD modeling</title>
<p>Conceptually, total experimental IGD can be broken down into two steps comprised of a physical delay period and a chemical delay period. This approach has been described in Challen and Baranescu,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412446884">1</xref></sup> with the caveat that some overlap exists between the physical delay and the chemical delay. For this study, these two delay periods will be assumed, to a first order, to be distinct and sequential. The physical delay portion (<italic>τ<sub>phys</sub></italic>) of this model includes the time required for a fuel spray to leave the injector, form droplets and entrain hot air, vaporize, mix, and reach a critical temperature required for the onset of rapid chemical reactions. These steps may all be occurring simultaneously and are depicted, along with associated fuel properties by Caton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412446884">8</xref></sup> Next, the chemical IGD period (<italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic>) includes the time required to initiate the chemical reactions that will quickly lead to explosive radical chain branching.</p>
<p>In the forthcoming analysis, the physical delay period will be determined as the difference between experimental total IGD (<italic>τ<sub>ign</sub></italic>) and the model-predicted chemical IGD (<italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic>), to be described in detail in the next section. The authors pursued this approach in a previous technical paper (see Carr et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412446884">12</xref></sup>), comparing experimental IGD results to chemical kinetic IGD (<italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic>) modeling results (also using a constant pressure reactor approach with SOI conditions) at a single engine speed and load running a binary surrogate fuel. For this study, the approach of measuring <italic>τ<sub>ign</sub></italic> and modeling <italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic> is applied across the engine’s entire speed–load range to determine <italic>τ<sub>phys</sub></italic>. It is the hope of the authors that current and future experimental- and modeling-based diesel spray research will be able to provide an alternative path to determine <italic>τ<sub>phys</sub></italic> so that a complete analytical-based initial evaluation of a new fuel’s acceptability can be pursued.</p>

<title>Chemical delay period</title>
<p>Once a fuel-vapor and air mixture is obtained with a suitable temperature and mixture ratio for chemical reaction (to be discussed further in the next section), there is a chemical delay period during which chemical reaction rates increase, ultimately leading to significant fuel chain branching. At high temperatures, the main chain branching reactions involve H radicals reacting with molecular oxygen to form OH plus O; when the temperature is lower though, the chemistry of hydroperoxides dominates, and at around 900 K, the main source of radicals is the rapid decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into two OH radicals. Although the addition of alkyl radicals (R) to molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) occurs at a slightly lower temperature, it also leads to degenerate chain branching and is extremely important to predict the onset of ignition in low- and moderate-temperature combustion systems such as diesel combustion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412446884">13</xref></sup> Low-temperature chain branching occurs in a process consisting of several steps, the first being an alkyl-peroxy (RO<sub>2</sub>) isomerization step, in which a peroxy group abstracts an H from the chain through a ringed transition state:</p>

</disp-formula></p>
<p>The rate of this isomerization step depends on the size of the ringed transition state and the type of C–H that is broken by the abstraction. For long-chain alkane species (e.g. cetane), there are many possible routes for this isomerization step, and thus the overall rate is faster than for shorter chain-length species. The time required for these and subsequent steps to yield significant chain branching is the main component of the chemical delay.</p>
<p>In order to more completely address the split between physical and chemical delay periods, the chemical delay period was computer modeled using an approach similar to that found in Curran et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412446884">14</xref></sup> Westbrook et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412446884">15</xref></sup> and Sarathy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412446884">16</xref></sup> IGD was modeled using a homogeneous constant pressure reactor assumption with a wide range of equivalence ratios (2–10) in order to evaluate IGD effects across a broad range of fuel–air mixtures. Initial conditions were chosen to be the in-cylinder pressure and temperature at SOI for each operating condition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412446884">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412446884">7</xref>, which is indicative of the environment into which the fuel is injected in the experimental engine. The temperature at SOI was determined using the above-described heat-release analysis. Chemical IGD (<italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic>) was defined as the time from the start of reaction modeling to when the rate of change of temperature reached its maximum (e.g. explosive chain branching (dT/dt)<sub>max</sub>). Other criteria based on specific species concentrations have been used, with all of these approaches providing very similar predicted chemical IGD times.</p>

<p>The detailed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) chemical kinetic model for n-hexadecane was assembled by combining previously developed mechanism for large n-alkanes. The mechanism for large n-alkanes considers n-alkanes up to n-hexadecane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412446884">15</xref></sup> It includes both low- and high-temperature chemistry, so that it can simulate ignition over the entire temperature range for diesel combustion. It has been validated for ignition over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and equivalence ratios. To create the present mechanism, the species and reactions necessary to model the C<sub>8</sub> to C<sub>16</sub> n-alkanes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412446884">15</xref></sup> were used.</p>

<title>Chemical IGD modeling results</title>
<p>The initial modeling effort involved simulating the chemical IGD using various fuel–air equivalence ratios (<italic>φ</italic>) in order to better understand the sensitivity. Results at the five different 1500 r/min load points are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412446884">Figure 8</xref>. The solid black bar with each data set is the experimentally measured total IGD. The additional five gray scale bars in each data set are the LLNL model-predicted chemical IGD at equivalence ratios from 2 to 6. Note that the general trend of decreasing chemical IGD with increasing load is captured by the model in agreement with the experimental data.</p>

</fig>
<p>The chemical delay is significantly shorter than the total experimental IGD. As described earlier, this difference is the physical delay time for the spray to develop a combustible mixture. It can also be seen that <italic>φ</italic> = 4 provides the shortest, quickest IGD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412446884">Figure 9</xref> shows the 1500 r/min data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412446884">Figure 8</xref>, as well as the experimental and modeling results for the three 3400 r/min operating points. The modeling results with various equivalence ratios at 1800 and 2500 r/min were removed for figure clarity, but follow the same general trends as the low- and high-speed cases. Again, it can be seen that for the high-speed (3400 r/min) points, an equivalence ratio of 4 has the shortest IGD. An equivalence ratio of 6 can be seen to be unlikely for the first fuel–air parcel to ignite, since the model-predicted result exceeds the experimentally measured total IGD. Representative experimental 95% confidence intervals are shown for both a low- and high-speed case.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since this study is investigating IGD and SOC, the quickest chemical delay fuel–air parcel (<italic>φ</italic> = 4) is thus most important as it will determine when combustion begins. This equivalence ratio will be the focus of the rest of this study, and is also consistent with previous work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412446884">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both experimental and model-predicted chemical IGDs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412446884">Figure 10</xref> for all of the speed–load points. It should be noted that no chemical kinetic model calibration was pursued in this study. LLNL’s long-chain alkane mechanism was applied directly to the Humvee operating conditions. Overall, the model predicts the general trends of the experimental data remarkably well. IGD delay is shorter with increasing load at a given speed. IGD is also shorter with increasing speed. The model captures both of these effects. The moderate difference between the experimental data and the model-predicted chemical IGD is due to the physical delay time discussed above. The resulting <bold><italic>τ<sub>phys</sub></italic></bold> will be discussed later on in this paper.</p>

<p>The detailed chemical kinetic model-predicted temperature histories of the <italic>φ</italic> = 4 fuel–air packet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412446884">Figure 11</xref> for the low- and high-speed cases. It is important to recall that the initial temperature for each operating point was based on SOI conditions at each individual operating point. Thus, the 3400 r/min cases are significantly hotter at SOI and are shown as dashed lines in the figure. The solid lines are the 1500 r/min data and are cooler due to the increased time for heat transfer in each engine cycle. For each speed data set, an arrow shows the direction of increasing load. This indicating arrow label will also be used in following figures. Additionally shown on this figure (and the following figures) are two black ‘dots’. These show the ignition point using the <italic>(dT/dt)<sub>max</sub></italic> ignition criterion described above. The additional open circle symbols show, just for this figure, the ignition points for the other load points in each engine speed data set. It can be seen that ignition occurs in the 1300 to 1500 K range characteristic of heavy HC fuels. The open symbols will be left off in future figures in order to improve figure clarity.</p>

</fig>
<p>The modeled temperature behavior in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1468087412446884">Figure 11</xref> shows an interesting two-step trend. This behavior is due to the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) region behavior that is characteristic of straight-chain alkanes reacting in the 800 to 1000 K region. This NTC temperature regime is slightly higher than that normally seen from laboratory combustion studies; however, these results are consistent with recent research from LLNL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412446884">18</xref></sup> This region has been shown to be important for straight-chain alkanes where endothermic reactions delay kinetics. In this temperature regime, alkyl-peroxy fuel radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) become unstable, preventing the low-temperature degenerate chain branching from taking place, leaving the hydroperoxyl radical (HO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) decomposition to control the reactivity. At these lower temperatures, characteristic of the end of the compression combustion chamber environment at lower engine speeds, the dominant kinetic paths takes place primarily through the formation of alkyl-peroxy radicals (RO<sub>2</sub>) via addition of molecular oxygen to alkyl (R) radicals, followed by production of alkyl hydroperoxides (QOOH). Additionally, it can be seen that the high-speed cases (3400 r/min) do not show this two-stage NTC-type behavior. This is because the temperature of the combustion chamber at SOI is well above 1000 K for the 3400 r/min operating points. Thus, the chemical kinetics are driven by more dominating high-temperature reactions that do not display NTC characteristics.</p>
<p>Next is shown how the fuel (nC<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>: normal n-hexadecane) is consumed in this reacting fuel–air parcel. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1468087412446884">Figure 12</xref> shows the n-hexadecane fuel mole fraction (concentration) as a function of time for the operating points at both 1500 and 3400 r/min. Again, an arrow is placed across each engine r/min data set to show the trends with increasing load. Additionally, the ignition ‘dots’ are placed at the time of ignition for only the highest load operating point at each speed. By the time ignition occurs, essentially all of the fuel has been consumed, leading to combustion (the ignition ‘dots’ are essentially on the horizontal axis). The 3400 r/min fuel consumption histories show a steady depletion in base fuel (n-C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>) as the fuel is breaking down ultimately to form CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O. The 1500 r/min cases show the two-stage NTC behavior as described above, which slows down the rate of fuel consumption due to the endothermic chemical kinetics early in the reaction process.</p>

</fig>
<p>As hydrogen atoms are extracted from the fuel, two key radicals are formed, HO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which further allow the chemical reactions to proceed. The detailed chemical kinetic model provides detailed insights into these early reactions leading to combustion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412446884">Figure 13</xref> shows the formation of the hydroperoxyl radical (HO<sub>2</sub>). This radical can be formed by the concerted elimination reaction (ROO→Olefin+HO<sub>2</sub>) or by the addition of O<sub>2</sub> to a hydrogen atom that was recently eliminated by partially oxidized fuel fragments. It can be seen that HO<sub>2</sub> builds up to a quasi-steady level before ignition-combustion is defined to occur. HO<sub>2</sub>-based reactions are thus important throughout the entire chemical induction (chemical IGD) period.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) formation is next shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087412446884">Figure 14</xref>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is a strong oxidizer that can aid in further fuel decomposition. During the early phases of the kinetics, once the fuel vapor and air mixture have formed, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> comes principally from reactions of fuel with HO<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen peroxide also comes from the reaction of two HO<sub>2</sub> molecules leading to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. It can be seen from the two combustion ‘dots’ (both at 3400 and 1500 r/min) that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> builds up to a maximum concentration midway through the chemical induction period (chemical IGD period), and after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has dissociated (e.g. reduced in concentration) into OH radicals, combustion finally occurs.</p>

<p>The three important intermediate species, hydroxyl radical (OH), the late forming acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), and high-temperature formaldehyde (CH<sub>2</sub>O) develop as is characteristic of pure HC combustion. These will be shown in composite species summary figures later in this paper.</p>
<p>CO formation is the next to final step in HC oxidation of a stoichiometric fuel–air parcel. However, for fuel-rich combustion, CO can be a stable final product, as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087412446884">Figure 15</xref>. The concentration of CO is seen to be at approximately 10% at the time of ignition, and holds steady after combustion begins.</p>

</fig>
<p>CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1468087412446884">Figure 16</xref>) formation principally comes from the further oxidation of CO provided that sufficient O<sub>2</sub> is present. CO<sub>2</sub> levels are seen to be well below 1% at the time of ignition, peaking at only 1–2% overall when combustion is allowed to progress completely. This concentration is an order of magnitude lower than that formed during stoichiometric HC combustion. This very low level of CO<sub>2</sub> formation is due to the very rich fuel–air packets that are first to ignite in a diesel flame.</p>

<p>Finally, composite species histories are shown for both the low- and high-speed cases (high load). The results for 1500 r/min are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1468087412446884">Figure 17</xref>. It can be seen that early in the fuel–air kinetics, HO<sub>2</sub> formation rates are greater than that of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation mechanisms begin to dominate at approximately 0.06 ms. The NTC behavior is also now clearly evident at nominally 0.07 ms after the start of the kinetics. This NTC behavior tends to slow down the progression of the reactions leading to ignition. A reduction in OH and HO<sub>2</sub> is seen during this period, which is why the cooler 1500 r/min cases take longer to ignite.</p>

It can be seen that due to the high initial temperature that the reactions proceed directly into high-temperature kinetic paths and thus no NTC behavior is seen, which tends to delay the progression towards ignition. This high-speed case leads to fast combustion.</p>

<title>Physical delay period</title>
<p>A mid-load summary of the IGDs as a function of engine speed is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1468087412446884">Figure 19</xref>. The top data line represents the total experimentally measured IGD. The chemical IGD (<italic>τ<sub>chem</sub></italic>) is the model-predicted delay and is represented by the dark gray region. The physical delay is the difference of the total and chemical delays and is represented by the light gray region. The total IGD is the sum of the physical and chemical delays. As discussed throughout this paper, the total IGD decreases with engine speed. Note also that the chemical IGD decreases with increasing engine speed, although at a more modest rate. This analysis shows and suggests that the physical delay is the most sensitive to engine speed, decreasing inversely with engine speed. As engine turbulence length scales also decrease inversely with engine speed, this effect is qualitatively physically correct. Knowledge of this physical delay time could be used with future chemical kinetic modeling results from different fuels (or fuel surrogates) to predict total IGD of a new fuel in an effort to determine fuel suitability. The authors are also pursuing model-based research in order to analytically predict this physical delay time in the engine context.</p>
