<p>This book is a very rare and valuable piece of research on a conflict that crystallized in a struggle in Shanghai, the biggest commercial city in China. Lasting less than 1 month (8–26 September 1955), the 18 days of mass arrests of Catholics in Shanghai were the result of a Catholic–Communist confrontation that spanned a period of 6 years (1949–1955). <italic>Church Militant: Bishop Kung and Catholic Resistance in Communist Shanghai</italic> discusses in great detail the strong resistance of Shanghai’s Catholics to the religious suppression exercised by the new regime of the People’s Republic of China under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p>In 1980, Eric Hanson wrote a book entitled <italic>Catholic Politics in China and Korea</italic> (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1980) and he devoted a short chapter (pp. 72–9) to the Catholic power in Shanghai. Hanson portrayed the Catholic resistance to the CCP’s interference in the Catholic faith of followers in Shanghai. The political power of the latter had already been indigenized in a regional ecclesiastical tradition that went back 350 years (p. 72). In a brief introduction, Hanson argues that Shanghai’s Catholic leaders were shrewd political operatives, who quickly adopted Chinese communist mobilization methods to resist Marxist-Leninist ideology (p. 73). The current book follows a similar line of argument and expands Hanson’s work by examining the struggle in greater depth.</p>
<p>By providing a detailed account and in-depth analysis based on various kinds of sources, Paul Mariani successfully answers the question of how the Catholic Church in Shanghai was able to resist the communists for so long. According to the author, a unifying ideology in the Catholic community, strong leadership from academically well-trained and spiritually fervent Jesuits and diocesan priests, together with articulated organization, constituted the cornerstone in this Catholic resistance. Mariani carries out a full-scale analysis of the strategies they employed.</p>
<p>On 8 September 1955, the mass arrest of Shanghai Bishop Kung Pinmei together with 7 diocesan priests, 14 Jesuit priests, 2 Carmelite sisters and 300 leading Chinese Catholics was the largest single arrest in the history of the Catholic Church in China. A government source indicates that even the CCP acknowledged that the crackdown on Shanghai’s Catholics proved to be the most difficult of assaults on religious communities in China in the 1950s. After the CCP had cracked the hard nut of resistance posed by Shanghai’s Catholics in 1955, it went on to crack the second hard nut in Guangzhou by jailing its Catholic leader the Jesuit Bishop Dominic Deng Yiming in February 1958. Without these two major crackdowns, major resistance from the Chinese Catholics would not have been eliminated and Party control of the Church in China could not have been launched (for an account of Bishop Dominic Tang’s advocacy and activism, see his memoir <italic>How Inscrutable His Ways Memoirs</italic>, 3rd edn, Hong Kong: n.p., 1994).</p>
<p>While Hanson only offers a framework of the struggle between the Church and the CCP, Mariani fleshes out Hanson’s framework by providing accounts and discussions of events that throw light on how the Church in Shanghai opposed the CCP’s policy on religion. Resistance included the rejection of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement and teaching an orthodox Catholic faith to youths in major parishes and Catholic schools. The appointment of Father Kung Pinmei as the bishop of Shanghai and Suzhou was a deployment for future Catholic militancy. The intensive Catholic activities in some Catholic parishes became the bastion of Catholic resistance. The mass arrest of Catholics with Bishop Kung at the helm on 8 September 1955 was a culmination of the CCP’s preparations to crack down on Catholic priests in Shanghai, beginning with the harassment and expulsion of foreign missionaries.</p>
<p>Mariani employs both Catholic and Chinese sources in his research, such as unpublished archival materials of missionary societies, personal letters written from prison and internal church documents, archival material from the Vatican, missionary journals, newsletters and magazines. The Shanghai Municipal Archives provided classified material that enabled the author to give a highly detailed account in his discussion of the Catholic resistance in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mariani’s contribution in researching this crucial part of Church history in contemporary China is highly valuable indeed. This kind of research on church history is never easy, because not every scholar is allowed access to Church and missionary archives that are jealously guarded by individual missionary societies and that are not open to members of the public and researchers alike. Only church personnel or members belonging to particular missionary societies and proficient in European languages including Latin are allowed – with permission from their religious superiors – to make good use of the Church archives for research purposes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would have been better had Mariani paid more attention to the state’s policy with respect to Catholics in that period, evidence of which could be seen in the harsh treatment meted out, for example, arrests, public accusations, and other means to defame Catholics in Shanghai. This would have provided a proper dimension to Shanghai’s Catholic militant resistance in the context of the CCP’s religious policies right after the 1949 revolution.</p>
