<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>It seems that human geography is in the midst of a(nother) period in which received concepts of place, region, territory and scale are very much open to critical scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132510394118">Jessop et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510394118">Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132510394118">MacLeod and Jones, 2007</xref>), if not in need of a fundamental overhaul (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132510394118">Marston et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, those notions of place and region that refer to bounded spatial units – the so-called territorial viewpoint – are being challenged, and in some instances usurped, by concepts which draw attention to interspatial relations, flows and networks – the so-called relational viewpoint. The growing attraction of the relational approach to regions reflects certain misgivings about the representation of territory in the literature developing around the New Regionalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132510394118">Harrison, 2008a</xref>); misgivings which are somehow neatly dispelled by contrasting relational spatial thinking to the territorial viewpoint.</p>
<p>One theme which is central to relational thinking is the idea that the region represents a contingent ‘coming togetherness’ or assemblage of proximate and distant social, economic and political relationships, the scale and scope of which do not necessarily converge neatly around territories and jurisdictions formally administered or governed by the nation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132510394118">Allen and Cochrane, 2007</xref>). At least, in this respect, proponents of the relational turn are arguably justified in wanting to distance themselves from bounded, static and ahistorical representations of space and place. Such representations were once closely associated with positivism and traditional regional geography and accordingly have been the subject of extensive critical analysis over the years. There is no need to rehearse these critiques here. Suffice it to say that references to the differences between territorial and relational viewpoints help to convey the idea that regions are not self-contained formal territorial entities. Many critical regional theorists now prefer to think of regions as fluid and historically contingent social constructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132510394118">Jones and MacLeod, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132510394118">Paasi, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132510394118">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one might want to question the wisdom of tarring all New Regionalists with the same brush of thinking territorially rather than relationally. Such characterizations tend to deflect attention from some of the limitations of relational thinking about regions (as well as space, scale and territory more generally). Not the least of these limitations is a propensity to neglect the analysis of territorial politics. For what seems to be missing in the relational/territorial debate about regions is any serious discussion of territory and territoriality. In other words, how might relational approaches to place and region shed light on the state and territorial politics? The purpose of this review is examine whether recent debates about regional economic development, interplace competition and regional resilience are premised on certain (overlooked) assumptions about the nature of territory and territorial politics. I begin with some brief reflections on the commonalities and differences between relational and territorial approaches to regions and regionalism. This is followed by a discussion of the treatment of the state and territorial politics in the various literatures developing around the New Regionalism. In conclusion, I suggest that the received distinction drawn between territorial and relational approaches could be rendered obsolete if closer attention is paid to questions of territory and territorial politics.</p>

<title>II Territorial and relational approaches reconsidered</title>
<p>In the past, human geographers have often approached the region from divergent ontological and epistemological perspectives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132510394118">Agnew et al., 1996</xref>: 366–377). For example, there was the long-standing debate about the merits of studying, respectively, formal and functional regions. That debate served to highlight some of the key philosophical and epistemological differences between traditional regional geography and its successor positivist spatial science (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132510394118">Johnston and Sidaway, 2004</xref>: 61–110). Recent and ongoing encounters between realist (so-called political-economy) geographers and poststructuralists continue this tradition of debate and discussion, at times even promising to put aside once and for all the age-old distinction between formal and functional regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132510394118">Agnew, 1990</xref>). In conveying the sense that the territorial and relational approaches represent two opposing extremes along a spectrum of approaches to place and region, differences in ontology and epistemology can be clarified; as also can certain claims that can be made about the usefulness of associated concepts like scale, territory and network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132510394118">Jessop et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The deployment of heuristic frameworks and opposing concepts to highlight differences of theoretical approach – or what might be called binary thinking (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132510394118">Harvey, 1999</xref>) – can be helpful in the further refinement of critical concepts. Presumably without such debate and discussion, the discipline would be in a philosophical and methodological stasis. Yet it is worth noting that the relational perspective on place and region is not new; nor does it represent an internally consistent set of approaches. In fact, several distinctive strands of relational thinking about regions have emerged from the work of radical human geographers and social theorists in the 1970s and early 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132510394118">Jonas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132510394118">Pudup, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132510394118">Sayer, 1989</xref>). For example, proponents of what became known as the New Regional Geography (NRG) argued that places and regions could be theorized as a combination, and contingent outcome, of the interaction of localized social relations and material conditions with wider processes of capitalist restructuring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132510394118">Massey, 1979</xref>). When examined through the lens of the realist method, the NRG envisioned places and regions as neither fixed territories nor a contingent ‘coming together’ of global flows and networks (which would imply that places and regions had little or no independent causal influence). Rather regions were to be examined as semi-coherent territories within which place-specific causal properties could shape – and in turn were shaped by – the wider dynamics of capital accumulation, state intervention (or withdrawal) and uneven development. This way of thinking about regions might now be offered as evidence of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132510394118">Jones (2009)</xref> has recently described as ‘phase space’. This is the idea that space (i.e. regionalism) is only ever semi-coherent in its concrete realization; it is always constructed out of the tensions between spatial fixity and flow. Therefore the key issue is to think not so much of the processes that help to containerize space into discrete regions but rather to investigate where, why and how processes of regionalization are negotiated, constructed and contested, becoming semi-permanently fixed or, conversely, dissolving altogether.</p>
<p>Relational perspectives on place and region have often been characterized as exhibiting a global sense of place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132510394118">Massey, 1991</xref>). What this means is that one can write about the ‘globalness’ of regions without assuming that the regional scale is fixed in space, subordinate to the global or somehow exists ‘above’ the local. In this respect, regions cannot – and indeed should not – be disconnected analytically from other regions, scales and territories. Above all else, relational thinking about regions gives licence for critical geographers to conceive of development processes and territorial politics in capitalism as operating both in a ‘vertical’ or ‘upwards’ dimension (e.g. from local-to-regional-to-national-to-global scales) and also ‘horizontally’ (place-to-place relations, including global connections, and differences). Of course, it has since become fashionable to distance the study of place, region and spatial politics from so-called ‘vertical’ thinking about territory and territorial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132510394118">Marston et al., 2005</xref>). Quite why this should have happened is difficult to pinpoint. Much of it has to do with the premise of the ‘scale debate’ in which so-called vertical thinking (about scalar hierarchies) has confusingly been equated with the territorial approach to place, region and spatial politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132510394118">Jonas, 2006</xref>). Protagonists in the scale debate often like to attribute vertical thinking to political-economic theories of the region when in fact it could be argued that such theories underpinned relational thinking about place and region in the first instance.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132510394118">Morgan (2007)</xref> has argued that such an overly simplistic reading of the relational perspective (i.e. that it is not only different to, but also a distinct improvement upon, territorial approaches) leads to two false assumptions:<disp-quote>
<p>In the first place it is a caricature of the mainstream view of cities and regions; by juxtaposing relational and territorial readings of place, as though they are mutually exclusive, it creates a binary division that is wholly unwarranted. Second, like its modernist forebears, it leaves the impression that territorial political affinities are antediluvian, parochial or even reactionary. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132510394118">Morgan, 2007</xref>: 1248)</p>
</disp-quote>There is also a sense in which the tone of recent debates about whether regions are either territorial or relational recalls a bygone age when regional geography was at the service of the Enlightenment project. Then the main task of the geographer was to draw boundaries around those territories of interest to colonialist and imperialist ventures. Echoing these sentiments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132510394118">Painter (2008)</xref> suggests that the ‘cartographic anxiety’ continues to haunt contemporary critical approaches to the region, thereby resulting in a lack of attention to how regionalism might shed further light on territory and territoriality, including state practices with respect to suchlike.</p>
<p>Although questions of territory, identity and territorial politics should be at the forefront of regional analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132510394118">Paasi, 2009</xref>), one struggles to find good examples in the regional economic development literature. The lack of attention to territorial politics is surprising given that the development of critical (relational) regional thinking was once informed by historical-geographical materialism (HGM), wherein concepts of territory, geopolitics and power were quite central to regional analysis. HGM saw regions and territorial organization operating at the nexus of tensions between fixity and flow in capitalism. Thus questions of regionalism, territorial organization, power and politics were very much at the forefront of David Harvey’s early work on the geopolitics of capitalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132510394118">Harvey, 1985</xref>). Harvey has revisited such concerns more recently in an analysis of the current global accumulation crisis of capitalism. He has argued that one outcome of the current crisis could be an intensification of regionalization process as countries like the USA withdraw from global financial arena and look to build new regional and transterritorial alliances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132510394118">Harvey, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132510394118">Harrison (2008a)</xref> is encouraged by the revival of interest in regions among political-economic geographers. Moreover, he suggests that the territorial and relational approaches to region and place have more in common than their respective protagonists might care to admit (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132510394118">Allen and Cochrane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132510394118">Pike, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the relational and territorial approaches do seem to diverge on the key issue of whether regionalism is best viewed as a ‘bottom-up’ or ‘top-down’ process. The answer to this question more often seems to depend on one’s positioning in ontological debates than is the result of a considered examination of the concrete actions and strategies of various agents, actors, interests and the respective spaces of dependence and spaces of engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132510394118">Cox, 1998</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132510394118">Morgan (2007</xref>: 1248) suggests, it is a contingent matter as to whether regionalism is progressive (i.e. ‘bottom-up’) or reactionary (‘top-down’). Therefore any attempt to assign regionalism a priori either to the territorial or to the relational perspectives does not come across as an especially critical or discriminating perspective on territorial politics, economic and political interests, and spatial outcomes.</p>

<title>III Competitive regionalism and territorial politics</title>
<p>A cursory examination of regional development literatures would reveal that questions of state territoriality and territorial politics have generally been secondary to discourses of globalization, competition and economic development. One finds plenty of assertions to the effect that regions (and city-regions) are becoming more competitive, efficient or resilient (see below) than the nation state. Yet such assertions are often made in the absence of any critical discussion of the role of the state and territorial politics. This is not to say that some of the more astute interpretations of the rise of the New Regionalism have completely failed to consider the nature of post-Fordist territorial politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132510394118">Lovering, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132510394118">MacLeod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132510394118">Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132510394118">Storper, 1997</xref>). Yet the advance of the New Regionalism literature is constantly bedevilled by sweeping assertions to the effect that regions, metropolitan regions and mega-regional agglomerations operate as quasi-independent ‘actor spaces’ and drive forward competition, economic growth and wealth distribution. Moreover, this only ever seems to happen at the expense of the nation state and its extant internal territorial politics.</p>
<p>For instance, in his recent book, <italic>Who’s Your City?</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132510394118">Richard Florida (2008)</xref> argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>As the distribution of economic activity has gone global, the city-system has also gone global – meaning that cities now compete on a global terrain. That means that bigger and more competitive economic units – mega-regions – have superceded cities as the real engines of the global economy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132510394118">Florida, 2008</xref>: 42)</p>
</disp-quote>Florida proceeds to list examples of such mega-regions, including Greater Tokyo, Boston-Washington, Rome-Milan-Turin, and so forth. The latter example is worth a closer look. It describes a region stretching from the Italian Alps to the ‘boot’ of southern Italy in one continuous urban sprawl (as measured in this case by satellite images of the light emitted at night from continuous city-regional developments). In bestowing from aloft territorial coherence on this unlikely Italian mega-region, Florida neatly skirts over some complex historical, cultural and political processes that might (but in fact probably do not) bind this putative region into a coherent geo-economic unit. Florida’s analysis is fairly typical of a style of pseudo-territorial analysis that has come to characterize contemporary regional development theory. It begs all sorts of questions about the role of actors and agents, territorial interests, and associated problems of territorial dependence, which give the territorial-distributional politics of global capitalist development pathways a mega-regionalist form.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for now the geopolitics of mega-city-regions, New Regionalist thinking has made quite substantial inroads into contemporary economic development discourse at all scales. The notion of competitive regionalism, in particular, has gained ascendancy in mainstream global policy thinking in spite of evidence that regionalism continues to assume nationally specific forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132510394118">Jonas and Ward, 2002</xref>). The corresponding attention given to territorial politics and state territorial structures is often deemed to be of secondary importance to the analysis of putative new regionalist governance structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132510394118">Ward and Jonas, 2004</xref>). This is not to say that the territorial-distributional implications of the New Regionalism have been ignored altogether. The New Regionalism embraces diverse schools of thought ranging from neo-regionalist thinking in international relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132510394118">Ohmae, 1993</xref>) and trade policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132510394118">Mucchielli et al., 1998</xref>) to the workings of city-regional policy and public administration at the subnational scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132510394118">Mitchell-Weaver et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132510394118">Pastor et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132510394118">Rusk, 1993</xref>). On the one hand, anthropologists believe that questions of territory, scale and efficiency are central to discussions of the optimal size of the regional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132510394118">Bodley, 2003</xref>). Regional scientists and geographers, on the other, suggest that in complex modern state systems the reallocation of authority across different scales creates distributional asymmetries and inefficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132510394118">Rodríguez-Pose and Gill, 2004</xref>). In short, there is no lack of attention to the economic and fiscal policy implications of regionalization for different scales of state territoriality.</p>
<p>The growing divergence between mainstream policy work on regional economic development and critical approaches to regionalism represents a point of departure for a recent special issue of <italic>Regional Studies</italic>, which is devoted to conceptualizing local and regional development (LRED) in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132510394118">Wood and Valler, 2010</xref>). Several of the papers in this collection point to the uniqueness and specificities of the regionalism question in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132510394118">Cox, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132510394118">Jonas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132510394118">Niedt and Weir, 2010</xref>). In an insightful summary of the collection’s main findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132510394118">Christopherson (2010</xref>: 230) gets to the heart of the matter by asking ‘why is it that some types of questions are visible and compelling in the United States while others are missing from the theoretical agenda?’ The answer she believes lies in the nature of territorial-distributional politics in the USA; the fragmentation of government and governance means that ‘[c]ompetition among places is so embedded in the US national governance regime and psyche that it is assumed in LRED analysis’ (p. 230). Further comparative work of this nature could shed light on the extent to which certain widely held beliefs about contemporary forms of regional economic development and territorial competition are based on unexamined assumptions about the state, territory and territorial politics.</p>

<title>IV Territorializing the economy: The question of regional resilience</title>
<p>One senses a growing unease among some regional development scholars regarding assertions that processes of deterritorialization are taking hold to such an extent that regional development theory can be so easily divorced from knowledge of territory and territorial politics. One symptom of this uneasiness is the recent interest in the economic resilience of regions. The metaphor of regional resilience has acquired a certain intellectual currency in part because of its ability to link regional economic development to problems of social equity and environmentalism. More pertinently, resilience analysis opens up a different way of thinking about the ways in which regional economic development processes are – or could be – seen as territorialized.</p>
<p>Notably, in these times of economic and environmental crisis, the metaphor of resilience resonates with the notion that economic development involves resistance and adaptation as much as growth and competition. Resilience implies that knowledge of the internal capacities of regions matters as much as their external relations. The gist of this idea can be summarized as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>the fashionable use of the concept [of regional resilience] may originate both from an increased sense of risk (economic and political as well as environmental) and from the perception that processes associated with globalization have made places and regions more permeable to the effects of what were once thought to be external processes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132510394118">Christopherson et al., 2010</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>Defined in this way, resiliency is an internal property of (regional) territory, which must always be juxtaposed to the external risks to places and regions posed by global flows of investment and environmental and economic crises.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such considerations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132510394118">Bristow (2010)</xref> suggests that regional policy-makers continue to conflate resilience with competitiveness. Like its predecessor concept of competitive regionalism, the internal/external problematic underpinning resiliency runs the danger of treating territorial politics as no more than the effect of extrinsic forces rather than constituted by and through territorial interests. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132510394118">Pastor et al. (2009)</xref> suggest that the question of regional resilience must be premised upon knowledge of how regional coalitions (i.e. territorial political interests) are constituted in the first place. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132510394118">Pike et al. (2010)</xref> ask whether regional and local institutions can develop ‘adaptive capabilities’ and respond to the challenges of globalization and state rescaling. Their analysis leaves some scope in regional development/resilience theory for examining territorial politics from the ‘bottom up’. Perhaps the problem hitherto with relational thinking around regions has been a tendency to overemphasize territorial politics as a response to external flows and mobility and, correspondingly, to underemphasize internal territorial interests, constraints and problems of immobility. It is in both of these respects that questions of territory and territorial politics must remain salient in regional development theory.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0309132510394118">
<title>V Territory, territoriality and the regionalizing state</title>
<p>Territory and territoriality are notoriously difficult concepts to pin down. As the above discussion of resiliency suggests, there is always the danger of resorting to biological metaphors of territory – metaphors in which questions of human agency, power and territorial politics are frequently obscured or elided. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132510394118">Elden (2009</xref>: xxvi) suggests, territory is ‘a political and legal term concerning the relationship between sovereignty, land, and people’. Questions of territory and territorial integrity have traditionally been linked to examinations of the nation state and geopolitical processes operating above it. Only to a lesser extent have they informed critical discussions of regionalism and regional development politics inside the state. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132510394118">Elden (2009)</xref> argues that territory and territoriality should not necessarily be conflated with the state and sovereignty especially where, for instance, questions of land, resources, economic development and citizen rights are at stake. Nonetheless there are signs that the development of new critical approaches to territory and territoriality are starting to inform new interpretations of regional state space and territorial politics.</p>
<p>For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132510394118">Brenner and Elden (2009)</xref> offer a new interpretation of state space drawing extensively on Henri Lefebvre’s work. They place particular emphasis on how Lefebvre’s writings shed light on questions of territory and spatial politics inside the state (or, as Lefebvre put it, ‘spatial policy’). Among his many insights into state space, Lefebvre saw regionalization as tied up closely with the withering away of the state and the rise of autogestion. As Brenner and Elden explain, autogestion is hard to define but in general terms seems to refer to grass-roots political actions and working-class social movements seeking to secure greater control and autonomy from the state. Drawing extensively on Lefebvre, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132510394118">Brenner (2009</xref>: 129) has recently affirmed the arguments spelled out in his earlier monograph, <italic>New State Spaces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132510394118">Brenner, 2004</xref>), that ‘the reorientation of state spatial strategies from nationally redistributive modalities towards urban-centric, competitiveness-oriented forms of locational policy still appears quite pervasive across the EU [European Union]’. Brenner’s take on metropolitan regionalism links the appearance of interspatial competition and regional development to the capacity of the state apparatus to manage, reconfigure and orchestrate the territorial politics of distribution across a range of state territorial scales (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132510394118">Brenner, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132510394118">Cox (2009)</xref> suggests that recent work by the likes of Brenner on state rescaling has generally been good at showing how state strategies with respect to regions and city-regions constitute responses to wider political and economic trends. But it has been less convincing on how state rescaling and regulatory processes are territorialized and how territorial politics (e.g. regionalist tendencies, central-local relations, class-based territorial politics) can in turn shape wider processes of regulation and state rescaling. Cox suggests that more work needs to be done on showing how territorial politics are constitutive of state restructuring and rescaling rather than the other way round. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132510394118">Jonas and Pincetl (2006)</xref> have argued in the context of an empirical study of the New Regionalism in California that the rescaling of the state and governance around regions could be as much a strategic ‘bottom-up’ outcome of organized business interests as it is a solution which is pursued in a unidirectional ‘top-down’ fashion by (central) state interests. Likewise the distinction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132510394118">Harrison (2008b)</xref> draws between ‘centrally orchestrated regionalism’ and ‘regionally orchestrated centralism’ is suggestive of the different ways in which regionalism is underpinned by territorial politics.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on a notion of territory and territorial politics as the outcome of wider processes of globalization and state rescaling, it should be possible to show how regional strategies of economic development and state redistribution are contingent upon territorial politics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132510394118">Park (2008)</xref> demonstrates how territorial politics have been important in framing the ways in which the Korean state has reorganized its scalar divisions of labour. Attempts to introduce new regional and city-regional state spaces reflect and embody central-local tensions inside the Korean state. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132510394118">Moisio (2008)</xref> examines the political actions and discourses that have underpinned particular acts of spatial state transformation in Finland, such as the rise of competitive city-regionalism as a state spatial policy. He argues that this development is premised on how business and political elites have rethought Finland’s role in the wider global economy. One increasingly influential policy discourse is that the survival of Finland depends on its ability to compete in the global economy, which means abandoning policies in pursuit of regional equality and promoting the growth of Helsinki and the surrounding region of southern Finland. Moisio concludes inter alia that:<disp-quote>
<p>This kind of argumentation … clearly diminishes the absolute value of the state territory and national peripheries. At the same time it means that regions other than the Greater Helsinki region and the two or three largest ‘provincial growth engines’ are very hard to be seen as having a role in the pursuit of economic competitiveness by the Finnish state. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132510394118">Moisio, 2008</xref>: 23)</p>
</disp-quote>The above examples demonstrate the different ways in which the state’s approach to regional economic development is fundamentally premised upon a particular understanding of territory and territorial politics. In each case, regionalism is examined both in relation to threats and opportunities external to state space and at the same time in terms of territorial-distributional politics internal to the state.</p>

<title>VI Conclusion</title>
<p>In this progress report, I have commented on the recent tendency to decouple regions and regional development processes from bounded notions of state and territory and, correspondingly, to connect regions and regionalism to wider flows, networks and processes of economic globalization and neoliberalism. In doing so, the regionalism problematic has become theoretically disconnected from crucial questions of territory and territorial politics. Consequently, there is a sense in which such work could be exaggerating the importance of relational (i.e. non-territorial) processes in shaping regional development politics. It could eventually lead to an intellectual backlash against relational thinking and self-styled ‘non-scalist’ interpretations of regions and spatial politics.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that regional analysis must at the very least take into account how some regional economic and political interests continue to be expressed in a territorial fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132510394118">Prytherch, 2010</xref>). Far from reflecting residual or antediluvian political identities, new (and old) regions offer all sorts of opportunities and possibilities not only for the creation of new political identities but also for new and alternative regional economic discourses to be forged against mainstream ideas about globalization, state restructuring and competition. In this respect, the analysis of regions offers scope for intellectual resiliency in the face of uncertain global economic and political times. Progress on the regionalism question will require further examples both of relational thinking about territorial politics and of territorial thinking about relational processes.</p>
