<abstract>
<p>The authors examine the effects of modernization and secularization on the vote for the religious party in the Italian First Republic (1948–1992). In addition to modernization and secularization, they also introduce two new factors to the analysis: the importance of institutionalized Church and effects of the Church’s Vatican II reforms. Italy is of particular relevance because of the centrality of the Catholic religion in the Italian society and politics, and the domination of the religious party—the Christian Democracy (Democrazia Cristiana; DC) in the country’s party system until 1992. The authors analyze the impact on the DC vote of a series of indicators of modernization and secularization and of Church organization and reform. The uniqueness of the analysis rests on the exceptional detailed and historical data for the Italian commune (<italic>N</italic> = 6,140) across this time period and the use of advanced quantitative techniques. The analysis confirms the traditional interpretation of secularization but also stresses effects of the failure of the Church’s reforms of Vatican II. These reforms, which deemphasized the institutionalized Church in favor of a more individualized, spiritual view, were intended as a response to modernization. Instead, the reforms hastened the decline affiliated organizations and the religious party.</p>

<p>Historically Italy has provided the international spiritual center of Catholic Christendom. The primacy of Rome as the locus for the Catholic Church and the status of the Bishop of Rome as Pope made the Italian peninsula crucial in the evolution of religion and politics in Europe. Today, Italy, compared to the other Catholic countries, still hosts the largest number of clerics (priests, nuns, monks) and parishes in absolute terms and maintains the most ample and articulated ecclesiastical organization (<italic>Annuario Pontificio</italic>, various years; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0010414012453030">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0010414012453030">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0010414012453030">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0010414012453030">Offi, 1998</xref>). This density of Church organization exists in a country whose population considers itself overwhelming Catholic, and Italians adhere to the Church’s sacraments of baptisms, christenings, marriage, Sunday mass attendance, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0010414012453030">Barone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453030">Burgalassi, 1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453030">1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0010414012453030">Ceasareo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414012453030">Pisati, 2000</xref>). In Europe, only Ireland and, to some extent, Poland displayed a similar commitment to Church sacraments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453030">Davie, 2000</xref>, p. 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0010414012453030">Minkenberg, 2002</xref>, p. 238; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0010414012453030">Pollack, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Italian Catholicism in the postwar period found its political expression in the church-sponsored Catholic party, the DC (Democrazia Cristiana; Christian Democracy), which dominated the First Republic from 1948 to 1992. In that period the DC was <italic>always</italic> in government, provided prime ministers for 44 of the 48 governments, and <italic>always</italic>, and often by far, received the most votes. The DC outperformed the second party, the PCI (Partito Comunista Italiano; Italian Communist Party), by an average of more than 12 points over the entire period. Several factors underpinned the DC’s pivotal position in the Italian politics: interclass appeal, anticommunist and pro-Western standing, and control of patronage resources, particularly in the south where the Church colonized the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0010414012453030">Giovagnoli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0010414012453030">Leonardi &amp; Wertman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414012453030">Parisi, 1979</xref>). The at times suffocating influence of the Church undergirded the DC’s Catholic constituency, particularly in the first decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453030">Galli et al., 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Paralleling other European countries after the 1960s, Italy experienced secularization, especially the weakening religious prescriptions for social behavior and participation in the religious rites. The DC was the most important religious party in postwar Europe. Although the German CDU-CDU was important, the CDU-CSU differed from the DC in its interconfessional nature, and it experienced 13 years in opposition, whereas the DC remained always in government. As such, the DC provides a test of modernization, secularization, and religious voting. We hypothesize that modernization and secularization, separately and combined, contributed to the DC electoral decline. Moreover, we postulate that the crisis of the Church organization following the Vatican II Council of 1962–1965 (hereinafter Vatican II) altered the Church’s relationship to society and politics and accelerated the effects of modernization and secularization.</p>
<p>We focus on the First Republic (1948–1992) and begin our analysis with the 1953 election. The first postwar election, 1948, followed 25 years of fascism and regime change, and its focus on the “choice of civilization” makes it unrepresentative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0010414012453030">Bartolini &amp; Mair, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0010414012453030">Lepre, 1993</xref>). The terminus <italic>ad quem</italic> is the 1992 election because after 1992 the party system underwent a radical transformation and the DC itself collapsed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0010414012453030">Cotta &amp; Verzichelli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453030">Craveri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0010414012453030">Ignazi, 2002</xref>). The article is divided into three sections. In the first section, we examine the long-run trends in the 40 years from 1953 to 1992. In the second section, we contrast two eras of DC decline: 1953–1972, during which the DC remained dominant but the early effects of modernization and secularization were evident, and the period 1972–1992, when the DC began its accelerated decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453030">Caciagli, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012453030">Cartocci, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414012453030">Wertman, 1993</xref>). In the third section, we focus on the consequences of the Vatican II reforms. Although Vatican II was the Church’s attempt to accommodate modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0010414012453030">Menozzi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0010414012453030">Riccardi, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453030">2007</xref>), the reforms failed to halt and perhaps even accelerated the decline of the DC.</p>
<p>We exploit three unique data sets. Previous cross-sectional, longitudinal analysis for the Italian commune was limited to the 1948–1963 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453030">Galli et al., 1968</xref>; Istituto Cattaneo, 1964). We incorporate census and electoral data for the communes after 1963. Our observational units are therefore commune or municipality, the smallest administrative entities in Italy (<italic>N</italic> = ca. 8,000).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0010414012453030">1</xref></sup> The third data set measures the Catholic Church organizations. See the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0010414012453030">appendix</xref> for data sources.</p>
<p>A second unique feature of this analysis employs structural equation modeling (SEM) and latent curve analysis (LCA). Although psychologists employ LCA to model individual growth curves and contextual effects on human development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0010414012453030">Muthen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0010414012453030">Willett &amp; Bub, 2005</xref>), to our knowledge LCA is rarely applied in political science. LCA draws on multiple across-time observations to estimate the intercept and the slope of a growth or decline function across time. The intercept represents the initial predicted value of the process, and the slope represents the change across time. SEM incorporates causal modeling to estimate the intercepts and slopes of both independent and dependent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0010414012453030">Bollen &amp; Curran, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414012453030">Preacher, Wichman, MacCallum, &amp; Briggs, 2008</xref>). LCA and SEM are joined to multilevel or hierarchical models characterized by nested data. Nested data refer to data for more than one level where lower level data are nested within larger units of analysis; for example, in our data, communes are nested within provinces. Hierarchical models specify across-level contextual effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0010414012453030">Asparouhov &amp; Muthen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0010414012453030">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0010414012453030">Duncan, Duncan, Li, &amp; Strycker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453030">Li, Duncan, &amp; Acock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453030">Li, Duncan, Duncan, &amp; Acock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0010414012453030">Muthen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0010414012453030">Rabe-Hesketh, Skrondal, &amp; Pickles, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Modernization, Secularization, and DC Vote in Postwar Italy (1953–1992)</title>
<p>Modernization and secularization are intimately linked. The classical literature on modernization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0010414012453030">Apter, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0010414012453030">LaPalombara &amp; Weiner, 1966</xref>) postulated that the passage from an agrarian, traditional society to a modern society via urbanization, industrialization, literacy, and education would lead to increased rational and secular values with the consequent decline in magic or religious beliefs (for recent reconsiderations, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012453030">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010414012453030">Smith, 2009</xref>). This literature, which flourished in the 1960s, especially in the United States, was indebted to Weber’s interpretation of the “disenchantment of the world.” Weber argued that the scientific revolution, the capitalist economy, and bureaucratization, which emerged in the late 19th century and intensified in the 20th century, fostered rationality and thus the marginalization of the magic-religious references.</p>
<p>Secularization embodies several interpretations in the present-day debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453030">Casanova, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0010414012453030">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0010414012453030">Davie, 2000</xref>). Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0010414012453030">Berger (1967)</xref> offered a clear and parsimonious definition of the classical interpretation of secularization. He emphasized two chief characteristics: (a) the separation between state and Church accompanied by the Church’s loss of influence over the political process and rulers (<italic>the sociostructural process</italic>) and (b) declining religiosity in intellectual and daily life (<italic>the cultural process</italic>). These two processes were evident in the postwar era with the <italic>desacralization</italic> and decline of church influence: Fewer people believed, fewer people practiced, and fewer people followed church proscriptions. Although religion declined in advanced economies, with the notable exception of the United States, it expanded in less developed economies. Even in the most developed countries, however, scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0010414012453030">Berger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453030">Casanova, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453030">Chavez, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0010414012453030">Norris &amp; Inglehart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0010414012453030">Smith, 2009</xref>) noted a religious revival of a different nature: the “individualization” of faith, a more direct and personal approach to the supernatural, no longer mediated by institutionalized religions, that is, “believing, but not belonging” so that “secularization is best understood not as a decline of religion, but the declining scope of religious authority” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0010414012453030">Chavez, 1994</xref>, p. 750).</p>
<p>We cannot discuss this debate in detail here; rather, we define secularization as the “decline of religious beliefs and practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0010414012453030">Casanova, 1994</xref>, p. 211) as manifest in the decline of institutionalized religion (in our case, Roman Catholicism): the weakening of the dogmas, the rites, and the moral-ethical proscriptions emanating from the institutionalized religion. Secularization is evidenced by the decline of the Church’s institutional strength (number of priests, parishes, schools, financial revenues, Catholic organizations, newspaper and magazines, etc.), and behavior at odds with Church proscriptions, for example, civil marriage, separation, divorce, abortion, and extramarital births.</p>
<sec id="section2-0010414012453030">
<title>The Indicators of Modernization and Secularization</title>
<p>Modernization is measured by several, widely employed, indicators: (a) the decline of agricultural-sector employment, (b) the rise of industrial and service-sector employment, (c) the increase in education, particularly formal, state-sponsored education, and (d) the process of urbanization. These data are drawn from the ISTAT population decennial censuses beginning in 1951.</p>
<p>The 1951 census depicted Italy as an agrarian economy, its population dispersed in many small towns, with a high rate of illiteracy and low levels of education. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> presents the historical averages for these measures and offers visual evidence of modernization. Agricultural employment declined from 43% of the economically active population in 1951 to 3% in 1991. Employment in industry and services evidenced the reverse course. Italy, one of the more city-centered countries in Europe, underwent further urbanization—defined as the proportion of the population in urban areas of 20,000 or more—from 54% in 1951 to 67% in 1991. Education, measured by the proportion of the population older than 6 years of age with at least an elementary education (5 years of schooling from ages 6 to 11) increased from 37% in 1951 to 98% in 1991. The decline of illiteracy followed: In 1951, 13% of the population older than 6 years was illiterate, but declined to 2% by 1991.</p>

<p>This analysis employs behavioral measures rather than on the attitudinal measures of secularization and provides a significant contrast with most of the studies of secularization. Although survey data are of great value, attitudinal measures face several shortcomings. First, little evidence exists for the early decades, with the notable exception of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0010414012453030">Burgalassi (1967</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0010414012453030">1968</xref>). Second, attitudinal measures are subject to validity and reliability concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0010414012453030">Smith (1998)</xref> demonstrated a general tendency toward “overreporting” religiosity. The most common indicator of religiosity—attendance at religious services—seems particularly susceptible to measurement and reliability error. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0010414012453030">Pisati (2000)</xref> examined mass attendance in Italy after 1956 and noted various discrepancies across the surveys. Moreover, the empirical validation of mass attendance in Venice demonstrated a significant overreporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0010414012453030">Castegnaro &amp; Della Zuana, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Civil marriage provides a more accurate and reliable measure. Following the 1929 Concordat between Church and state in Italy, all religious marriages were recorded in the civil records. In addition to religious marriages, civil marriages, that is, those officiated by a member of the city council in council chambers, were recorded as civil marriages. Religious values dictated Church marriages as a central Church sacrament. Therefore, those who did not marry in the Church resisted religious, traditional, and family pressures and manifest a secular posture: a civil rather than a religious marriage implies a clear, public, individual statement. In 1951, religious marriages were almost universal at 98.9%. By 1961, civil marriages increased to 2%, then tripled by 1971, and almost tripled again by 1991, reaching 17% of all marriages, and more than 40% in some cities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> shows that Italy experienced a profound transformation of its economy and society: a migration from the countryside to the cities, a shift from agriculture to industry and services, and an expansion of education. These changes constitute the preconditions for a weakening of institutionalized religion.</p>

<sec id="section3-0010414012453030">
<title>Religion and Religiosity in Italy From the 1950s to the 1990s</title>
<p>Italy’s process of nation and state formation (the <italic>Risorgimento</italic>) resulted in a deep cleavage between the liberal nation-builders and the Church that vigorously opposed the new state. This hostility was so intense that the Church initially excommunicated all Catholics willing to enter politics. This condition persisted until 1913, when the Church finally lifted the ban, but it resulted in the absence of political representation for and by the Catholics until that time. The Partito Popolare (Popular Party), the first political party to represent the Catholic perspective in the late 1910s and the 1920s, did not receive the official endorsement by the Church. Following the collapse of fascism, the Church moved directly into politics by sponsoring a new Catholic political party. Catholic representation in postwar politics, expressed by the DC, represented a dramatic shift from both the prefascist, liberal predominance and the relatively small and unsupported Catholic party of the prefascist era. In the first free election after the war, in 1946, the DC got the highest share of votes (35.7%) for the Constituent Assembly; furthermore, it predominated in the first parliamentary elections in 1948, winning its historical maximum of 48.5% of the votes.</p>
<p>This new postwar political setting induced the Church to extend its influence beyond the moral and spiritual domain. Consequently, Church influence pervaded in all aspects of public life, and the Vatican overtly expressed itself on relevant political issues. The presence was so strong that even a highly respected Catholic scholar of the time, Carlo Arturo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0010414012453030">Jemolo (1978)</xref>, stated that Italy was on the verge of becoming a “clerical regime”:
<disp-quote>
<p>The regime displays itself in a stubborn and extensive application of the Concordat, annoyances, not to use the too stern term of persecution, toward the harmless attempt to proselytize by the tiny sects of the Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Pentecostals, spiritual exercises practiced in the state central ministries during Lent, mayors with the state emblems and city flag in religious processions, students escorted to the church by their teachers for attending at the school opening or closing day’s mass, soldiers commanded by their superiors to the Sunday mass, blessing of every new site or bureau notwithstanding the absence of any religious destination or connotation. (p. 314)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the pontificate of Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), the Church directly and repeatedly intervened in political affairs by mobilizing its organizational efforts in support of the DC in the electoral campaigns, by excommunicating the Communist party members and voters in 1949, and by urging the DC-led governments to enforce the Catholic “principles” through the financing and sustaining of Catholic institutions (seminaries, schools, hospitals, etc.) and of Catholic cultural, educational, leisure, and social activities.</p>
<p>Some data highlight the Church pervasiveness in and predominance over Italian society. The Catholic Church is organized by territorial dioceses that are normally administered by a bishop or an archbishop, although some exceptions exist. The number of Italian dioceses traditionally surpassed that in other countries. Even if Pope Paul VI reduced the number to 224 in the early 1980s—after a long <italic>bras de fer</italic> with the Vatican hierarchy—the Italian dioceses are the most numerous in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1991</xref>, p. 127; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414012453030">Riccardi, 1999</xref>, p. 271). Likewise, parishes and priests provided a powerful local presence. The first accurate count of the parishes in 1961 recorded 26,500, or a parish for every 1,800 to 1,900 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1996</xref>, p. 181). In the same period, diocesan priests numbered 47,117, about one priest per 1,000 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>, p. 436). Simultaneously, religious orders accounted for more than 200,000 members, with the nuns outnumbering the friars in a ratio of six to one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1991</xref>, p. 181).</p>
<p>In summary, the Church exercised a massive, pervasive, deeply rooted, and politically focused institutional presence during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Pope Pius XII sought to eradicate the remnants of secular attitudes in the country and, above all, to dash the communist and atheist menace directly by mobilizing the Church’s powerful organizational machine to serve the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0010414012453030">Riccardi, 1984</xref>). From this perspective, secularization in Italy had to overcome a higher threshold compared to other countries. Once the process took hold, however, it accelerated quite dramatically after the late 1960s, despite the efforts of the Church to blunt its impact, and reached a high point in the 1990s.</p>

<title>The Impact of Modernization and Secularization on the DC Vote, 1953–1992</title>
<p>In this section we explore changes across about 40 years of DC vote. We approach this by three SEM-LCA models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref> examines the long-term changes in modernization, secularization, and DC vote from 1953 to 1992. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453030">Model 2</xref> explores these same dynamics and compares the DC vote decline across two time periods: 1953–1972 and 1972–1992. Analysts of Italian politics and the estimates in Model 1 concur that after 1972 the DC experienced an accelerated decline. Model 3 focuses on the 1972–1992 period and traces out the consequences of the Church’s response to social change as manifested in Vatican II.</p>

<title>The Long-Run Impact of Modernization and Secularization on the DC Vote, 1953–1992</title>
<p>Initially, we trace the long-run changes across about 40 years of DC vote. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref> presents the estimates. Prior to estimating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref>, each component is tested for its fit to the data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0010414012453030">2</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref> combines the separate measurement models discussed in Note 2 into the full model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref> has an adequate fit to the observed data (comparative fit index [CFI] = .90, normed fit index [NFI] = .89, chi-square = 8812.1, <italic>df</italic> = 76, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and explains 36% of the variance in the DC slope change from 1953 to 1992.</p>
<p>The model links modernization and secularization to the DC vote via the directed relationships or paths indicated by the arrows. Modernization from 1951 to 1991 had a positive effect (.26) on civil marriage intercept in 1963 and a slight positive effect (.09) on DC vote intercept in 1953. This is not an estimate error: Where modernization was higher in 1951, civil marriages and the DC vote were also higher. The estimate is consistent with the pattern of modernization in postwar Italy, which first occurred in the regional strongholds of the DC, the north and, particularly, the northeast. Modernization has the expected effect on the civil marriage and DC slopes. A one standard deviation increase in the rate of modernization generates a .53 increase in the slope of civil marriages and a .55 decrease in the slope of the DC vote. The model accounts for 36% of the variance in the slope of the DC decline. The increased rate of civil marriages has only a slight, but significant, effect (.08) on the DC vote. In summary, increased modernization, as measured by rising education and industrial-service employment, had a large and direct effect on the decline of the DC vote, an effect greater than secularization.</p>

<title>Comparative Analysis of the Modernization and Secularization on the DC Vote, 1953–1972 and 1972–1992</title>
<p>Analysts of Italian politics note the accelerated decline of the DC vote after 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0010414012453030">Caciagli, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0010414012453030">Craveri, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0010414012453030">Wertman, 1993</xref>), culminating in the DC’s collapse in 1992. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453030">Model 2</xref> contrasts the 1953–1972 and 1972–1992 and confirms this breaking point. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453030">Model 2</xref> improved fit to the observed data (CFI = .92, NFI = .92, chi-square = 11121, <italic>df</italic> = 140, <italic>p</italic> = .000). The striking differences between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0010414012453030">Model 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453030">Model 2</xref> confirm that after 1972, the DC’s decline rapidly accelerated. The model accounts for only 12% of the 1953–1972 DC slope variance, and 59% of the 1972–1992 DC slope variance. These results clearly indicate that modernization and secularization had a much greater effect on the DC after 1972.</p>
<p>Model 2 presents seven latent variables indicated by circles. The circle labeled MOD 1951–1992 measures the slope of modernization from 1951 to 1992. Changes in secularization are represented by three latent variables for civil marriages: the intercept of civil marriages in 1963 (CM 1963 INCPT), and two slopes representing rates of change in civil marriages across the two periods: CM 1963–1972 SLP and CM 1972–1992 SLP. Changes in the DC vote are also represented by three latent variables: the intercept of DC vote in 1953 (DC 1953 INTCP) and two slopes for the two periods, DC 1953–1972 SLP and DC 1972–1992 SLP.</p>

<p>The numbers attached to the respective intercept and slope latent variables are the estimates of their means. For example, the model estimates the mean intercept of civil marriages in 1963 at −2.88 or about 5% of all marriages, and the DC vote 1953 at −0.81 or about 44% of the valid vote. Recall that these coefficients are estimated from the natural logs of the observed variables. Causal or directed relationships are indicated by the arrows linking the latent variables. Each directed relationship has the standardized effects coefficient attached, which indicated how the change of one standard deviation in the independent variable generated change in the dependent variable.</p>
<p>The coefficients attached to the slope latent variables are the slopes of across-time decline within the each time period, 1953–1972 and 1972–1992. The model estimated that the slopes of civil marriages increased slightly from 1963–1972 to 1972–1992 (CM 1963–1972 SLP = −.29; CM 1972–1992 SLP = −.30). For the DC vote, the estimated decline of DC vote increased markedly across the two periods (DC 1953–1972 SLP = −.01; DC 1972–1992 SLP = −.06).</p>
<p>Turning our attention to the directed relationships, we observe the following: First, the initial links between modernization and the civil marriage and DC intercepts confirm that greater modernization was associated a higher incidence of civil marriages and greater electoral success for the DC. Across-time changes are captured by the arrows from modernization and civil marriages slopes to the DC slopes. For civil marriages, increased modernization increased the rate of increase in civil marriages in both time periods, but the rate of increase slowed in the 1972–1992 period (.38 vs. .24). Although modernization increased the rate of civil marriage, the most powerful predictor of civil marriages 1972–1992 was the rate of civil marriages in the previous period, 1963–1972 (.78). In other words, an across-time path dependency operated: What modernization set in motion in 1951 accelerated the increase in civil marriages in 1972–1992.</p>
<p>Modernization had powerful effects on the decline of DC vote. The coefficient from the modernization slope to the DC slope vote 1951–1972 (–.31) more than doubled for the 1972–1992 slope (DC 1972–1992 SLP = −.77). Moreover, the path linking the DC vote slopes 1953–1972 and 1972–1992 is not significant. Hence, the lagged effect we observed in the civil marriage slopes across the two time periods is not present across the DC slopes from 1953–1972 to 1972–1992. These results suggest the DC vote decline became more dispersed in the 1972–1992 period.</p>
<p>Contrary to some interpretations, increased secularization had only a very small effect on the rates of the decline of DC vote in the 1953–1972 period and no significant effect on the DC vote decline from 1972–1992. Recall that modernization proceeded faster in the northeast and the northwest of the country, long established DC strongholds, especially the northeast, meaning that the initial high level of DC vote in areas that subsequently experienced rapid modernization evidenced higher rates of decline of the DC vote. In sum, secularization has little direct effect on DC vote, and almost all the decline in DC vote was accounted for by modernization.

<title>The Denouement of the DC, 1972–1992</title>
<p>The accelerated decline of the DC vote after 1972 corresponded to important changes in the Church’s internal organization and its relationship to society and politics initiated by Vatican II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0010414012453030">Lanaro, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0010414012453030">Riccardi, 1999</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section8-0010414012453030">
<title>The Church’s Internal Evolution and Its External Impact</title>
<p>The reforms introduced by Popes John XXIII (1958–1963), Paul VI (1963–1978), and John Paul II (1978–2005) and, above all, Vatican II (1962–1965) marked a major shift in the Church’s role in Italian society and politics. Compared to the papacy of Pius XII, the Church subsequently followed a path of greater detachment from direct involvement in daily politics and a call for a more spiritual and “authentic” life for Catholics.</p>
<p>The transition from Pius XII to John XXIII radically altered the Vatican’s attitude vis-à-vis the Church’s political involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0010414012453030">Riccardi, 2007</xref>). The new pope’s behavior contrasted with that of his conservative predecessor. For example, when serving as patriarch of Venice, he warmly greeted the Congress of the Italian Socialist Party in 1957. In addition, he shifted attention away from daily politics and instead focused on preparations for Vatican II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0010414012453030">Alberigo, 2005</xref>). In 1963, Paul VI reinforced his predecessor’s approach. In particular he implemented the outcomes of Vatican II generating unwanted and unexpected consequences for Church organization and it relationship with the DC.</p>
<p>First, Vatican II launched an intense self-analysis on the meaning of being Christian in modern society and emphasized a more spiritual posture toward the world and the Church itself. This deep self-questioning shook the Church from within producing internal, and often devastating, turmoil. Criticism of the hierarchy for its conservative positions, the demand for a return to original purity, the call for a more participatory life in the <italic>ecclesia</italic>, and the consequent emergence of the “Catholic dissent” confronted the priesthood directly and challenged its role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0010414012453030">Giovagnoli, 2000</xref>). Because parish priests formed the front line of the Church, they encountered the full impact of these changes. As a consequence, the priesthood suffered a marked decline. The number of priestly exits from the Church doubled in a few years and reached its peak in 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>, p. 441). The number of new priests drastically declined from 740 in 1969 to its lowest point of 344 in 1987, with some recovery afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>, pp. 441-442). More generally, between 1951 and 1989, the number of priests declined by 18.6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>, p. 437).</p>
<p>The vocational crisis provided further evidence of the Church in turmoil. Fewer students attended seminaries and theological schools resulting in the closing of many of these institutions. From 1970 to 1989, the number of students in the seminaries (<italic>maggiori</italic>) preparing for the priesthood almost halved, from 6,337 to 3,581 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0010414012453030">Brunetta, 1991</xref>, p. 445). The average age of priests continued to rise as a consequence: the percentage of priests older than 60 years of age increased from 36% in 1982 to 50% in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1996</xref>, p. 156). Moreover, because the number of parishes remained the same whereas the number of priests declined, numerous parishes no longer had their own priest. In 1951, there was one priest for 1,000 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1991</xref>, p. 416); in the early 1990s, there was one priest per roughly 1,500 inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1996</xref>, p. 156).</p>
<p>The Church’s organizational decline is unquestioned: fewer and older priests, fewer parishes with their own priests, fewer novices. But the impact of Vatican II did not exclusively affect the Church organization. The council’s reforms also generated disenchantment with, and even disregard for, politics in general and the Catholic party in particular. The wave of spirituality induced by Vatican II provoked a deep uneasiness with the materialistic, clientelistic, and often corrupt practices of “their” party. This attitude paralleled the Church’s change vis-à-vis the DC, and ended the phase of strict cooperation between the Church and the party. Paul VI’s encyclical promulgated in 1971 <italic>Octogesima adveniens</italic> (1971) had suggested that the DC was no longer “the” Catholic party. The meeting on <italic>Evangelizzazione e promozione umana</italic> (“evangelization and human enhancement”) organized by the CEI (Conferenza Episcopale Italiana; Italian Bishop’s Conference) in 1976 provided the strongest evidence. The resulting document unambiguously stated that the <italic>collateralism</italic> with the DC was over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0010414012453030">AAVV, 1977</xref>, p. 277). Both documents opened the possibility of Catholic voters shifting to other parties.</p>
<p>The close relationship between the Church and the DC dissolved during the mid-1970s, especially after the outcome of the referendum on divorce (1974). Only 40.9% of the voters supported the DC campaign, fiercely backed by the Church, to repeal of the divorce law. This surprising outcome meant that the Catholic world was no longer loyal to the Church’s—and to the DC’s—suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0010414012453030">Giovagnoli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0010414012453030">Parisi, 1979</xref>). When a group of high-profile Catholics publically declared their opposition to repeal, dissent went public. After that traumatic event, the idea that Catholics could find their political representation, as Catholics, in a party different from the DC, became plausible. Political unity among Catholics lost its hold on DC voters, and evaporated in the early 1990s. Even if the DC continued to collect the vast majority of the religious vote after 1974, this vote was less religiously driven than before: Religious affiliation still counted for these voters, but it was much less salient. In fact, in 1990, two-thirds of the regular churchgoers reported that they were “willing” not to vote for the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453030">Diamanti, 1997</xref>, p. 319), although almost half of them continued to support the party in the 1992 elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0010414012453030">Diamanti, 1997</xref>, p. 329).</p>
<p>The Church’s distance from the DC weakened the Catholic associations’ attachment to the party. The DC had profited from a large network of sponsoring and flanking associations. Some were closely linked to the Catholic hierarchy such the CA (Azione cattolica; Catholic Action) which gathered more than 3 million members in the late 1950s. Other supportive associations included the ACLI (Azione cattolica lavoratori italiani; Catholic Action of Italian Workers), the FUCI (Federazione universitari cattolici italiani; Federation of University Catholic Students), the GIAC (Gioventù italiana di azione cattolica; Youth Catholic Movement), the scouts, and a plethora of others. These organizations maintained a strong relationship with the party through the 1960s, benefiting the DC with their political mobilization capacities. Furthermore, these associations formed an important leadership recruitment base for both the DC national and local party organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0010414012453030">Poggi et al., 1968</xref>, p. 505). As these organizations relaxed their ties with the DC in the aftermath of Vatican II, the party lost of an essential reservoir of leadership and militants, and it weakened its ties to the Catholic constituency at large. The same trend affected other DC flanking organizations, albeit not organically linked to the Catholic hierarchy, such as the powerful farmers’ association (Coldiretti) or the Catholic trade unions.</p>
<p>After Vatican II, almost all these Catholic associations cut their institutional links with the DC either because they wanted to pursue a more religiously oriented path or because they disliked the DC’s policies and style of politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0010414012453030">Casella, 2003</xref>). Political detachment was accompanied by collapse of membership. During pontificate of Pope John Paul II, a new wave of Catholic organizations emerged and partly revitalized the Catholic associational networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0010414012453030">Faggioli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0010414012453030">Garelli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0010414012453030">Pace, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0010414012453030">1992</xref>). However, these new religious associations, with one exception, concentrated on the spiritual and religious domain. The exception was CL (Comunione e Liberazione; Communion and Liberation), a very militant and charismatic organization combining high religious fervor with direct intervention in politics.</p>
<p>In summary, the two decades before the 1990s represents the <italic>terminus ad quem</italic> of our research. Vatican II’s reforms, by fueling spiritual deepening and internal dissent in the Catholic milieu, provoked disarray in the political and nonpolitical Catholic organizations. Collapsing membership, rising internal conflict, and loss of self-consciousness corroded their place in Italian society. No longer could such groups counteract secularization, thus further eroding the Catholic world.</p>
<p>The lameness of the Church’s visible hand was both a product <italic>and</italic> a propellant of secularization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0010414012453030">Diotallevi, 1999</xref>, for a similar interpretation while starting from different premises). Although secularization was the end product, it originated from the separation of politics and religion, and a withdrawal into the spiritual realm. The DC lost its grip on Catholics, who increasingly assumed different worldviews.</p>

<title>Secularization, Church Reforms, and the DC 1972–1992</title>
<p>Religiosity and religious homogeneity characterized Italy in 1951. Even within the limitations of survey research, the evidence indicated that Italians identified themselves as Catholics, and a large proportion followed the Church’s rites and moral and ethical teachings. As previously noted, the Church’s influence was declining. Civil marriages grew from less than 1% to 17% in the 30-year period between 1961 and 1991, and most of the increase occurred after 1970.</p>
<p>The failure to repeal divorce and abortion legislation demonstrated the Church’s waning influence on social behavior. Parliament passed laws liberalizing divorce and abortion in 1970 and 1978, respectively. The Church tried to undo these laws with national referendums in 1974 and 1981, respectively, and both failed. The 1974 referendum to repeal the divorce law failed, with 59.3% of the votes against repeal. The 1981 referendum to repeal the abortion law failed with an even larger 68% of votes against repeal. Both defeats, particularly the second, marked an overwhelming victory of the secular positions.</p>
<p>CA, the largest association of Italian Catholics, founded in the 1870s to counteract the secular drive of the Italian state, historically had provided a very significant outreach organization for the Church (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0010414012453030">De Antonellis, 1987</xref>). This association, directly linked to the Catholic hierarchy, had its local branches subject of bishopric authority. At its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, CA had more than 3 million members. Secularization and particularly the Church’s internal unrest negatively affected the CA. This unrest produced, inter alia, a temporary detachment of that association from the hierarchy and a large decline in membership. This detachment terminated Church’s central position among the network of associations and deprived the DC of a well-established route for leadership recruitment. CA’s membership collapsed to around half a million by the mid-1970s, and it presently numbers about 300,000 to 350,000 members.</p>
<p>Because of CA’s centrality and intermediacy between the Church on one side and the DC on the other, we introduced this crucial association into our analysis. The general hypothesis is that until 1972 the CA’s strength reduced the impact of modernization and secularization on the DC vote. However, following the Vatican Council II reforms and the collapse of the CA after 1972, its disintegration paralleled the DC vote decline.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0010414012453030">Model 3</xref> captures these dynamics. The measurements used for modernization (MOD 1972–1992) and DC vote intercept (DC 1972 INTCP) and DC slope (DC 1972–1992 SLP) remain the same as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0010414012453030">Model 2</xref>.

Catholic Action membership density has a latent growth variable with the Catholic Action intercept (CA 1972 INTCP) and Catholic Action slope (CA 1972–1992 SLP), measured by the density of CA membership per elector in 1972, 1976, 1983, and 1992; because the CA decline is nonlinear, the measure is the natural logarithm of the observed data.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0010414012453030">Model 3</xref> estimates the coefficients among latent variables. The model provides a very close fit (CFI = .97, NFI = 97, chi-square = 4690.8, <italic>df</italic> = 124, <italic>p</italic> = .000), and it accounts for 46% of the variance in the decline of the DC vote during the 1972–1992 years. The total standardized effects of modernization on DC vote decline was −.68: a one standard deviation increase in modernization generated a decline of .68 standard deviations in DC vote. The largest component of this effect remains the direct impact of modernization on the DC vote decline (–.66).</p>
<p>Modernization also generated indirect effects on the DC vote decline because (a) it accelerated the decline of CA membership (–.21) and (b) a one standard deviation decline in CA membership produced a .14 increase in the DC vote slope decline. Although modernization increased secularization (measured by the civil marriage rate), increased secularization had no significant effect (<italic>ns</italic>) on DC vote decline. Rather, the breakdown of CA’s mediation between society and Church, aggravated by the Vatican II reforms, contributed the DC’s collapse after 1992. The decline of CA membership by 80% from 1972 to 1992 illustrated the fading effects of Church lay organizations on the DC vote; however, the direct effects of modernization proved even greater.</p>
<p>In summary, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0010414012453030">Model 3</xref> demonstrated that increased modernization in the period 1972–1992 augmented secularization and reduced CA membership. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0010414012453030">Model 3</xref> is consistent with the earlier work of the Istituto Cattaneo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0010414012453030">Galli, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0010414012453030">Galli et al., 1968</xref>): In the 1950s and 1960s, modernization accelerated the DC vote decline, whereas Catholic outreach organizations blunted these effects. However, after Vatican II, the Church and its affiliated organizations became increasingly decoupled from society and could not counteract the deleterious effects of modernization and secularization. Contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0010414012453030">Diotallevi (2002)</xref>, the model demonstrated that modernization had significant direct and indirect negative on the DC. The evidence supports the conclusion that modernization unleashed the forces of secularization that Vatican II reforms failed to slow and may have accelerated. Although others noted similar results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0010414012453030">Cartocci, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0010414012453030">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0010414012453030">Segatti, 1999</xref>), this research extended and deepened the analysis.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Religion and politics remain an ongoing research focus among social scientists. The modernization thesis, which dominated the field for many years, presumed the increasing secularization of politics. More recently, the thesis was challenged as scholars noted cultural and national variations. Thus, although some advanced economies, particularly in Europe, followed the modernization–secularization path toward “post-Christian” polities, others, notably the United States, experienced a religious revival. Lesser developed economies offered an alternative path characterized the growth of emotive, antiestablished religions, whereas postcommunist societies seemed to revert to established religions.</p>
<p>In this research we drew attention to perhaps the most historically religious case within the European “post-Christian” transition: Italy. We argued that Italy represented a particularly high religious threshold in the postwar period. As such, Italy provided a rigorous test of the modernization, secularization, and religious voting hypotheses. Several factors marked Italy as an outlier for the importance of religion in society and politics. Italy “hosts” the Vatican, the most extensive bishop community, the most numerous diocesan and regular clergy, the most thorough socioreligious penetration, and the highest density of church organizations and associations. Moreover, a greater percentage of Italians attended mass and other rites than any other European Catholic country in the 1950s. In addition, the Church played an outsized role in the political sphere with the DC as the direct political expression of the Catholic Church and the pivotal party in the First Republic (1948–1992).</p>
<p>To test the thesis we exploited newly available data: more robust measures; more numerous micro units of observation; behavioral rather than attitudinal measures of religiosity, extended longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis, and the examination of the Church’s reforms of Vatican II. To fulfill the potential of the robust data, we employed advanced techniques not common in political science: LCA, SEM, and contextual analysis.</p>
<p>Our evidence and conclusions are solid and robust: Modernization increased secularization and depressed religious voting. When we compared the first and second 20-year periods of the First Republic, analysis the second period (1972–1992) showed the dramatic acceleration of secularization, driven in part by the rapid process of modernization of the previous decades.</p>
<p>The third part of the analysis highlighted crucial role of the institutionalized Church and the effects of Vatican II. In an effort to accommodate modernization, Vatican II emphasized a more spiritual, informal church less engaged in society and politics. Paradoxically, the Church’s efforts to partially embrace, or at least accept, some features of modernization, hastened the decline of religious voting in the following 20 years. Church organizational networks, which had proved a bulwark against modernization and secularization during the first period (1953–1972) collapsed in the second period (1972–1992).</p>
<p>More generally, this analysis brought substance and evidence to the modernization, secularization, religious voting discussion. Religions continue their delicate dance with modernization, most with mixed outcomes. Institutionalized religions, in particular, show signs of stress. Although scholars of modernization–secularization developed contingent and contextual interpretations in response to earlier critiques of determinism, our analysis suggested such approaches may treat institutionalized religions too passively. Organized religions are active partners in this delicate dance. In a sense, we “bring the institution back in” with a focus on the Church’s response to modernization. As we continue to examine the religious responses to modernization and secularization, we need to expand our perspective to include active participants as well.</p>

<p>The number of communes ranged around 8,000. According to various censuses, they were 7,810 in 1951, 8,035 in 1961, 8,056 in 1971, 8,056 in 1981, 8,100 in 1991, and 8,101 in 2001. However, beneath their apparent stability, across time boundaries of Italian communes have changed because of the creation of new units, the merging of several units, and so on. Whenever one of more units were altered, these units were merged to create a “constant unit of analysis” (CUA) across time. Today, after more than 50 years of boundary changes, the CUA total is 6,140 units. The “administrative units” of the Catholic Church are dioceses, usually administered by a bishop. After a series of reforms they now number 224. Since the dioceses do not follow the provincial administrative units, we assigned the relevant dioceses’ values to each commune and then aggregated these to provincial averages. The measure then is the average diocese’s values for commune in each province. Although we obviously lose some variance, we gain comparative provincial units (<italic>N</italic> = 92).</p></fn>

The model excluded urbanization and agricultural employment because (1) urbanization shows inadequate variation across time and (2) agriculture is the inverse of industrial and service employment. The observed or manifest variables were measured across the intervals from the census data: 1951, 1971, and 1991. Because the education and industry services in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> evidence nonlinear growth, we used the natural logarithm of the observed values. The latent variable MOD tracked the long-run trend in modernization.

<p>Secularization and DC vote were modeled by latent growth curves following the accepted procedures. The intercept was estimated by fixing the observed loading at 1.0 and estimating the mean, whereas the slope loadings were scaled to time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0010414012453030">Li et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0010414012453030">Li et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0010414012453030">Preacher, Wichman, MacCallum, &amp; Briggs et al., 2008</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>Secularization, measured by the natural logarithm of civil marriage rates in 1963, 1972, 1983, and 1992 for the 92 provinces, is represented by two latent growth variables: the intercept (CM 1963 INT) and the slope (CM 1963–1992 SLP). The latent curve variable generated a good fit to the data (CFI = .91, NFI = .91, chi-square = 3159.55, <italic>df</italic> = 3, <italic>p</italic> = .000). The model estimated civil marriages in 1963 at about 3% of all marriages and that civil marriage increased on average five percentage points per data point across time. The intercept and slope were correlated (.49), indicating that civil marriages increased more rapidly where they were greater in 1972.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0010414012453030">
<label>5.</label>
<p>The latent growth variable for DC vote estimated the intercept (DC 1953 INT) and slope (DC 1953–1992 SLP) of the DC vote from the observed vote in 1953, 1963, 1972, 1983, and 1992. Because the DC vote in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> evidences a nonlinear decline, we used a natural logarithm of the percent DC vote. The DC latent growth curve generated a very good fit to the observed data (CFI = .96, NFI = 96, chi-square = 996.63, <italic>df</italic> = 7, <italic>p</italic> = .000). The estimated intercept for DC vote in 1953 was 48.1%; the observed value was 47.3%. Note that these values differed from the averages shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> because the intercept estimated is the mean DC vote across the commune units of observation, whereas the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0010414012453030">Figure 1</xref> were the average for the entire country. The estimated slope (DC 1953–1992 SLP) was the rate of change for the DC vote across time, that is, the five observed elections and the estimated decline was about 5 percentage points across each data point. The correlation of the intercept and the slope was negative, indicating the DC vote declined most where it was greater in 1953.
