<abstract>
<p>This study examined the relationship between motivational style and academic achievement among 2,220 secondary school males and females in Hong Kong. Respondents were classified into high, average, or low <italic>academic performance</italic> (AAP) groups based on a single average for academic subjects obtained from their schools. Respondents were also classified into top, middle, or bottom groups based on their <italic>perceived academic performance</italic> (PAP). Results indicated that only 42% of the students perceived their academic performance correctly. Compared to their lower AAP counterparts, high scoring AAP males were significantly more serious, conformist, and arousal-avoidant. The high scoring AAP female group was found to be more self-oriented than the other female groups. The top PAP male group was also found to be more serious, conformist, arousal-avoidant, and optimistic than the other PAP male groups. The top PAP female group was more self-oriented and optimistic than the other two PAP groups. The present findings suggest that the traditional Chinese cultural values of collectivism, diligence, and education are major influences on shaping the motivational style of Hong Kong Chinese high school students. The implications of the results for school psychologists and teachers are also discussed.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311426943">Yeo and Choi (2011)</xref>, school psychologists are uniquely placed within school systems to effect desired changes in children. Change may be achieved effectively by working collaboratively with teachers, counsellors, and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143034311426943">Cook, Jimerson, &amp; Begeny, 2010</xref>), provided that school psychologists’ service roles allow them to do so. In any particular country, this is likely to be dependent on: (a) the number of school psychologists and the ratio of school psychologists to school age children in that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311426943">Jimerson, Stewart, Skokut, Cardenas, &amp; Malone, 2009</xref>), and (b) whether school psychologists’ assessment duties are not so onerous as to prevent them from engaging in other activities such as consultation and intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311426943">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>). According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143034311426943">Hong Kong Educational Psychology Service (2011)</xref>, there are 104 educational psychologists currently serving primary, secondary, and special schools in the public sector. In public-funded primary and secondary schools, the ratio of school psychologists to school age children is 1:8,000. This figure is considerably higher than the ratio of 1:2,000 quoted for developed countries, such as the USA, Canada and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311426943">Jimerson et al., 2009</xref>), but is considerably lower when compared to other Asian countries. Singapore, for example, has a ratio of approximately 1:14,000 students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143034311426943">Yeo &amp; Choi, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to research, similar types of restraints, such as time, and lack of practitioner qualifications and resources, may also limit school psychologists’ ability to engage in research, either individually or in collaboration with researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311426943">Atkinson, 2009</xref>). Yet several authors have identified a shortage of real world research and the need for inquiry-based practice to improve professional knowledge and help schools address current issues and challenges (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143034311426943">Atkinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143034311426943">Farrell, Jimerson, &amp; Oakland, 2007</xref>). It was with this shortage of research in mind that the present research study set out to explore Hong Kong secondary school students’ motivational style and how it would relate to their actual and perceived academic performance. This particular study was not carried out in collaboration with a school psychologist, but it was hoped that the results would be of practical use to both school psychologists and teachers.</p>
<p>As shown by the findings of recent research studies published in this journal, there are factors beyond those of cognitive abilities that influence school academic achievement in Chinese and other international students (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143034311426943">Greenman, Schneider, &amp; Tomada, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143034311426943">Kettler, Elliott, Davies, &amp; Griffin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0143034311426943">Savina, Coulacoglou, Sanyal, &amp; Zhang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143034311426943">Shin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0143034311426943">Shin, Lee, &amp; Kim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311426943">Sori, 2009</xref>). Examples of motivational factors such as academic self-esteem and learned hopelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311426943">Au, Watkins, &amp; Hattie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143034311426943">Koh &amp; Galloway, 2006</xref>), causal attributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0143034311426943">Sori, 2009</xref>), competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311426943">Lam, Yim, Law, &amp; Cheung, 2004</xref>), and beliefs about intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143034311426943">Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &amp; Dweck, 2007</xref>), have all been shown to affect learning.</p>
<p>An additional psychological concept important in school psychology and of direct relevance to academic achievement is that of motivational orientation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143034311426943">Ames &amp; Ames, 1989</xref>) or motivational style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311426943">Apter, 2001</xref>). Achievement goal theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143034311426943">Nicholls, 1984</xref>) is concerned with motivational orientation and proposes that individuals tend to master new skills and increase competence based on self-referenced standards, strive to outperform others in competitions, or avoid looking incompetent relative to others (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0143034311426943">Pintrich &amp; Schunk, 2002</xref>). International research on goal achievement and motivational orientation in school settings has been broad-based, but it has been suggested that achievement motivation is viewed differently by students from within different cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0143034311426943">Salili, Chiu, &amp; Lai, 2001</xref>). It is therefore important to understand how students’ achievement motivation is defined and operates in different contexts and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143034311426943">Pintrich, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143034311426943">Hau and Salili (1996)</xref>, for example, have shown that the traditional Chinese cultural values of collectivism and diligence are major influences on shaping the motivational orientation of Chinese students.</p>
<p>Another conceptual model that also explains individual motivational orientation or <italic>style</italic> in achievement settings is the reversal theory framework developed by Apter (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311426943">Apter, 2001</xref>). Apter’s approach posits that human behaviour and motivational style are influenced by basic human psychological motives and experiences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143034311426943">Apter (2001)</xref> proposed that there are six pairs of motivational styles in his theoretical framework arranged in pairs of opposites. Individuals can be either serious (<italic>telic</italic>) or playful (<italic>paratelic</italic>), arousal-avoidant or arousal seeking, negativistic or conformist, self-focused (<italic>autic</italic>) or other-focused (<italic>alloic</italic>), competitive (<italic>mastery</italic>) or cooperative (<italic>sympathy</italic>), and optimistic or pessimistic. A scale known as the Motivational Style Profile (MSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311426943">Apter, Mallows, &amp; Williams, 1998</xref>: see Measures section) has been developed to measure individuals’ motivational style. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311426943">Mallows (2007)</xref> has shown how the application of this approach in teaching situations can improve student behaviour and support effective teaching.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong education system fosters keen competition among secondary school students as a result of the examination-oriented curriculum and high parental expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311426943">Au et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311426943">Hui, 2000</xref>). Achievement through effort and hard work is highly emphasized. Chinese students are expected to meet their parents’ expectations and many consider academic striving as their filial duty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143034311426943">Walker, 2004</xref>). In relation to educational psychology, and influenced by the traditional Chinese cultural values of collectivism and diligence, such educational environments require Hong Kong students to be compliant, competitive, and individually accountable.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong education system in particular, adopts an educational policy of ability grouping, in which students are grouped into classes and schools based on their academic abilities. Some previous psychological research studies on ability groupings in Hong Kong schools have been carried out. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143034311426943">Wong and Watkins (2001)</xref>, for example, found that high-ability students had lower self-esteem and higher test anxiety than students in a low ability groups. However, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143034311426943">Cheung and Rudowicz (2003)</xref>, no detrimental effects of ability groupings on self-concept and academic achievement among high school students were found. Also, a different study found form-level differences in academic support-based achievement relationships for Hong Kong students in Forms 3, 4 and 5 (ages 14–15, 15–16, and 16–17 years, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143034311426943">Chen, 2008</xref>). Specifically, perceived parental support was positively related to academic achievement through perceived academic engagement for Form 3 students, but negatively linked to academic achievement for Form 4 students. Perceived teacher support was found to be a significant predictor of academic achievement only for Form 3 students. Previous psychological research findings on ability groupings in Hong Kong have been somewhat inconclusive.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between academic achievement and students’ motivational style. In particular, the focus was on the motivational style of high-achieving secondary school students and identifying any differences that distinguish them from average and low-achieving students. It was predicted that high achieving students’ motivational style would be significantly more serious, conformist, mastery, self-focused, arousal avoiding and optimistic than middle or low achieving students. Although some studies have shown the importance of students’ perception of aspects of their educational experience (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143034311426943">Chan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0143034311426943">Meredith, Wang, &amp; Zheng, 1993</xref>), it was not known how perceived academic performance (PAP) would relate to actual academic performance (AAP) in this regard. However, pre-study the authors could identify no reason (either theoretical or research) for assuming that the motivational style of students who perceived themselves as high achievers would be different to that of those who actually were high achievers. Two previous studies have examined motivational style in Hong Kong students, but they concerned students’ physical activity preferences, rather than academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143034311426943">Lindner &amp; Kerr, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0143034311426943">2001</xref>). There have been no previous research studies examining the relationship between motivational style and actual (AAP) and perceived academic performance (PAP).</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143034311426943" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>School principals on a list of coeducational secondary schools provided by the Hong Kong Department of Education were approached in random order within their group of schools until the co-operation of at least two schools in each of three school bands (high, middle, and low band) had been obtained. Children in Hong Kong secondary schools are classified based on their general academic ability as formally tested in public examinations in Primary 6 (age 11- to 12-years-old.). For the purposes of the present study, schools were grouped into ‘top’ ‘middle’, and ‘bottom’ categories on the basis of the average academic quality of their accepted students.</p>
<p>From the cooperating schools two or more classes were randomly selected from each of school grade levels S2 (average age = 13.2 years), S4 (average age = 15.06 years) and S6 (average age = 17.05 years). Objective grades were provided by the schools for 720 (370 boys, 350 girls) of the 1,500 school children and youth (899 boys; 601 girls) who completed the questionnaire. Boys and girls were evenly distributed over the three grade levels sampled. The sample was nearly proportionally distributed over Hong Kong districts. S6 had fewer respondents, which was in proportion to the actual number of students at that level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143034311426943"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>The questionnaire used in this study was a survey instrument used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311426943">Lindner, 2002</xref>) with minor amendments. Part of the questionnaire asked the respondent to rate, on six-point Likert-type scales, their own academic performance in the past year (from ‘poor’ to ‘good’). Another part was devoted to biographical information such as age, sex, grade level, school name, and class number and student name (to permit matching the individual with the objective grade average). A final part contained the 70-item Motivational Style Profile (MSP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311426943">Apter et al., 1998</xref>). The MSP has items concerning the six motivational style dimensions, or ‘<italic>dominances’</italic> which were the focus of the present study. Item responses were recorded on a six-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 6 (always). All subscales have a minimum score of 5 and a maximum of 30. Each motivational dominance score is derived from the difference between the two subscale scores in each pair (e.g. the <italic>serious dominance</italic> score is derived from the <italic>serious</italic> (telic) subscale score minus the <italic>playful</italic> (paratelic) subscale score. The MSP has demonstrated good test–retest reliability for dominance subscales and satisfactory concurrent validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311426943">Apter et al., 1998</xref>). Chinese versions of the MSP have been previously used in the local Hong Kong context (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143034311426943">Kerr, Au, &amp; Lindner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143034311426943">Sit &amp; Lindner, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0143034311426943">2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143034311426943" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>Following consent by the principals for their school’s participation in the survey, administration of the questionnaire took place early in the academic year (September to November) for all schools sampled. The instrument was distributed and explained by trained research assistants to entire classes, usually in the classroom. Assistance for the completion of the forms by the respondents was available throughout the session, which was done within one class period of about 45 minutes. In some instances, the instrument was administered by a school teacher after extensive briefing by a research assistant. Grade averages reflecting actual academic performance in the past year were obtained for the examinable academic subjects. These excluded subjects such as music, home economics and physical education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0143034311426943"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The completed questionnaire forms were checked, numbered, and coded by the principal research assistant. The forms were then electronically scanned and converted into data files. The resulting data sets were then converted into computer files, and the objective academic performance scores obtained from the schools were also entered. The whole data set was then checked for errors and outliers and some variables re-coded for regrouping or for conversion from real to nominal data. At this stage, descriptive statistics were generated to assess skewness and kurtosis within variables, and to test for normality.</p>
<p>The academic grades were provided for a total of 720 students. Some schools provided the average score for the relevant subjects (a single percentage value), whereas other schools made grades available for each subject. Academic performance (AAP) was standardized by taking or calculating a single average for the examinable subjects. Students with a grade point average of below 52% (<italic>n</italic> = 210) were classified as low AAP, those scoring above 66% were placed in the high AAP group (<italic>n</italic> = 252), with 258 respondents in the average AAP group. Students’ self-rated their perceived academic performance (PAP) on a five-point Likert scale: 1 and 2 (very poor and poor) was converted to low PAP (<italic>n</italic> = 254), 3 (average) to average PAP (<italic>n</italic> = 878), and 3 and 4 (good and very good) to high PAP (<italic>n</italic> = 365).</p>
<p>The analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls because the distributions of boys and girls over the AAP groups (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 121.38, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and over the PAP groups (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2 </sup>= 7.08, <italic>df</italic> = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0202) were unequal, with disproportionately low numbers of females in the low performance groups and males in the high groups, and fewer males in the high and females in the low groups.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics summarizing scores and variability, Chi square analyses, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and follow-up one-way ANOVA to test for significance of differences among academic performance groups. Full multifactorial (M)ANOVA was not possible because of low counts in some gender by academic ability category by grade level by academic performance group cells. The grade level variable was found to have a significant main effect, but did not interact significantly with any of the other independent variables and was therefore excluded from the reported findings.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0143034311426943"><title>Accuracy of academic performance perception</title>
<p>Just over 42% of the respondents perceived their academic performance correctly: 7% low PAP and low AAP, 23% average PAP and AAP, and 12% high PAP and high AAP. Of those students who perceived themselves as low achievers, 19% were actually high AAP and 40% were average AAP. Of those students who perceived themselves as high achievers, 23% were low AAP and 24% average AAP.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0143034311426943"><title>Male and female actual academic performance groups</title>
<p>Academic performance group (3––high, average, low) by academic ability category (3––top, middle, bottom) MANOVAs were conducted for the MSP dominances. The results for both genders showed that there were significant differences in dominances between levels of AAP (Males: <italic>F</italic> (12, 708) = 1.89, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0327, <italic>λ</italic> = 0.939; Females: <italic>F</italic> (12, 672) = 1.82, <italic>p</italic> = 0.042, <italic>λ</italic> = 0.938). The main effect of academic ability category and the interaction effect were not significant.</p>
<p>Results of the follow-up ANOVAs are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143034311426943">Table 1</xref>. High achieving males were significantly more serious (telic) dominant than average and low AAP group members, more arousal-avoiding dominant than the average AAP group and more conformist dominant than the low AAP group. High-achieving females were significantly more self-oriented (autic) dominant than the low AAP female group.

Meanwhile, low PAP male students were less conformist dominant than high and average PAP groups, and the average PAP male group less than the high-PAP students. High PAP females were more self-oriented (autic) dominant than the average PAP group, and both high and average PAP female groups were significantly more optimism dominant than the low PAP group.

<sec id="sec11-0143034311426943"><title>Perception and classification</title>
<p>According to the findings, those male and female students who perceived themselves to be high academic performers, whether that perception was accurate or not, indicated the same significant motivational dominances as the actual high academic performers (i.e. males: serious, conformist, arousal avoidance; females: self-oriented). The exception was in optimism dominance. In many cases, high perceivers were actually high achievers, but in other cases, they were not. There are at least two possible explanations for these findings. The first obvious possibility is that high PAP individuals who were not actual high academic performers simply lacked the academic skills and/or abilities required to be high achievers. A second possibility is that the high PAP/low AAP individual not only misperceived his or her actual academic performance, but also misperceived his or her own motivational style disposition. This may be due in part to a heightened sensitivity to parental or societal pressures to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143034311426943">Au et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143034311426943">Hui, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0143034311426943">Lindner, 2002</xref>). That is, the high PAP groups had a greater awareness of, and assigned greater importance to, certain motivational characteristics than the other PAP groups. This heightened awareness could have facilitated inaccuracies in self-perceptions.</p>
<p>The higher scores in optimism dominance for the male and female high (and average) PAP groups could simply be due to the notion that students who claimed to be high achievers have a more optimistic outlook than students who did not.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0143034311426943"><title>Motivational style in male and female groups</title>
<p>Although the analyses were conducted separately for boys and girls, the findings within each gender group suggest that there are differences between boys and girls in the way motivational style was related to academic achievement. In addition to the optimism dominance results discussed above, it was predicted that high-achieving students would be significantly more serious (telic), conformist, mastery, self-oriented (autic), and arousal-avoidance dominant than middle or low achieving students. These hypotheses were only partially supported and there were differences in male and female high achieving students. Male high academic performers (both actual and perceived), were significantly more serious, conformist, and arousal-avoidance dominant than lower achieving groups. Female high performers, (both actual and perceived) were significantly more self-oriented than middle and low performers. All other predictions for both male and female high achievers were not supported by the results.</p>
<p>Many school psychology studies have uncovered gender differences when it comes to explaining academic achievement. For example, specifically in the West, it has been found that as children move into adolescence boys typically do better in mathematics and girls do better in language arts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143034311426943">Dweck (1986)</xref> has suggested that these differences may be due in part to differences in motivational orientation. The differences in motivational style in the present study, may be due to differences in male and female socialization. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311426943">Ho (1986)</xref> has pointed out that Chinese parents are likely to discipline their sons through power assertion and the withdrawal of love and discipline, and their daughters through gentler means such as induction. In most cultures, and to varying degrees, there exists the so-called ‘double standard’ between boys and girls. Therefore, generally speaking, a boy’s playfulness and/or mischievousness are tolerated to a greater extent than the same characteristics in a girl. It may be that the significant difference between achievement levels in boys in the present study was due to the flexibility of male socialization with regard to behaviour normally associated in reversal theory with the serious and playful and conformist and negativistic dimensions. The girls in the present sample, perhaps due to the uniformity of socialization, were more consistent in serious (telic)-conformist dominance than the boys, with no significant differences across female achievement groups.</p>
<p>Furthermore, girls are generally often socialized to be more oriented to others, than are boys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143034311426943">Ho, 1986</xref>). In the sample studied here, high-achieving girls were significantly more self-oriented than lower achieving girls. It may be that in Hong Kong, boys are more uniformly socialized to be self-oriented, but because of the emergence of more opportunities for women to succeed as individuals, the socialization process for girls is changing and becoming more flexible. This could be the reason why a higher degree of self-orientation is a distinguishing factor for high achieving girls. These suggestions, however, are largely speculative, and more research would need to be conducted in order to reach any definitive conclusions on these points.</p>
<p>One surprising result concerned the lack of significant differences in mastery dominance among any of the groups following analysis. This was an unexpected finding, as it had been predicted that high achievers would be significantly more mastery dominant than their average and low achieving fellow students. This prediction was based on what has traditionally been considered important in Chinese formal educational settings (i.e. performance-oriented, high academic achievers with a need to be competitive, ambitious, and eager to be more successful than their peers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143034311426943">Chan, 2001</xref>). However, given the lack of significant differences in mastery dominance between different achievement groups in the present study, this assumption was not supported. In this regard, it should be noted that some educational psychology research results seem to support the notion that competition can be detrimental to academic achievement in Chinese classrooms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0143034311426943">Lam et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It may be that a mastery dominant motivational style could be advantageous to achievement in the short-term, and as long as confidence is high, performance-oriented learners will persist and accept new challenges where they can be successful. However, if confidence wanes or success becomes doubtful, the performance-oriented individual may refuse to engage in further learning opportunities that could threaten successful performance. Mastery dominance then may not be an essential characteristic for long-term academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143034311426943">Mueller &amp; Dweck, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-0143034311426943"><title>Implications of the results for psychological service providers in schools and teachers</title>
<p>Given the findings of the present study which distinguish high academic achievers from their less accomplished peers, what are the practical implications for school psychologists and secondary school teachers in Hong Kong? The present results suggest that, for example, as far as male students are concerned, if teachers produce unchanging, serious, rigid, rule-bound learning environments, these will suit the serious, conformist motivational style of high academic achievers. However, such learning environments will not suit the more playful, less conformist motivational style of the low academic performers and would likely leave these students frustrated and dissatisfied with school. To remedy this situation, school psychologists can suggest to teachers that they have a choice. First, they could organize at least some classroom learning activities to match the motivational styles of the low performers. Here, the focus for the students could be on being creative and having the freedom to experiment with new learning experiences and taking pleasure in the activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311426943">Mallows, 2007</xref>). Second, they could encourage male students in this low-performing group to alter their behaviour and become more serious and conformist in class. In reversal theory terms, this latter choice means inducing reversals between some of the six pairs of opposite motivational states that underpin different motivational styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143034311426943">Apter et al., 1998</xref>). The specific reversals in this case would be from playful to serious, and from negativism to conformity.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that, if learning conditions for females constantly involve the type of individually-oriented learning that suits the motivational style of high performers, they will not match the more group-oriented motivational style of low academic performers. For school psychologists and teachers, a similar choice is possible. First, teachers can attempt to change some learning conditions and create environments which match low performers’ motivational style and their need to be group-oriented, rather than egoistic. For students, this could involve focusing on personal success and achievement, and willingness for students to take on the responsibility of mastering new learning challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311426943">Mallows, 2007</xref>). Second, teachers could maintain the learning environment and encourage female low achievers to change their behaviour to be more oriented towards themselves. In reversal theory terms, this could involve inducing reversals in students from the other-focused motivational state to one which is self-focused. There are different ways to trigger reversals, including using visual images, creating routines, or getting individuals to reinterpret the way they think about situations (Apter, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143034311426943">Mallows, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of research work undertaken in schools by an educational psychologist in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143034311426943">Ford, 2003</xref>) support the reversal theory argument that, in order to reach all students, and especially those who are at risk for underachievement (and possible behaviour problems), the learning environment needs to include the whole range of motivational experiences in a balanced fashion. For all levels of students, learning requires variety and fluidity, and environments should be flexible enough to allow changes in motivation that best suit learning goals and students’ motivational styles at particular times. Educators should offer experiences that encourage the learner to consider the means as well as the ends, to be serious and playful, to think inside and outside the box, to compete and cooperate, and to value working with others as much as oneself.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0143034311426943"><title>Closing comments</title>
<p>If Hong Kong school psychologists (and those in other countries) are to utilize the results of the present study and the conceptual arguments of reversal theory with teachers, they need to have enough flexibility and time within their service roles to do so. School psychologists in Hong Kong, with a ratio of 1 psychologist to 8,000 school age children, (which is considerably below the figure for developed countries of 1:2,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143034311426943">Jimerson et al., 2009</xref>), may face difficulties in this regard. Taking advantage of modern computer technology and online methods of communication might possibly allow them to pass on the necessary information directly to teachers.</p>
