<abstract>
<p>Self-affirmation may offset defensiveness to threatening messages, increase intentions to engage in protective behaviors, and facilitate actual change. Relatively little is known about the conditions under which self-affirmation is most beneficial. The authors examined whether self-affirmation facilitates the forming of implementation intentions–plans to engage in specific steps that facilitate behavior change—and whether effects differ by affective state. Undergraduate female drinkers (<italic>N</italic> = 265) were self-affirmed or not prior to reading an article linking excessive alcohol consumption to breast cancer susceptibility. They then had the opportunity to report implementation intentions, by listing specific steps they planned to take to reduce consumption. Consistent with predictions, self-affirmation promoted formation of implementation intentions, an effect found only among individuals manifesting positive (as opposed to negative) affect following receipt of the message. Self-affirmation may facilitate behavior change by encouraging development of implementation intentions, an effect that is likely enhanced among those experiencing positive affect.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why people fail to change unhealthy behaviors. They may defensively dismiss information that suggests they are at risk of harm, or that they should modify dangerous behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611419265">Jemmott, Ditto, &amp; Croyle, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611419265">Kunda, 1987</xref>). Even when people are motivated and intend to make health behavior changes, they may fail at executing their goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611419265">Curry &amp; Marlatt, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611419265">Marlatt &amp; Kaplan, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611419265">Norcross, Ratzin, &amp; Payne, 1989</xref>). Thus, in order to facilitate behavior change, it is necessary not only to find ways to make people receptive to potentially threatening information but also to increase their chances of successfully implementing their goals once they have set them.</p>
<p>Self-affirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1948550611419265">Steele, 1988</xref>) may be one way to offset defensiveness and facilitate behavior change. Self-affirmation draws on motivations to maintain “self-integrity” and positive self-regard and involves reflecting upon one’s cherished values, actions, or attributes. Self-affirmation appears to promote positive consequences such as reducing defensiveness to threatening health information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611419265">Crocker, Niiya, &amp; Mischkowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419265">Harris, Mayle, Mabbott, &amp; Napper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>), increasing behavioral intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611419265">Armitage, Harris, Hepton, &amp; Napper, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1948550611419265">Sherman, Nelson, &amp; Steele, 2000</xref>), and promoting actual behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611419265">Epton &amp; Harris, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>No research has examined whether self-affirmation can promote the formation of more specific behavior change plans, although this has been highlighted as a promising direction for self-affirmation research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Epton, 2010</xref>). The current study investigates whether self-affirmation may promote the formation of implementation intentions—intentions to engage in specific steps that will facilitate behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611419265">Gollwitzer, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611419265">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611419265">Heckhausen &amp; Gollwitzer, 1987</xref>), as opposed to more global behavioral intentions. When individuals create implementation intentions, they create a detailed plan specifying when, where, and how they will execute the target behavior. Implementation intentions increase the likelihood of achieving a goal above and beyond behavioral intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1948550611419265">Orbell &amp; Sheeran, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1948550611419265">Sheeran &amp; Orbell, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1948550611419265">2000</xref>). Implementation intentions help overcome a variety of obstacles that can stand between goal setting and attainment, such as not initiating action, getting derailed from action, not disengaging when a course of action is failing, and overextending oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611419265">Gollwitzer, Wieber, Myers, &amp; McCrea, 2010</xref>). Implementation intentions also help individuals shield themselves against inner states, such as anxiety and ego depletion, that may interrupt goal striving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611419265">Achtziger, Gollwitzer, &amp; Sheeran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611419265">Bayer, Gollwitzer, &amp; Achtziger, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Existing findings in the self-affirmation literature are consistent with the possibility that self-affirmation may influence implementation intentions. Self-affirmation promotes specific preparatory behavior, consistent with the idea that it may facilitate specific behavior change plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1948550611419265">Sherman et al., 2000</xref>). Self-affirmation has also been associated with increased postmessage self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611419265">Epton &amp; Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Epton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611419265">Jessop, Simmonds, &amp; Sparks, 2009</xref>), suggesting individuals are developing actionable plans, although it is not clear whether this is a direct or indirect effect of self-affirmation. However, research examining the effects of self-affirmation on perceived behavioral control, a construct similar to self-efficacy, only sometimes yields effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419265">Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Role of Affect</title>
<p>Little is known about conditions under which self-affirmation is most effective. Here, we examined whether affect moderates the effects of self-affirmation on implementation intentions. Several studies have examined whether self-affirmation directly influences affect, with mixed results (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1948550611419265">Weisenfeld, Brockner, &amp; Martin, 1999</xref>). However, affect has not been conceptualized as a moderator of the association between self-affirmation and defensive processing and associated health outcomes. Such interactions are important to explore, given that associations among affective and cognitive processes are related to decision making and behavior in many settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611419265">Finucane, Peters, &amp; Slovic, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611419265">Ferrer et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611419265">Klein, Zajac, &amp; Monin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611419265">Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001</xref>), and emotion may activate cognitive predispositions that influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611419265">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Affect may be particularly important to examine in the context of processing threatening health messages. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that global affective states influence message processing and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419265">Bless, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419265">Bower, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611419265">Forgas, 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611419265">1998b</xref>). Indeed, affect can actually act as information, where individuals interpret environmental cues or messages based on their feelings, regardless of whether those feelings are integral to the cues or messages (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419265">Clore, Gasper, &amp; Garvin, 2002</xref>). Affect has been shown specifically to influence processing information about personal risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611419265">Fischhoff, Gonzalez, Lerner, &amp; Small, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611419265">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1948550611419265">Raghunathan &amp; Pham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1948550611419265">Tiedens &amp; Linton, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Affect can be important, regardless of whether it is essential or even related to the decision. Loewenstein and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611419265">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611419265">Loewenstein et al., 2001</xref>) have distinguished between integral affect, which is relevant to the decision, and incidental affect, which is experienced at the time of the decision but is not directly relevant. Integral affect, such as worry that results directly from threatening health messages, can influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611419265">Bagozzi, Baumgartner, &amp; Pieters, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611419265">Loewenstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611419265">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003</xref>;). Incidental affect, such as emotion elicited from watching an unrelated movie clip, can also exert a strong influence on behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611419265">Lerner, Small, &amp; Loewenstein, 2004</xref>). As individuals often have difficulty identifying an emotion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611419265">Buck, 1985</xref>) or correctly associating it with its antecedent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1948550611419265">Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962</xref>), the influences of integral and incidental affect often simultaneously influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611419265">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003</xref>). As such, these two should be considered concurrently when examining their association with message processing.</p>
<p>Here we consider the possibility that effects of self-affirmation might affect implementation intentions differently depending on whether individuals are experiencing positive or negative affect after processing a threatening health message. Self-affirmation increases self-resources, such as self-control and ability to withstand negative events or messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611419265">Crocker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419265">Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>), as does positive affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1948550611419265">Raghunathan &amp; Trope, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1948550611419265">Tice, Baumeister, Shmueli, &amp; Muraven, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1948550611419265">Trope &amp; Neter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1948550611419265">Trope &amp; Pomerantz, 1998</xref>) suggesting that together they might have an additive or even synergistic effect. Thus, the experience of positive affect may increase implementation intentions above and beyond the effect of self-affirmation, producing a pattern of results in which self-affirmed individuals express more implementation intentions, particularly if they report experiencing positive affect upon receipt of the threatening message.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it may be that individuals experiencing positive affect exclusively benefit from self-affirmations (whereas individuals experiencing negative affect do not). Positive affect promotes heuristic processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419265">Bless, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419265">Clore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611419265">Forgas, 1998a</xref>). Additionally, individuals experiencing positive affect often engage in strategies to maintain that affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611419265">Forgas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611419265">Handley, Lassiter, Nickell, &amp; Herchenroeder, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1948550611419265">Wegener &amp; Petty, 1994</xref>). This may trigger biased processing and recall of information consistent with motivations to see alcohol use as safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611419265">Bower, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611419265">Kunda, 1990</xref>), particularly because affect can direct individuals to attend to congruent risk-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611419265">Diefenbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611419265">Finucane et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611419265">Lerner, Gonzalez, Small, &amp; Fischhoff, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, self-affirmation may attenuate the effects of positive affect by increasing systematic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611419265">Correll, Spencer, &amp; Zanna, 2004</xref>) and reducing defensiveness against messages that could decrease mood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611419265">Crocker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419265">Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>). Individuals experiencing negative affect, however, may process the messages more systematically and be less defensive about the threatening message, meaning they would be less likely to need self-affirmation.</p>
<p>In sum, we examined whether self-affirmed participants, after reading about the link between alcohol and breast cancer, will be more likely to express implementation intentions, operationalized as detailed plans about how to reduce their drinking behavior (such as specifying alcohol quantity/type, and/or location/time of drinking). When individuals indicate that they will take steps associated with the specific context, they are articulating a comprehensive set of situations in which they need to respond, thus expressing implementation intentions.</p>
<p>Additionally, we examined whether global affective state—positive or negative—upon receiving the threatening health message moderates the association between self-affirmation and implementation intentions. We were interested in both incidental (unrelated to the message) and integral (experienced as a direct response to the message) affect. Thus, we measured affect immediately after the message—when individuals would be influenced by both types of affect—as opposed to prior to the message, when only incidental affect would be captured. As stated, we hypothesized an interaction such that either (a) the effect of self-affirmation on implementation intentions would be exaggerated among those reporting positive affect (a significant interaction where there was a main effect for condition among all individuals, but one far more pronounced among those reporting positive affect) or (b) self-affirmation influenced implementation intentions only among those reporting positive affect (a significant interaction where there was a main effect of condition only among those reporting positive affect).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 265 University of Pittsburgh undergraduate females, aged 18 or older, who reported drinking at least one alcoholic drink per week, and who were fulfilling a psychology course requirement. They were tested in individual experimental sessions lasting approximately 1 hr. We used only female participants because of the personal relevance of the health risk used in the manipulation, which described the link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer, a disease that predominantly affects females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550611419265">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions, the self-affirmation condition or the non-affirmed control condition. The experimenter was blind to condition. Participants first completed baseline measures of alcohol consumption, including number of drinks per week. Participants then completed a writing task, a standard self-affirmation manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611419265">McQueen &amp; Klein, 2006</xref>). Those in the self-affirmation condition were instructed to select the most important value from a list and write about why it was important to them. Participants also had the option to write about a value not included in the list. Those in the control condition selected the least important value to them and wrote about why it might be important to someone else.</p>
<p>After completing the writing task, all of the participants read an article about the link between alcohol consumption and susceptibility to breast cancer, adapted from materials used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611419265">Harris &amp; Napper, 2005</xref>). The article specified that according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ recommendations for alcohol consumption, women should not drink more than one serving (12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor) per day, and no more than 7 servings per week.</p>
<p>Following the article, participants completed a questionnaire assessing a variety of behavioral and social–cognitive variables, including affect and intentions to reduce alcohol consumption. A more detailed description of the study procedures is published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611419265">Klein &amp; Harris, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>As part of the questionnaire, participants had the option of indicating steps involved in reducing their alcohol intake for the following week. Participants were asked: “If you have any interest in altering your alcohol consumption in the next 7 days, how will you go about it? Please list below any steps that you think you will take to reduce your alcohol consumption.” Fully 211 (80%) participants provided one or more steps. These steps were coded to indicate the degree to which participants were expressing a clear and comprehensive set of implementation intentions that comprised a specific plan for reducing drinking. We coded whether the steps specified quantity of alcohol, type of alcohol, location of drinking, or time of drinking on the intentions sheet. Each of these 4 items was scored as 0 (<italic>not mentioned</italic>) or 1 (<italic>mentioned</italic>), and an aggregate specificity score was calculated. Scores therefore ranged from 0 (<italic>mentioned none of these aspects, indicating lack of implementation intentions comprising a specific plan</italic>) to 4 (<italic>mentioned all four aspects, indicating comprehensive implementation intentions comprising a specific plan</italic>), with a mean of 0.73 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.67). There was high interrater reliability for coding (Cohen’s κ = .99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Affect was assessed by a semantic differential scale in which participants indicated the extent to which the following words described how they currently felt (bad/good; sad/happy; displeased/pleased; calm/excited; tired/energetic; sedate/aroused). Answer options ranged from 1 (<italic>corresponding to the negative emotions</italic>) to 7 (<italic>corresponding to the positive emotions</italic>). These items had high internal reliability (α = .83). Affect had a relatively normal distribution (skewness = 0.40, kurtosis = −0.08), and as such, was treated as a continuous variable in analyses. The mean affect score was 3.6, consistent with an essentially neutral affective state. As such, we reasoned that participants who were one standard deviation above the mean could be said to be experiencing positive affect, and those who were one standard deviation below the mean to be experiencing negative affect.</p>

<sec id="section7-1948550611419265">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>As a control, we examined whether self-affirmation influenced positive or negative affect by regressing affect on self-affirmation condition. We then regressed the implementation intentions measure on self-affirmation condition and affect in order to first assess main effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611419265">Cohen, Cohen, Aiken, &amp; West, 2003</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1948550611419265">1</xref></sup> Then, to examine the interaction, we regressed implementation intentions on self-affirmation condition, affect, and their interaction. Self-affirmation was coded such that self-affirmed participants had a value of 0.5 and non-affirmed participants had a value of −0.5. The affect score was mean-centered. To interpret interaction effects, we used simple slopes tests to evaluate the relationship between self-affirmation and implementation intention separately for those experiencing positive and negative affect. For purposes of exposition, we computed separate regression lines for individuals one standard deviation above (positive affect) and below (negative affect) the mean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611419265">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Main Effects</title>
<p>Self-affirmation condition had no effect on affective state (<italic>B</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> = .87), consistent with findings in previous studies. Main effects analyses indicated implementation intentions were generated as a result of self-affirmation (<italic>B</italic> = .19, <italic>p</italic> = .04) but were not related to affective state (<italic>B</italic> = −.01, <italic>p</italic> = .90).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550611419265">
<title>Interaction</title>
<p>We hypothesized that self-affirmed participants would be more likely to express specific plans about how to reduce their drinking behavior, and further, that level of affect would moderate this effect. When controlling for self-affirmation condition and affect, there was a significant interaction between self-affirmation condition and positive affect (<italic>B</italic> = .18, <italic>p</italic> = .05). Specifically, among individuals who were relatively higher in positive affect, self-affirmation facilitated the use of implementation intentions (<italic>B</italic> = .37, <italic>p</italic> = .006), but among individuals higher in negative affect there was no effect of self-affirmation (<italic>B</italic> = −.01, <italic>p</italic> = .99; See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611419265">Figure 1</xref>
). Simple slopes analyses indicated that affect did not influence implementations in the self-affirmed (<italic>B</italic> = .08, <italic>p</italic> = .24) or control (<italic>B</italic> = −.09, <italic>p</italic> = .12) condition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As predicted, self-affirmation resulted in increased generation of implementation intentions for reduced alcohol consumption, an effect that was found only among individuals who manifested positive affect upon receiving the message. Self-affirmation has been demonstrated to promote positive consequences for motivation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611419265">Crocker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611419265">Harris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1948550611419265">Sherman et al., 2000</xref>) and even behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611419265">Epton &amp; Harris, 2008</xref>). The results of the current study may contribute to our understanding of how self-affirmation produces these effects. The formation of more implemental intentions may be a pivotal mechanism by which self-affirmation encourages health behavior change. The association between self-affirmation and implementation intentions may be particularly important, given previous research demonstrating that desire or motivation is not sufficient to ensure successful health behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1948550611419265">Norcross, Mrykalo, &amp; Blagys, 2002</xref>). Implementation intentions are a useful regulatory strategy for individuals attempting to change their behavior; studies have demonstrated that they are beneficial for goal attainment and precede initiation of health behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1948550611419265">Sheeran &amp; Orbell, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1948550611419265">2000</xref>). Implementation intentions may help individuals overcome obstacles that may stand in the way of achieving a goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611419265">Gollwitzer et al., 2010</xref>) and may shield against inner states that interrupt goal striving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611419265">Achtziger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611419265">Bayer et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We also found that affect moderated this association between self-affirmation and implementation intentions. Our findings support the prediction that individuals experiencing positive affect may exclusively benefit from self-affirmation (as opposed to a competing prediction that all participants would benefit, but those experiencing positive affect would have increased benefit). Because positive affect can lead to heuristic information processing, whereas negative affect leads to systematic information processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611419265">Bless, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611419265">Clore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611419265">Forgas, 1998a</xref>), it is possible that individuals experiencing negative affect are able to systematically process the content of the article, whereas individuals who are experiencing positive affect are more likely to succumb to biased processing and recall only information that is consistent with motivations to see alcohol use as safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611419265">Kunda, 1990</xref>). Self-affirmation increases systematic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611419265">Correll, Spencer, &amp; Zanna, 2004</xref>), which may be more necessary in individuals experiencing positive affect.</p>
<p>Positive affect is also associated with mood maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611419265">Forgas, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611419265">Handley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1948550611419265">Wegener &amp; Petty, 1994</xref>), and as such, individuals experiencing positive affect may be motivated to avoid information that would make them feel vulnerable, potentially decreasing their positive affect. It is possible that among individuals experiencing positive affect, self-affirmation may be one mechanism for mood maintenance, even in light of feelings of perceived vulnerability to cancer that might otherwise threaten it. Additional research is necessary to test these hypotheses.</p>
<p>Note that affect was measured after individuals read the threatening article, meaning that both integral and incidental affect were collapsed together. In other words, individuals experiencing positive affect may have been experiencing affect both incidental to, and as a result of, the message and self-affirmation. Given that these two types of affect simultaneously influence decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611419265">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003</xref>), measuring affect after the message to encompass both types is conceptually appropriate and replicates conditions under which affect may naturally influence responses to messages encountered in everyday life. However, it does not allow us to draw conclusions concerning the type of affect driving the finding.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to explain these findings. First, individual differences may contribute to tendencies to experience positive or negative affect upon message receipt. For example, the affective response may be a product of individual differences in motivation or ability to maintain positive mood; individuals more motivated to maintain positive mood may be better able to engage defensive processes. Conversely, the affect measured may be confounded with individual differences in defensive processing, such that individuals who are more likely to be defensive or have greater ability to engage in defensive processes (and thus need self-affirmation more) experience more positive integral affect about the message as a result of their bias. Future research could measure and control for relevant individual differences. Additionally, longitudinal research that examines the effect in the same individuals over time may shed light on whether the effect is consistent within individuals (which would support an individual differences hypothesis).</p>
<p>Incidental affect may also be driving the effect—such that individuals who entered the experimental session already experiencing positive or negative affect were then motivated and able to maintain that affect throughout the course of the study. This possibility could be examined by inducing incidental affect (with a writing exercise, for example; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611419265">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2001</xref>) prior to the study (or after the self-affirmation but prior to the threatening message). Finally, the affect and subsequent effects we observed may be due to a combination of incidental and integral affect as well as individual differences. This possibility could be addressed by combining the techniques described above, where an incidental affect manipulation is employed and the design is longitudinal to examine the within-subject effects over time.</p>
<p>A strength of the study is that it observed spontaneously occurring expressions of implementation intentions indicating that self-affirmation may naturally lead to generating these helpful plans for goal attainment. However, in future studies, it would be beneficial to compare spontaneously occurring implementation intentions with those generated as a result of experimental instructions or manipulation, in order to examine potential differences in direction or magnitude of the effects. It may be that if participants were specifically instructed to generate implementation intentions for behavior change and told how to word them to best maximize their effectiveness, the results would be even more pronounced, or alternatively, that being required to generate intentions would have no great benefit over their natural tendency to create intentions, or even result in a reduced effect due to external attributions for the creation of the intentions. Future research could also determine whether certain types of self-affirmation may be more effective and lead to greater use of implementation intentions.</p>
<p>The results of this study afford a better understanding of one potential underlying mechanism that may inform the design of future applications with profound implications for those individuals attempting to change their unhealthy behavior. Additionally, this study demonstrates conditions under which self-affirmation may be most beneficial—where individuals are experiencing positive affect upon message receipt—and highlights the possibility for complementary persuasion techniques that target affect and self-integrity.</p>
<p>These findings also have great practical importance. Alcohol use among college students, many of whom are under the legal drinking age, is a significant problem on college campuses. The prevalence of drinking is higher among college students than their noncollege counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611419265">Chen, Dufour, &amp; Yi, 2004</xref>). Overconsumption of alcohol leads to numerous negative consequences in both the short and long term for those who drink, as well as for the community at large. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, driving while intoxicated increased from 2.3 million students in 1998 to 2.8 million in 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611419265">Hingson et al., 2005</xref>). From 1999 to 2005, alcohol-related unintentional injury deaths increased among college students aged 18–24, as did the proportions of those driving under the influence of alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611419265">Hingson, Zha, &amp; Weitzman, 2009</xref>). This study suggests that self-affirmation may have potential for eventual use as an applied intervention to reduce alcohol abuse in this population.</p>

<p>We originally controlled for baseline drinking; however, this control variable was not significant and was excluded from the final analyses reported. We also performed four logistic regressions on each of the four components of implementation intentions, to ensure that none of these was individually driving the effect. Self-affirmation condition, affect, and their interaction had no significant effects on whether participants reported steps referring to (a) quantity of alcohol, (b) type of alcohol, (c) location of drinking, or (d) time of drinking. This suggests that self-affirmation and affect interact to affect the generation of specific plans, or implementation intentions, rather than to affect the generation of any one specific component of that plan.</p>
