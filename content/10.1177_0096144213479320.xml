<p>The Barbican Estate, in London’s square-mile City financial district, is one of the capital’s most unique residential spaces. In the 1950s the City Corporation redeveloped the war-damaged site as a “high class” neighborhood even though the prevailing planning dogma was to usher the well-heeled out of the crowded center. To sanitize the inner-city site, the Barbican’s architects created a radically modernist residential precinct elevated above City streets. This social history examines the Barbican Estate as a unique intersection between modern architecture and the emerging discourse of gentrification in London. In creating spaces of comfort and exclusion, its architects drew from the same new middle-class culture that influenced the gentrification of existing London neighborhoods. The Estate’s eventual residents continued this interpretation and revision after the flats opened in 1968. The Barbican demonstrates the flexible nature of early gentrification and suggests how it must be approached as a diversified spatial phenomenon.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viewed from the outside, the city of London’s forty-acre Barbican Estate looks more like a freeway overpass than a residential development, let alone one designed for London’s choosy upper-middle classes. Its dark concrete walls might easily obscure a train shed, a warehouse, or a sewage treatment facility. But every weekend night, thousands of people ascend one of the dingy stairways around the Barbican’s perimeter to visit the Estate’s gargantuan arts complex. Once inside this modern walled fortress, these outsiders are inevitably struck by the contrasts inside one of London’s most perplexing places.</p>
<p>On this hidden island one floor above the City streets, they likely recognize the terraced concrete towers and windswept paved plazas—trademark features of many post–World War II social housing projects. However, the structures at the Barbican do not look like the usual monoliths of urban poverty. There is real wood paneling on the balconies, where flowers dangle elegantly from hanging boxes down to the floors below. A close examination of the Barbican’s walls and columns reveals that the whole Estate is clad not in typical cheap concrete but rough, hand-chiseled Welsh Pen Lee stone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479320">1</xref></sup> There are plenty of ugly ventilation towers, but even these are covered in vines climbing up wooden guides. Many visitors to the Barbican and its arts center have surely sat near the Estate’s lush artificial pond, with its loudly quacking ducks, and wondered where they were and what kind of people live here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144213479320">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The Barbican, a housing development built in the 1960s for more than four thousand people, is unique for a variety of reasons. Most obviously, it is an architectural masterwork—near-total destruction of the site from German bombing in World War II gave its architects and planners a blank slate on which to implement modernist ideas on a grand scale. Pedestrian and vehicular traffic is entirely segregated. Cars flow through the site in an underground tunnel that connects to parking facilities in the Barbican’s ground level. Above this is the podium, a pedestrian precinct where the Estate’s various buildings are connected by meandering walkways and gardens. The Barbican is also an unusual political construction. The Corporation of London, the archaic body that governs the square-mile City of London financial center, funded it to bolster its dwindling residential population. But the Barbican’s most important yet overlooked aspect is its social purpose as an inner-city enclave for the middle class.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479320">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This social history examines the Barbican as an intersection between three cultural forces with overlapping visions for middle-class life and neighborhood space. Architectural modernism, the City Corporation’s traditional bourgeois values, and especially the emerging consumerist discourse of <italic>gentrification</italic> each contributed to this domestic fortress. The Corporation’s idea to develop the inner-city site into a “high class” neighborhood ran against the grain of contemporary planning wisdom. The scheme’s architects then took the City’s plans and infused them with their own modernist sensibilities and awareness of shifting middle-class tastes. The Estate’s eventual residents then sought to revise its built values to suit their needs while celebrating its uniqueness and authenticity. Despite the project’s ambition and scale, the assertion of middle-class space at the Barbican, as in London in general at the time, was a complex and ongoing process.</p>
<p>To carry out this inquiry, I draw from archival, oral, and architectural sources surrounding the Barbican’s creation and inhabitance. The physical form of the Estate itself, seen both in design documents and my own observations, is crucial. But other sources reflecting the political and social discourses surrounding the Barbican must inform this reading of built space. Reports, plans, and correspondence exchanged between the scheme’s architects and the Corporation of London shed light on the intentions and influences behind the Barbican’s creation. I also examine newsletters published by the Barbican Residents Association between 1968 and 1990 as an instrument for creating the Barbican’s residential culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479320">3</xref></sup> Finally, interviews conducted with three long-time residents in summer 2010 supplement this documentary record.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479320">4</xref></sup> The experiences of interviewees in particular help contextualize the activities of the voluntary Residents Association and its newsletter within the residential community. All of these sources are discussed with an eye toward their relation to the scholarly literature on gentrification and middle-class space.</p>

<title>Background and Historiography</title>
<p>The political and economic climate of post–World War II Britain would initially seem an unlikely incubator for the Barbican’s upmarket state-constructed housing. One reason is the slow pace of economic recovery in the postwar years. Household rationing was only terminated in 1954.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479320">5</xref></sup> Moreover, historians have highlighted the period from 1945 until Margaret Thatcher’s reforms in 1979 as an era when both political parties were committed to creating a welfare-state economy that shared the fruits of growth more equitably.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479320">6</xref></sup> When the Barbican was being planned in the 1950s, it was austerity and collective well-being—not individual affluence—that defined the spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Government plans for London’s reconstruction reflected this concern for equality. As planning historian Lionel Esher points out, the postwar period was a crucial moment for modernist architecture, not just as an aesthetic style but also as a social program in step with the progressive zeitgeist. Mass housing, ample provision of green spaces, and thoughtful building in general were to be the “bedrock” for a more just society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479320">7</xref></sup> As a result, planners saw inner London, with its crowded spaces and oppressive slums, as a less than desirable place for people to live. The planning “consensus,” according to Esher, became the decentralization of residences to outer parts of London such as the purpose-built New Towns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479320">8</xref></sup> In the city itself, large-scale housing projects promised to bring modern living and some amount of open space to the working-class masses.</p>
<p>However, the Barbican project stands somewhat apart from national trends because of its deep connections to the Corporation of London. Not to be confused with London’s metropolitan government, the Corporation governs the capital’s tiny and historic financial core.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479320">9</xref></sup> The Court of Common Council and an annually elected Lord Mayor head its institutions, which date from pre-Norman times. Although the municipality long contained most of London’s growth, the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the metropolis sprawl far outside the City’s boundaries. The square mile’s resident population gradually dwindled from about 130,000 in the nineteenth century to just 5,000 in the post–World War II years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479320">10</xref></sup> At the same time, however, the Corporation intensified the City’s traditional role as the country’s center of commerce, and the wealth of empire made it the world’s premier financial center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479320">11</xref></sup> Bustling during the daytime, it became increasingly deserted after business hours. The City’s influence allowed it to retain its anachronistic powers and status despite reforms to London government in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479320">12</xref></sup> Hence, most of its electorate were actually enfranchised companies, and its conservatism was matched only by its desire for self-preservation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479320">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a commercial center, the City was hit particularly hard by German air raids in World War II. Areas such as the Barbican site were bombed almost entirely to rubble.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479320">14</xref></sup> The British postwar government saw war reconstruction as an opportunity to relieve urban congestion, and eventually decided that more housing in the square mile would reduce commuting traffic, setting the stage for a residential Barbican.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479320">15</xref></sup> However, the Corporation wanted to create a middle-class space, and its vision of middle-class life was rooted in corporate culture. As Simon Gunn and Rachel Bell explain, white-collar employees at the time were expected to prioritize stability, family, and loyalty. Workers typically devoted their entire careers to one employer and in turn the company took care of them with job security and opportunities for promotion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479320">16</xref></sup> The Corporation’s dream for the Barbican was thus a haven for young executives whose employment would make them natural boosters for the City. Because the Corporation would construct, own, and operate the Estate, the initial tenure arrangements—short-term leases with the local authority—were similar to those found on contemporary social housing estates. Although rents were not subsidized beyond the Estate’s massive capital construction cost, this government-led ownership structure would continue until 1982, when all tenants of council-owned housing in Britain were given the right to buy their flats on long-term leases.</p>
<p>The modernist style of its chosen architects, Chamberlain, Powell, and Bon (CP&amp;B), influenced the Corporation’s ideals. Indeed, though the Estate may have stood apart from Modernism’s egalitarian social values, most historians have focused on its exemplary applications of the movement’s architectural style.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479320">17</xref></sup> London historians such as David Kynaston have approached the Estate with an eye to its implementation of radical planning ideas while overlooking its political role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479320">18</xref></sup> Esher, in his history of England’s postwar planning, portrays the Barbican as a praiseworthy modernist vision hampered primarily by its incompleteness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479320">19</xref></sup> However, it is not sufficient to examine the Barbican merely as an expression of radical postwar planning. Its political background and, especially, social objectives distinguish it from the countless other contemporary experiments in British modernist architecture.</p>
<p>David Heathcote’s <italic>Barbican: Penthouse Over the City</italic>, the only scholarly book on the Estate, recognizes the project’s uniqueness as an architectural product.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479320">20</xref></sup> He analyzes every detail of the architects’ vision—from the constantly changing site layout to faucets and doorknobs—to investigate what he correctly claims is a unique record of “ideas about how London should be lived in the future.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479320">21</xref></sup> Unfortunately, Heathcote only touches on the wider social values that fueled the Estate’s construction and became embedded in its form. He provides an excellent overview of the Estate’s modernist vision of middle-class housing, but overlooks the efforts of Barbican residents to revise and interpret this vision. The Barbican must be examined in light of the cultural forces operating before and after its physical construction.</p>
<p>In particular, while government planners envisioned a population freed from inner-city slums and congestion, certain middle-class groups were embracing life in dilapidated central London neighborhoods. During the postwar years, young professionals bought and renovated homes in working-class areas, rapidly replacing former residents in a process that would later become known as gentrification. Historians and geographers have highlighted the particular consumerist culture of these gentrifiers and how they imposed their ideas on the neighborhood spaces they occupied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479320">22</xref></sup> Values such as authenticity, individuality, neighborliness, convenience, and tranquility were crucial in much of this gentrification discourse. Incoming residents sought to accentuate and cultivate these qualities in their urban environments. As geographers Tim Butler and Gary Robson point out, gentrification was crucial in the “remaking” of inner London into a play zone for the well-off.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479320">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Historians have yet to integrate the Barbican into this wider narrative of London’s twentieth-century social change. This is likely partially a problem of disciplinary barriers; literature on gentrification has drawn extensively from the fields of urban geography and sociology, while the Barbican’s history has been written almost exclusively by historians of architecture and planning. Early gentrification was gradual and ground-up, operating on quaint but unremarkable houses and neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479320">24</xref></sup> In contrast, the Barbican’s ambitious and tumultuous twenty-three-year development drew the constant attention of the popular and architectural media. But contextualizing the Barbican in the concurrent discourse on gentrification reveals the shifts in middle-class values that became embedded in its built form.</p>
<p>Historians and geographers have only begun to grapple with the long-term trajectory of gentrification. Sociologist Ruth Glass first coined the term in 1964 while discussing the residential changes occurring in London’s Islington neighborhood. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479320">25</xref></sup> But early academic work focused on causal debates about the economic forces underlying this global urban pattern. In particular, geographers such as Neil Smith argued for a Marxist, supply-side approach that focused on the urban land market while others, particularly David Ley, saw gentrification as a result of consumptive shifts in a postindustrial economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479320">26</xref></sup> The economic and cultural function of gentrification remains hotly debated, but researchers have since broadened their view to look at how—rather than just why—gentrification happens and the ways gentrified space is produced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479320">27</xref></sup> This shift is a welcome opportunity to examine the particular process of gentrification at unusual sites such as the Barbican.</p>
<p>The new tone in gentrification research reflects the recent influence of the “spatial turn” in urban history and the related “new cultural geography” among geographers. Both movements focus on how urban spaces were at once the representations and enforcers of normative values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479320">28</xref></sup> Recent work has explored how gentrification is a vastly different phenomenon in each country, city, and neighborhood. London, as the city that inspired the term, has been the subject of a number of studies on the nature of its middle-class transformation. Tim Butler and Garry Robson, for instance, trace the gradual rejection of the modernist idea of London as a labor market—a necessary concentration of jobs and amenities—instead viewing it as “a place to live and play.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479320">29</xref></sup> Similarly, Joe Moran focuses on the strategies used by early gentrifiers to create communities of like-minded neighbors and communicate their presence through neighborhood transformation. This research into the methods of gentrification is particularly useful when examining a neighborhood like the Barbican, where the gentrification discourse interacted with other, alternative conceptions of middle-class space.</p>
<p>According to geographer Loretta Lees, the initial phase of gentrification in the 1950s through 1970s—during the Barbican’s construction and inhabitance—saw young professionals buying and rehabilitating formerly rental housing in North London neighborhoods like Barnsbury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479320">30</xref></sup> These “pioneers” worked through “collective social action” to create organizations that promoted and demonstrated their influence in the neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479320">31</xref></sup> Government action, where present, took the form of indirect incentives such as the 1969 Housing Act’s improvement grants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479320">32</xref></sup> Deregulation of the finance industries in the 1980s saw increased wealth for City bank workers, who became the primary actors in the second and third waves of gentrification. These wealthier newcomers were less concerned with forming neighborhood bonds and mixing with the remaining working-class community. Beginning in the 1980s and 1990s with the third wave, corporations and government made their involvement in the process more pronounced. Not only did large-scale commercial and infrastructure investment accompany residential transformation, but new housing developments were also built that produced “gentrified” dwellings from whole cloth.</p>
<p>Geographers and gentrification researchers have recently begun to consider whether this emerging trend of “new build” gentrification, where resident displacement may be minimal or indirect, can be seen as an extension of the older forms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144213479320">33</xref></sup> But the historical experience of the Barbican, which straddles all three of Lees’s gentrification phases, suggests that the economic and cultural discourse of gentrification has long operated in diverse, complex, and contested ways—including as massive, “new build” megaprojects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0096144213479320">
<title>The Corporation’s Vision</title>
<p>The government had informed the City as early as 1952 that more housing provision in the square mile would be preferable, but a certain faction in the Corporation, led by E. F. Wilkins, was already seeking to reverse the area’s depopulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144213479320">34</xref></sup> This group was concerned that the City’s tiny residential electorate was a political vulnerability. The central government was pursuing the reform of local authorities, and would unsurprisingly find it hard to justify a municipality that had almost no actual residents. One solution was to simply build subsidized housing—this could be done affordably and would expand the City’s residential base.</p>
<p>However, Wilkins and his faction, whom Heathcote calls the “modernizers,” believed that the Corporation needed to go further by providing top-quality neighborhood amenities for its citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144213479320">35</xref></sup> In doing so, the City would be able to attract wealthier residents who, it is implied, would be better advocates for the body’s continued existence. Wilkins outlined his ideas in a 1955 Common Council resolution sidelining business development in favor of “harmonious integration of all the needs of the Corporation” at the Barbican site.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144213479320">36</xref></sup> Intended for an internal audience, this insinuative title highlights the political pragmatism behind the Barbican. Wilkins argued that “high class, unsubsidized housing” would be most beneficial to the Corporation, but would require a full complement of amenities to counterbalance congested surroundings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144213479320">37</xref></sup> His main concern was not cost but rather how to attract “high class” tenants to the Barbican’s undesirable land. His focus on amenities—arts facilities, schools, and shopping—is prescient in its implication that consumption might be an important attraction for middle-class residents. But the simultaneous demand for comprehensive planning suggests that Wilkins’s elevated urbanity would have to be sufficiently packaged and protected from the inhospitable city outside.</p>
<p>The first designs for the Barbican’s rebuilding came from the New Barbican Committee, an advocacy group composed of modernizers like Wilkins.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144213479320">38</xref></sup> The group commissioned a proposal from the architecture firm Kadleigh, Whitfield, and Horsburgh that aligned well with Wilkins’s views about comprehensive development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144213479320">39</xref></sup> The New Barbican design first introduced the podium concept, where residential flats were carefully positioned on an elevated platform above commercial uses at ground level and deep below. The architects claimed that this comprehensive approach would provide residents “with a far higher standard of amenities than are possible in a more traditional development . . . in the City.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144213479320">40</xref></sup> They envisioned a neighborhood for “young professionals, likely to have a taste for Mediterranean holidays, French food and Scandinavian design.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144213479320">41</xref></sup> This was only possible because the proposal created a middle-class oasis elevated above the less desirable commercial uses operating around and under the podium. Because the Ministry of Housing and Local Government was concerned that the New Barbican’s extreme density would only increase congestion, it quashed the proposal in 1956.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144213479320">42</xref></sup> However, the precedent of large-scale, amenity-rich comprehensive development would become the cornerstone of the Barbican project.</p>
<p>This focus on amenities defied the conventional planning theory of the time, which suggested that high densities would preclude the City from ever being attractive to the upper classes. Between 1955 and 1957, the debate over the Barbican area became polarized between the Martin-Mealand Scheme, which was aligned with this more conventional view, and the proposals of Chamberlin, Powell &amp; Bon (CP&amp;B). CP&amp;B had become Wilkins’s favored architects after designing the City’s Golden Lane housing estate earlier in the decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144213479320">43</xref></sup> The Martin-Mealand scheme allocated a smaller, thirteen-acre precinct for housing on the Barbican site, reserving most of the rest for office use. Anthony Mealand, the City’s planning officer, justified this decision by pointing out that “this location” would make the Barbican “very unlikely” to appeal to anyone beyond a “restricted market of potential tenants.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144213479320">44</xref></sup> He thus concludes that subsidized housing would be the only feasible option for the site. Mealand and other Barbican opponents were not ethically opposed to ushering the wealthy onto the site, but the City could simply not be sanitized for the middle classes. Even Wilkins’s own Special Committee, which was formed to investigate and implement the CP&amp;B plans, acknowledged the unprecedented nature of the project, stating that “little or no provision is being made in the central areas of London either by private enterprise or by local authorities for housing accommodation for the middle and higher income groups.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144213479320">45</xref></sup> Once the Corporation approved the notion of government-built gentrification in theory, devising and promoting a scheme that would resonate with middle class residents became the main challenge for the Barbican’s architects.</p>

<sec id="section4-0096144213479320">
<title>Architectural Plans: Amenities</title>
<p>While the Corporation’s interests and financing dominated the Barbican project, the architects had considerable freedom to interpret and even alter the City’s desires to fit their vision. Because of the site’s contentious and high profile status, CP&amp;B’s plans for the Estate are spread across a number of documents spanning from the initial report in 1955 until the final designs for the arts center in 1968, when residents were already moving into other parts of the Barbican. During this time, the project became increasingly contentious within and outside the Corporation, and the architects were under pressure to produce a project worth the growing costs. While each of the four main proposals present differing ideas for the site, there is a fundamental unity in their concern for creating spaces that would appeal to middle-class urban residents. In crafting their designs, CP&amp;B clearly drew from their architectural modernism, but these artistic decisions were inseparably conflated with the emerging discourse of fashionable, middle-class life in central London. Heathcote suggests that their creation’s continuing resonance with today’s urban “culturati” may be rooted in the architects’ own status as young urban professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144213479320">46</xref></sup> It was exactly this middle-class subset, which included architects, journalists, writers, and publishers, that composed the bulk of the contemporary pioneers in gentrifying North London.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144213479320">47</xref></sup> This connection may help explain the striking similarities between spaces at the Barbican and these other neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Recognizing the Barbican site’s less-than-ideal setting for a residential neighborhood, CP&amp;B sought to compensate by focusing on providing residential amenities in an artificially tranquil setting. This included physical recreation facilities, such as swimming pools and squash courts. However, the architects were careful even in 1955 to emphasize that tenants of the expected class would require “mental recreation” at a certain level as well, including “a concert hall, theatre, or cinema.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144213479320">48</xref></sup> To make these provisions feasible, they suggested incorporating the City day schools into the Estate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144213479320">49</xref></sup> Classes could use sports and arts facilities in the daytime while residents made use of them after work hours. The 1956 plan also suggests that the schools could start providing preschool service for Barbican residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144213479320">50</xref></sup> Cramming these institutions into the site would not be an easy task, especially considering that generous provision of open spaces, such as those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144213479320">Figure 2</xref>, was both a planning requirement and a necessary draw for middle-class households accustomed to the leafy suburbs.</p>

<p>The focus on amenities often came into conflict with the quiet tranquility the architects sought to maintain at the Barbican. The podium design was one means of reinforcing peace and quiet, since it allowed “service traffic at road level to reach its destination without hindering or disturbing the residents.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144213479320">51</xref></sup> Residents could expect their deliveries, maintenance, and even visitors to arrive without upsetting the serene neighborhood landscape. Even the schools were seen as potential threats to this artificial urban pastoral. The architects complained that while the school buildings should be located centrally, “playgrounds are inevitably a rather unsympathetic neighbor to good class residential development.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144213479320">52</xref></sup> They solved this problem by tucking away play fields on the periphery of the Estate, behind shrubbery and concrete barriers, and connecting them to the main buildings via tunnels through the podium. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144213479320">Figure 3</xref> shows how these play areas appear from the podium.</p>

<p>In addition, concerns about peace and quiet led the architects to scrap their original 1955 plans to provide ample pubs and shops within the Barbican. CP&amp;B justified this decision by pointing out that adjacent developments could provide sufficient shopping amenities. They cited the advice of their market consultants, who claimed that “the creation of bustling activity associated with shopping centres is alien to the quiet and sense of seclusion which should be characteristic of a residential neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144213479320">53</xref></sup> This nod to suburban tranquility proved to be a miscalculation since the Estate had hardly opened its doors before residents were complaining about the lack of shopping in the area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144213479320">54</xref></sup> The tension between amenities and tranquility would become a defining aspect of the Barbican’s residential culture.</p>

<sec id="section5-0096144213479320">
<title>Architectural Plans: Interior Space</title>
<p>The architects also paid close attention to the layout and styling of the Estate’s interior spaces. This was crucial since consumer goods and household decorations were becoming an increasingly important mode of expression for members of the new middle class. Traditional bourgeois values saw identity in terms of stable markers such as male career status and family connections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144213479320">55</xref></sup> However, as professional and family roles became more malleable, consumerism emerged as an alternative method of self-assertion, especially among urban gentrifiers. These new urban elites focused less on the durable goods their parents valued and more on products that made a personalized statement. In the words of Jonathan Raban, a writer who studied gentrifiers in 1970s London, buying became “an epigram: a rapid, oblique, witty gesture that transforms an object into an idea by the mere act of acquisition.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144213479320">56</xref></sup> Consumption, particularly in relation to the home, was transformed into an activity that was not only recreational, but also expressive.</p>
<p>However, early gentrifiers had to ensure that the resulting aesthetic was distinctively patrician, reflecting the class status that was still integral to their identity. Moran points out that the most dominant style in gentrified neighborhoods was one of “conspicuous thrift,” where the home exhibited an intentionally stripped-down appearance. He quotes contemporary journalist Nicholas Tomalin, who coined the phrase, as stating that the trend appealed to “the would-be aristocrat, seeking by the appearance of plain living to create the impression of high thinking and anti-vulgarity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144213479320">57</xref></sup> To distinguish themselves from their proletarian neighbors, gentrifiers preferred a flexible modernism that allowed the fullest expression of their own refined tastes.</p>
<p>CP&amp;B clearly understood the aesthetic desires of its middle-class target demographic. As Heathcote points out, the flats at the Barbican convey luxury primarily through a sense of spaciousness rather than visual extravagance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144213479320">58</xref></sup> Their interior decorations and layouts were intentionally flexible and modern; walls were left unpainted, and many surfaces had a rough and unfinished look. In contrast, the convention in social housing was to provide decorated homes ready for habitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144213479320">59</xref></sup> The Barbican’s interior style was hence a nod to the minimal aesthetic of modernism, but it also spoke to the new middle class’s need for consumerist self-expression. Indeed, individuality had to be emphasized to set the Estate apart from the prescribed monotony of subsidized housing projects. The architects justify providing unfinished flats by claiming that residents will want “elegant surroundings decorated in an individual manner to personal taste.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144213479320">60</xref></sup> The terms “personal” and “individual” highlight the way that residents were expected, like Raban’s North London gentrifiers, to put their identities on display.</p>
<p>This concern for self-expression extended to the individual family members within each flat as well. In contrast to social housing schemes, which often tried to engineer a sense of family togetherness through shared household space, the Barbican designs purposefully gave family members their own private areas for leisure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144213479320">61</xref></sup> CP&amp;B stated that “bedrooms should be designed to be furnishable primarily as sitting rooms in which there is, almost incidentally, a bed. This helps to make it possible for members of a family of different ages and with different tastes to live comfortably with one another.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144213479320">62</xref></sup> Each bedroom was expected to become, in essence, a gentrified home in miniature where personal tastes and habits could be exercised and demonstrated. This was a radical suggestion during the postwar era, when family and domesticity were still treasured.</p>
<p>However, not all parts of the flats resonated with the emerging gentrification lifestyle. The kitchens are a key example of an instance where the architects’ modernist sensibilities trumped other considerations. Rather than being flexible, the kitchen is a single prefabricated design integrated into each flat. The room was envisioned, in the words of the architects, as an “inseparable whole” that would provide for the needs of the modern household in the most efficient manner possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144213479320">63</xref></sup> Their implementation differs greatly from the kitchens in gentrifying neighborhoods, where the “kitchen was the main eating area as well as social hub of the home.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144213479320">64</xref></sup> This role celebrated a growing interest in culinary creativity and experimentation. Moran links this development to a new discourse surrounding women’s work that elevated certain household chores—most notably cooking—above more mundane tasks like cleaning. While cooking continued to be foisted upon women, it was increasingly celebrated as a more creative and expressive endeavor.</p>
<p>The architects acknowledged that “there appears to be a growing interest in better—and greater variety—of cooking which . . . greatly influenced the design of the kitchens in the residential neighborhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144213479320">65</xref></sup> But their approach to the room still treated cooking as an act of labor rather than leisure. While Barbican kitchens, seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144213479320">Figure 4</xref>, implemented a core set of cooking appliances permanently, gentrifiers were interested in using a wide range of task-specific devices that varied according to fashion and technology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144213479320">66</xref></sup> As Heathcote points outs, this continual revision of the kitchen and its tools was fundamentally incompatible with the modernist view of the kitchen “as one problem, which could be solved once for all time.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144213479320">67</xref></sup> According to this view, industrial efficiency could be applied to the kitchen’s timeless, classless, and gendered function. Hence, kitchens in all but the largest Barbican flats were implemented as service areas in the same way as bathrooms—they were not places that needed natural light and ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144213479320">68</xref></sup> While aware of changing middle-class attitudes towards cooking, the architects nevertheless chose a more strictly modernist approach at the Barbican.</p>

<title>Architectural Plans: Creating a Middle-Class Landscape</title>
<p>However, it is the scheme’s exterior spaces that are most striking for the visitor—it is here that the Estate’s curious blend of modernist design and middle-class comforts is most apparent and complex. CP&amp;B faced the challenge of making the neighborhood distinctly affluent while avoiding the suburban feel that would scare off the new, “urban-seeking” middle class they were targeting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144213479320">69</xref></sup> As early as 1955, they informed the Corporation that “the proposed development, being actually within the square mile of the City, should be urban in character although residential, and should at all costs avoid the appearance or the suggestion of suburban development which would be so inappropriate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144213479320">70</xref></sup> They acknowledged the challenge of providing the ample open spaces expected by planning regulations without resorting to suburban “open planning.” Their solution was to enclose public spaces with tall buildings, ensuring a “definitive formality” typical of London parks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144213479320">71</xref></sup> This increasing focus on urban formality was at odds with the prevailing, suburban view of middle-class tastes, but meshed with the gentrification discourse as well as Corporation officials desirous of a stately showpiece.</p>
<p>References to suburban environments still abound at the Barbican. While high densities make true suburban seclusion impossible for residents, the Estate’s perplexing access routes and secluded resident-only lawns attempt to artificially create country privacy in the heart of London. The architects even acknowledge this tension between urban and suburban in their plans, stating their goal as “the creation of a garden city which is, at the same time, truly urban.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144213479320">72</xref></sup> Gentrifiers had similar ambivalent feelings toward the suburbs—while they wanted to escape the constricting stability of their parents’ generation, they also sought to create urban facsimiles of comfortable and nostalgic suburban spaces.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144213479320">73</xref></sup> Demarcating these “urban villages” was a strategy for differentiating themselves from the urban masses both at the Barbican and in gentrifying neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Whereas gentrifiers were concerned with avoiding the appearance of living in a slum, CP&amp;B focused on distinguishing the Barbican’s spaces from subsidized, social housing projects, which shared the Estate’s modernist styling. The architects were aware of the visual monotony that often plagued the smooth geometries of modern architecture. In response, they arranged the Barbican’s numerous “terraces, paths, and elevated walkways” in a “consciously complex way in order to provide a number of devious routes through the site along which people may walk without feeling like they are treading the same path too often.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144213479320">74</xref></sup> These circuitous routes sought to replicate “one of the charms of the City with its many pedestrian alleys.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144213479320">75</xref></sup> Interestingly, the Corporation’s own modernist planners were eagerly bulldozing many of these medieval alleys to make way for wider streets and taller buildings.</p>
<p>Indeed, as municipal authorities tore down aging districts and buildings in London, these forms only became more popular with the new urban elites. Conservation was a popular cause among gentrifiers, and this is reflected in the areas they chose to colonize. Moran points to the “squares and crescents of Islington and Camden” as nodes for gentrification. Their desirability was linked to the urge to both possess and selectively rehabilitate their architectural characters.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144213479320">76</xref></sup> Squares provided gentrifiers a firm spatial anchor that, while seen as culturally malleable like most of working-class North London, was also clearly distinctive and reassuringly patrician.</p>
<p>The Barbican borrows these connotations for its own spaces, which, while certainly modern in layout and aesthetic, make direct references to the forms and nomenclature of London’s urban past. In some parts of the Barbican, this meant the wholesale incorporation of older buildings into the scheme. The medieval Church of St. Giles at Cripplegate, for instance, was one of a handful of buildings on the site to survive the Blitz, and was always earmarked for preservation. At the Barbican, it is respectfully enshrined along the Estate’s central lake and plaza. Earlier CP&amp;B proposals display an even stronger conservationist streak that, while out of harmony with the pragmatic Corporation, is certainly similar to the attitudes of North London gentrifiers. Their 1955 plan included a restored Temple Bar, the historic gate designed by Christopher Wren that once marked the Western entrance to the City.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144213479320">77</xref></sup> The architects claimed the monument “could serve as a formal approach to the proposed residential estate . . . adding a certain ‘cachet’ to the whole enterprise.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144213479320">78</xref></sup> The 1956 revision dropped this suggestion; Heathcote suggests that a conspicuous entrance seemed inappropriate as the site layout became more exclusive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144213479320">79</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the Temple Bar proposal is a clear example of the architects’ attempts to infuse the Barbican with a sense of pastness and the City’s historical prestige.</p>
<p>In comparison to the universally regarded Temple Bar, the architects’ next attempt at conservation was more daring and reveals the taste divide between the conservative City and the new urban elites. The 1959 plan for the Barbican suggests moving the rotunda of the Victorian-era Coal Exchange, which was to be demolished as part of a road-widening scheme, to serve the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144213479320">80</xref></sup> Unlike the Temple Bar, the Coal Exchange’s merits as architecture were debatable. Its intricate styling bordered on pastiche—architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner calls it “immensely elaborate and crushingly tasteless.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0096144213479320">81</xref></sup> The Corporation shared this opinion, and it refused plans to save the building at the Barbican. Wilkins brushed the Coal Exchange off “as an unremarkable piece of Victorian commercial architecture unworthy of preservation.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0096144213479320">82</xref></sup> In contrast to the Corporation, the architects’ focus on conservation reflects their own contact with gentrification and an understanding of the expectations of potential middle-class tenants.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the most important symbols of history at the Barbican are subtler because they are incorporated into the layout of the Estate itself. The podium design is a conscious nod to traditional precedents in Venice and more locally in London’s Carlton House Terrace and Adelphi apartment district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0096144213479320">83</xref></sup> The architects portray the walkway system not so much as a modern innovation but rather the rediscovery and improvement of a centuries-old method for creating pleasant, patrician space. Similarly, the Barbican’s formal plazas are an intentional reference to “some of the familiar London squares.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0096144213479320">84</xref></sup> For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0096144213479320">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0096144213479320">6</xref> show Frobisher Crescent at the Barbican along with prestigious Park Crescent near Regent’s Park. Other parts of the Estate were given traditional names derived from historic residents of the City and Barbican, such as Ben Jonson House, Bryer Court, and Brandon Mews.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0096144213479320">85</xref></sup> Thus, the Barbican offered residents the unimpeachable historicity of the City of London while not intruding on their ability to project their own identities and meanings onto these spaces. This is very similar to how, in the later second and third waves of gentrification, developers tried to create a “gentrification aesthetic” in new buildings that aped the authenticity of renovation while giving homebuyers the flexibility that comes with a new residence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0096144213479320">86</xref></sup></p>

<p>This fetishization of the urban past coincided with ambivalence concerning the urban present, both in gentrifying neighborhoods and at the Barbican. Faced with the enormity and anonymity of the modern city, gentrifiers sought to “build a local community within the global city that maps onto their particular set of values”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0096144213479320">87</xref></sup> Gentrified neighborhoods carved out an “urban village” that partially echoed the “reassuringly predictable” community of the village or suburb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0096144213479320">88</xref></sup> Gentrifiers readily marked these class boundaries through changes to neighborhoods spaces.</p>
<p>Moran highlights the case of the Barnsbury Association in Islington, which successfully lobbied the local council to “pay for tree-planting, restoring cast-iron streetlamps and railings, and granite setts [archaic paving stones] to give the road a cobblestone look.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0096144213479320">89</xref></sup> Although not quite the Temple Bar, these conspicuous improvements were a declaration of middle-class presence and a comforting affirmation to the gentrifiers of the area’s distinct identity. The Association went further in 1970 with a one-way traffic scheme that partially closed off roads in gentrified areas, redirecting noisy automobile traffic through “streets full of working class tenement blocks.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0096144213479320">90</xref></sup> Gentrifiers valued their urban location but simultaneously wanted to keep the city and its perceived otherness at arm’s length.</p>
<p>If these spatial changes in traditional gentrified neighborhoods were subtle nudges about the areas’ class character or exclusivity, the Barbican’s statements were far more blunt. Indeed, the word “barbican” means “an outer fortification or defense to a city or castle,” and the area takes its name from a historic fortress along the City wall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0096144213479320">91</xref></sup> With its imposing high walls and density of structures on its periphery, the current Estate makes good on its namesake. Despite his earlier association with the Brutalist style that Barbican also adopts, architecture critic Reyner Banham sums up the effect of this almost militaristic feel, stating that “it only has four [entry] points at which, according to the current unfunny joke, the colonels will have to set up machinegun posts to keep out the mob after the Social Contract is rescinded.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0096144213479320">92</xref></sup> There is certainly an inside–outside effect at the Barbican; residents and others with insider knowledge can take advantage of the Estate as a pleasant shortcut or place for relaxation. Outsiders are given few clues that there is a pedestrian oasis floating a few feet above their heads.</p>
<p>Part of this impenetrability is due to the nature of the podium. At the time the Barbican was designed and constructed, the City had plans to develop an elevated walkway system across the entire square mile. New buildings were required to have two entrances and lobbies—one on the ground floor and another on the first floor to connect to the “highwalks.” While the rise of the conservation movement doomed this enterprise, a more complete system would have made the Barbican far more accessible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0096144213479320">93</xref></sup> Also, in emphasizing winding scenic paths around the Barbican, the architects furthered the Estate’s exclusivity by creating unnecessary complexity. This confusing layout is especially problematic because the Barbican Arts Centre, one of London’s major centers for theater and music, is located on the podium.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0096144213479320">94</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section7-0096144213479320">
<title>Residential Culture at the Barbican</title>
<p>While the architects strived to consider middle-class lifestyles in their comprehensive design for the neighborhood, the Estate’s eventual residents did not hesitate to revise and reinterpret this vision to fit their own needs. The first residents moved into Speed House in 1968 even though the last of the scheme’s two thousand flats were not finished until 1976 and construction continued on the Arts Centre until 1982. Not content to merely accept the Estate as provided by the Corporation, residents asserted their own role in the project of crafting the Barbican as a “genuine residential community.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0096144213479320">95</xref></sup> This meant reshaping its amenities, aesthetics, and politics to fit their own ideas about residential space and lifestyles while also preserving the unique modernist character that gave meaning and prestige to the act of living in the Barbican. It also sparked a transformation of the City, which had long been a pragmatic site of bourgeois business exchanges, into a site for middle-class domesticity as well. Like the first wave of gentrifiers in North London, residents strived to cultivate a sense of neighborhood authenticity even as they altered existing local spaces.</p>
<p>This study looks at the residential culture until 1982, just after national reforms to state-owned housing policy allowed the Estate’s flats to be bought outright rather than rented on short leases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0096144213479320">96</xref></sup> Interviewed residents agreed that this marked a drastic change in the Barbican community. Just as the original gentrifiers of Barnsbury, in North London, saw incoming second- and third-wave newcomers as less invested in the neighborhood, long-time Barbican dwellers were quick to point out in interviews that the buying and subletting of flats brought a less community-oriented population to the Estate in the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0096144213479320">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Barbican Association, formed in 1970, was the main formal outlet for residential activism and culture. A voluntary, fee-based organization, its membership varied but generally held above 50 percent participation until the flat ownership scheme began. The Association worked both to advocate for resident concerns as well as sponsor social activities to “encourage good neighborliness.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0096144213479320">98</xref></sup> Interviewees indicated that younger tenants were less involved with the organization, and it naturally would be most attractive to residents with sufficient time and interest. But, as was and remains typical for many voluntary residential associations, the Association established itself as the voice for the entire residential community, especially in matters involving the Corporation. Its newsletters highlight its role in shaping social and physical changes to the Barbican, and the loose, submission-based nature of the early publications offers a useful if skewed window into the efforts of different residents to assert and contest a vision of middle-class residential space in the heart of the city.</p>
<p>The first issue of the <italic>Barbican Association Newsletter</italic> describes the plans for a clubhouse with a bar in an empty flat tendered by the Corporation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0096144213479320">99</xref></sup> Great effort was made to provide a forum where residents could network over shared hobbies such as bridge and classical music, reflecting Tim Butler’s assertion that gentrified neighborhoods sought to carve out “communities of interest” within the generally impersonal city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0096144213479320">100</xref></sup> As one interviewee pointed out, residents at the time were socially active around the Estate, whether through the Association or, as was the case with many younger tenants, at the local pubs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0096144213479320">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>Residents were conscious and proud of the Estate’s history and their own role in, as one resident put it, “this great experiment to create a living, residential community in the heart of the City of London.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0096144213479320">102</xref></sup> Just as pioneer gentrifiers were drawn to the perceived edginess of working-class Islington, Barbican tenants were self-conscious of the Estate and eager to portray themselves as partners in an exciting and grandiose urban project. In 1972, a presentation at the clubhouse called “The Barbican Concept: Is it doomed to failure?” attracted a standing-room-only crowd.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0096144213479320">103</xref></sup> Similarly, the newsletter advocated attending two short films about the Estate’s planning, with the editor stating that “they are, whatever your present view of the Barbican development, of enormous historic interest.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0096144213479320">104</xref></sup> Residents were also constantly concerned that the Corporation had abandoned the shared ideal of a residential neighborhood, and often framed their criticisms in these terms.</p>
<p>Indeed, residents were not the City loyalists the Corporation had originally envisioned. As interviewees—none of whom worked in the Square Mile—and various newsletter contributors asserted, the Barbican was not a community of City bank workers. Rather than revel in the grandeur and generosity of the Corporation, residents preferred to selectively appropriate the idea of the City as part of their own neighborhood identity. For instance, Barbican tenants were keen to preserve admired City institutions such as St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and the annual Lord Mayor’s Show. But news about the square mile and its business community was rarely on the radar in the Association Newsletter. More common were fears about the Corporation leasing Barbican flats to banks and other companies. Residents were also reluctant to use City recreation facilities at the neighboring subsidized Golden Lane Estate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-0096144213479320">105</xref></sup> The Barbican’s vision and its historical context in the City became a mark of uniqueness similar to what gentrifiers sought to emphasize in their own squares and crescents.</p>
<p>This appropriation of the City’s past is most evident in the local conservation effort that sprang from the Barbican. The same preservationist values that fueled both contemporary gentrifiers and the Estate’s architects resonated with residents as well. In 1972, a tenant wrote to the newsletter seeking other people who might be interested in forming a conservation group to save the increasingly threatened prewar buildings in the City. As Corporation residents, he said, Barbican dwellers will “only have themselves to blame if the Lord Mayor really does persuade authorities to dismantle historic City churches and convert the sites into anonymous office blocks.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-0096144213479320">106</xref></sup> As a direct result, a club formed under the Association called the “Barbican Association Conservation Group,” with the goal of saving “the few beautiful old corners of the City left.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-0096144213479320">107</xref></sup> Quaint beauty and historicism could be used as a means through which select residents could assert their ideas about neighborhood aesthetics on a formerly pragmatic business district. By 1976, the newsletter described the conservation club as the “most active group at Barbican,” and its influence with the City’s planners grew.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-0096144213479320">108</xref></sup> As planning historian Michael Hebbert acknowledges, these Barbican residents were key in pressuring the City into enacting conservation legislation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0096144213479320">109</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hebbert points out that it was the conservation of these older buildings that wrecked the City’s dream of expanding the highwalk system across the square mile. This left the podium and its handful of connecting walkways stranded and increasingly empty above the newly appreciated medieval alleys and streets. This outcome is ironic considering that Barbican residents continued to lobby for expanded highwalk connections, apparently unaware that the Association’s own efforts were making them increasingly impractical. The modernist podium was a convenience to take pride in, but its expansion would not come at the expense of the other aspects that gave the City, and hence the Estate and its residents, its own character.</p>

<title>Residential Culture: Amenities versus Tranquility</title>
<p>The tension between tranquility and amenities, which also featured in the changing architectural designs, was a constant theme in the Barbican’s early occupation. Despite the architects’ desire to provide for both physical and mental recreation, residents found the final implementation of the Estate lacking in leisure facilities. In 1972, the Association complained when the Corporation decided to start charging rent for the clubhouse flat. The editor rejected the Corporation’s claim that the flat was a “subsidy of us rich stockbrokers (if only we were!).” He instead pointed out that the free clubhouse hardly made up for “the staggering absence of any other social amenities provided on the Estate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0096144213479320">110</xref></sup> Implicit in this argument was the constant refrain that the Association had to push against the Corporation to achieve the Barbican’s original vision—and residents’ reinterpretations—of a vibrant residential community. For instance, residents themselves had to negotiate with the Girls’ School about sharing sports facilities, and pressured the City into not closing Cripplegate Library before it moved into the Arts Centre in 1982.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-0096144213479320">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>Residents were also concerned about ensuring that shops and commercial amenities were provided on the Estate. During the Barbican’s earliest years, many tenants were quick to highlight the glaring lack of any laundry facilities. One angry Association member bemoaned that “the Corporation seem to want people here as long as they don’t live. What sort of planners chose tiny kitchens not plumbed for washing machines and don’t supply a ‘wash shop’?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0096144213479320">112</xref></sup> Two interviewees stated that for many years they commuted to Bloomsbury or Russell Square for laundry facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0096144213479320">113</xref></sup> While a launderette was eventually provided, shops that the architects envisioned opening on the periphery of the Estate’s podium were slow to materialize. The Association tried to encourage patronage of the shops that did open, including the “courageous chemist” that opened on “one of the empty sites on St. Alphage’s Walk.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-0096144213479320">114</xref></sup> But as late as 1978, the Association Chairman highlighted the “lack of good shopping facilities” as one of the primary obstacles to achieving a true “community within the City” at the Barbican.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0096144213479320">115</xref></sup> The boosters in the newsletter dreamt of a self-sufficient urban village, but residents and visitors readily forewent the quaint, isolated storefronts for the lures of the surrounding metropolis. This failure in some way vindicates the architects, who understood the new middle-class focus on leisure and consumption and originally envisioned an Estate with a central shopping area and plenty of recreational facilities.</p>
<p>The architects were less prescient in their provision for children and families at the Barbican. The 1959 designs included larger flats that could accommodate families, and CP&amp;B had mused over ways that the City of London School for Girls could also serve residents. But as tenants moved in, they complained that the Estate was not suitable for their children. Most glaringly, there was no community playground or indoor site for youth meetings. Although certain residents questioned in the newsletter whether the Barbican could be made child-safe, others were clearly determined to make it habitable for children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0096144213479320">116</xref></sup> Concerned tenants created the Barbican Playgroup, which worked to secure indoor and outdoor play areas such as the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0096144213479320">Figure 8</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0096144213479320">117</xref></sup> This echoes Butler and Robson’s finding that gentrifiers sought to remake parts of the inner city into a place where the correct social and cultural values could be passed on to the next generation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0096144213479320">118</xref></sup> For residents, accommodating children was another way to express their own interpretation of the Barbican’s residential vision.</p>

<p>Despite this craving for amenities, residents jealously guarded the tranquility the architects had built into the Barbican. For instance, one tenant wrote to the Newsletter in 1972 deriding fellow residents for demanding more amenities from the Corporation. She stated that residents were promised a residential community, not “a swimming pool or a discoteque [sic] nor a nightclub with dancing.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-0096144213479320">119</xref></sup> And pubs frequented by young adults living in the Barbican, such as the Crowders Well, received complaints about noise at night in the same breath as demands for longer opening hours.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0096144213479320">120</xref></sup> Even the actions of Barbican children became contentious, as demonstrated by a heated exchange in the newsletter about children playing ball games on the resident-only lawns. One resident chastised the editor for complaining about the noisy practice, stating that “Barbican was intended to be a living, thriving community and, believe it or not, you need children to achieve this environment.” Different residents had different ideas of what constituted a residential neighborhood and couched their preferences in rhetoric about the “original” vision of the neighborhood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0096144213479320">
<title>Residential Culture: Softening the Barbican’s Modernism</title>
<p>Barbican tenants also sought to transform the aesthetic appearance of their neighborhood. Despite CP&amp;B’s attempts to signal the Barbican’s status as middle-class space, residents were conscious of its aesthetic similarity to deteriorating high-rise social housing. The Association constantly called on the Corporation to clean Estate infrastructure and remove graffiti.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0096144213479320">121</xref></sup> One resident fretted about the deterioration seen in “many estates of council flats. But surely you may think, this could never happen to the Barbican because the type of tenant possesses too much pride, discernment, and initiative to permit it.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0096144213479320">122</xref></sup> Such sentiments implied that without a keen eye on the conditions and users at the Barbican, the enterprise could begin to look worryingly like the neglected blocks of subsidized housing that were gaining notoriety as sites of crime and poverty. The social housing project was characterized as the alternate path that the Barbican could take if tenants and landlords did not pursue the vaunted residential dream “with consistency and strength.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0096144213479320">123</xref></sup> Class space had to be both asserted and defended.</p>
<p>Residents sought to avoid this fate by accentuating the middle-class features of the Estate. The Association paid great attention to lighting schemes on the podium, highlighting places where there was insufficient lighting and those where, perhaps more worryingly, it was too bright and institutional.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-0096144213479320">124</xref></sup> Periodic attempts were also made to enforce the requirement that linens and clothing not be dried in plain sight on balconies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0096144213479320">125</xref></sup> One notable strategy was using plantings and horticulture to counteract the “windswept” landscapes that had become a byword for the Barbican’s uncomfortable similarity to social housing. As early as 1971, the Estate Office agreed to allow residents to participate in bulk buying of specially made window boxes for balconies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0096144213479320">126</xref></sup> Window boxes became a way for residents to gentrify the appearance of the Estate while also demonstrating their own creativity, and the Association even sponsored window box competitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0096144213479320">127</xref></sup> This effort to green the Barbican eventually extended to public spaces as well. Through the Barbican Horticultural Society, residents volunteered to maintain planter tubs around the Estate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0096144213479320">128</xref></sup> As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0096144213479320">Figure 9</xref>, this system continues today. Just as North London gentrifiers marked their presence through distinctive neighborhood infrastructure, Barbican residents used greenery as a public expression of their interpretation of the project’s residential vision.</p>

<p>Hence, residents balanced two approaches at the Barbican. While they sought to soften its architectural starkness and create amenities and aesthetics more resonant with their own tastes, tenants strongly valued the Estate’s uniqueness. Its harsh aesthetic, confusing layout, and political contentiousness were seen as bits of local flavor. If, like Islington’s dingy and crowded streets, they could be domesticated, these obstacles to middle class inhabitance could be turned into positive assets that reflected the identities of the occupants as well as the place itself.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The variety of ways that middle-class presence was asserted at the Barbican helps clarify what gentrification means in the historical context. Since new-build projects such as the Barbican do not usually involve direct displacement of existing residents, geographers have debated whether these can be considered gentrification at all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-0096144213479320">129</xref></sup> However, it is clear that the Estate’s architects and residents were entangled in the same cultural discourse as the first wave gentrifiers in North London. The effect, whether in Islington or the City, was the declaration and demarcation of middle-class domestic space, taste, and exclusivity. Although no working-class tenants were directly displaced, the Barbican allowed the middle class to reconfigure a large area of central London for social occupation and reproduction. The ability of its residents to rapidly assert their political and cultural influence even in the ossified City reflects the power of the new urban elites to drastically change the character of an area.</p>
<p>Placing the Barbican into the existing discourse on gentrification also helps historicize this force of urban change. While later “new build” developments presented an urban lifestyle that residents quietly accepted, the Barbican demonstrates how ideas about elite urban living were still being tested and constructed in the middle of the twentieth century. CP&amp;B created their own conception of middle-class space based on their modernist convictions and the Corporation’s mandate. And although the eventual product was somewhat out of sync with residential expectations, the Estate’s activist middle-class community readily adapted. They reinterpreted the original vision for the Estate in a way that accommodated new tastes while broadcasting reverence for an idealized, “authentic” Barbican.</p>
<p>By the time Queen Elizabeth II opened the Arts Centre in 1982 and brought the Barbican’s long planning and construction to a close, the Corporation had little reason to celebrate. The project was enormously over budget and long-delayed. In addition, labor disputes, residential complaints, and internal discord about the scheme’s merits had caused a maelstrom of bad press for the City. However, by patronizing the Barbican, the Corporation had loudly proved an important point: that sufficient economic capital could attract the middle classes back to the inner city. Further, it demonstrated that the new urban elite did not have to be accommodated in low-rise townhomes or quasi-historic squares, as was the case in gentrifying North London. At the Barbican, they were proud to live in imposing towers not unlike the concrete monoliths that housed some of London’s poorest residents. This set the stage for gentrification’s transformation into a hallmark of government policy and a boon for private developers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0096144213479320">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the coming decades, new buildings catering to increasingly wealthy residents would transform central London and especially the square mile. Even the Barbican itself was not immune from these later waves of gentrification. In 2008, Milton Court, a peripheral part of the Estate, was demolished to make way for “The Heron,” a thirty-six-story tower offering what the developers call “effortless living in the heart of the City.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0096144213479320">131</xref></sup> Developments such as the Heron now offer a processed and packaged version of gentrified space—it is a far cry from the ambiguity and revision that characterized the Barbican project.</p>
<p>Rather than a monolithic market force, gentrification at the time was a flexible and diffuse set of norms, expectations, and tastes. Its manifestation was most obvious in the renovated rowhouses of North London, but it also deeply influenced the Barbican, a government urban project conceived at the height of Britain’s welfare state and built in the modernist style of that social moment. This understanding of gentrification suggests the need for a wider historical and spatial understanding of the phenomenon and the ways it has affected and continues to affect the urban built environment.</p>

<p>Middle class” is a difficult term to define precisely, especially in the British context. While the Corporation uses the term “high class” to refer to expected Barbican tenants, the Estate’s eventual residents were not the “bourgeois,” stability-minded office workers it envisioned. The middle class examined by this paper were instead an emerging set of professionals who valued city living. We will see that they were concerned with expressing their status as cultural “elites” and projecting an understated yet distinctive aura of consumerist affluence.
