<p>Ethical thinking is an essential area of inquiry as we are inherently equipped with the ability to catechize, elucidate, and detangle dilemmas. <italic>Ethics in Action: Making Ethical Decisions in Your Daily Life</italic>, by Jane Ann McLachlan, identifies with the frequency of ethical quandaries that bombard us regularly, and works to fuse the theoretical and practical dimensions involved in facing these issues.</p>
<p>Within a democratic society, the role of the media is to act as ambassadors and provide the public with information and knowledge that is truthful. However, the obstacles and temptations that can impede a media practitioner’s ability to practice in a sound manner can be seemingly overwhelming. Today, the world of communication and technology provides us with an endless supply of apparatuses that facilitate the dissemination of messages, making it increasingly important to ensure the validity and accuracy of information used by journalists and practitioners who hope to gain and uphold credibility and respect within the industry. <italic>Living Ethics: Across Media Platforms</italic>, by Michael Bugeja, provides the reader with information on how to deal with ethical dilemmas within media and across media industries. This book teaches the <italic>how to</italic> of ethics using numerous examples to enhance the learning process and engage the reader in the contextual meaning of each concept.</p>
<p>Our relationship with the media has changed profoundly in recent years due to technological advancements with regards to communication devices, and as these changes occur within the media landscape and the interactional pattern between audiences and media is transformed, it becomes increasingly important to consider the ethics of these situations. <italic>Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning</italic>, by Clifford G Christians, Mark Fackler, Kathy Brittain Richardson, Peggy J Kreshel, and Robert H Woods, looks into many practical issues involved in contemporary media ethics, through an exploration of four main categories: news, advertising, public relations, and entertainment. Though designed as a textbook best suited for undergraduate university students, this book can also be used as a reference point for those within the media industry looking to refine their knowledge and skills, and enhance their moral sensitivity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1461444812473946">
<title>Making ethical decisions</title>
<p>McLachlan’s <italic>Ethics in Action</italic> utilizes diverse pedagogical methods to educate, illuminate, and instill the lessons of the text through basic readings, supplementary readings and excerpts, and interactive worksheets and questions designed to stimulate the reader.</p>
<p>The first section of this book introduces various ethical theories and perspectives. The author emphasizes that reflection is an extremely important element of ethical philosophy and decision-making due to its ability to allow for the inundation of ideas and thoughts that can easily be forgotten; it is therefore intertwined into the theory descriptions, examples, and worksheets. The author’s use of examples is a definitive element of this book. For instance, when pursuing the exploration of feminism in relation to ethics, McLachlan underscores the importance of human relationships from a female ethical perspective by providing an example of women’s dedication to this aspect of life. McLachlan notes that “[s]tudies prove that even when wives and husbands both work full time, the majority of household chores and childcare responsibilities are still borne by women” (p. 115). In this section, the author extrapolates on examples of inequalities, and how they are reflected in the majority of ethical systems created by men. She goes on to claim that religion and ethics are intertwined. McLachlan includes an insightful and comprehensive discussion of religion, citing it as an extremely important part of many people’s lives; thus, it is considered highly valuable in the discussion of ethics.</p>
<p>New ethical issues and conundrums continue to emerge, so McLachlan dedicates a substantial segment to discussing the importance of logical reasoning in debates, as well as learning how to apply valid arguments based on accepted ethical principles. Through the process of critical thinking and the organization of our thoughts and emotions, it is possible to develop perspectives on situations in a sound and moral way. In this section, the author provides advice on how to form personal ideas regarding any issue, and how to develop persuasive and convincing arguments.</p>
<p>McLachlan then moves on to provide detailed descriptions of many important ethical issues in Canadian society. She explores controversial issues such as abortion, stem cell research, and animal rights. The author’s ability to describe the issues in great detail from many perspectives is very insightful. While she delves into the intrinsic “gut-wrenching” capabilities of these issues, she does so in an unbiased, yet concise manner. McLachlan’s discussion on euthanasia and patient-assisted suicide is particularly interesting. Following a summary of these two ethical problems, she describes in detail the highly debated case of Sue Rodrigues, a Canadian woman who was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which is a tragic terminal condition that involves an extremely painful decline in health and control over the body. Rodrigues did not want herself or her family to suffer through the painful decline of her health, and so pleaded for physician-assisted suicide but was denied in the Supreme Court. However, she died in her home with the help of a physician who has never been named.</p>
<p>Ethical issues concerning globalization and worldly issues are then discussed as McLachlan offers debate on issues that impact Canadians such as global inequality, war, terrorism, and environmental issues. McLachlan’s dialogue on the environment is of particular value because it highlights the complexity of global ethical dilemmas. Environmental ethics are complicated by the different perspectives involved, the different stakeholders (businesses, governments, individuals), and the difficulty in forming an opinion because of the scientific knowledge involved. Environmentalism epitomizes the definition of a “global issue”, as this particular situation has the ability to impact everyone. Without ethical reasoning based on meticulous thinking, we run the risk of facing irreversible damage to humankind.</p>
<p>The final section of this book discusses the importance of developing an ethical lifestyle, considering the influence of laws and culture on our ethical decisions, and the knowledge and tools needed to develop a sound code of ethics. McLachlan’s discussion of the benefits of creating and implementing a personal code of ethics, however, stands out. The formalization of codes in organizational, governmental, and business settings are important due to their ability to guide standardized operations. However, the development of a personal code of ethics is an essential element in the conduct of sound judgement, and is facilitated by reflection on one’s life experiences and values, and influenced by family, friends, and culture. Of these, family is considered the most important, as the most pivotal knowledge gained by our familial inheritances speaks volumes to our ability to absorb information on morals and values. Our first lessons are learned, our first conflicts played out, and our first opinions are formed with parents and siblings. However, as our minds grow and our interactions span beyond the familial existence, we often find ourselves relating to peers and other strands of authority in our lives. This process highlights the fluid nature of our learning experience with ethics.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, the author prepares the reader for her final discussion on making sound ethical decisions, which she argues is a lifelong commitment to reflection and moral dedication. This discussion serves as a strong concluding section dedicated to the actual process of discernment. McLachlan encourages the reader to test their own boundaries and experiment with situations, emphasizing the advantages and importance of embarking on ethical journeys while learning from mistakes. The author’s approach accepts the subjective nature of the human existence, and notes that standardized codes of ethics are not always feasible. To clarify the nature of ethical decision-making, McLachlan identifies the main types of ethical issues that require discernment, and walks the reader through the various steps needed to face such problems.</p>

<title>Developing communication ethics</title>
<p>Bugeja’s <italic>Living Ethics</italic> begins with an exploration of the factors that influence our personal ethics, asking the reader to look inward to their personal experience. Bugeja discusses how family, culture, experiences, generation, and social mores impact our development. Bugeja provides an exclusive and comprehensive look at the ways in which generational aspects have an impact on our understanding of the world, as communication is mediated through very different tools from one generation to the next. Many political figures are discussed in relation to how they shaped communication standards; however, the exploration of the influence of Rosa Parks is of particular interest. The author proves to the reader that Parks displayed strong values such as strength and determination, and her actions exhibited the importance of equality, tolerance, and access that continue to resonate in today’s ethical standards. Her strength and willingness to fight for her rights through a non-violent protest speaks volumes to her dignity and integrity as a strong, determined woman.</p>
<p>Truth is a prominent value whose modern manifestation has been heavily influenced by history. Throughout <italic>Living Ethics</italic>, the author exalts the importance of honesty and transparency within the media business. Whether in advertising, press releases, or local newscasts, customers and audiences demand the truth. However, truth is an ambiguous value; although some ethical theories preach the standardization of all actions to ensure equality, others believe in relativity or situational factors. This book attempts to teach the reader how to tackle issues of truth when working within the media industry, and ways to face ethical dilemmas that arise when truth has been sacrificed. Bugeja provides compelling examples of deception in the industry, illuminating the importance of truth issues and their impact on respect for and the integrity and credibility of media professionals and organizations.</p>
<p>An important topic Bugeja adds to his discussion of truth is that of temptations. For him, temptations are relative; what one may find painfully alluring may deter someone else. Therefore, temptation, like truth, is a relative concept. However, the author clarifies the term by explaining it as a form of enticement that guides a person to abandon or alter their personal values and morals. The nature of the internet and new communication devices, such as the cell phone, have created a communicative climate that has the ability to provide infinite information and foster instantaneous interaction, often sparking impulsive behavior. Bugeja shows that with deadlines and stressful time crunches that are typical of the competitive field of journalism, it can be tempting to resort to the internet for quick information and material that will aid in the completion of a project. However, some users can abuse the use of this technology, plagiarizing content and being deceptive about sources. The author urges media practitioners to avoid completely the temptations that are presented in this context, and argues that it is the media professional’s duty to behave ethically due to their democratic role in society in order to uphold their integrity.</p>
<p>The issue of bias is another interesting discussion in <italic>Living Ethics</italic>, which touches on ideas of racism, stereotyping, and gender inequality in media industries. The author places a great emphasis on bias in the context of journalism, as news media practitioners shape societal norms and values in society and often have the ability to mobilize opinions. Thus, when practitioners fail to provide accurate information, those who are wrongfully depicted can suffer serious consequences. Bugeja exemplifies this through a comprehensive discussion of negative impacts of stereotyping. Bias, through false representation, degrades and reduces human beings to the simplified portraits depicted by the media. Interestingly, the author notes that bias most often occurs as a result of a lack of diversity. To combat these inequalities, Bugeja advocates working towards a diversified industry that praises people of all backgrounds. It is suggested that media practitioners and journalists strive to act as holistic public representatives who embrace the common good, and value community strength and equality.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of the author’s discussion of media ethics is his inquiry into who has more power—corporations or the media? This complex quandary is illuminated through a modern example. While Wal-Mart executives have the ability to select what products are available to the public, the media have the ability to report and share ideas and messages on these products to the public. For example, if a person is harmed by a particular product sold by Wal-Mart, local news may choose to report on this and advise people to avoid purchasing this product. Due to the power of news media, it is very likely that the public may choose not to invest in a product that a reputable news organization advises against. In this debate, it becomes apparent that the media hold an outstanding amount of persuasive power. However, Bugeja advises that power can be a challenging entity to balance. Power is described as a highly intimate element of our personal character, shaped by our ability to exude and gain respect.</p>

<title>Understanding media ethics</title>
<p>In <italic>Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning</italic>, Christians, Fackler, Richardson, Kreshel, and Woods first introduce the “Potter Box” as a theoretical framework for engaging in ethical discernment and moral analysis regarding the aforementioned main categories of analysis. The authors suggest that the framework be seen as an organic whole rather than merely a set of isolated questions, which makes it possible for the reader to understand and link ethical issues within the context of complex media industries. With this highly useful yet simple guidance tool, the authors argue that the reader will be better equipped to articulate and evaluate standards of decision-making and moral reasoning.</p>
<p>The involvement of corporate initiatives in the media is a common theme woven throughout <italic>Media Ethics</italic>. In their discussion of moral reasoning in complex media industries, the authors first focus on the role of the news media. By using democratic theory, they argue that news media play a crucial yet contentious role in the creation of societal understanding, because they question whether they can operate fully isolated from corporate initiatives. The authors emphasize the decision-making environment of the news media as a particularly salient issue in the new media landscape. Unique to the news platform are the time pressures associated with perpetually chasing timelines, competition to break the story first, and the immediacy with which society expects the news. This creates a dilemma because sound moral reasoning requires time and reflection, yet reporters face deadlines and rarely enjoy the luxury of time for decision-making in their often ambiguous and stressful circumstances. This dilemma is intensified with the advancements in communication technology, which make the process of newsgathering and breaking stories faster than ever.</p>
<p>Another manner in which corporate initiatives affect the news relates to bias and influence, and creates the potential for news media outlets to adopt, censor, or slant coverage to please advertisers. Predominantly privatized, the news media industry is typically profit-driven, meaning that practitioners are pressured to fulfill the expectations of advertising companies that fund them and upper management that approves their work. Although the authors attempt to provide resolutions for these quandaries, they urge news media practitioners to be aware of these practices and avoid involvement in the overwhelming corporate pressures. This book provides a thorough discussion of the media as a “big business” industry, illuminated by cases and examples that accurately illustrate the ethical issues at hand.</p>
<p>The second section of this book examines the ethical issues involved in contemporary advertising. The authors uniquely and interestingly argue that such issues are no longer external to media and culture, but embedded into the daily practices of these entities as products, emotions, and events, and people now all have the ability to possess a brand status. The authors argue that the increasing infringement of advertising onto private and public places is commoditizing our culture and society such that the lines between genuine and commercial elements continuously become more blurred. Product placement, for example, raises ethical issues relating to truth as it eliminates the clear distinction of advertising initiatives and can be very deceitful in its presentation. Through examples of product placement in the news and entertainment media, the authors argue that it is increasingly important to be aware of the threats that these messages pose to our personal privacy and rights.</p>
<p>The subsequent section in the book discusses public relations. Persuasion, the authors argue, is something that public relations and advertising have in common. However, public relations practitioners focus on developing symbiosis between an organization and the public by liaising between them in order to increase benefits for their clients. This practice requires public relations professionals to shape or “package” messages to best suit the needs of their clients’ initiatives and enhance resonation of their objectives with their target audiences. This process has sparked debate due to the clouded role of truth in this profession resulting in a damaged image of these practitioners in the public eye. The ambiguity of the context involved in the practice of public relations makes it increasingly challenging to understand this ethical quandary. Despite this, the authors present this ethical issue in a neutral manner and provide a variety of examples to better understand this concept.</p>
<p>The final installment of this book focuses on entertainment media. Interestingly, while the other sections of the book dive straight into the ethical dilemmas found in specific media industries, in this section the authors first consider whether or not entertainment is relevant to ethical reasoning because it is typically driven solely by profit incentives and corporate gain. Despite this, the authors argue that social responsibility and accountability are crucial issues requiring ethical reasoning, due to the ever-increasing capacity for the growing entertainment media industry to influence people. Violence is a prevalent and increasing real-world problem that has often been linked to the proliferation of violence in the media. This trend is disturbing; however, the essential ethical issue relates to the social responsibility of entertainment media firms that generate content to engage in self-censorship to decrease unnecessary violent content, because at present, no governmental policy exists to curb the proliferation of such material in mainstream entertainment media.</p>

<title>Reaching contemporary ethics</title>
<p><italic>Ethics in Action: Making Ethical Decisions in Your Daily Life</italic> provides a strong overview of contemporary ethical issues. As privacy debates and cyber crimes continue to cause public anxiety globally, it has become increasingly apparent that the internet, along with many other new technologies, requires ethical attention. This book is beneficial for those hoping to find a basic overview of the practice of ethics in daily life. Metaphorically, this book resembles an ethical thinking toolbox; it provides the reader with the proper items needed to face the world from a sound ethical standpoint, regardless of the situation. One of the book’s greatest strengths is its detailed section dedicated to contemporary ethical issues in Canadian society such as abortion, stem cell research, and gay rights. McLachlan’s multi-angled approach to learning about ethics stimulates all aspects of the learning process, which is an excellent method for engaging and further educating readers. Even more remarkable, McLachlan poses questions in the text, which are positioned and worded in a manner that maximizes the reader’s intellectual involvement in the material. This unique interactive component is undoubtedly one of the greatest strengths of this publication.</p>
<p><italic>Living Ethics</italic> is considered a great practical reference for both students and practitioners looking to enhance their knowledge on communication and media ethics. It focuses on the actual practice of ethics in the professional world of media, while providing strong examples of how such ethical considerations are needed in real-world situations. Perhaps the most alluring element of this book is its uncompromising commitment to truth in the practice of media ethics. Many unique aspects of this book emerge; however, the perspectives used to comment on the influences that impact our moral development are of specific interest. Bugeja’s discussion of historical influences is almost exclusive to this book, and is distinctive and insightful, contributing to our understanding of ethical standards today. Through a well-designed and written structure and its unique and interesting real-world scenarios, <italic>Living Ethics</italic> is an excellent read.</p>
<p><italic>Media Ethics: Cases and Moral Reasoning</italic> is unique in that it provides an overview of theory followed by a heavy focus on a practical perspective dedicated to exploring contemporary ethical dilemmas. Most other books tend to focus on theoretical and philosophical traditions, and are supplemented only by a few practical issues. Another important element of this book is its recognition of the need for truth and authenticity in a media climate often criticized for deception and undue influence. This is based on the role of profit and commercialization as advertising is increasingly becoming embedded into all aspects of the media. When seeking to uphold respect and credibility, truth is perhaps the most important element in any strand of media, and therefore, this book’s close attention to this concept should be seen to be a strength. Lastly, the separation of issues based on media platforms in this book is an excellent method that makes for a well-organized read, as the authors first introduce each platform before delving into particular issues directly relevant to that field. However, a more thorough exploration of ethical theory and philosophy would be beneficial for the betterment of the book. Overall, this book is an important contribution to knowledge, ideally suited for those who are looking for a well-organized, well-synthesized, and practical application of the study of media ethics in contemporary society.</p>
