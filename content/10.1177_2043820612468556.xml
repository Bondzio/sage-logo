(2012), we discuss in this paper the nature of memory and forgetfulness in geography and examine what the implications of active forgetting are for the stories we tell about geography and geographers. We explore the role which fashion plays in directing the course of the discipline and what this means for our engagement with the work of past geographers. Finally, we consider how notions of inheritance and bequest can inform the ways in which we value the texts through which the discipline has defined and represented itself.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anglo-American geography</kwd><kwd>anti-canonical</kwd><kwd>canonical</kwd><kwd>fashion theory</kwd><kwd>forgetting</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>For responses to our paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468556">Keighren et al., 2012</xref>) that are, at turns, provocative, insightful, and impassioned, we should like to thank Robert J Mayhew, Charles WJ Withers, John Agnew, Avril Maddrell, Janice Monk, Phil Hubbard, Richard H Schein, and Richard C Powell. These responses point, albeit in different ways, to the importance of thinking through how geographers engage with (or, indeed, ignore) texts that at various times have defined their field, and the value of debating what the implications are of the related processes of veneration and castigation for the ways in which we imagine and narrate our discipline. In addressing these commentaries, we should like to clarify our understanding of canonicity, to examine the nature of forgetfulness in geography, and, in attending to the question of fashion, to consider the degree to which concepts of relevance and irrelevance are used to ‘discipline’ geography.</p><p>The distinction we have chosen to draw between ‘canonical’ and ‘classic’ texts reflects that which, in our reading of it at least, the discipline and its literature has settled upon. Canonical texts, where they are deemed to exist at all, are remnants of another time – mementoes from a period during which the discipline’s scope and purpose might conceivably have been encompassed by specific texts. Borrowing the metaphor from Schein, these texts represent the deeper, calmer pools in the otherwise convoluted streams and meanders of disciplinary historiographies and genealogies. In truth, as we argue, whilst we might be able to identify a few such texts, there never was <italic>a</italic> canon in geography, even in the early phases of its academic institutionalisation. Some texts arguably came close to achieving that status – Ellen Semple’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468556">1911</xref>) <italic>Influences of Geographic Environment</italic> perhaps coming nearest of all within the Anglo-American community – but geography’s diversity (even within that particular context) has always been too great to be circumscribed by a specific textual product. As Mayhew points out, even if we wanted to, it is now impossible given the many bifurcations in human geography to return to a point at which a canon, in the unifying sense of the term, could conceivably exist.</p><p>Whilst we have tended to cast the absence of a canon in geography as something at once peculiar and pejorative, Agnew and others point to the fact that – in a particular sense – this state of affairs might well be regarded as a strength and benefit. Freed from the requirement to toil in the shadow of their predecessors, geographers are relatively untrammelled by tradition and expectation – freer than colleagues in cognate disciplines to move forward without the requirement also to look back. Without wishing to extend that metaphor too far, it should be noted, however, that whilst shadows obscure, they also reveal the direction from which the sun is shining. Our argument is not that geography’s texts are there to be sheltered behind, but rather that they be used as directional indicators – waymarkers by which the discipline’s convoluted trajectory (rather than any straightforward notion of its ‘progress’) might be traced; signposts with which geographers should, to use Agnew’s phrase, have a nodding familiarity.</p><p>To claim that we have never been canonical is not the same, however, as saying that our tendency to avoid engaging with our early texts is unproblematic. This is true, particularly, when one of the mechanisms which underpins that lacuna is a culture of intellectual celebrity which emphasises the new and the ‘relevant’ (the veneration of what Agnew calls ‘fanons’) at the seeming expense of the old and ‘irrelevant’. Whilst every discipline is moved by trends and styles – by those ideas, methods, and theories which the cognoscenti deem to be the intellectual <italic>dernier cri</italic> – geography’s reverence for novelty stands out as peculiarly robust. This process of intellectual fandom appears more ironic still when one considers the fact that a number of those philosophers around whom geographers cluster – including Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito – build some of their own arguments upon a textual engagement with long-dead geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel and Rudolf Kjellén. The work of past geographers must, so it seems, pass through the mediating interpretation of a continental philosopher in order to gain contemporary intellectual relevance and scholarly kudos.</p><p>Fashion by definition implies an attribution of social prestige and superiority to the present and the new, in direct opposition to a model of legitimacy based upon a collective past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468556">Lipovetsky, 1994</xref>). At the same time, fashion can – albeit with an ironic slant – look back and revive past forms and styles (horn-rimmed spectacles, 1920s hats, old Italian motorcycles) from which we have been sufficiently distanced that they appear as eccentric novelties and thus suitable for playful ‘innovation’. Fashion theory might well end up offering us a suitable alternative (or corrective) to Kuhn’s paradigm model in mapping out, for future generations of students, the many shifts, turns, and returns that seem increasingly to characterise the landscape of 21st century human geography.</p><sec id="section1-2043820612468556"><title>Texts and contexts</title><p>We agree with Mayhew that, in practice, the distinction between ‘canonical’ and ‘classic’ is small, but we nevertheless feel that it is important to distinguish between those texts in geography that – irrespective of their venerability – have been superannuated and those that retain some contemporary currency. Hubbard is right, of course, to advance a rather more optimistic interpretation than we have given of geographers’ engagement with past texts, particularly in a pedagogical context. We remain both cautious and anxious, however, about the longer term viability of undergraduate courses in the history and philosophy of geography given broader institutional changes that are affecting the design and delivery of geography’s undergraduate curricula, and the implications such changes have for the way in which geography’s past texts are engaged with. This is perhaps even more significant at a postgraduate level. As Schein observes, an important aspect of postgraduate seminars in the history of the geographical thought (at least in a North American context) is to help students build a sense of intellectual community – to offer incoming postgraduates, often drawn from different cultural and academic backgrounds, a space in which they are socialised as a cohort. Geography’s past is used in this sense to establish its future.</p><p>The important relationship between pedagogy and canonisation is highlighted by Powell. As he reminds us, the preferences and prejudices of individual academics can shape what, for generations of students, counts as and becomes geography. In that respect, Powell’s implicit suggestion is that the processes of canonisation should be understood not only at the spatiolinguistic scale but also at the level of the individual and the institution. Powell’s commentary also points to the fact that, in a UK context at least, undergraduate courses on the history and philosophy of geography are under threat. The scale of this problem (and we do consider it to be a problem) is uncertain and requires further investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468556">Phillips and Healey, 1996</xref>). It seems likely, however, that the requirement of departments to respond to wider marketplace concerns with employability and interdisciplinarity leaves increasingly less room for an engagement with disciplinary history. The implications of this quiet transition in the undergraduate curriculum are uncertain but demand scrutiny.</p><p>It is also interesting to note here Powell’s reference to the recent debate in <italic>Environment and Planning A</italic> surrounding the bicentennial of Charles Darwin’s birth and the sesquicentenary of the publication of his <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468556">Castree, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468556">Finnegan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468556">Kearns, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468556">Summerfield, 2010</xref>). In some respects, one can view the initial plea by Castree, as well as the subsequent commentaries, as illustrative of why we need the history of geography. Missing from this debate, however, is recognition of the fact that the reception of Darwinian thought in geography first took place within a German context. Oscar Peschel wrote one of the first reviews of <italic>On the Origin of Species</italic> to appear in German and was passionate in the subsequent promotion of Darwinian thought in Germany (albeit in the service of his own ideas about race). It is in Peschel’s review that we find the first mention of the Lebensraum concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468556">Raffestin et al., 1995</xref>). In this respect, Powell’s claim about the ease of ‘mastering’ the discipline in absence of a canon reminds us of the necessity to reflect critically on the often unexplored ‘dark’ genealogies of vitalist thought and other similarly uncomfortable ideas within the history of geographical thought.</p><p>Schein and others stress the importance of setting texts in their historical context. More specifically, Hubbard, Maddrell, Powell, and Withers each point to the importance of also considering geography’s non-textual canonical practices – that is, of acknowledging the ways in which geography has disciplined itself through different kinds of embodied work, through different kinds of spaces, and in relation to forms of representation other than textual. Addressing this variety would entail, amongst other things, detailed studies of the multitude of contexts in which geographical inquiry has been practiced – something that would demand a far greater geographical and linguistic scope than is often the case today. To give just one example, it is impossible to understand the work of the Lund school of geography, and its paragon Torsten Hägerstrand, without necessarily considering the role that the school played in shaping the Swedish welfare state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468556">Buttimer and Mels, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the production of geographical knowledge in the United States during the Second World War cannot be understood apart from geographers’ involvement with, and contribution to, the Office of Strategic Services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468556">Barnes and Farish, 2006</xref>). We agree with Schein, Mayhew, and others who advocate a critical engagement with geography’s texts and their contexts – their production and circulation, their reading and reception, their proposition and castigation – and with how these change over time and across space.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2043820612468556"><title>Remembering to forget</title><p>One of the claims we seek to make (and one which both Hubbard and Mayhew feel we are somewhat guilty of overstating) is that the ‘forgetting’ to which certain texts in geography are subject is not passive and accidental. In the same sense that memory is both a process and a construction, so forgetting should be regarded not just as something which happens, but as something which is made to happen. Just as there is an <italic>ars memoriae</italic>, there is an <italic>ars oblivionalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468556">Weinrich, 2004</xref>). That forgetting certain texts, and the geographical ideas they are seen to represent, is the result of desire and choice was evidenced, to give just one example, during the 2007 Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers. This conference remains memorable for many geographers for two reasons: first, it was foreshadowed by a long-running labour dispute at the San Francisco Hilton Hotel (where the conference was hosted), and, second, the opening plenary lecture was delivered by Jared Diamond, whose 1997 book <italic>Guns, Germs, and Steel</italic> was and is regarded by some as advancing an undesirable neo-environmentalist explanation for human development. Diamond’s lecture, ‘Why geography matters, more than ever’, and the labour dispute were both subject to anticipatory debate in online discussion forums and, after the fact, in heated conference-corridor discussion – disciplinary housekeeping in action. In relation to Diamond’s lecture, an uneven bifurcation was evident between those (the majority) who wished to forget geography’s past engagements with environmental explanation, including those of Semple, and those (the minority) who felt that, in an intellectual sense, the baby had been thrown out with the bathwater.</p><p>Whilst we would not wish to claim that such displays of elision and repression are universal, they nevertheless illustrate the fact that geographers rarely forget as a consequence of inattention, but rather that they make choices about what to include and remember and what to exclude and forget. As Maddrell and Monk point out, female and non-Anglophone geographers have been disproportionately affected by processes of forgetting in a way which betrays the discipline’s gendered and linguistic power dynamics. In seeking to problematise geography’s forgetfulness we are not advocating, as Mayhew suggests, the delineation of a new geographical canon but more straightforwardly are arguing that we need to understand how processes of veneration and castigation, remembering and forgetting, operate, and that, in a more general way, we stand to benefit from an engagement with those texts which have – for a variety of reasons – been subject to processes of exclusion. We might profitably see geography’s story not as one defined by canonisation, but rather one marked out by processes of decanonisation (or at least anti-canonisation).</p><p>As Mayhew indicates, voluntary forgetfulness happens in any discipline and indeed in any history. The point we wish to make, however, is that the degree, intensity, and consequences vary across the spectrum of the humanities and social sciences. As Agnew observes, disciplines like sociology and economics are dominated by the long shadows cast by figures from the past in part because, unlike our own Ratzels or Mackinders, it is felt that their theories can still inform understandings of contemporary problems. As we argue, what seems somewhat peculiar to contemporary Anglophone human geography at least is that this process of rejection – set within a larger neoliberal context defined by h-indexes, research audits, and institutional emphasis on ‘innovation’, amongst other things – consciously or otherwise gives rise to an unprecedented obsession with fashions and mimesis. Whilst this might not be true in physical geography to the same extent, as Monk’s analysis suggests, it certainly is in Anglophone human geography.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2043820612468556"><title>Selling the family silver</title><p>Maddrell offers us an interesting metaphor to describe our relationship with geography’s canonical texts: that of bequests made and items inherited. Changing fashions, tastes, and politics inevitably mean that certain texts – awkward mementoes of a bygone era like a grandmother’s much-prized fur coat or a widely-travelled uncle’s ivory-carved tourist souvenir – can provoke a sense of unease and discomfort. Another way of thinking about canonical texts is through heritage, and here, linguistic differences (coupled, of course, with institutional and cultural circumstances) might in part help give an account of Anglophone and continental human geographers’ different attitudes towards their past texts. On the one hand, the English word ‘heritage’ (rooted in the Germanic ‘heir’) places emphasis on the successor who receives, and has therefore the right to radically transform (or dispose of). On the other hand, its equivalent in the romance languages (‘patrimonio’, ‘patrimonie’, and so on) emphasises the giver’s intentions rather than the recipient’s acts, thus rendering the relationship one of duty and suggesting a more limited flexibility in dealing with the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468556">Cosgrove, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Negotiating that sense of embarrassment on the one hand, and of duty on the other, is a question not of being revisionist or apologetic any more than it is of simply burying one’s head in the sand and seeking to ignore what once was done and written, but of seeing geographical ideas as always and inevitably the product of circumstance. Doing so is important, in part, because we too will one day bequeath the texts that matter to us. The shifts and realignments that have rendered the work of Sauer, Ratzel, Ritter, Semple, Hartshorne, and Mackinder outmoded and illustrative of particular moments in geographical thought will inevitably do the same for those texts that we consider contemporary touchstones, and perhaps do so just as quickly. As has always been the case, the baton will be passed on and our gifts bestowed – some to be treasured, others to be relegated to the attic. Our argument is simple: whether our past texts have earned precious space on the bookshelf or have been relegated to a dusty alcove, they deserve and will reward our attention.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468556"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
