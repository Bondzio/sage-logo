<p>This book sets out to question the notion of openness in adoption practice. Salles sets out the idea of openness by giving us a very full overview of the history of the origin of this practice in part one of the book. Then, in the second part she uses evidence from her research into local authority archives and current systems to illustrate and continue to question the concept.</p>
<p>If this were all the book does it would probably be a dull read and offer the reader no more than a basic summary of what happens in adoption, but here we have what Salles calls a ‘foucauldian history’ where we are asked not merely to consider the changing practices within adoption in terms of what happened and how legislation has changed and supported it but rather to re-present those events by using Foucault’s genealogical approach which allows her to look at adoption practice by ‘disturbing and unsettling the commonplace ways we see (…) our world (p. 9). The aim is not ‘to make any further contributions to “measurable” research on adoption, but (…) seek(s) to understand …’ (p. 15). This allows for her to problematize and analyse the concept of openness and to question the stated underpinning philosophy for its use.</p>
<p>The first six chapters take us through the history of adoption from the mid-1800s to the present. They make fascinating reading and her analysis, which juxtaposes the stated ‘facts’ of adoption against the practice and outcomes, cause one to think and ponder on the purpose of adoption. This is evident in the shifting focus from the parent to the child as central to the process and shown in the change in the use of language from one where the parent relinquishes the child but still retains parental rights to being one where the child is ‘freed’ and to then become part of another family entirely. Set this in the context of the importance of maintaining links with origins and of maintaining attachments, we begin to see how this particular analysis makes for some potentially uncomfortable questioning of the meaning of current practice. We move from the state where an adopted child was to be told that they had been ‘chosen’ (p. 78) by the new family to one where the ‘choosing’ is of the parents as suitable for the child and this choice is made by the social worker. Salles considers the change from the apparent historical situation of ‘total severance’ (p. 129) to the emergence of the trend towards open adoption. The particular way in which this is not read as a straightforward linear reading of history allows for a much more complex and nuanced reading of this change and also allows us to consider the meaning, intended or not, of the outworking of this change.</p>
<p>Part two of the book continues this analysis but with a current focus and with reference to her own research evidence. It is possible to read only part two to follow the argument and to reflect on current practice as Salles refers back to earlier points throughout. This can feels a little repetitive at times.</p>
<p>This book is fascinating but it is neither an easy nor a comfortable read. It challenges, perhaps, accepted ideas in current practice and offers no solutions – but it never promised to do that. Students may well find it beneficial as a reference source and so should practitioners. This book offers a way into critical reflection on practice and as such may well be a work that finds itself being referred to in dissertations and in post qualifying essays. The book could easily be a valuable source to read for group supervision, but it is not a handbook and it is quite demanding on the reader. This is not really a book that can be dipped in to easily – you need to read the whole thing, but the effort is worthwhile.</p>
