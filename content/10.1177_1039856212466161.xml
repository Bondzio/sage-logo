<p>The tragic circumstances of Antony Waterlow are not disputed, but bear repeating as they form the foundation of a different analysis of the case. He had suffered from paranoid schizophrenia for more than a decade. He lived in a boarding house, significant because of the reduced social and health support associated with such places, and the indication that his illness had caused substantial social deterioration and dispossession. He suffered long-standing, systematised persecutory delusions which involved his family, he experienced auditory hallucinations and he had the experience that others could control his mind. There was a history of aggression, sometimes bizarre, and also focused threats on his family. Such a history only requires an examination of the patient by any medical practitioner to find him psychotic (currently ill) to satisfy the harm to others test for involuntary detention under the Mental Health Act NSW 2007 (MHA). Under Section 26 of the MHA, a family member could also have sought a psychiatric assessment by approaching a local magistrate with their concerns.</p>
<p>The reason that Antony Waterlow was not brought into involuntary treatment was not due to “an impossible burden upon the assessing clinician”, or anything to do with statistical analysis of false positives or negatives. Nor should the decision have been down to whether an assessing doctor could “foresee the sort of events that unfolded”. But Ryan et al. are correct in saying that the assessing doctor in such situations needs to exert some “common sense”. An illness such as paranoid schizophrenia, plus psychotic symptoms in the form of persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and thought passivity, plus threats to family who are incorporated in the delusional system, plus no engagement with and no likelihood of treatment in the community (less restrictive care) eminently qualified this man to be brought into care under the MHA. It is not the test of harm to others that is the problem here, but failures, probably multiple and over a long period of such care being applied.</p>
<p>Why are there failures to apply an effective and appropriate MHA? The answers are complex. Firstly, insufficient investment has been made in implementation of the MHA, a common reason for policy and procedural failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212466161">2</xref></sup> There is considerable variation in the application of the MHA across NSW. There is generally poor reliability between even experienced psychiatrists in relation to when schedules directing a patient to undergo psychiatric examination are made and upheld. There is frequent failure to take corroborative history from available family in the context of making such decisions. There is an under appreciation of the frequency, seriousness and meaning of aggression, especially aggression to family members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212466161">3</xref></sup> There is no process for the monitoring, calibration, education and refreshment of scheduling practice by medical practitioners.</p>
<p>It is not helpful for arguments about statistical false positives and negatives to blur the clear issues in this case. No one can predict whether something will actually happen. The nature of the world is one of uncertainty and we live with that in many parts of our lives every day. We buy a lottery ticket not expecting to win but knowing we have a chance, albeit small, of winning. The MHA is there to help us deal with uncertainty. Antony Waterlow had a number of tickets in the lottery that something seriously bad might happen as a result of his mental illness. He had enough tickets in this lottery to qualify for involuntary treatment under the MHA. Moreover, every day he was outside of treatment with these illness characteristics was like re-entering the same lottery. The stakes were high. The ultimate event could not have been known to an assessing doctor, but the nature of possible events could easily be anticipated: Other people, but particularly his family, were at risk of serious aggression. To qualify for involuntary treatment, the MHA does not require that a person “win” the unfortunate lottery (actually harm yourself or another person) — it is sufficient that the person is on a trajectory that one could reasonably anticipate might end in tragedy.</p>
<p>To suggest that a capacity test could replace the harm to others test is very concerning. There are people who suffer from psychotic disorders who can reasonably say that they are aware that they are ill, at least by their doctor’s definition, but chose to be so, and chose to be without treatment. In other words, a person may be suffering from an illness such as paranoid schizophrenia, delusional disorder or bipolar disorder, understand they have an illness and still choose not to be in treatment. It is also concerning that Ryan et al. make the analogy with “delirium, dementia or developmental delay”. Most people living with a mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder would find this demeaning and stigmatising. An illness like schizophrenia does not generally affect the person’s capacity to give informed consent to medical treatments. Such people, like any other citizen, generally have the competence and the right to agree to or refuse to have a blood transfusion, an HIV test, a tooth extraction.</p>
<p>Finally, any introduction of a capacity test to the MHA requires careful design lest it return us to the days of often quite arbitrary detention because a medical officer felt that a person was not “under proper care and control”. What is required, regardless of what tests are to be applied under a mental health act, is that there is a process of review, calibration, education and training of those granted the authority to exercise special powers under the act. Perhaps this could be a role for the new Mental Health Commission in NSW.</p>
