<abstract>
<p>Previous studies have described juveniles who sexually offended (JSO) as a rather heterogeneous population. In consequence, different typologies of JSO have been proposed for a better understanding of the causes and interventional needs of JSO. Three previously described types have received support in previous studies, namely, the victim age type (JSO offending against children vs. adolescents or adults), the co-offender status type (JSO offending as singles vs. in groups), and the crime history type (JSO with vs. without a previous history of crime). The validity of these types is tested in a consecutive sample of 223 criminal male adolescents, who had been convicted of a sexual offense between 2000 and 2008 in the Canton of Zurich (Switzerland). By analyzing nine offender characteristics, four victim characteristics and six offense characteristics, the best evidence is found for the victim age–based type. The co-offender status and the crime history types are less well supported. However, all three types are related to each other and do not provide a comprehensive characterization of JSO. Therefore, an additional principal component analyses is performed searching for basic dimensions of juvenile sexual delinquency and leading to the following factors: “single offender with severe molestation of a related child,” “persistent general delinquent with migrant background,” “older offender with alcohol use and familial constraints,” “multiple and aggressive offender with social adversities,” and “offender with unselected and multiple victims.” These five dimensions reflect different relevant factors of sexual offending behavior in male juveniles and may have further impact on forensic and clinical practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Considering the growing concern for juveniles who have sexually offended (JSO), a better understanding of these youths is warranted. Previous research has addressed common misperceptions of JSO regarding (a) their specific characteristics compared to other adolescent offenders, (b) their risk of sexual reoffending, and (c) their homogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1079063211420449">Chaffin, 2008</xref>). JSO were found to be largely comparable to other juvenile offenders in terms of personality and psychosocial circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211420449">Freeman, Dexter-Mazza, &amp; Hoffman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1079063211420449">van Wijk, Loeber et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, JSO were found to have rather low recidivism rates for sexual reoffending but show higher recidivism rates for nonsexual reoffending (see meta-analyses by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211420449">Caldwell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211420449">Gerhold, Brown, &amp; Beckett, 2007</xref>). Finally, JSO were described as rather heterogeneous according to offender characteristics, victim choice, and sexual abusive behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter, Figueredo, Malamuth, &amp; Becker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1079063211420449">Ryan, Miyoshi, Metzner, Krugman, &amp; Fryer, 1996</xref>). Given this heterogeneity, various types of JSO explaining differences in general criminal behaviors and recidivism have been proposed. The present study aimed at testing the validity of some previously suggested types of JSO by analyzing offender, victim, and offense characteristics. In the following, first, the specificity of JSO compared to other juvenile offenders will be reviewed, and, second, previous studies on JSO types will be addressed.</p>
<p>Various studies have addressed specific characteristics of JSO compared to criminal versatile offenders. As much as 62% to 94% of JSO have also committed nonsexual crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1079063211420449">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>), and JSO were more likely to exhibit nonsexual recidivism compared to sexual recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1079063211420449">Caldwell, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1079063211420449">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1079063211420449">Gerhold et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, some studies found that JSO did not differ from violent or general juvenile offenders according to their early childhood problems, current behavioral adjustment, personality traits, antisocial attitudes, and family background characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211420449">Freeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1079063211420449">van Wijk, Loeber et al., 2005</xref>). Because of these findings, some authors concluded that JSO do not need specialized sexual treatment and may profit from intensive family and social interventions as general antisocial youth do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1079063211420449">Letourneau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>). However, other studies found differences between JSO and general juvenile delinquents, especially regarding reduced social functioning and earlier beginning of their criminal careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1079063211420449">Bullens, Van Wijk, &amp; Mali, 2006</xref>). The inability to show further differences between JSO and juvenile nonsexual offenders may be partly due to ignoring the inherent variability in JSO. In consequence, it has been recommended for further research to define JSO more precisely according to their sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1079063211420449">van Wijk et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, JSO typologies may be useful in understanding the underlying psychopathological mechanisms in JSO and might help to refine sexual and nonsexual risk assessment and intervention planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1079063211420449">Aebi, Plattner, Steinhausen, &amp; Bessler, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1079063211420449">Barbaree, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1079063211420449">Robertiello &amp; Terry, 2007</xref>). Based on theoretical assumption some authors have attempted to categorize JSO in specific typologies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1079063211420449">O’Brian &amp; Bera, 1986</xref>). However, the empirical verification of these typologies and their corresponding types as discrete constructs is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1079063211420449">Robertiello &amp; Terry, 2007</xref>). One of the main reasons for the lack of validity is that the suggested subgroups rarely differ on factors related to treatment needs or recidivism (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063211420449">Kemper &amp; Kistner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1079063211420449">Parks &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>). Moreover, types have to be regarded with caution, because some JSO will not fit into a given classification scheme. Furthermore, in contrast to theoretical assumptions, most types are not found to be mutually exclusive. Apart from other classification systems, three types based on victim age, co-offender status, and crime history show some face validity and have been frequently addressed and at least partly supported in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs, Doreleijers, Jansen, van Wijk, &amp; Bullens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren, Wassberg, Carlberg, Langstrom, &amp; Svedin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1079063211420449">Parks &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The victim’s age is one of the most prominent criteria for the classification of sexual offenders. The idea that offenders against children constitute a distinct type has received considerable support from research on adult sexual offenders, showing that child molesters and rapists differ across many domains (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1079063211420449">Groth, Longo, &amp; McFadin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1079063211420449">Knight &amp; Prentky, 1990</xref>). In consequence, a number of studies have compared JSO with child victims (JSO-C) to JSO with adolescent or adult victims (JSO-A) regarding offense, demographic and personality characteristics, psychopathology, and recidivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211420449">Hunter, Hazelwood, &amp; Slesinger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1079063211420449">Kemper &amp; Kistner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1079063211420449">Parks &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>). The findings are mostly consistent. Compared to JSO-A, JSO-C were found to be younger at the age of offense, more often of native origin, more often related and familiar to the victim, more frequently male, and less frequently using force and weapon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211420449">2000</xref>). A recent meta-analysis shows that JSO-C display less conduct problems than JSO-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1079063211420449">Seto &amp; Lalumiére, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, JSO-C are more deficient in social functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>) and show more psychosexual development problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>). From a psychopathological point of view JSO-C suffer considerably more frequently from depression and anxiety symptoms than JSO-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>). The findings regarding sexual and nonsexual reoffending of JSO-C compared to JSO-A are conflicting and still remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1079063211420449">Kahn &amp; Chambers, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1079063211420449">Nisbet, Wilson, &amp; Smallbone, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1079063211420449">Parks &amp; Bard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1079063211420449">Skubic Kemper &amp; Kistner, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the victim-based type, single (JSO-solo) and group (JSO-group) offenders have been distinguished in JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>). Single offenders committed more sexual offenses and were older; more impulsive, neurotic, and unsociable; and more frequently abused siblings than JSO-group, who more frequently committed offenses against acquaintances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>). However, no differences regarding age, urbanization, ethnicity, and presence of male victims and hands-on versus hands-off offenses were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, group offenders were found to be more violent than single offenders if child molesters were excluded from the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>). Overall, the findings on the co-offender status type remain scarce and more research is warranted.</p>
<p>The findings on nonsexual crime and conduct problems in JSO led to the assumption that antisocial characteristics may account for two distinct subtypes of JSO. Based on a developmental model for sexual offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063211420449">Seto &amp; Barbaree, 1997</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler and Seto (2002)</xref> distinguished between JSO without (JSO-H–) and those with (JSO-H+) a history of nonsexual crime. JSO-H– had fewer behavioral problems, more prosocial attitudes, and a lower expected risk for future delinquency. On the other hand, JSO-H+ resembled to a greater extent criminal versatile offenders. With the exception of victim relation, no differences in offense characteristics were found. However, some methodological limitations should be noted: namely, small sample size and a partly tautological research strategy by using similar variables for defining the types (prior nonsexual offenses) and for their validation (antisocial behaviors). Despite these limitations, the findings partly support the assumption that JSO-H+ versus JSO-H– reflects a valid type of JSO. In agreement with these findings, a recent meta-analysis found that antisocial lifestyle characteristics play a major role in sexual reoffending in adults and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1079063211420449">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2005</xref>). However, it remains unclear how antisocial attitudes are associated with other developmental factors like egoistical masculinity and social skills deficits in JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1079063211420449">Daversa &amp; Knight, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, previous studies on JSO subgroups address important aspects of juvenile sexual offending and provide some support of specific JSO types. However, none of the previous studies has assessed the validity of different types in order to gain a comprehensive classification system. Thus, the present study was designed to test the validity of three dichotomous types of JSO, namely, a first type based on a child victim, a second type characterized by co-offender status, and a third type defined by previous history of nonsexual crime in a consecutive sample of JSO using offense- and offender-specific data from criminal files. It was assumed that a valid type shows a specific profile of offender, victim, and offense characteristics that reflect underlying psychological processes in JSO and are relevant to etiology, maintenance, treatment, and recidivism. In the present study, the validity of the three types was analyzed by use of a set of previously described relevant variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>) that were available from criminal files. Variables related to general criminal outcomes (e.g., social adversities, general recidivism) as well as to specific sexual offending behaviors (e.g., victim choice, sexual offense severity) were considered for the analyses. In addition, previously supported risk factors for sexual reoffending such as offending against a strange victim, offending against multiple victims, offending against a male victim, interpersonal aggression and antisocial attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1079063211420449">Långström &amp; Grann, 2000</xref>), and treatment-related variables (e.g., own sexual victimization) were included. However, information on other important psychological measures such as deviant interests, social isolation, and victim empathy was not available in the files. In addition to these analyses, the relation and independence of the three types was analyzed for developing a more comprehensive empirical classification model.</p>
<p>Given the large number of potential influences and interactions of sexual offending characteristics, JSO may be better described by use of dimensional measures rather than assigning them to specific types. Most JSO are not adequately described by membership to a specific type and show characteristics of multiple types simultaneously. Comparable to the development of dimensional personality concepts (e.g., 16 PF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1079063211420449">Cattell, 1957</xref>) underlying factors of sexual offending behavior in juveniles should be identified. Thus, alternatively to the type-oriented approach, an exploratory principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify relevant patterns of sexual offending characteristics. Compared to previous studies, the present analyses were not based on preselected clinical samples. As noted by some researchers, findings on representative criminal samples are scarce and may add significant knowledge on juvenile sexual offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211420449">Finkelhor, Ormrod, &amp; Chaffin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1079063211420449">Kjellgren, Priebe, Svedin, &amp; Langstrom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The original sample included all children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 years who had been convicted of a sexual assault against children (victims under 12 years and at least 3 years younger than the offender), coercive sexual behavior, rape, exhibitionism, sexual harassment, porn distribution, or illegal pornography possession (e.g., child or violent pornography) in the Canton of Zurich (Switzerland) between 2000 and 2008. Thus, the initial sample included the complete population of JSO in the area and time period. A total number of 419 JSO had been reported. However, 40 (9.5%) of the youngsters were not found to be guilty by a superior court. In the present study, juveniles exclusively convicted of porn distribution or the possession of illegal pornography were excluded from further analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 119; 28.4%). Although differences between male and female JSO seem likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1079063211420449">Fehrenbach &amp; Monastersky, 1988</xref>), female JSO had to be excluded because the number of women (<italic>n</italic> = 9, 2.1%) was too small for statistical analyses. From the remaining 251 subjects, 28 (11.2%) files were not available, mostly due to official elimination of archive files (<italic>n</italic> = 22, 8.8%). Attrition analyses showed that the 28 cases with missing file information did not differ from the 223 youngsters in the final sample in terms of recidivism rate (sexual recidivism, 10.7% vs. 3.1%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.73, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; nonsexual violent recidivism, 10.7% vs. 16.6%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.64, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; and general recidivism, 64.3% vs. 44.8%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.78, <italic>df</italic> = 1, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05). However, the 28 cases with missing file information were significantly younger than the final sample of 223 participants (14.50 vs. 15.64 years, <italic>t</italic> = −2.37, <italic>df</italic> = 32.68, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.05). The study was designed in cooperation with the justice department of the Canton of Zurich and approved by the local medical ethic committee.</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>A retrospective analysis of police reports, prosecutors’ documents, court protocols, mental health assessment reports, and social workers’ reports was performed to identify 21 descriptive and behavioral variables that were found all relevant in previous studies of JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1079063211420449">Fehrenbach, Smith, Monastersky, &amp; Deisher, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1079063211420449">Finkelhor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211420449">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>). Three variables represent the three dichotomous JSO types described earlier in this article, that is, JSO-C versus JSO-A, JSO-solo versus JSO-group, and JSO-H+ versus JSO-H–. In addition, nine offender variables (age, nationality, socioeconomic status [SES], broken home, outplacement, previous sexual victimization, general recidivism, nonsexual violent recidivism, sexual recidivism), four victim characteristics (male, multiple, related, and unknown victim), and six offense characteristics (sexual severity, number of sexual offenses, alcohol/drug influence, verbal and physical aggression, weapon use) were coded from the files using a modified and adolescent adapted version of the Forensic Psychiatric Documentation System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1079063211420449">Nedopil &amp; Grass, 1988</xref>). Data extraction was accomplished by one experienced forensic expert and two master students in psychology (see below for reliability of ratings).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1079063211420449">
<title>Types of JSO</title>
<p>The first type was based on victim age. Juveniles were classified as JSO-C if they offended against at least one victim who was both under the age of 12 and at least 3 years younger than the offender himself. This definition of JSO-C is in line with previous studies limiting the age of the victim to 12 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>) as well as with the Swiss penal code that allows exemption from punishment only if the age difference does not exceed 3 years. The alternative code (JSO-A) was used when the victims were peers or adults.</p>
<p>The second type was based on co-offender status. In agreement with previous studies, juveniles who assaulted at least once as single offenders were classified as JSO-solo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1079063211420449">Bijleveld &amp; Hendriks, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1079063211420449">Kjellgren et al., 2006</xref>). All juveniles who solely offended in groups were labeled <italic>JSO-group</italic>. The third type was based on the crime history of the offender. Juveniles found guilty of a nonsexual crime before or during the trial in which they were convicted of the sexual offense were classified as <italic>JSO-H+ type</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>), whereas those with a negative crime history were labeled <italic>JSO-H– type</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1079063211420449">
<title>Offender Characteristics</title>
<p>In total, nine variables were coded among offender characteristics: (1) “Age” refers to the offender’s age at the time he committed his first sexual offense against a victim. (2) “Foreign nationality” was assigned to all offenders who were not Swiss citizens. (3) In agreement with the Swiss Health Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1079063211420449">Swiss Federal Institute for Statistics, 1992</xref>) the “Social Economic Status” (SES) was defined according to parents’ educational and professional background (“high” if at least one parent had finished upper secondary education, was self-employed, or a manager with extended responsibility; “middle” if at least one parent had completed a vocational training or was employed with at least some managerial responsibility; “low” in all other cases). (4) If the JSO was not living with both parents at the time of the offense, a “broken home” situation was coded. (5) “Outplacement” was coded if the offender was living in a youth institution or in foster care. (6) The criterion of “sexual victimization” was fulfilled if there was a social or mental health assessment report in the files stating that the JSO was sexually abused by an older person or coerced to sexual activities. (7) Recidivism states were obtained from the cantonal crime registry only after all the other variables were coded. “General recidivism” was evident if the person was charged because of at least one nonviolent or one nonsexual crime after he had been convicted of the sexual offense, for example, because of theft or violations of drug laws. In the same way, (8) “nonsexual violent recidivism” and (9) “sexual recidivism” were coded dichotomously. Thus, in a single person all three recidivism characteristics might be observed. The mean time for recidivism registration was 4.30 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.49) with a range of 9 months to 9.74 years. There were two relevant limitations of recidivism information: It was limited to the area of the Canton of Zurich and based on charges, not convictions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1079063211420449">
<title>Victim Characteristics</title>
<p>Four variables were considered among victim characteristics: (1) “male victim” was assigned if at least one victim was male, (2) “multiple victims” if the JSO sexually offended against at least two different persons, (3) “related victim” if all victims were relatives of the offender (including half brothers and half sisters and more distant relatives such as cousins), and (4) the criterion for “unknown victim” was fulfilled, if at least one victim was not known to the offender even by sight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1079063211420449">
<title>Offense Characteristics</title>
<p>Finally, six variables were used to define offense characteristics: (1) “Sexual Offense Severity” (SOS) was assessed by a modified version of the scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1079063211420449">Aylwin and colleagues (2000)</xref>. The six levels are: (a) noncontact (voyeurism, obscene phone calls); (b) clothed fondling, (c) off-clothed fondling, digital penetration, and masturbation; (d) oral sex, (e) attempted or performed vaginal intercourse; and (f) attempted or performed anal intercourse. If more than one offense occurred, the SOS value is based on the most severe offense. (2) The following rule was applied for the definition of the “number of sexual assaults against the victim(s)”: Offenses were separate events if the offender left the victim for at least one hour and then reoffended the victim. (3) “Alcohol and/or drugs” was coded if the offender consumed alcohol or drugs before or during at least one offense. (4) “Verbal aggression” implied that the offender used verbal and/or gestural expressions that seem appropriate to intimidate the victim. (5) In contrast, “physical aggression” refers to the actual use of physical force during at least one offense. (6) “Weapon use” was coded if knives, fire arms, or other potentially dangerous objects (e.g., baseball bats) were present or used during at least one offense.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1079063211420449">
<title>Inter-rater Reliability</title>
<p>As an indicator of reliability, interrater agreement was assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients for “age,” “number of sexual offenses,” and “number of previous nonsexual crimes,” Kendall’s W for SES and SOS, and Fleiss’ Kappa (κ) for all other variables. Inter-rater reliability was not assessed for recidivism status and the JSO-H+ type because these variables were taken directly from the computer database of the cantonal crime registry. Perfect agreement was found for the JSO-C and the JSO-solo type (κ = 1.0). The statistics for the characteristics variables were also quite convincing (ranging from 0.70 to 1). Only the Kappa coefficients of the variables measuring “verbal aggression” and “physical aggression” were rather low (.48 and .56, respectively), though still sufficient for group comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1079063211420449">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1079063211420449">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>First, group comparisons of the three JSO types based on the nine offender, four victim, and six offense characteristics were performed using <italic>t</italic> tests for interval-scaled, Mann–Whitney tests for ordinal-scaled, and χ<sup>2</sup> statistics for dichotomous variables. Second, variables for that significant differences were found in univariate analyses were used as predictors in stepwise backward multivariate LR analyses (WALD removal criterion = .10) in order to identify a combination of significant predictors of either the victim age–based type, the co-offender status type, or the crime history type. Furthermore, Pseudo <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> and Hosmer–Lemeshow statistics were used to compare the goodness of fit of the three models. Multicollinearity diagnostics were applied by analyzing variance inflation factors (VIF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1079063211420449">Myers, 1990</xref>). Finally, dimensions of criminal characteristics were explored by use of principal component analysis (PCA) with subsequent varimax rotation based on the previously defined 19 offender, victim, and offense characteristics. In addition, “child victim” (variable defined for victim age type), “single offending” (variable defined for co-offender status type), and the number of previous nonsexual crimes were included. For determining the number of factors, a parallel analysis (a Monte Carlo simulation technique with 200 samples, criteria 95th percentile) was performed using Vista-PARAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063211420449">Ledesma &amp; Valera-Mora, 2007</xref>). Parallel analyses were found robust, appropriate, and superior compared to other methods (e.g., Kaiser criteria, Cattell’s Scree test) to determine the number of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1079063211420449">Ledesma &amp; Valera-Mora, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1079063211420449">Thompson &amp; Daniel, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive findings for the three types of JSO and offender, victim, and offense characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211420449">Table I</xref>. On average, a JSO was 13.93 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.93) old at the time of the first reported incidence of sexual offense, whereas mean age at the time of conviction was 15.65 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.14 years; on average, 1.72 years [<italic>SD</italic> = 1.51 years] elapsed between first sexual offense and conviction). Although age of conviction was substantially related to the age of first offense (<italic>r</italic> = .73, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.001), it may be influenced by administrative and procedural circumstances. Therefore, “age of conviction” was considered as less a valid measure than “age of first offense” and was not included it in the following analyses. A total of 102 (45.7%) of the JSO were of non-Swiss nationality; 93 (41.1%) of the JSO did not life with both parents (“broken home”), and for 14 (6.3%) there was evidence of a previous sexual victimization. A subgroup of 7 (3.1%) JSO reoffended sexually, 37 (16.6%) reoffended nonsexually violently, and 90 (40.4%) reoffended with other crimes. Further descriptive information on victim and offending characteristics of the sample is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1079063211420449">Table I</xref>.</p>

<p>The victim age–based type consisted of 89 (39.9%) JSO-C and 134 (60.1%) JSO-A, the co-offender status type comprised 116 (52.0%) JSO-solo and 107 (48.0%) JSO-group, and the crime history type consisted of 106 (47.5%) JSO-H+ and 117 JSO-H–. Among the 89 JSO-C, a total of 9 (10.1%) additionally had sexually offended a peer or adult victim, and among the 116 JSO-solo, another 9 (7.8%) subjects additionally had committed a sexual offense in a group. Additional univariate and multivariate analyses excluding these “mixed” offenders did not substantially influence the following findings (data are available on request). The JSO-H+ committed 1 to 52 previous nonsexual crimes (<italic>M</italic> = 4.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.8).</p>
<p>The frequencies and combinations of the three types is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1079063211420449">Figure 1</xref>. It is apparent that there is some association between these types. A history of nonsexual crime was more prevalent among juveniles who offended against peer or adult victims (<italic>n</italic> = 81, percentage of JSO-H+ type among JSO-A type = 60.5%) than among juveniles who offended against children (<italic>n</italic> = 25, percentage of JSO-H+ type among JSO-C type = 28.1%). Furthermore, the majority of child offenders were lone perpetrators (<italic>n</italic> = 62, percentage of JSO-solo type among JSO-C type = 69.7%), whereas offending in groups seems associated with victimizing an adult or a peer (<italic>n</italic> = 80, percentage of JSO-solo type among JSO-A type = 40.3%). Significant positive Phi correlations were found for the victim age type and the co-offender type (<italic>r</italic> = .28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), a significant negative correlation was found for the victim age type and the crime history type (<italic>r</italic> = −3.2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), whereas co-offender type and crime history type did not significantly correlate (<italic>r</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05)</p>

<p>JSO-solo and JSO-group types differed in 3 of the 19 variables. Solo offenders committed more and more severe offenses, and more of them had related victims. The JSO-H+ type differed from the JSO-H– type on 5 of 19 variables.

This factor may be called “single offender with severe molestation of a related child.” “Number of previous nonsexual crimes,” “foreign nationality,” “general recidivism,” and “nonsexual violent recidivism” loaded on Factor 2 (9.0% explained variance), which may be labeled “persistent general delinquent with immigrant background.” “Offender age,” “broken home,” “outplacement,” and “alcohol/drug use” loaded on Factor 3 (9.10% of explained variance). This factor may be called “older offender with alcohol use and familial constraints.” “Foreign nationality,” SES (negatively), “number of sexual offenses,” “verbal aggression,” and “physical aggression” loaded on Factor 4 (7.8% of explained variance). This factor may be named “multiple and aggressive offender with social adversities.” Finally, “multiple victims” and “unknown victims” loaded on Factor 5 (6.9% of explained variance). “Sexual recidivism” also loaded on Factor 5 with a factor loading of 0.39 (i.e., short of 0.40).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The validation approach in three JSO types provided the best evidence for the victim age–based type. Less support was found for the co-offender status and the crime history–based types. More precisely, 7 out of 19 univariate tests differed significantly between the JSO-C and the JSO-A, whereas only 3 out of 19 tests between the JSO-solo and the JSO-group and 5 out of 19 comparisons between the JSO-H+ and the JSO-H– were significant. Furthermore, the explained variance measured by pseudo <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> statistics from multivariate LR indicates stronger empirical support for the victim age based than for the co-offender status and the crime history–based types (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .53 vs. <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .21 and <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> = .37, respectively). However, all these three types are related to each other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1079063211420449">Figure 1</xref>) and do not provide a comprehensive characterization of JSO.</p>
<p>Previous findings from clinical samples supporting differences between JSO-C and JSO-A were confirmed in the present study. In agreement with previous results, JSO-C were younger at the time of the offense and were less frequently of foreign nationality than JSO-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>). JSO-C more often abused related and male victims and showed less aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>). Low SES, which has been suggested as a risk factor for sexual offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1079063211420449">S. Lightfoot &amp; Evans, 2000</xref>), was limited to sexual aggressive behavior against peers/adults and was not specific to JSO-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to previous findings, our data show that sexual offense severity (SOS) was higher among JSO-C than among JSO-A. Compared to JSO-A, the sexual offenses of JSO-C included more often intrusive behaviors such as touching and masturbation of the victim. This finding may reflect the psychological dependency and the limited possibilities of resistance of child victims. In conclusion, there is some support for regarding the JSO-C type as a separate entity because child sexual abusive and sexual aggressive behaviors may have different origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1079063211420449">Gunby &amp; Woodhams, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding the co-offender status type, no difference between JSO-solo and JSO-group were found in terms of age and nationality. However, JSO-solo had more related victims and scored higher on the SOS scale than JSO-group. Accordingly, JSO-solo resembled JSO-C regarding victim choice and SOS. In contrast to studies of adult sexual offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1079063211420449">Ullman, 1999</xref>), in the present sample sexual behavior in group offending was less intrusive than in solo offending. Our results indicate that juvenile group offending shows different underlying mechanisms than adult offending. On the one hand, the threshold to be sexually intrusive might be reduced in a group, and on the other hand, the group situation might prevent single perpetrators from using extreme forms of violence, as the group might exert some social control. However, considering both univariate and multivariate analyses, the present findings indicate that co-offender status is less appropriate for the definition of two distinct types of JSO.</p>
<p>Finally, JSO-H+ were older at the time of the sexual offense, had higher rates of general and nonsexual violent recidivism, and showed more alcohol and drug use and verbal aggression at the time of the offense than JSO without a history of previous nonsexual crimes. Thus the JSO-H+ group in the present study showed a versatile, antisocial profile that has been often described in former studies of JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1079063211420449">Butler &amp; Seto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1079063211420449">Freeman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1079063211420449">Ronis &amp; Borduin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1079063211420449">Seto &amp; Barbaree, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1079063211420449">van Wijk, Loeber et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1079063211420449">van Wijk, van Horn, Bullens, Bijleveld, &amp; Doreleijers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1079063211420449">van Wijk et al., 2006</xref>). Sexual inadequate behavior of these JSO represents a part of a more comprehensive behavioral problem that also includes general rule-breaking behaviors and social deficits. Taken together, these findings add to the validity of the JSO-H+ type. However, the amount of previous nonsexual crimes varies a lot in the JSO-H+ (<italic>M</italic> = 4.6, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.8). Hence, a dimensional measure of previous nonsexual crimes may be more favorable for explaining the amount of antisocial attitudes in JSO. In consequence, the number of previous nonsexual crimes was considered in the additional PCA.</p>
<p>The limited validity and lacking independence of the three types strongly suggest that a comprehensive typology of JSO based on victim age, co-offender status, and crime history is not feasible. Furthermore, the present results suggest that a dimensional approach is more adequate for describing JSO than a comprehensive typology defined by separate and independent entities. Furthermore, both antisocial attitudes and joining hostile masculine offending peers may more strongly reflect general criminogenic factors than specific and independent subtypes of JSO. Hence, the additional exploratory analyses based on a variable-oriented dimensional instead of a person-oriented approach may shed further light on this issue. Five independent factors were identified representing different criminality dimensions in JSO. These dimensions were called “single offender with severe molestation of a related child,” “persistent general delinquent with migrant background,” “older offender with alcohol use and familial constraints,” “multiple and aggressive offender with social adversities,” and “offender with unselected and multiple victims.” Consequently, a JSO can score on more than one of these dimensions simultaneously.</p>
<p>The first dimension labeled “single offender with severe molestation of a related child” explained most of the variance in the sample and may reflect a specific pattern of offender and victim characteristics in JSO. Accordingly, the availability of younger and related victims may constitute an opportunity for JSO to commit sexual offenses. Because of familiarity with the victim, who might show limited resistance and may trust the offender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1079063211420449">Ryan et al., 1996</xref>), the opportunistic single offender has no need to use verbal and physical aggression. The intimate relationship and the low resistance of the victim may allow sexual intrusive behaviors like oral, anal, or genital sexual behaviors. The “single offender with severe molestation of a related child” dimension may be relevant for a specific subtype of JSO as represented by the overlap of JSO-C and JSO-solo in the present sample. Further factors, like normal sexual development, increased sexual curiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1079063211420449">Bancroft, 2006</xref>), and an easy access to potential victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1079063211420449">Leclerc, Beauregard, &amp; Proulx, 2008</xref>), and also specific social, psychosexual, and affective dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1079063211420449">Hart-Kerkhoffs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1079063211420449">Hendriks &amp; Bijleveld, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1079063211420449">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1079063211420449">2000</xref>) play an important role in these juvenile child molesters. Furthermore, exposure to sexual abuse has been found to contribute to later juvenile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1079063211420449">Worling, 1995</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1079063211420449">Salter et al., 2003</xref>) sexual offending that often has been committed against male child victims. The present data partly support this association because sexual victimization and offending against a male victim was found to be weakly but most closely related to the “single offender with severe molestation of a related child” dimension.</p>
<p>Foreign nationality was related to a chronic course of juvenile versatile delinquency on the second dimension. This dimension may refer to antisocial and delinquent attitudes in JSO. In agreement with a general strain theory of crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1079063211420449">Agnew, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1079063211420449">2005</xref>), psychosocial adversities like migration and subsequent cultural adjustment can be seen as chronic stressors, which have an impact on the development of general and sexual delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1079063211420449">Bauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1079063211420449">Erickson, Crosnoe, &amp; Dornbusch, 2000</xref>). Familial problems and alcohol use in older JSO may reflect another dimension of sexual abusive behavior. The use of drugs and alcohol increases the probability of sexual aggression and has a disinhibitory effect on sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1079063211420449">L. O. Lightfoot &amp; Barbaree, 1993</xref>). Consequently, substance use and abuse should represent a target also in the treatment of JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1079063211420449">Johnson &amp; Knight, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Instrumental verbal and physical aggression may allow the JSO to commit multiple sexual offenses against a specific victim. In consequence, these characteristics load on the fourth dimension representing the amount of sexual aggression used by the offender. This might be explained by operant conditioning; that is, the offender’s aggressive behavior is rewarded (reinforced) by social and/or sexual gains. Furthermore, low SES and foreign nationality were associated with aggression during the offense. Previous studies have found that growing up in disadvantaged and low-income families is a risk factor of later aggressive behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1079063211420449">Cote, Vaillancourt, LeBlanc, Nagin, &amp; Tremblay, 2006</xref>). In addition, culture-specific moderators of sexual aggression and masculinity have been found to be related to sexual aggression in previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1079063211420449">Nagayama Hall, Teten, DeGarmo, Sue, &amp; Stephens, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the pattern of characteristics based on the fifth dimension of the PCA includes “multiple victims” and “unknown victims.” Furthermore, “sexual recidivism” was most strongly related to this dimension. Sexual crimes against strangers and sexual offending against multiple victims indicate a low threshold of committing sexual offenses and, therefore, are serious risk factors in juvenile and adult sex offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1079063211420449">Quinsey, Harris, Rice, &amp; Cormier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1079063211420449">Worling &amp; Långström, 2006</xref>). Accordingly, JSO scoring high on this dimension may represent potentially dangerous and chronic sex offenders who are in need of comprehensive interventions.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Due to the specific sample characteristics the results may be limited to male Caucasian JSO living in urbanized areas. Further limitations are noteworthy. First, all information has been extracted retrospectively based on the available file information that was limited to demographic and offending data. Only limited additional information on personal and familial circumstances was available from the social reports included in the files. In consequence, the test of validity of the various JSO types and criminality dimensions did not include psychosocial and psychopathological variables. Second, in many files information on previous victimization was missing or not addressed in the social reports. Therefore, it is possible that the figures of the present study represent an underestimation of the actual sexual victimization rate in the sample. Third, the JSO types defined for the present analysis were not mutually exclusive. For example, it was possible for a JSO-C to have committed also a sexual offense against peers or adults and for a JSO-solo to also have offended sexually in groups. However, the exclusion of these “mixed” offenders did not significantly influence the present findings. Four, the evaluation of recidivism was based on local official data and did not include national official data or self-reports so that there may be some underreporting. However, despite these limitations the present study is one of few studies not limited to preselected and clinical samples and, thus, may stimulate further research on JSO. Finally, the five dimensions of criminality as identified in the present study warrant cross-validation in further studies and samples.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The present findings suggest distinct dimensions of criminality implying different pathways that lead to sexual offending in youth. Previous results showing different background themes on JSO were partially confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1079063211420449">Almond, Canter, &amp; Salfati, 2006</xref>). JSO abusing a familiar child victim and acting on their own represent a specific type of JSO that differs considerably from other types of JSO. The consideration of distinct underlying psychological mechanism in JSO-C and JSO-A may be important for intervention planning. Although peer group processes and general delinquency account for some diversity of the JSO sample, authorities and clinicians should avoid classifying JSO exclusively on the basis of these characteristics and should include additional information when making decisions on treatment and interventions.</p>
<p>Although offender typologies may be useful, in particular the dichotomy of JSO-C and JSO-A, they constitute limited constructs for forensic clinicians. Alternatively, the identification of criminality dimensions in JSO in terms of relevant patterns of sexual offending characteristics may be more useful. In this process, different factors should be carefully addressed in JSO. If the juvenile offended against a younger and familiar child victim, previous sexual victimization, social and emotional problems, and skill deficits should be assessed. Independently from victim relationship and age of the victim, general delinquency and antisocial attitudes in association with cultural adaption should be addressed. Furthermore, in older JSO alcohol and drug use should be examined in relation to sexual offending behavior. Hostile masculinity in JSO should be focused in relation to psychosocial adversities and sexual aggressive behavior. Finally, offenses against multiple and unknown victims have to be considered as risk factors of further sexual reoffending. These findings may add to existent knowledge on the assessment and treatment of JSO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1079063211420449">Burton, Smith-Darden, &amp; Frankel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1079063211420449">Miner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1079063211420449">Shaw, 2000</xref>). In summary, the findings of the present study emphasize the relevance of offender, victim, and offending characteristics for an adequate assessment and treatment of JSO by forensic mental health experts.</p>
