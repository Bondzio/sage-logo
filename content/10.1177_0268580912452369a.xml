<p><italic>Child Migration in Africa</italic> both engages the concept of childhood and examines the processes involved with the migration of children in West Africa. Using the voices and perspectives of children in Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Cote d’Ivoire, Iman Hashim and Dorte Thorsen profile the contexts from which and the reasons for which children migrate away from their parents usually for work within West Africa. A real strength of this book is that the authors situate children’s perspectives and lived experiences in the grey areas found across anthropological research, advocacy and policy knowledge. This book therefore offers much insight to scholars and practitioners interested in children’s migration issues. The children’s interviews provide needed balance to recent journalistic and policy writings on children living separately from their parents that often portray children’s separate migration as involving human trafficking of passive children. Hashim and Thorsen present children as involved participants in migration, often negotiating in part or whole their migration trajectories. The breadth of children’s perspectives put forth in this book challenges both scholars and practitioners to consider varied migration trajectories and long-term outcomes for child migrants.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, the authors introduce us to a child-centered focus for understanding West African family dynamics and migration processes. They argue for the necessity to comprehend children’s choices and engagement in migration decision-making as ‘children themselves think about their movement and what role they play in their migration’ (p. 17). The authors challenge the reader to discard dualistic categories – such adult/child and forced/voluntary – and to consider the links between agency and age, and between agency and social structure. In this way, the reader moves from the perspective of child to migrant context, and then again to the perspective of child throughout this monograph. Children’s outlooks and interpretations of events are therefore the data points from which the reader can understand these migrant lives.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 defines childhood as a concept linked to context, and then argues for the import of context itself to understand child migration. In contrast to a global model of childhood, the authors argue using the words of West African children and families interviewed for this research that childhood should be defined with work being a necessary component, while schooling is not necessarily a requirement. The authors illustrate how economic and social relations in the child migrant’s sending context shape, facilitate, and sometimes discourage girls’ and boys’ aspirations to move. A 15-year-old boy explains why he works and lives separately from his parents: ‘My work for my family is important because it is where they will get their food to eat. . . . And when I marry my father will give me the animals for my bride-wealth’ (p. 21). Likewise for girls, the authors’ findings concur with prior research which concluded that girls share an imagined benefit of acquiring trousseau items in order to be more attractive for future marriage.</p>
<p>Chapter 3’s focus on context illustrates specifically how poverty and its gendered dimensions explain why children move, and therefore why migration options may be different for girls and boys. Poverty and the desire to work for money figure heavily in boys’ reasoning for leaving rural communities. However, children also highlight other specific reasons for moving, such as locating educational opportunities like apprenticeships and helping relatives in need. The authors assert that there are ‘many layers underneath the poverty discourse’ (p. 63). The specific reasons of ‘why’ may vary, yet they come together under the umbrella of poverty. Nearly all of these children migrate to support their kin network (and in turn, the child) in the short and long term, monetarily or in kind, which concurs with earlier research on migrant, working children in Africa (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580912452369">Awumbila and Ardyfio-Schandorf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580912452369">Bass, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580912452369">Beauchemin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580912452369">Jacquemin, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Chapter 4 makes substantial contributions to what is known about migration by including the migration processes of the specific West African migrant children interviewed for this study. This chapter illustrates how social networks, kin, and relatedness all shape the migration trajectories for children in patterned ways by gender. On the one hand, this chapter illustrates how migrants’ relatives and earlier ‘peer’ migrants shape children’s motivations for migration, while on the other, it explains how children themselves create and use kinship relations to enable their migration. One account from Paul, 15 or 16 years old (p. 73), describes how he made friends with an older migrant visiting his village and negotiated his own migration and eventual work in the capital city through this peer. Interviews suggest that children and parents often hold similarly optimistic views on migration and what may lead to successful migration. In this way, children are presented as being active participants embedded within extensive social networks.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 examines children at their migrant destination in terms of their work activities and identities, as these migrant children become a part of a new community. This chapter includes children’s reflections on their position in society, within their family in both sending and receiving environments, and within their peer group. The authors highlight interrelationships across migration, vulnerability, and children’s construction of identity, to comprehend how migrant boys and girls navigate their social and economic contexts. Because children engage in informal employment relationships, there is a great deal of variability in whether work enables or constrains children’s expectations and eventual migrant outcomes. The migration outcomes then influence children’s identities, as these migrants realize their own possibilities and constraints. The authors argue that the migration process is a type of education, wherein children develop social skills of adaptability, ingenuity, and awareness.</p>
<p>The concluding Chapter 6 considers the negative and positive aspects of children’s mobility and ends with a discussion about how to conceptualize children’s agency. Indeed, the authors argue that child migrants are not passive victims, but are active in shaping the decision to migrate and the migration journey itself, as they participate, negotiate social statuses, and forge identities. Overall, this book provides much insight and usefully questions several assumptions we make about childhood, especially when undertaking cross-cultural research.</p>
<p>The authors’ use of ethnographic research in rural sending communities, coupled with interviews gathered in migrant destinations, provides rich empirical examples from which to interpret the data and tell children’s stories. However, the reader would be better informed and able to interpret some of the quotations of children interviewed if more information were provided about the methodology used. How were children chosen for interview, and how did this method affect the types of information gathered as well as the analysis and results presented? To what extent can the results be generalized to other regions of Ghana and West Africa?</p>
<p><italic>Child Migration in Africa</italic> fills a substantial gap in our understanding of child migrants’ lived experiences and stands out as a timely contribution to the fields of childhood studies and migration studies. This research serves as a baseline on children’s migration in Africa by providing depth into the types of issues that are important while also considering that children are purposeful, malleable, and embedded within social networks and structures. This research also stands as a call for other studies on this issue to include the perspectives of African children in other locations in order to extend and test the monograph’s conclusions. The argumentation and conclusions stand out as clear and compelling. This accessible, engaging, and timely book should be read and digested by those researching children and those considering children’s needs in both academic and policy realms.</p>
