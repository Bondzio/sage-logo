<p>Marian Barnes offers an important new text which explores the significance of an ethics of care perspective in everyday life. The author examines the role of care in promoting individual and collective well-being by considering care in a range of different contexts. She addresses the relationship between care and justice and considers the role of care ethics in shaping social policy. The text encourages the reader to think more broadly about the contribution of an ethic of care perspective in understanding well-being in everyday settings.</p>
<p>To set the stage, the book begins by reviewing conceptual, philosophical and political perspectives of care. She discusses the concept of the person from an ethic of care viewpoint, exploring the moral principles of care and the relationship between ethics of justice and ethics of care. This provides a context for subsequent chapters which consider the significance of care in different types of interpersonal relationships and specific environments. Chapters Three and Four focus on the relationships and care ethics in family settings and within ‘care work’ settings, whilst Chapters Five and Six focus more widely on care ethics in friendships, with neighbours, in communities and with strangers. The concluding chapters contemplate the role of care ethics in the process of policy making.</p>
<p>The author encourages the reader to appreciate the contribution that a political ethic of care can bring to a range of social and public policies. Throughout the text she draws on her previous work, providing helpful examples of individuals’ lived experiences of giving and receiving care: these illustrations highlight the importance of care as a core value in policy and practice. The text offers a new perspective and fills a gap by placing an ethics of care perspective into the context of current British social policy. Barnes suggests that discourses around care have been ‘abandoned’ by recent policy initiatives, stating that care as a concept is often associated with paternalistic or oppressive practice. She emphasizes, therefore, the need to understand care as a value. This book offers an alternative to the current rhetoric which focuses on the benefits of choice-based and individualized models of support by addressing concerns about the limitations of dominant rights-based political discourses, highlighting the need to take account of collective responsibilities and principles of reciprocity. It enables us to consider the importance of an ethic of care perspective for social policy and practice by illuminating the need for an ethic of care discourse to be integral to policy making to achieve justice for those affected by it. Barnes also goes further to emphasize the importance of participative policy making to ensure that policies respond to the lived experience of giving and receiving care.</p>
<p>Throughout, there are numerous references to prominent feminist care ethicists such as Kittay, Tronto and Sevenhuijsen and I would suggest that for those readers who are not familiar with their theorization it would be beneficial to study them before reading this particular book. However, <italic>Care in Everyday Life</italic> builds upon the existing literature, going beyond earlier contributions focusing on an ethic of care from a moral or political approach, by advancing the discussion to incorporate new insights into the relationship between care ethics and social justice. In summary the book is essential reading for all those who are interested in ethics of care and it is especially relevant for scholars and students who have an interest in social policy, political theory, philosophy and feminist studies.</p>
