<abstract>
<p>This study aims to investigate the mechanisms of individuals’ social interaction with new and existing friends in the blogosphere. It examines not only the direct association between social anxiety and online friendships but also the mediating effects of motivation and self-disclosure on the relation through path analysis. A total of 385 bloggers recruited online responded to the survey questionnaire. The results showed that compared with low socially anxious individuals, those with high social anxiety tended to make fewer new friends, communicated with fewer existing friends via blogs, and had lower relationship quality with those existing friends, but had higher relationship quality with new friends made through blogs. With regard to mediation, the higher the bloggers’ social anxiety, the more motivated they were to make new friends via blogs and the more intimate information they disclosed on their blogs, both of which were, in turn, associated with more new friends and higher quality of new friendships. Interpretations of the findings and implications for understanding the social use of the Internet, especially the competing social compensation hypothesis and rich-get-richer hypothesis, are discussed.</p>

<p>The Internet is “fundamentally social” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0093650211420137">Baym, 2001</xref>, p. 62). Since the emergence of the Internet, scholars have been intrigued by its potential impact on human social interaction. Some researchers, especially at the early stage of the Internet, were concerned that time spent online may reduce individuals’ face-to-face (FtF) interaction with family and friends, leading to loneliness and social isolation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211420137">Caplan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0093650211420137">Kraut et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0093650211420137">Nie, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0093650211420137">Nie, Hillygus, &amp; Erbring, 2002</xref>). Others, however, suggested that the Internet provides unprecedented opportunities for users to expand their social networks and to increase the intimacy of their relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0093650211420137">Bargh &amp; McKenna, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211420137">Kraut et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211420137">McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">2007b</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two competing hypotheses concerning the social consequences of the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211420137">Kraut et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter, Valkenburg, &amp; Schouten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007b</xref>). The social compensation hypothesis suggests that lonely or socially anxious individuals are more likely to be drawn to online communication due to its anonymity, reduced social cues, and greater controllability, whereas the rich-get-richer hypothesis proposes that the Internet is particularly useful for extroverts with strong social skills to enhance their social lives. Both hypotheses have received empirical support in the literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007b</xref>). However, the mechanism of how personal characteristics influence individuals’ online social interaction is still not well understood, which may be partly ascribed to the fact that many studies only looked at the direct association between social anxiety and online interaction, while neglecting factors that may mediate the relationship. The present study seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion by specifically investigating the social interaction taking place in the blogosphere. It not only investigates the direct association between social anxiety and individuals’ online social interaction but also takes into account two possible mediators: motivation and self-disclosure.</p>
<p>Weblog, usually abbreviated as blog, is one of the most popular Web 2.0 tools that emphasize information sharing, networking, and user-centered design. It was estimated that over 70% blogs are diary-style personal blogs with detailed recording of the blogger’s daily life, thoughts, and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0093650211420137">Herring, Scheidt, Wright, &amp; Bonus, 2005</xref>). Besides being a self-expression and self-presentation tool (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0093650211420137">Mazur &amp; Kozarian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0093650211420137">Trammell &amp; Keshelashvili, 2005</xref>), the blog is also a social medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211420137">Baker &amp; Moore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0093650211420137">Blanchard, 2004</xref>). Readers can easily give feedback to blogs or individual blog entries. Moreover, links to other bloggers via blog rings form online communities. Many studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0093650211420137">Baker &amp; Moore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211420137">Bane, Cornish, Erspamer, &amp; Kampman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0093650211420137">Stefanone &amp; Jang, 2007</xref>) have examined the social aspect of blogging.</p>
<p>Early online relationship research had focused on the interactions between strangers. Recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0093650211420137">Ellison, Steinfield, &amp; Lampe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0093650211420137">Ramirez &amp; Broneck, 2009</xref>) have shown that individuals use the Internet not only to establish new relationships but also to maintain existing relationships. The Internet has become increasingly integrated into individuals’ everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211420137">Mesch &amp; Talmud, 2006</xref>). However, very few studies in computer-mediated communication (CMC) have compared how individuals interact with existing friends differently from friends met exclusively online. Therefore, the present study proposes to examine bloggers’ communication with existing friends as well as new friends to find out whether there are different patterns of associations. In addition, this study will include both quantity and quality of friendship as social interaction outcome variables.</p>
<p>In sum, rooted in theory and research on interpersonal communication and CMC, the present study proposes to test two models that specify the social psychological process of blogging. The models tested include four major components: (a) personal characteristics (i.e., social anxiety), (b) blogging motivation (i.e., the motive to make new friends via blogs or the motive to maintain existing friendships through blogs), (c) blogging behavior (i.e., self-disclosure), and (d) social outcomes of blogging (i.e., the number of new and existing friends communicated with through blogs and the quality of these relationships).</p>

<title>Social Anxiety and Online Social Interaction</title>
<p>Social anxiety is the fear of being evaluated negatively in social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0093650211420137">Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211420137">Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982</xref>). According to the self-presentational theory of social anxiety, people tend to be shy or experience social anxiety when they want to make a desired impression on other people but fear that they will fail to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0093650211420137">Schlenker &amp; Leary, 1982</xref>). Individuals who feel shy or anxious in social interactions usually find it difficult to make connection with others and to establish intimate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211420137">Leary &amp; Kowalski, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>As already noted, there are two hypotheses concerning the relationship between social anxiety and online social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211420137">Kraut et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007b</xref>). The social compensation hypothesis proposes that CMC will be particularly useful to socially anxious individuals, who do not, or believe that they do not, possess sufficient social skills to develop intimate relationships in FtF interaction. Researchers have identified a number of unique characteristics of CMC that can help people cope with their social anxiety (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211420137">Walther, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0093650211420137">2002</xref>). The anonymity and greater control of the time, pace, and content of communication in online settings make socially anxious individuals feel safer and more comfortable to interact with others. Moreover, in CMC, most of the social cues indicating negative evaluations disappear, thus helping socially anxious individuals overcome the inhibition they typically experience in FtF interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211420137">McKenna, Green, &amp; Gleason, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0093650211420137">Stritzke, Nguyen, &amp; Durkin, 2004</xref>). On the other hand, the rich-get-richer hypothesis suggests that extroverted people who experience a lower level of anxiety during social interaction will benefit more from CMC. Extroverts already possess strong social skills and are likely to use the powerful Internet to further expand their social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0093650211420137">Kraut et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Both hypotheses have received empirical support in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007b</xref>). Consistent with the social compensation hypothesis, several studies have confirmed the connection between social anxiety and preference for online communication. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al. (2005)</xref> showed that introverted adolescents were more motivated to use CMC to compensate for their deficiency in social skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0093650211420137">Caplan (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211420137">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211420137">2007</xref>) also found a positive association between social anxiety or lack of social skills and individuals’ level of preference for online social interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211420137">Feaster (2010)</xref> discovered that in face-threatening situations, the higher individuals’ social anxiousness was, the more likely they preferred computer-mediated channels over FtF communication.</p>
<p>In summary, due to the potential anonymity, reduced social cues, and greater control of interaction in online communication, socially anxious individuals probably perceive CMC as less threatening and more effective in forming relationships than nonanxious individuals and they are hence more motivated to use it to make new friends.</p>
<list id="list1-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Social anxiety will be positively related to the motive to make new friends through blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Motivation is at the core of the uses and gratifications perspective. According to this approach, media use motivations influence communication behavior and result in various consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0093650211420137">Katz, Blumler, &amp; Gurevitch, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0093650211420137">Rubin, 2002</xref>). Individuals who are highly motivated to use the Internet to compensate for their deficiency in social interaction will probably spend more time online and exert more effort to manage their online relationships. Consequently, they may make more new friends and have higher relationship quality. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter and colleagues (2005)</xref> found that adolescents’ motive for social compensation was positively related to their time spent online, which in turn positively predicted the number of relationships they formed online.</p>
<list id="list2-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The motive to form new friendships will be positively related to the number of new friends made through blogs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The motive to make new friends will be positively related to the quality of new friendships established via blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the possible mediation by motivation, the direct association between social anxiety and the number of new friends made is still expected to be negative. Those who are less anxious in social situations usually possess more outgoing personalities and greater social skills. They may be more easily engaged in online interaction as well as FtF communication, resulting in a greater number of social contacts than those with higher social anxiety. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211420137">Ward and Tracey (2004)</xref> found that although less shyness was experienced online than FtF situations, overall shyness was negatively related to online relationship initiation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al. (2005)</xref> also discovered that extroverts self-disclosed and communicated online more frequently than introverts, and they therefore made more friends.</p>
<list id="list3-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Social anxiety will be negatively related to the number of new friends made through blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although the negative association between social anxiety and quantity of new friendships has been established in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211420137">Ward &amp; Tracey, 2004</xref>), the relationship between social anxiety and friendship quality is still unclear. On one hand, high socially anxious individuals may lack adequate social skills to successfully manage their online friendships, thus harming the quality of these relationships. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0093650211420137">Lee (2009)</xref> found that adolescents’ initial sociability positively predicted their frequency of online communication, which in turn positively predicted their cohesive friendships. On the other hand, because those with higher social anxiety usually have fewer friends offline, they may value their new online relationships more, spend more time and energy maintaining those relationships, and consequently have higher friendship quality. In addition, the anonymity and greater controllability in CMC may enable socially anxious people to engage in selective self-presentation and partner idealization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211420137">O’Sullivan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211420137">Walther, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211420137">2007</xref>), resulting in more intimate relationships. For example, in an experimental study of individuals’ initial interaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211420137">High and Caplan (2009)</xref> found that in CMC dyads, a person’s social anxiety was negatively related to his or her partner’s perception of the anxiety but positively related to the partner’s satisfaction with the interaction.</p>

<sec id="section3-0093650211420137">
<title>Self-Disclosure and Online Social Interaction</title>
<p>Self-disclosure is the revealing of personally relevant experiences, thoughts, and feelings to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211420137">Derlega, Metts, Petronio, &amp; Margulis, 1993</xref>). It is widely believed that self-disclosure is essential to the development and maintenance of close relationships. People who are able to disclose their true self are more likely to form relationships with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211420137">Jourard, 1971</xref>). Moreover, self-disclosure can contribute to relationship closeness and communication satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211420137">Altman &amp; Taylor, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211420137">Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Many researchers have suggested that the computer-mediated environment can lead to greater self-disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211420137">McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211420137">Schouten, Valkenburg, &amp; Peter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211420137">Tidwell &amp; Walther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211420137">Walther, 1996</xref>). First, the reduced nonverbal cues can decrease the risks of self-disclosure. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0093650211420137">Derlega and Chaikin (1977)</xref>, individuals do not engage in self-disclosure until trust has been established between them because of the potential leak of intimate information to mutual acquaintances and the possibility of being ridiculed or rejected. The relative anonymity provided by the Internet can greatly reduce such risks, making individuals more comfortable to share intimate information with each other. Second, the greater control over the time and pace of social interaction in CMC can also reduce individuals’ inhibition, resulting in increased self-disclosure. The disinhibitive effect of CMC on self-disclosure has been supported empirically (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211420137">Joinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211420137">Tidwell &amp; Walther, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The anonymous environment provided by CMC may be particularly useful for socially anxious individuals. In FtF settings, social anxiety has been found to inhibit individuals’ self-disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0093650211420137">Reno &amp; Kenny, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0093650211420137">Wheeless, Nesser, &amp; McCroskey, 1986</xref>). In CMC, however, under the protection of anonymity and reduced social cues, those who experience higher levels of social anxiety in FtF interaction may be encouraged to disclose more and deeper about themselves. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211420137">McKenna and Bargh (2000)</xref> found that lonely and socially anxious individuals tended to feel that they could better express their true selves online than FtF. However, the direct association between social anxiety and self-disclosure online may still be negative. Support for this proposition has been provided by several studies. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter and colleagues (2005)</xref> found that introverted adolescents self-disclosed less often than extroverts in online communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0093650211420137">Ward and Tracey (2004)</xref> also showed that shyness was associated with greater inhibition and less disclosing behaviors online.</p>
<list id="list5-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Social anxiety will be negatively related to self-disclosure in blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As self-disclosure is essential to the development of close relationships, it is predicted that a higher level of self-disclosure should be associated with a greater number of new friends made online and higher friendship quality. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211420137">McKenna et al. (2002)</xref> found that those who disclosed more personal and intimate information reported greater intimacy and closeness to their online friends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211420137">Bane et al.’s (2010)</xref> study of female bloggers found that self-disclosure was positively related to the number of online friendships and satisfaction with online friendships.</p>
<list id="list6-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: Self-disclosure will be positively related to the number of new friends made through blogs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: Self-disclosure will be positively related to the quality of new friendships established via blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The above discussion suggests that social anxiety may influence the number of new friends made both directly and indirectly. The direct association between the two variables is predicted to be negative. The two indirect paths go through the motive to make new friends and self-disclosure, respectively. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0093650211420137">Holbert and Stephenson (2003)</xref>, analyzing mediation is very important for fully understanding the relationships between two variables. Therefore, this study proposes to test the significance of the mediating relationships involving social anxiety and new friendships and poses the following research questions:</p>
<list id="list7-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Will there be significant indirect effects from social anxiety to the number of new friends made via (a) the motive to make new friends and (b) self-disclosure?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Will there be significant indirect effects from social anxiety to quality of new friendships via (a) the motive to make new friends and (b) self-disclosure?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Overall, the hypotheses and research questions proposed above are presented in a path analysis model (Model 1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0093650211420137">
<title>Existing Friendships Maintained Through Blogs</title>
<p>There are some comparative studies of online and offline relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0093650211420137">Chan &amp; Cheng, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0093650211420137">Mesch &amp; Talmud, 2006</xref>), but very few studies have explored how individuals communicate online with new friends differently from existing friends. Social interaction differs as a function of whether the interaction partner is a friend or a stranger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0093650211420137">Tice, Butler, Muraven, &amp; Stillwell, 1995</xref>). Therefore, one additional model (Model 2) is developed to examine bloggers’ online interaction with their existing friends.</p>
<p>As previously reviewed, those with higher social anxiety probably perceive online interaction as less threatening and more comfortable and are more likely to prefer online interaction to FtF communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211420137">Caplan, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211420137">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211420137">Feaster, 2010</xref>). It is predicted that this argument will apply to existing relationships as well as new friendships. In other words, the more socially anxious individuals are, the more motivated they are to use online tools to maintain their existing relationships.</p>
<list id="list8-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 8</italic>: Social anxiety will be positively related to the motive to communicate with existing friends through blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Similar to new relationships, the motive to communicate with existing friends through blogs is predicted to be related to both the number and the quality of these existing friendships. The more motivated individuals are to stay connected with existing friends, the more existing friends they will communicate with through their blogs. Friendship quality will benefit from high motivation as well. Those with higher motivation to communicate with existing friends through blogs will probably allocate more time and attention to these relationships, resulting in higher friendship quality.</p>

<p>In the interpersonal communication literature, it has been well established that high social anxiety is associated with a smaller social network and lower relationship quality in FtF interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0093650211420137">Leary &amp; Kowalski, 1995</xref>). When offline relationships migrate online, no dramatic change is expected to emerge. Those with higher social anxiety will have fewer friends to communicate with through blogs because they tend to have fewer friends in the offline world due to their anxiety and poor social skills. In the same vein, the higher the bloggers’ social anxiety is, the lower the quality of their existing friendships will be, even though they also communicate with these friends via their blogs.</p>
<list id="list10-0093650211420137" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 11</italic>: Social anxiety will be negatively related to the number of existing friends communicated with through blogs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 12</italic>: Social anxiety will be negatively related to the quality of existing friendships maintained through blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Regarding self-disclosure, it is predicted that bloggers’ online disclosure will not be directly related to the number of exiting friends communicated with through blogs because this number is primarily determined offline by bloggers’ overall social network size. However, online self-disclosure may be associated with higher quality of existing friendships. Bloggers may disclose intimate information that they would not talk about in FtF settings, which helps build intimacy with their offline friends, thus improving the quality of their relationships. In an ethnographic study of teenage girls’ blogs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211420137">Bortree (2005)</xref> showed that teenage girls shared substantial private thoughts and feelings with their offline friends in their blogs and that this kind of disclosure increased their closeness with these friends. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211420137">Valkenburg and Peter’s (2009)</xref> longitudinal study also found that instant messaging use increased adolescents’ intimate disclosure online, which in turn enhanced the quality of their existing friendships.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 13</italic>: Self-disclosure will be positively related to the quality of existing friendships maintained through blogs.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Taken together, the above hypotheses indicate an indirect influence from social anxiety to existing friendships mediated by the motive to communicate with existing friends via blogs and self-disclosure. Thus, the following two research questions are proposed:</p>

<sec id="section6-0093650211420137">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The present study employed an online questionnaire with questions about personal characteristics, blogging motivations, blogging behavior, blogging social outcomes, and demographic information. The questionnaire included other measures reported elsewhere. This research was approved by a university institutional review board and the author obtained informed consents from all participants.</p>
<p>A convenience sample was selected from several popular blog-hosting websites, including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Livejournal.com">Livejournal.com</ext-link>, Blogger.com, and Wordpress.com, through their random selection features, such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Livejournal.com">Livejournal.com</ext-link>’s “Random Journal” and Blogger.com’s “Blogs updated” and “Next Blog” function. Before any invitation to participate was sent out, the selected blogs were first checked to make sure they met all the preset criteria. First, there had to be evidence that the blogger was at least 18 years old. This information was either obtained from the blogger’s profile or inferred from cues in profile or blog entries. If the researcher could not determine whether a blogger was at least 18, he or she was not invited to participate in the study. Second, the blog needed to be written primarily in English, but the blogger could be located anywhere in the world. Third, the blog had to be a personal blog, which means it is maintained by one individual and primarily talks about the author’s everyday experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Filter blogs that mainly comment on external contents and blogs that primarily contain photographs or videos were excluded. Finally, the blog had to have at least five entries and had to have been updated in the past month. This was intended to exclude those abandoned blogs.</p>
<p>About 2,000 invitations with a link to the online questionnaire were sent out via emails or online messages to blog authors who met the above criteria. A total of 534 bloggers responded to the questionnaire, 385 of whom answered the questions relevant to the present study and were therefore kept in the sample.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0093650211420137">
<title>Respondents</title>
<p>There were more female respondents (79.3%) than males (20.7%), which is consistent with the gender composition of personal bloggers identified by several other studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0093650211420137">Herring, Kouper, Scheidt, &amp; Wright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0093650211420137">Huffaker &amp; Calvert, 2005</xref>). The participants’ reported age ranged from 18 to 69, with a mean of 29.83 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.62). Regarding ethnicity, 83.5% of the participants identified themselves as “White,” 9.7% as “Asian/Pacific Islander,” 2.0% as “African American/Black,” 2.0% as “Hispanic/Latino(a),” and 2.8% as “Other” or multiethnic. The respondents’ highest level of formal education was reported to be “some high school or less” (1.6%), “high school diploma” (9.3%), “some college” (30.9%), “college/university degree” (39.7%), or “graduate degree” (18.4%). The majority (82.7%) of the respondents indicated that they currently live in North America.</p>

<title>Measurement</title>
<sec id="section9-0093650211420137">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>The respondents’ motivations for online social interaction were measured by seven items.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0093650211420137">1</xref></sup> Four items measured their motive to make new friends through their blogs (“I blog to establish new friendships”; “I blog to meet new friends”; “I blog to expand my social network”; “I blog to make some friends”; Cronbach’s α = .92) and three items measured their motive to stay connected with existing friends (“I blog to communicate with my offline friends”; “I blog to maintain connection with my existing friends”; “I blog to stay in touch with my offline friends”; Cronbach’s α = .86).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0093650211420137">
<title>Social anxiety</title>
<p>Social anxiety was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0093650211420137">Leary’s (1983)</xref> Interaction Anxiousness Scale. The scale includes 15 items, examples of which include “I usually feel uncomfortable when I am in a group of people I don’t know” and “I seldom feel anxious in social situations” (reverse coded). Higher scores on this scale indicate greater social anxiety. The Cronbach’s alpha was .92.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0093650211420137">
<title>Self-disclosure</title>
<p>Self-disclosure was assessed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0093650211420137">Miller, Berg, and Archer’s (1983)</xref> Self-Disclosure Index. This scale contains 10 items and has been used to measure self-disclosure to friends as well as to strangers. The wording of the statements was slightly modified to reflect self-disclosure in blogs. Sample items include “In my blog, I talk about what I like and dislike about myself” and “In my blog, I reveal my close relationships with other people.” The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .85.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0093650211420137">
<title>Blogging social network</title>
<p>The respondents were asked to report how many new friends they had made via their blogs. They were also asked to estimate how many existing friends, to their knowledge, read their blogs or interacted with them through their blogs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0093650211420137">
<title>Quality of friendship</title>
<p>The quality of new friendships formed through blogs was measured by nine items from the Network of Relationship Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0093650211420137">Furman &amp; Buhrmester, 1985</xref>). The items were from three 3-item subscales of the inventory: satisfaction, support, and intimacy. Examples of the items include “how often are you happy with your relationships with these new friends?” (satisfaction), “how often do you turn to these friends for support with personal problems?” (support), and “how much do you share your secrets and private feelings with your new friends?” (intimacy). All of these items were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale with 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> and 5 = <italic>very/very much</italic>. Ratings on the nine items were averaged to form a quality of friendship score. The Cronbach’s alpha was .90. The same nine-item scale was adapted to measure the respondents’ relationship quality with existing friends who read their blogs or communicated with them through their blogs (Cronbach’s α = .93).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 19.0) for descriptives and correlations and the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS 19.0) for path analysis. Prior to running the analyses, the data were screened for outliers. One case with an extreme number of new friends made through blogs (500) was removed from the data set. Missing data (3.70%) were replaced using multiple imputation provided by SPSS 19.0 Missing Values.</p>
<p>The skewness and kurtosis statistics of all observed measures were inspected to determine whether they were normally distributed. The majority of the variables’ absolute skewness and kurtosis values were less than 2, except for two variables, the number of new friends made through blogs (skewness = 4.35; kurtosis = 23.52) and the number of existing friends communicated with through blogs (skewness = 4.24; kurtosis = 23.81). The nonnormal distribution problem was amended by bootstrapping technique in the path analysis. Bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0093650211420137">Efron &amp; Tibshirani, 1993</xref>) is a resampling technique that is particularly useful for small sample sizes or nonnormally distributed data.</p>
<p>Of the 384 participants remaining in the sample, 290 reported that they had made at least one new friend through blogs and 351 said that they had communicated with at least one existing friend via their blogs. Consequently, those who did not make any new friends and those who did not communicate with any existing friends did not answer the relevant questions about friendship quality. As path analysis does not allow missing values, only those 290 bloggers who reported making new friends were included in the analysis for Model 1 and those 351 who reported communicating with existing friends via blogs were analyzed in Model 2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0093650211420137">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In both models, the error terms of the quantity and quality of friendships were allowed to covary as they are equivalent constructs in the model that measure different aspects of online social interaction outcomes. They may have something in common in addition to the shared variance explained in the model. The path analyses in the present study were performed by bootstrapping provided by AMOS 19.0 with 5,000 bootstrap samples drawn. The coefficients depicted in the models and reported in the text are all standardized path coefficients. The tests of their significance were based upon bias-corrected percentile method. The descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations of the variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0093650211420137">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Model 1</title>
<p>The first proposed model consisted of one exogenous variable (social anxiety) and two endogenous variables (the number of new friends made and the quality of new friendships), with the motive to make new friends and self-disclosure as mediating constructs. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0093650211420137">Hu and Bentler’s (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0093650211420137">Kline’s (2011)</xref> discussion on model fit evaluation, Model 1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0093650211420137">Figure 1</xref>) seemed to fit the data adequately, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 290) = 1.14, <italic>p</italic> = .29; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .022 with the 90% confidence interval from .00 to .16; comparative fit index (CFI) = 1.00; standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .017.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis predicted a positive association between social anxiety and the motive to make new friends through blogs. This hypothesis was supported, β = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. According to Hypotheses 2 and 3, the motive to make new friends should be positively related to both the number of new friends made and the quality of new friendships. These two hypotheses were both confirmed (β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01; β = .26, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, respectively). Consistent with Hypothesis 4, social anxiety was found to be negatively related to the number of new friends made, β = −.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. In contrast, the association between social anxiety and quality of new friendships (Research question 1) turned out to be positive, β = .12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. In other words, the higher the respondents’ social anxiety, the higher their new friendship quality.</p>
<p>The three hypotheses concerning self-disclosure were also tested by the path coefficients. The predicted negative relationship between social anxiety and self-disclosure was not observed. Instead, a significant positive correlation between the two variables was detected, β = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Therefore, Hypothesis 5 was not confirmed. In support of Hypothesis 6, the association between self-disclosure and the number of new friends made was positive and significant, β = .13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Hypothesis 7 was supported by a significant positive relationship between self-disclosure and the quality of new friendships, β = .35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Research question 2 asked whether there would be indirect effects from social anxiety to the number of new friends made through two mediators, the motive to make new friends and self-disclosure. To address this question, a bootstrapping approach for multiple-mediator analysis recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211420137">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> was adopted. The indirect effects were tested using an SPSS macro provided by Preacher and Hayes with 5,000 bootstrapping samples drawn. Ninety-five percent bias-corrected confidence intervals were used to evaluate the significance of the indirect effects. A confidence interval that does not include zero indicates a significant effect. The results indicated that the indirect effect via the motive to make new friends (95% CI [0.051, 1.18]) and the indirect path via self-disclosure (95% CI [0.058, 1.29]) were both significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093650211420137">Table 2</xref> for detailed estimates).</p>

<p>To address Research question 3, the significance of the indirect effects from social anxiety to the quality of new friendships were also tested, using the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211420137">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref>.The indirect effect via the motive to make new friends (95% CI [.004, .072]) and the indirect effect via self-disclosure (95% CI [.028, .13]) were also both significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0093650211420137">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Model 2</title>
<p>Besides bloggers’ social interaction with new friends, the present study also investigated how social anxiety, motivation, and self-disclosure influence individuals’ interaction with existing friends through blogs in a separate model. The estimation of Model 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0093650211420137">Figure 2</xref>) suggested that this model also fit the data satisfactorily, χ<sup>2</sup>(2, <italic>N</italic> = 351) = 2.66, <italic>p</italic> = .27; RMSEA = .031 with the 90% confidence interval from .00 to .12; CFI = .99; SRMR = .023.</p>

<p>Hypothesis 8 proposed that social anxiety would be positively related to the motive to communicate with existing friends through blogs. This hypothesis was not supported, β = .06, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. As predicted by Hypotheses 9 and 10, the motive to maintain existing friendships through blogs was positively related to the number of existing friends communicated with through blogs (β = .19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and the quality of these existing friendships (β = .16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The direct association between social anxiety and the number of existing friendships maintained through blogs was negative, β = −.19 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. So was the relationship between social anxiety and the quality of existing friendships, β = −.35, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Therefore, both Hypotheses 11 and 12 were confirmed. As predicted by Hypothesis 13, self-disclosure was positively related to the quality of existing friendships, β = .23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Research question 4 asked whether there would be an indirect effect from social anxiety to the number of existing friendships maintained via blogs through the motive to communicate with existing friends. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0093650211420137">Preacher and Hayes (2008)</xref> method indicated that this indirect effect was not significant (95% CI [−.21, .89], see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0093650211420137">Table 3</xref>). Research question 5 concerned the indirect effect from social anxiety to the quality of existing friendships. The results suggested that the indirect path via the motive to stay connected with existing friends was not significant (95% CI [−.007, .033]), but the indirect path through self-disclosure was significant (95% CI [.016, .087]).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined individuals’ social interaction with new and existing friends in the blogosphere through path analysis. Overall, the findings extended our knowledge about the dynamics of the blogosphere and the social uses of the Internet. First, this study examined not only the direct association between social anxiety and online social interaction but also the mediators of the relationship, which have been largely overlooked in previous research. Second, the present study provided further insight concerning the social compensation hypothesis and the rich-get-richer hypothesis. The findings provided support for both hypotheses, indicating that both high and low socially anxious individuals can benefit from online interaction. Third, the present study compared individuals’ communication with new friends versus existing friends via blogs and identified different patterns of association between these two types of communication and other constructs, which have important implications for CMC research and theories. The interpretations of the specific findings are discussed in the following sections.</p>
<sec id="section19-0093650211420137">
<title>Social Anxiety, Motivation, and Online Social Interaction</title>
<p>The present study examined how individuals’ social anxiety was related to their online social interaction. The findings suggested that individuals with higher social anxiety were more motivated to use blogs to make new friends. This is probably because the anonymity, the lack of social cues, and the greater control over communication in the blogosphere make highly anxious individuals feel more comfortable to interact with others. This result resonates with evidence that those with high social anxiety prefer CMC channels to FtF communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211420137">Caplan, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0093650211420137">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0093650211420137">Feaster, 2010</xref>).The more motivated the bloggers were, the more new friends they made and the higher the quality of these new friendships. In other words, motivation mediated the relationship between social anxiety and online social interaction outcomes. These findings further highlight the importance of taking motivation into consideration when examining online interaction, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al. (2005)</xref>. The social consequences of the Internet may partly depend on individuals’ motives for using the medium.</p>
<p>When it comes to the direct association between social anxiety and quantity of friendships, this study found that highly anxious individuals made fewer new friends than those with lower social anxiety and they also communicated with fewer existing friends through their blogs. These results are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al.’s (2005)</xref> study, which found that introverted adolescents were more motivated to use CMC for social interaction, which in turn facilitated their online friendship formation, but, overall, introverts communicated online less frequently and thus made fewer friends than extroverts. In other words, despite their high motivation and the safer, more comfortable interaction environment provided by the Internet, those with high social anxiety still have smaller social networks than do those with low anxiety due to their weak social skills.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between social anxiety and quality of friendship, an interesting difference was identified. Specifically, social anxiety was negatively related to the quality of existing friendships maintained through blogs but positively related to the quality of new friendships formed via blogs. This result is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211420137">McKenna et al.’s (2002)</xref> finding that those who scored high on social anxiety were more likely to locate the “real me” online, which in turn led to more rapid development of intimacy and closer relationships. It is possible that high socially anxious individuals have fewer friends and lower relationship quality offline due to their anxiety and poor social skills. However, belongingness is a fundamental human need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0093650211420137">Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995</xref>). When their interpersonal needs cannot be fulfilled by FtF communication, they may resort to CMC channels to satisfy these needs. Therefore, high socially anxious individuals may become more dependent on the new relationships they establish online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0093650211420137">Mazur &amp; Burns, 2000</xref>) and devote more resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0093650211420137">Caplan, 2005</xref>) to these relationships, resulting in higher relationship quality.</p>
<p>Moreover, CMC provides greater control over the pace and content of interaction, allowing socially anxious individuals to manage the impressions they make on others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0093650211420137">O’Sullivan, 2000</xref>). As suggested by the hyperpersonal perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211420137">Tidwell &amp; Walther, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0093650211420137">Walther, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0093650211420137">2007</xref>), CMC enables people to “engage in selective self-presentation and partner idealization, enacting exchanges more intimate than those of FtF counterparts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0093650211420137">Tidwell &amp; Walther, 2002</xref>, p. 320). Through the selective presentation of favorable information, the idealization of interaction partners, and mutual feedback, socially anxious individuals may perceive deeper intimacy and higher relationship quality with their exclusively online friends. In an attempt to corroborate the hyperpersonal perspective, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211420137">High and Caplan (2009)</xref> hypothesized that the negative association between an individual’s social anxiety and his or her partner’s conversational satisfaction with their initial interactions should be attenuated in CMC compared with FtF settings. However, this prediction was not supported. Instead, they found a positive relationship between social anxiety and partner’s communication satisfaction in a CMC setting, but no such association in FtF interaction. When interpreting this seemingly surprising result, High and Caplan suggested that there may be a “boundary condition” (p. 480) to the hyperpersonal perspective that involves motivation. In other words, socially anxious individuals may be more motivated to employ the hyperpersonal features to benefit their online social interaction. The results of the present study seem to substantiate this claim. Of course, more research is needed to further confirm and explain the positive association between social anxiety and the quality of relationships established online.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0093650211420137">
<title>Self-Disclosure</title>
<p>The hypothesized negative association between social anxiety and self-disclosure was not observed in the present study. Instead, a significant positive relationship was found between the two constructs. That is, the more socially anxious the bloggers were, the more likely they were to disclose about themselves in their blogs. This is in line with the argument that the Internet will facilitate self-disclosure, especially for those who are inhibited in FtF interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0093650211420137">Joinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211420137">McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0093650211420137">Schouten et al. (2007)</xref> found that social anxiety was positively related to adolescents’ perception of the reduced nonverbal cues and controllability in CMC, which in turn led to higher disinhibition and more self-disclosure. In other words, those who experience higher levels of anxiety in traditional social interaction perceive CMC as a safer place to express intimate aspects of themselves, without or with less fear of disapproval and rejection.</p>
<p>The present study provides additional evidence of the essential role of self-disclosure in relationship initiation and maintenance, even when they are mediated by the Internet. Consistent with research results in interpersonal communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0093650211420137">Altman &amp; Taylor, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0093650211420137">Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0093650211420137">Derlega et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0093650211420137">Jourard, 1971</xref>) and CMC (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0093650211420137">Bane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0093650211420137">McKenna &amp; Bargh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0093650211420137">McKenna et al., 2002</xref>), the disclosure of intimate, personal information on blogs was positively associated with not only the number of new friends made but also the quality of these new relationships. With regard to existing relationships, online self-disclosure was found to be positively related to the quality of existing friendships maintained through blogs. That is, even though the bloggers and their readers already knew each other offline, the more they disclosed about themselves in their blogs, the higher the quality of their relationships. This may be because blogs provide a venue for people to reveal information they would otherwise be uncomfortable about disclosing, which helps their friends to get a deeper understanding of them and builds closeness and intimacy among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0093650211420137">Bortree, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0093650211420137">
<title>Direct and Indirect Effects</title>
<p>The present study examined both the direct associations between social anxiety and bloggers’ social interaction outcomes, and the roles of two intervening variables, motivation and self-disclosure, in the relations. The inclusion of mediation greatly increased the explanatory power of the models and contributed to the ongoing discussions concerning the social compensation hypothesis and the rich-get-richer hypothesis. The direct negative associations between social anxiety and the quantity (new and existing) and quality (existing) of online friendships provide support for the rich-get-richer hypothesis, whereas the positive, indirect paths through motivation and self-disclosure, and the direct positive relationship between social anxiety and the quality of new friendships are consistent with the social compensation hypothesis. Specifically, in support of the rich-get-richer hypothesis, this study found that those who had lower levels of social anxiety not only tended to make more new friends than those with higher social anxiety but also communicated with more existing friends through their blogs and had higher friendship quality with these existing friends. These results indicate that less socially anxious individuals are able to employ their strong social skills to maintain or to further expand social networks in the blogosphere. On the other hand, in line with the social compensation hypothesis, this study found that individuals with higher levels of social anxiety were more motivated to use blogs to form new friendships and they also disclosed more intimate information than those with lower social anxiety, both of which were related to a greater number of new friends and higher quality of new friendships. Moreover, those with higher social anxiety were found to have higher quality relationships with their new friends than those with lower social anxiety.</p>
<p>In sum, the findings from the present study suggest that both low socially anxious and high socially anxious individuals can benefit from online communication. For low socially anxious individuals, the Internet may serve as a supplement to their FtF interaction, via which they can stay connected with existing friends or make new friends to further expand their already large social networks. For high socially anxious individuals, CMC may serve as a functional alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0093650211420137">Papacharissi &amp; Rubin, 2000</xref>) to FtF communication, by which they can compensate for their inadequate offline social interaction to satisfy their interpersonal needs. Therefore, the social compensation hypothesis and the rich-get-richer hypothesis should not be framed as two opposing, mutually exclusive perspectives. Indeed, similar to the present study, several others also found support for both hypotheses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0093650211420137">Peter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0093650211420137">Zywica &amp; Danowski, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0093650211420137">
<title>Limitations and Suggestions for Future Research</title>
<p>Some limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the self-report nature of the data may not accurately assess respondents’ motivation and behavior due to memory loss and estimation error. For example, this study asked the respondents to report how many new friends they made through blogging and how many existing friends they communicated with via their blogs. The estimation of both numbers could be biased simply because the respondents’ definitions of friends vary or because some offline friends read their blogs without their knowledge. Also, it could be difficult for some respondents to distinguish between these two types of friends as some friends met initially online may later become friends in their offline lives.</p>
<p>Second, related to the design of the study, bloggers who did not make any new friends or did not communicate with any existing friends were excluded from the relevant path analysis. Those included and those excluded do differ on some measures but in ways consistent with the current findings. An examination of the zero-order correlations among the constructs further increased the author’s confidence that the results were not biased as a result of excluding those incomplete cases. Nevertheless, the findings should be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Third, although this study is theory driven, the causal directions of the relationships among the variables cannot be determined by cross-sectional data. It is possible that the direction of some paths may be reversed and there may be extraneous variables accounting for the observed associations. However, the few existing longitudinal (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0093650211420137">Valkenburg &amp; Peter, 2009</xref>) and experimental (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0093650211420137">High &amp; Caplan, 2009</xref>) studies did provide evidence consistent with the current findings. Of course, more studies that can specify the direction of causality and rule out alternative interpretations are badly needed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study investigated individuals’ social interaction with new and existing friends in the blogosphere. The results provide further insight into the social use of the Internet. However, further research is needed to confirm whether the findings from this study apply to other computer-mediated settings, such as instant messaging, social networking sites, YouTube, and Twitter. The blog is primarily an asynchronous communication tool; it is unclear whether different mechanisms would be involved in synchronous interaction. The present study was an exploratory investigation of bloggers’ social interaction motives and outcomes with new friends versus existing friends and found some intriguing results. Future research should further investigate how individuals use the Internet to maintain their existing relationships and how it differs from their communication with friends made online.</p>
