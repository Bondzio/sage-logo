<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Community treatment orders (CTOs) mandate the outpatient treatment of mental disorders through medications and other services. Individuals issued CTOs commonly display complex and chronic presentations of mental disorders, and are largely managed by long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491845">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491845">2</xref></sup> The routine use of antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose antipsychotics are discouraged, due to the risk of serious adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491845">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491845">4</xref></sup> While persistence with antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose antipsychotics has been studied in outpatient populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491845">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491845">6</xref></sup> no previous study has evaluated persistence when CTOs are renewed. The objectives of our study were to determine the prevalence of psychotropic drug-regimen changes between CTOs, and to evaluate persistence with antipsychotic polypharmacy and high-dose antipsychotics.</p>
<p>We undertook a retrospective study of 378 individuals, randomly selected from a sample of 1317 individuals with a CTO expiry date of ≤ April 30, 2010, taken from all 2856 individuals issued a CTO by the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal in 2009. De-identified information relating the individuals’ treatment plans, demographics and clinical details were systematically extracted. Individual records were reviewed to determine whether their CTO was renewed after expiry. Any changes made to their subsequent treatment plan were documented. Antipsychotic polypharmacy referred to the concurrent use of two or more different antipsychotics. High-dose antipsychotics referred to a single or combined daily antipsychotic dose percentage above 100%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491845">3</xref></sup> of the absolute maximum doses recommended in an international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491845">7</xref></sup> Persistent antipsychotic polypharmacy and/or high-dose antipsychotic use was defined as those individuals without any change in these parameters between CTOs.</p>
<p>In total, 236 (62%) individuals had their CTO renewed; 67% were male and the mean age was 43.0 (SD 13.2) years. Schizophrenia, schizotypal or delusional disorder was diagnosed in 90% of individuals and the mean duration of illness was 15.0 (SD 10.3) years. The mean duration between issued CTOs was 7 months. Of the 236 individuals with a renewed CTO, 128 (54%) had evidence of a psychotropic drug-regimen change. Dose changes were the most prevalent, with a documented decrease in dose observed in 47 (37%) individuals and an increase in dose observed in 34 (27%) individuals.</p>
<p>A total of 49 (21%) individuals had a documented change to their antipsychotic regimen, with an overall reduction accounting for most cases (<italic>n</italic> = 32; 14%). This included either conversion to antipsychotic monotherapy (<italic>n</italic> = 19; 8%) or to standard-dose antipsychotics (<italic>n</italic> = 21; 9%). In contrast, prescribed antipsychotics increased for 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 19) of individuals. We found that 14 (6%) individuals converted to antipsychotic polypharmacy and 11 (5%) individuals converted to high-dose antipsychotics. Overall, antipsychotic polypharmacy was persistently prescribed to 26% (<italic>n</italic> = 61) of individuals and high-dose antipsychotics to 18% (<italic>n</italic> = 43).</p>
<p>The finding that 54% of individuals had evidence of a psychotropic drug-regimen change suggested that regimens are frequently reviewed when renewing CTOs. Although major changes to antipsychotic regimens were less common than changes to psychotropic drug-regimens overall, the number of individuals converted to monotherapy or standard-dose antipsychotics was also encouraging. However, we were not able to determine the reasons for the psychotropic drug-regimen changes. Determining whether these changes occurred due to adverse events or changes in symptom control would be an important topic for future research.</p>
<p>Antipsychotic polypharmacy was persistently prescribed to 26% of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491845">6</xref></sup> Similarly, in a sample of Canadian outpatients, antipsychotic polypharmacy was persistently prescribed to 26% of individuals after 3 months. However, these rates are higher than those in a study evaluating antipsychotic polypharmacy rates across four European countries over 12 months, which found that antipsychotic polypharmacy was persistently prescribed to 13% of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491845">5</xref></sup> These observed differences may be due to regional variations in drug use patterns.</p>
<p>The rate of persistent high-dose antipsychotics that we observed in our study (18%) was lower than both the rates reported among outpatients with schizophrenia in Europe (28%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491845">5</xref></sup> and Canada (30%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491845">6</xref></sup> However, these differences are likely a consequence of different classifications to define high-dose antipsychotics. The definition we adopted in our study was based on a recent international consensus study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491845">7</xref></sup> whereas the other two studies applied drug utilisation statistics. Although schizophrenia treatment guidelines recommend that minimum effective doses of antipsychotics be used in the maintenance phase of treatment, there is little guidance as to how often dosage reviews should be undertaken.</p>
<p>The results of this study provide the first detailed analysis of longer-term antipsychotic prescribing in CTOs, among a representative sample of individuals from New South Wales. While changes in psychotropic drug-regimens were common between issued CTOs, about one-fifth corresponded with major changes in antipsychotic regimens. There were 26% of individuals persistently prescribed antipsychotic polypharmacy and 18% prescribed high-dose antipsychotics. This may reflect the complex clinical need of individuals issued a CTO and their increased requirements for antipsychotics. Determining the clinical implications associated with these observations is warranted in future studies and across other jurisdictions.</p>
