<abstract>
<p>High attrition often limits the efficacy of weight management programs, particularly those that serve primary care patients. We investigated stage of change and other predictors of retention in a behavioral intervention program that enrolled adult obese patients at three primary care sites. The program included practice improvements and provider training, as well as individual lifestyle counseling and educational group classes for participants. We analyzed predictors of whether participants returned for counseling visits and whether they attended group classes. The 461 participants were mainly women (84%) and minorities (87%), and most of them were in the preparation stage for dietary and physical activity changes. A total of 134 (29%) participants returned for at least one follow-up visit with their counselor and 85 (18%) attended at least one class. Baseline stage of change was not significantly associated with either return visits or class attendance (<underline>p</underline> = .875 and .182, respectively). Men and participants with children in the household were less likely to return for subsequent counseling sessions (<underline>p</underline> = .012 and .027, respectively). Age and employment were associated with class attendance (<underline>p</underline> = .099 and .034, respectively). Focus groups with participants confirmed that reasons for dropout included physical limitations or health issues, family issues, stress, and lack of social support. We conclude that prescreening of patients for readiness to participate and attention to personal barriers related to family and work might improve program retention. More frequent contacts between visits and stronger provider engagement might also strengthen the intervention.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Weight management studies have become a focus of research because of the high prevalence of obesity, and particularly the elevated rates among low-socioeconomic and minority groups. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912460871">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2010)</xref>, the prevalence of obesity in the United States is 28%, and it is even higher among African Americans and Hispanics. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524839912460871">U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2003)</xref> recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity and then direct them to intense counseling and behavioral interventions for weight management. However, only 42% of patients receive recommendations from physicians to lose weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912460871">Galuska, Will, Serdula, &amp; Ford, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, attrition can be very high among those who enroll in a behavioral or lifestyle weight management program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912460871">M. J. Davis &amp; Addis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912460871">Douketis, Macie, Thabane, &amp; Williamson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839912460871">Wadden, Crerand, &amp; Brock, 2005</xref>). Dropout rates of up to 83% at 3 months have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912460871">Grossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas, Early, Fredericksin, &amp; O’Brien, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912460871">Inelmen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde, Rothman, Baldwin, &amp; Jeffery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska, Norcross, Fowler, Follick, &amp; Abrams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912460871">Riebe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912460871">Teixeira et al., 2002</xref>), and they tend to be higher for programs or interventions directed toward primary care patients rather than volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912460871">Calfas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912460871">Hardcastle, Taylor, Bailey, &amp; Castle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912460871">Kumanyika et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912460871">Macqueen, Brynes, &amp; Frost, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912460871">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912460871">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912460871">Nanchahal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912460871">Read, Ramwell, Storer, &amp; Webber, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The use of motivational techniques can potentially increase participants’ confidence in their success in the program and hence decrease the likelihood of dropout. One such approach is based on the transtheoretical model (TTM), which was originally created to identify an individual’s readiness to quit smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912460871">DiClemente, Prochaska, &amp; Gibertini, 1985</xref>) but has also been applied frequently to weight management intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912460871">Andres, Gomez, &amp; Sandana, 2007</xref>). The stage of change construct within the TTM follows a person’s movement from precontemplation of weight loss to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight and has been reported to be associated with both program participation and actual weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912460871">Glanz, Rimer, &amp; Viswanath, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>). Multiple other factors have also been reported to be associated with program attrition, such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912460871">Hardcastle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912460871">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912460871">Nanchahal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>), race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912460871">Calfas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>), a host of social and family issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912460871">Grossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912460871">Inelmen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912460871">Read et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912460871">Teixeira et al., 2002</xref>), and personal motivation, prior weight loss attempts, expectations, and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912460871">M. J. Davis &amp; Addis, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The Clinic–Community Intervention Program (CCIP) was a multicomponent intervention among obese adult patients in primary care practice. The study design was based on the chronic care model and involved interventions that included participants, providers, counselors, and health educators in an effort to alter lifestyle behaviors, such as diet and exercise. The main study data are currently being analyzed, but it is evident that the program suffered from a high degree of attrition. The goal of the analyses presented in this article was to identify predictors of participant retention in the program, including stage of change.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1524839912460871">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The CCIP was designed as an intervention program aiming to reduce the obesity rate in urban areas of Philadelphia. Participants were patients of three primary care clinics (Jefferson University Hospital’s Family Medicine Associates practice, a university hospital family practice; the Philadelphia Department of Public Health’s Health Center 6, a city clinic mainly serving a disadvantaged Hispanic population; and Jefferson Healthcare Fairmont, a private family practice) and were referred by their providers. Patients were eligible to participate if they were between 18 and 55 years old and were obese at the index office visit (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The intervention entailed periodic sessions between each participant and a study lifestyle counselor every 3 months. During these sessions, the participant and counselor discussed weight-related behaviors and goals and developed or revised a personalized action plan to improve diet and physical activity. Occasional phone calls also took place during the first month. Participants were also invited to attend biweekly educational group classes during which a trained study health educator covered various topics relevant to obesity, such as using the food guide pyramid, reading food labels, healthy meal planning, supermarket tours, shopping on a budget, cooking healthy for a family, healthy snacking, dining out, healthier shopping at corner stores, and incorporating physical activity into daily life. Some class cycles were bilingual, conducted by a bilingual health educator (Spanish/English). The study did not provide any monetary incentives for participation, although raffles with small prizes (e.g., measuring cups, fruit baskets, pedometers, and gym passes) were held among participants of the group classes. The study implemented provider training and practice improvements at the participating sites (e.g., motivational interviewing training, presentations on obesity management guidelines, placement of BMI charts in examining rooms, and feedback regarding enrolled patients’ progress), but most participants’ physicians were not directly involved in the intervention activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524839912460871">
<title>Study Measures</title>
<p>Data were collected from questionnaires administered during counseling visits and via direct measurements (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure). BMI was computed as weight divided by height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Information was also collected on sociodemographic, family, and lifestyle factors. A 24-hour recall was used to assess diet, and the information was then processed through the Nutritional Analysis Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.myfoodrecord.com/">http://www.myfoodrecord.com/</ext-link>). Total caloric intake was computed and classified as below recommended calories (≤1,500 calories), recommended calories (1,501-2,000), and above recommended calories (&gt;2,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524839912460871">U.S. Department of Agriculture &amp; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Physical activity was assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Short Form (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ipaq.ki.se/ipaq.htm">http://www.ipaq.ki.se/ipaq.htm</ext-link>). Total metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week were computed and categorized as none, below recommended (&lt;500 MET minutes/week [MET min/wk]), recommended (500-1,000), and above recommended (&gt;1,000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524839912460871">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The assessment of the participants’ willingness to adopt lifestyle changes to lose weight was optional and was performed systematically by three of the four study counselors. The assessment was based on the TTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912460871">Glanz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>). We used three items to measure the participants’ stage of change regarding increasing physical activity, increasing fruit and vegetable intake, and decreasing fat intake. Stage of change was classified as follows: (a) precontemplation (does not intend to take action within 6 months), (b) contemplation (intends to alter behavior within the next 6 months), (c) preparation (has either taken steps within the past year to alter behavior or is willing within the month to take some action), (d) action (has made defined changes within his or her life to meet requirements for altering his or her behavior), (e) measurable change (has made measurable changes), and (f) maintenance (has made a continual effort to maintain the new lifestyle). For the main analyses, we computed the average and the maximum stage of change across the three dimensions.</p>
<p>At the end of the study, four focus groups were conducted to identify why patients did or did not enroll or, once enrolled, why they dropped out. These focus groups included 11 CCIP participants and five patients who were initially referred but opted not to enroll in the CCIP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524839912460871">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The main outcomes were whether a participant returned for any follow-up counseling visits and whether he or she attended any group classes. The main predictor of interest was the participant’s average of the three stage-of-change dimensions (physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and fat intake). We hypothesized that participants with a higher starting stage of change would be more likely to remain in the program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>). We also investigated the role of sex, age, race, education, employment, marital status, family structure, smoking, drinking, physical activity (MET min/wk), caloric intake (total calories), medications, and comorbidities. The analyses were based on cross-classification and logistic regression. For each outcome, the final multivariable logistic regression model was determined via a backward elimination algorithm. The final model included stage of change, site, counselor, sex, age, and race, irrespective of their statistical significance; it also included any other variables that were significant at the .1 level. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.2.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 784 patients were enrolled into the CCIP and were seen by four different lifestyle counselors at the three participating primary care clinics. Data on participant stage of change were collected by three of the four study counselors, who saw a total of 499 participants and obtained stage of change data for 461 of them (92%). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912460871">Table 1</xref> summarizes the characteristics of the 461 participants in our analyses, including their stage of change data.

<title>Focus Groups</title>
<p>The 16 focus group participants were between 30 and 52 years old (mean = 44 years), and were mostly women (15) and African Americans (14). The majority of focus group participants cited quality of life issues, such as physical limitations (e.g., not being able to tie shoe laces or keep up with children) and pain related to their obesity, as reasons why they wanted to lose weight. They also mentioned their desire to improve their self-esteem and increase their overall health. CCIP participants stated that they had a good relationship with their physicians and that lifestyle counseling and group support increased their desire to continue with the program. However, factors that were mentioned as reasons for dropping out of the program included physical limitations or health issues (surgery), family issues (taking care of sick family member, being a single parent), stress, and lack of social support.</p>

<sec id="section10-1524839912460871" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study’s 71% dropout rate is at the high end of attrition reported in behavioral weight management programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912460871">M. J. Davis &amp; Adis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912460871">Douketis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524839912460871">Wadden et al., 2005</xref>), with possible reasons related to both the target population and the study design. No-show rates for patient office visits at our study’s two main sites were 25% to 30%. We attempted multiple telephone contacts to schedule counseling visits and were very flexible in scheduling those appointments, as well as the group classes. Nevertheless, of those patients who scheduled an initial baseline visit, 52% either cancelled or simply did not show up, and the cancellation and no-show rate was around 45% for follow-up study visits. Even after multiple attempts to reschedule, we were unable to even contact the majority of those patients, which suggests that those patients may have shown an initial interest but were not truly ready for any concrete behavioral change.</p>
<p>Our high dropout rates may also be related to the very high proportion of minorities in our study (60% African Americans and 24% Hispanics), who are more likely to drop out than White participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912460871">Calfas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>), possibly because of cultural factors, such as body image and food preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912460871">E. M. Davis, Clark, Carrese, Gary, &amp; Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912460871">Dorsey, Eberhardt, &amp; Ogden, 2010</xref>). With the exception of a few recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912460871">Kumanyika et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912460871">Martin et al., 2006</xref>), most prior weight management studies in primary care have had low or no minority enrollment and hence relatively lower attrition.</p>
<p>Study design factors might have also contributed to our high dropout rates. Participants of some previous studies were volunteers who self-referred in response to advertisements and/or received compensation for participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912460871">Read et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912460871">Riebe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524839912460871">Teixeira et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, research has shown that some prescreening of referred primary care patients can also lead to increased program retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912460871">Macqueen et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912460871">2002</xref>). However, such measures lead to recruitment of only a self-selected group of patients and yield an estimated intervention effect that is invariably overoptimistic. We chose to target all referred patients without any screening to exclude those with low motivation in order to obtain a realistic and broadly generalizable assessment of the program. However, in agreement with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912460871">de Zwann et al., 2009</xref>), we found that pain and quality of life issues played a significant role in the motivations of our study’s participants, and this could perhaps be used by providers to reinforce their referrals in future programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524839912460871">Rohrer, Adamson, Barnes, &amp; Herman, 2008</xref>). Finally, we did not provide any financial incentives to participants, since such patient incentives are not currently available in large-scale programs in primary care (although reimbursement for provider counseling is possible through Medicare and some managed care plans).</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest limitations of our study was the lack of contact with participants between baseline counseling and the 3-month follow-up. Participants may feel lack of encouragement and a sense of abandonment after an initial intensive phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912460871">Grossi et al., 2006</xref>), and prior studies that included weekly or monthly support telephone calls as part of their programs have experienced quite modest dropout rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912460871">Calfas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912460871">Logue et al., 2005</xref>). During the course of our study, we introduced participant–counselor telephone calls at 1 month, but these were incompletely implemented because of budgetary and staffing reasons.</p>
<p>In addition to periodic presentations and feedback to health providers at the participating sites, we had envisioned using electronic medical record (EMR) systems to enhance provider involvement. Unfortunately, despite our expectations, EMR systems were delayed and unavailable at the time of the study, and manual insertion of notes into patients’ paper charts proved too labor-intensive and ineffective. At least on the basis of survey data, providers’ advice seems to have a significant impact on patients’ attempted weight loss, although the impact on actual weight loss is less clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524839912460871">Rose, Poynter, Anderson, Noar, &amp; Conigliaro, 2012</xref>). But even with a functional EMR, it is unclear how best to engage providers in real time. Providers are unlikely to see their patients again until months later, and they lack the time or resources to contact them in the interim to offer support.</p>
<p>In our study, both counseling sessions and group classes partly relied on the TTM as a model for weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912460871">Dallow &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912460871">Logue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912460871">Riebe et al., 2003</xref>). Lack of motivation has been mentioned as a strong reason why participants in behavioral weight management programs may fail to exercise or eat healthier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912460871">Andajani-Sutjahjo, Ball, Warren, Inglis, &amp; Crawford, 2004</xref>). However, studies of TTM-based interventions have yielded contradictory results regarding stage of change and dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912460871">Dallow &amp; Anderson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912460871">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). Our finding that stage of change was not predictive of dropout is consistent with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912460871">Macqueen et al. (1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912460871">2002</xref>), who suggested that the usual stage of change assessment may not be sensitive enough as predictor of dropout. It is possible, however, that a more extensive assessment, via a multi-item algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524839912460871">Sutton et al., 2003</xref>) may have better predictive utility. Our stage of change assessment might also have been subject to social desirability bias. Some participants might have lacked motivation, yet they might have felt obligated to meet with the counselor (and possibly exaggerate their reported stage of change) because they were referred by their physician. Both measurement error (lack of sensitivity) and social desirability bias would tend to introduce a bias toward the null in our study and could partly explain the lack of association seen between stage of change and attrition.</p>
<p>We found that older participants had somewhat higher likelihood of returning for counseling visits and attending group classes, which is consistent with numerous prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839912460871">Hardcastle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839912460871">Martin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524839912460871">Nanchahal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524839912460871">Prochaska et al., 1992</xref>). We also found that women were more likely to return for a counseling visit than men. Sex was not a predictor of attendance in a number of prior weight management interventions that used group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912460871">Honas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912460871">Linde et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524839912460871">Riebe et al., 2003</xref>) or individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912460871">Inelmen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839912460871">Macqueen et al., 2002</xref>) counseling, but the participants of those studies were overwhelmingly White. Since our study’s participants were mainly African Americans, our finding may indicate that a gender difference that is not very pronounced in Whites may be stronger among African Americans.</p>
<p>In our study, participants with children were more likely to not return for counseling, and our focus groups suggested that time constraints and lack of social supports may have been partly the reason. In contrast, children did not seem to affect attendance at group classes, possibly because these sessions were more child-friendly than individual counseling visits. However, employment was a significant predictor of group class attendance, with participants with part-time employment outside the home being less likely to attend. Although we held group class cycles at various times (mornings, afternoons, and after work hours) and locations (primary care and community sites), the classes of each cycle were held at the same time and place every week. Therefore, participants employed part-time might have found it harder to attend because of more frequent fluctuations in their work schedules. Other weight management programs have also reported similar family and domestic factors affecting participation, including child care and lack of support, as well as work schedules and distance/travel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912460871">Grossi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839912460871">Inelmen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524839912460871">Read et al., 2004</xref>)</p>
<p>We draw four different lessons from our study that relate to patient prescreening and targeting, provider engagement, frequency of contacts, and attention to more general lifestyle issues and barriers. First, a weight management program that indiscriminately targets primary care patients with varying levels of motivation may have limited success. Research is needed to identify or develop a brief yet effective screening tool for patients’ true motivation and interest. The patients’ providers can also play a direct role by focusing on their patients’ existing weight-related pain and quality of life issues, rather than simply discussing the potential long-term medical consequences of obesity, such as heart disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>Also needed are effective ways to engage providers in their patients’ efforts toward behavioral change. However, even with functional EMR systems and staff support, the workload and reimbursement pressures on primary care providers are formidable barriers. The recent Medicare reimbursement provisions may facilitate provider involvement to some degree, but occasional brief advice can have only modest impact in motivating patients in practice.</p>
<p>Frequency of contacts is also very crucial. In the absence of constant encouragement and support, in-person counseling every few weeks may not be very sustainable or effective. In the future, it may be possible to implement brief weekly semiautomated contacts via electronic means (texts or e-mails), perhaps tied to the practice’s EMR system, to accomplish the goals of both stronger provider engagement and more frequent contacts.</p>
<p>Finally, a weight management program must address common social and personal barriers to participation, such as childcare. Although additional resources (such as financial incentives) may not be broadly available, even small things could help, such as making the meetings with providers and counselors child-friendly and allowing participants to bring family members and friends to group classes.</p>
