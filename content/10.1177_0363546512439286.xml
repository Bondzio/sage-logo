<p>The sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is a saddle-shaped, diarthrodial joint with a complete intra-articular disk. It is the only true articulation between the axial skeleton and the upper limb, and because of its more central location and the strong surrounding ligamentous structures, it is rarely injured.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512439286">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>When injury does occur, traumatic dislocation or subluxation are the most common causes. Associated damage to the intra-articular disk at the time of injury is not uncommon and may be a cause of both acute and chronic pain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of 41 patients with joint pain after SCJ trauma found 80% had an intra-articular disk injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512439286">2</xref></sup> The incidence of asymptomatic tears is not known, but degenerate tears are often associated with SCJ degenerative arthritis. The SCJ intra-articular disk has been likened to the meniscus in the knee, in that tears may present with mechanical symptoms and be partly of a degenerate nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512439286">3</xref></sup> Just as in the knee, it is anticipated that intra-articular disk excision may partially alleviate these mechanical symptoms even in the presence of joint degeneration.</p>
<p>Previous descriptions in the literature of SCJ intra-articular disk injury, particularly its treatment, are limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512439286">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512439286">8</xref></sup> This may in part be due to historic limitations in SCJ soft tissue imaging and concerns with the relative operative morbidity of an open arthrotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512439286">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512439286">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this report, we describe the results of 2 patients who had sustained an acute SCJ intra-articular disk injury diagnosed by MRI scan that were treated successfully by arthroscopic surgical excision.</p>

<title>Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section2-0363546512439286">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 36-year-old male left-handed recreational tennis player presented to our clinic having developed an acute onset of pain in his left SCJ with associated clicking. This had occurred 4 weeks previously as he contacted the ball while serving in a tennis match. Although the acute pain had settled, he had been left with a background ache and a clicking sensation with pain in his SCJ on scapular protraction or retraction.</p>
<p>Physical examination revealed a palpable click over the SCJ on active scapular protraction and retraction while the joint remained stable. The glenohumeral joint was normal. An MRI scan demonstrated a torn intra-articular disk with a truncated appearance and early degenerative articular changes with intact sternoclavicular ligaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512439286">Figure 1</xref>). The scan demonstrated a normal appearance of the right asymptomatic SCJ.</p>

</fig>
<p>Over the next 3 months, the patient experienced increasing SCJ pain and clicking on day-to-day activities. Because of his deteriorating symptoms, we elected to proceed to an arthroscopic assessment and intra-articular disk excision of his SCJ. At arthroscopy, there was evidence of early articular degenerative change with some delamination within the disk, suggesting a degenerate element to the tear.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, the patient was allowed to mobilize his shoulder without restrictions. At 6 weeks after the surgery, he was pain free and had regained full function, including playing tennis. His pain relief and functional recovery had been maintained at the 12-month clinical follow-up. The patient reported at telephone review that his recovery remained full at 38 months after surgery.</p>

<sec id="section3-0363546512439286">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 32-year-old female right-handed patient presented to our clinic with a 6-month history of pain and clicking over her right SCJ. She had fallen off of her horse on to her right outstretched arm and initially experienced global pain over her right chest and shoulder girdle. Chest and shoulder radiographs had shown no obvious acute bony injury, and she had initially rested and then rehabilitated her shoulder under the supervision of the physical therapists. Her global pain settled fairly rapidly, but she was left with a background ache over her SCJ and a painful click whenever she brought her arm across in adduction. This caused her problems riding, particularly when turning while cantering at speed.</p>
<p>Physical examination revealed a stable SCJ with a palpable click when her arm was brought across her body in adduction. An MRI scan demonstrated a tear to the intra-articular disk with intact sternoclavicular ligaments and no evidence of preexisting articular degenerative changes.</p>
<p>Because of the patient’s continued background pain, continued significant click, and inability to return to riding, we undertook an arthroscopy and intra-articular disk excision of her SCJ. At arthroscopy, there was minimal evidence of degenerative change in the articular cartilage or the disk (see the Video Supplement, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Postoperatively, the patient was allowed to mobilize her shoulder without restrictions. At 6 weeks after the surgery, she was pain free, the clicking had gone, and she had regained full function. This had been maintained at the 12-month clinical follow-up. The patient reported her recovery at telephone review to have been fully maintained at 25 months after surgery.</p>

<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Both patients underwent identical procedures. The patients were anesthetized with a general anesthetic and positioned supine on the table with a small sandbag placed between the scapulae to open up the SCJ anteriorly. We had assessed the anatomy of the sternoclavicular joint in detail, particularly in relation to portal placement. The anterior sternoclavicular ligaments, the small area of bony congruency inferiorly, and the joint inclination were all taken into account. The bony landmarks of the joint were marked and the joint entered using an 18-gauge spinal needle at the inferior soft spot below the anterior sternoclavicular ligament and at an inclination of 30° to the vertical plane. The joint was then distended with normal saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512439286">Figure 2</xref>). A 3.5-mm trocar and 2.7-mm arthroscope were then inserted through an inferior portal. A superior portal, above the anterior sternoclavicular ligament, was then established under direct vision using an outside-to-in technique and a probe then inserted.</p>

</fig>
<p>In case 1, the intra-articular disk was found to have torn superiorly and to have dropped down into the inferior part of the joint. In case 2, there was a longitudinal split within the disk. Using a combination of a mini-punch and mini-shaver, the disk was resected back circumferentially to its capsular origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363546512439286">Figure 3</xref>). The joint was then lavaged and the wounds closed with sutures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The SCJ intra-articular disk divides the articular cavity, increases joint congruency, and serves to limit medial translation of the clavicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512439286">3</xref></sup> Because of its circumferential capsular attachment, it is likely that any type of trauma to the SCJ (subluxation, dislocation, or compression) may also result in damage to the disk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512439286">13</xref></sup> The exact role played by intra-articular disk injury in SCJ pain after trauma and also in the degenerative joint is not clearly known. However, particularly before the advent of readily available MRI scans, it is likely to have been underestimated previously. Central thinning of the intra-articular disk and, in some cases, perforations have been described as normal variants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512439286">1</xref></sup> These can be differentiated from a torn intra-articular disk on MRI in which there is characteristic disk truncation and edema.</p>
<p>Description of the surgical excision of the SCJ intra-articular disk in the literature is limited. Duggan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512439286">7</xref></sup> in a case report in 1931, described the intra-operative finding of a disk that would herniate through a tear in the SCJ capsule. After excision of the disk and repair of the capsule, the patient’s pain settled. In a case series of 4 patients with SCJ intra-articular disk injuries, Pierce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512439286">10</xref></sup> described how the 3 patients who underwent excision of the disk made a fairly rapid recovery, whereas the patient who did not had a far longer recovery.</p>
<p>Most recently, Delos et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512439286">5</xref></sup> described 2 patients who underwent successful meniscectomy of the SCJ disk. Both patients had chronic SCJ pain and an intra-articular disk tear diagnosed by MRI scan in one case and a computed tomography (CT) arthrogram in the other (the cases were 17 years apart). The patients underwent an open arthrotomy and excision of the disk with an intraosseous repair of the anterior capsule. There was no mention of the quality of the excised disk with regard to degenerative change. Postoperatively, the patients were immobilized in a sling for 6 weeks and then began to mobilize. This is in contrast to our series, in which the patients were able to mobilize immediately. However, as in our series, at 1 year after surgery, both patients were reported as being symptom free.</p>
<p>In this series, we describe 2 patients who presented fairly acutely with SCJ pain and clicking after a specific precipitating incident. With no history or evidence of an episode of traumatic instability, we decided to proceed directly to an MRI scan for a better assessment of the soft tissue structures. In case 1, there was evidence of degenerative changes within the SCJ with a disk tear. These changes would have been preexisting, and we suspect that either an acute tear in a degenerate disk or an acute on chronic tear had occurred at the time of injury. Because his symptoms had not been present before his injury, and in particular his clicking did not appear to improve with time, we chose to proceed to arthroscopy, where we excised a degenerate disk tear. This appeared to resolve his symptoms. Whether this was due to the disk excision, the washout of his degenerate joint, or a combination of both is not clear. In case 2, there was no evidence of any associated degenerative joint changes. This was confirmed at arthroscopy, where excision of the torn disk led to a resolution of the patient’s symptoms.</p>
<p>Arthroscopy of the SCJ has been described previously and is a technique that we have been developing for limited indications (diagnostic arthroscopy, joint debridement, excision of loose fragments, and resection of the medial end of the clavicle of the SCJ; Dennel and Tytherleigh-Strong, unpublished data, 2009).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512439286">12</xref></sup> Using anterior portals positioned superior and inferior to the anterior sternoclavicular ligament and above the costoclavicular ligament allows full access to the joint space without compromising joint stability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512439286">4</xref></sup> Clear visualization of the intact posterior capsule and observing that the instruments remained within the joint throughout the procedure ensured that the vascular structures posterior to the joint were not breached. Delaying surgery for 4 and 6 months after injury allowed adequate time for healing of any capsular damage that may have occurred, preventing any fluid extravasation posteriorly. The postoperative morbidity is theoretically reduced with less pain and a faster functional recovery than that compared with an open arthrotomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512439286">5</xref></sup> This may have the potential of lowering the threshold for undertaking intra-articular sternoclavicular surgery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Although intra-articular disk damage at the time of SCJ injury is thought to be relatively common, its contribution to ongoing joint pain and symptoms may have been underestimated previously. A greater index of suspicion and the use of MRI may lead to an increased understanding of the role that the intra-articular disk plays.</p>
<p>In this case report, we describe the successful surgical treatment using an arthroscopic technique of 2 patients who had sustained an acute SCJ disk injury.</p>
