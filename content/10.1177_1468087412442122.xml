<p>Oxygen-enriched air combustion has been extensively studied, but not for internal-combustion engines. This paper presents how oxygen-enriched intake air influences early flame growth and the combustion process, and looks at how oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) enrichment translates into resistance to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) dilution. The experiments were conducted with an optical single-cylinder engine instrumented with an in-cylinder pressure transducer and a high-speed camera to monitor early flame growth. During the experiments, O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were varied from 18% to 29%, while CO<sub>2</sub> was varied from 0% to 35%. The main findings are that O<sub>2</sub> addition speeds up the combustion process and renders the flame more resistant to CO<sub>2</sub> dilution. It was observed that the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> can be significantly increased to reduce the combustion process to a level similar to that with air. Finally, laminar flame speed correlated well with early flame growth and fully developed turbulent combustion periods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oxygen-enriched combustion has attracted research interest because of the expected decrease in carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions. This reduction should be associated with an increase in nitrogen oxide (NO<sub>x</sub>) because of the expected higher flame temperatures. Adding oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) to intake air should also increase the combustion propagation speed of the air–fuel mixture at a constant equivalence ratio, since it reduces nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) dilution.</p>
<p>Few studies have been dedicated to O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air for internal-combustion engines. For example, Kajitani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412442122">1</xref></sup> used a single-cylinder optical engine to investigate the influence of O<sub>2</sub> enrichment on emissions and engine performance at full load. They reported that increasing the O<sub>2</sub> concentration from 21% to 22% decreased UHC emissions by 25% when optimum spark timing was used. There was, however, a concomitant increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Infrared images obtained through the piston window showed an increased combustion temperature, which was judged to be partly responsible for the decrease in UHC emissions. Tests performed at constant spark timing also showed an increase in engine thermal efficiency for rich mixtures up to an equivalence ratio of 1.3, when O<sub>2</sub> concentration was 23%. It was observed that, for a given equivalence ratio, the increase in O<sub>2</sub> concentration was associated with a decrease in the combustion period and variability of combustion duration. Kajitani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468087412442122">2</xref></sup> completed their study, but at partial load and during warm-up. They observed that O<sub>2</sub> enrichment resulted in shorter engine warm-up and that the flame propagation was stronger in the early stages of combustion with O<sub>2</sub> enrichment.</p>
<p>Maxwell et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468087412442122">3</xref></sup> used a single-cylinder engine fueled with methane or gasoline to study the impact of O<sub>2</sub> enrichment. They reported reduced CO and UHC emissions, and increased fuel conversion efficiency when the O<sub>2</sub> concentration was increased. They also reported a decrease in volumetric efficiency with increasing O<sub>2</sub> enrichment in the intake manifold.</p>
<p>Ng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468087412442122">4</xref></sup> modified a car to enable it to run with an O<sub>2</sub> concentration between 21% and 30% while performing the FTP-75 (federal test procedure) cycle. They observed, over the FTP cycle, that O<sub>2</sub> enrichment offered some advantages, such as a reduction in CO and UHCs from engine-out and after the catalytic converter, especially during the cold phase of the FTP cycle. These reductions were, however, accompanied by an increase in NO<sub>x</sub>. Interestingly, they reported a marked reduction of olefins, ozone, and aldehyde, especially for engine-out emission.</p>
<p>Poola et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468087412442122">5</xref></sup> also tested a vehicle over the FTP cycle with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air, but only during the cycle’s cold phase. They observed reductions of 41% and 55% of converter-out UHC and CO emissions, respectively, with 25% oxygen-enriched air, along with a significant increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. They suggested that 23% O<sub>2</sub> enrichment could reduce UHC and CO emissions, while keeping NO<sub>x</sub> emissions manageable.</p>
<p>As shown by this short review, O<sub>2</sub> enrichment can reduce CO and UHCs, but at the cost of higher NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Only Kajitani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412442122">1</xref></sup> reported shorter combustion periods with stronger flame propagation. Most of the studies tried to show the advantage or viability of running an internal-combustion engine with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air, but none really concentrated on the influence on the combustion process as studied with in-cylinder pressure or flame imaging. The main reason for revisiting O<sub>2</sub> enrichment, despite the increase in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, is spurred on by the trend towards engine downsizing among engine manufacturers. The goal of engine downsizing is to reduce fuel consumption while maintaining an engine performance similar to that of larger displacement engines by using a turbocharger and/or other technologies. It could be envisioned that a combination of technologies, such as turbocharging and O<sub>2</sub> enrichment, from separation membrane, could help achieve a further reduction in engine size while delivering the same power. Furthermore, with O<sub>2</sub> enrichment, high-load operations might not generate as much UHC emissions as with air, which would be beneficial from a pollutant emissions perspective. Experiments were therefore conducted in an optical spark-ignition (SI) engine with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air under a high intake manifold pressure. We also studied O<sub>2</sub> enrichment in combination with CO<sub>2</sub> dilution to quantify its influence on the combustion process because exhaust gas recirculation is a proven technique to alleviate the increased NO<sub>x</sub> emissions associated with O<sub>2</sub> enrichment.</p>
<p>This study’s objectives were (a) to quantify how O<sub>2</sub> concentration influenced the spark-timing requirement; (b) to determine how early flame growth and ensuing combustion are influenced by O<sub>2</sub> concentration for fixed initial conditions; (c) to establish what diluent concentration is required when O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air is used to yield combustion processes similar in duration to air; (d) to determine if O<sub>2</sub> enrichment renders the mixture more resistant to dilution; and (e) to establish whether there is a relationship between combustion markers and fundamental laminar flame speed (S<sub>L</sub>).</p>
<p>First, this paper begins with the influence of O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air with optimum spark timing and its influence on the combustion process. Then, the same levels of O<sub>2</sub> enrichment with a constant spark timing, allowing similar initial mixture temperature and pressure on the early flame growth, are studied. Lastly, the influence of adding CO<sub>2</sub> with three different O<sub>2</sub> concentrations at constant spark timing is studied. The experiments were performed in an optical access SI engine, which allows the recording of natural flame radiation by direct visualization.</p>

<p>The experiments were conducted with a single-cylinder optical version of a four-valve, pent-roof combustion-chamber Renault J4S engine that induces an in-cylinder tumble flow. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468087412442122">Table 1</xref> provides the main engine characteristics, along with engine operating conditions, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468087412442122">Figure 1</xref> gives the experimental setup and typical field of view. A quartz window provides optical access to the combustion chamber, offering a 40 mm diameter field of view through the piston. The optical engine was driven by an electric motor at 1200 r/min throughout the experiments. A water-cooled AVL pressure transducer monitored the in-cylinder pressure and was synchronized with a 7200 pulse optical encoder mounted on the camshaft, providing a resolution of 0.1 crank-angle degree (CAD). The engine was fired in skip-fire mode (one firing every six cycles) to remove residual gases and ensure a stoichiometric air–fuel ratio. The results presented herein were obtained over an average of 100 fired cycles.</p>

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>This section presents and discusses the main research findings. First, the results with minimum advance for best torque (MBT) spark timing are shown, illustrating the influence of O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air on the combustion process under optimized ignition. Then, the same mixtures studied under similar initial conditions by maintaining the spark timing constant at 20 CAD before top dead center (BTDC) are presented. Lastly, the results of investigating the resistance to CO<sub>2</sub> dilution for three different O<sub>2</sub> concentrations are given to show how O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air improves the combustion process.</p>
<sec id="section6-1468087412442122">
<title>Optimum spark timing</title>
<p>The influence of O<sub>2</sub> addition on the combustion process was first studied with MBT spark timing, while the isooctane mixture was kept at stoichiometric values. The optimum spark timing was found by maximizing the mean IMEP over 100 cycles for each O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Using MBT spark timing translated into a location of peak pressure between 12.2 to 13.3 CAD after top dead center (ATDC) and CoV of IMEP inferior or equal to 1%, for all mixtures tested in this section. Spark timing is retarded as the intake-air O<sub>2</sub> concentration increases, confirming faster flame propagation. For example, MBT spark timing at 19% O<sub>2</sub> was 50 CAD BTDC, while for air, it was 23 CAD BTDC and for 29% O<sub>2</sub>, it was 9 CAD BTDC.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref> presents different combustion periods obtained with the in-cylinder pressure transducer (averaged over 100 cycles) as expressed by MFB and also obtained with the high-speed camera as expressed by A<sub>f,norm</sub>. Early flame growth is represented by CA10 (corresponding to 10% of the accumulated heat release) and by finding the duration between spark timing and A<sub>f,norm</sub> that reaches 10% (CA(A<sub>f,norm</sub> = 10%)). On the other hand, a fully developed combustion period is represented by the combustion duration between CA85 and CA10 and expressed as CA85-CA10. The figure shows a general decreasing trend in combustion duration as O<sub>2</sub> concentration increases for all combustion periods, which is in accordance with the shorter combustion period reported in Kajitani et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468087412442122">1</xref></sup> for MBT spark timing, but under different operating conditions. The A<sub>f,norm</sub> acquired with the high-speed camera follows the general trend associated with early flame growth from in-cylinder pressure data.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref> that increasing the O<sub>2</sub> concentration from 19% to 21% offers a greater reduction in combustion duration than increasing it from 21% to 23% or even to 29%. It can be assumed that, for cases with O<sub>2</sub> deprivation with respect to air, there is a twofold explanation underlying the observed increase in combustion duration: (a) increased N<sub>2</sub> dilution and (b) a reduced chemical reaction activity associated with a reduced initial mixture temperature due to early spark timing, required by a slower S<sub>L</sub>. These conditions translate into a 125% decrease of 0–10% MFB duration when the O<sub>2</sub> concentration increases from 19% to 21%. A 10% reduction in the same combustion period was observed when O<sub>2</sub> increases from 21% to 29%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref> indicates that O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air seems to play a more prominent role during the early flame-growth period than during the fully developed combustion period (10–85% MFB), since the combustion duration decreases by only 25% for the latter, when O<sub>2</sub> increases from 19% to 21%. This difference, however, can be partly attributed to (a) higher in-cylinder temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468087412442122">6</xref></sup> during the fully developed combustion period with higher O<sub>2</sub> concentration, which could increase flame speed; and (b) the difference of in-cylinder temperature and pressure at spark timing, which influences flame kernel formation. In further support of this observation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412442122">Figure 3</xref> presents the early flame-growth duration expressed as CA10 as a function of MBT spark timing, along with a linear trend line passing through each O<sub>2</sub> concentration tested herein. Since the CA10 can be considered laminar,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412442122">7</xref></sup> a decrease of O<sub>2</sub> concentration needs more spark advance because of slower S<sub>L</sub>, which, in turn, results in lower initial mixture temperature and pressure at spark timing, corresponding to a further reduction in S<sub>L</sub>. Therefore, O<sub>2</sub> concentration plays a direct role with S<sub>L</sub>, but also on the initial conditions at which ignition is provided, which further influences S<sub>L</sub>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To attempt to explain the observed linear relationship between CA10 and MBT spark timing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412442122">Figure 3</xref>, S<sub>L</sub> calculations were performed for each mixture under temperatures and pressures corresponding to spark-timing conditions based on the in-cylinder pressure measurements, using PREMIX from the CHEMKIN package.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412442122">8</xref></sup> The calculations used the high-temperature, iso-octane–air kinetics mechanism from Jerzembeck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412442122">9</xref></sup> (99 species and 669 reactions) and the PREMIX solutions were obtained with a grid of approximately 400 points, which is similar to the convergence analysis of S<sub>L</sub> performed by Conaire,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468087412442122">10</xref></sup> who showed that between 300 and 500 grid points were sufficient. Because spark-timing advance is inversely proportional to S<sub>L</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412442122">Figure 3</xref> presents 1/S<sub>L</sub> as a function of spark timing and shows a linear relationship between the two variables. Moreover, by looking only at the data with at least 21% O<sub>2</sub>, it can be seen that CA10 and 1/S<sub>L</sub> behave similarly as a function of spark timing. It thus appears that S<sub>L</sub> in combination with pressure and temperature conditions at spark timing are, at least in part, responsible for the linear behavior between CA10 and MBT spark timing observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468087412442122">Figure 3</xref>.</p>
<p>The general nonlinear behavior observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref> translates into an increase average peak pressure (P<sub>max</sub>) and average IMEP with increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentration, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412442122">Figure 4</xref>. This can be related to two phenomena. First, the combustion heat release takes place more quickly near top dead center (TDC) because of faster combustion with increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentration. The decreased combustion duration for conditions of O<sub>2</sub> enrichment with respect to air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref>) translated into a marked increase in average P<sub>max</sub> and average IMEP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468087412442122">Figure 4</xref>). Second, maintaining a stoichiometric mixture at a constant manifold pressure of 0.7 bar resulted in an increase of fuel mass injected with increased O<sub>2</sub> content, which translates into more chemical energy available for the combustion process. This is supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1468087412442122">Figure 5</xref>, which shows the relationship between IMEP and engine fuel flow rate, and where a strong link between the two variables is observed.</p>

<p>This influence of lack of O<sub>2</sub> concentration on the combustion process is also felt between IMEP and early flame growth, as represented by CA5 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1468087412442122">Figure 6</xref> (some data omitted for clarity). It shows that, at O<sub>2</sub> deprivation (19% O<sub>2</sub>) with respect to air, CA5 is reached over a range of 19 CAD, with IMEP varying by 67 kPa, while, with air, the range of CA5 is over 4 CAD with IMEP varying by 27 kPa. A further increase in O<sub>2</sub> slowly decreases the ranges over which CA5 is reached and IMEP fluctuates. It is observed that the general trend between CA5 and IMEP for the case with 19% O<sub>2</sub> is similar to that obtained by Aleiferis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412442122">11</xref></sup> under lean conditions and with a spark timing near MBT. This similarity can be explained by the fact that the influence of using a lean mixture or using N<sub>2</sub> dilution is to reduce S<sub>L</sub>, which, in turn, makes the flame more sensitive to turbulence and in-cylinder conditions. Thus, this increased flame sensitivity results in an increase of cyclic variations of combustion and of IMEP. Furthermore, for the other cases, the lack of correlation between the two variables was also reported by Aleiferis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468087412442122">11</xref></sup> for stoichiometric mixtures and MBT spark timing.</p>

<p>While pressure data showed a weak link between IMEP and CA5 with 19% O<sub>2</sub> and no correlation at all for the other conditions studied, the investigation turned to A<sub>f,norm</sub> at CA5 and a possible relationship with CA5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1468087412442122">Figure 7</xref>).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412442122">Figure 8</xref> presents early flame kernel images at different O<sub>2</sub> concentrations for stoichiometric mixtures and MBT spark timing. One general observation about all the images is that all early flame kernels reveal similar spherical progression, irrespective of O<sub>2</sub> concentration. This progression appears to be a slightly wrinkled spherical flame. The differences observed due to O<sub>2</sub> concentration are the time elapsed between spark timing and the first visible flame kernel, and the ensuing speed at which the flame progressed. These differences are considerable mainly for O<sub>2</sub> deprived conditions, as was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468087412442122">Figure 2</xref> for early flame-growth periods. The images in the first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1468087412442122">Figure 8</xref> were taken with an O<sub>2</sub> concentration of 19%, between 31 and 46 CAD after spark timing (AST), while the second row of images were taken with an O<sub>2</sub> concentration of 21%, between 9 and 21 CAD AST. Finally, to illustrate the faster early flame growth associated with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air, the last two rows are for O<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 25% and 29%, respectively, between 6 and 15 CAD AST, and between 5 and 11 CAD AST, respectively, illustrating a much faster combustion process for cases with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air.</p>

<title>Constant spark timing</title>
<p>Another way to study the effect of O<sub>2</sub> content on the combustion process is to maintain a constant spark timing (20 CAD BTDC), allowing a comparison under similar initial pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412442122">Figure 9</xref> shows the initial flame growth for a stoichiometric mixture with 18%, 21%, 25%, and 27% O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The first row shows an initial flame growth at every 12 CAD, starting with the first image at 12 CAD AST. Under these O<sub>2</sub> deprivation conditions, it is observed that the early flame is distorted; spherical flame propagation is only seldom observed. On the other hand, as the O<sub>2</sub> concentration increases, the propagating flame generally becomes more spherical in shape and slightly wrinkled, as can be seen by comparing rows 2, 3, and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1468087412442122">Figure 9</xref>.</p>

<p>The influence of the O<sub>2</sub> concentration on the repeatability of the combustion process was then studied by determining the standard deviation (stdev) of different combustion markers used to quantify the combustion process. The stdev of the CA10 and CA85-CA10, along with the stdev of A<sub>f,norm</sub>(10%) were calculated for each O<sub>2</sub> concentration, and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412442122">Figure 10</xref>. The first general observation is that the stdev is drastically higher when the O<sub>2</sub> concentration falls below 21%. When the O<sub>2</sub> concentration is greater than that of air, the stdev decreases slightly, showing that the stabilizing influence of O<sub>2</sub> on the combustion process is nearly maximized. Moreover, the stdev of early flame growth and of fully developed combustion are nearly equal for stoichiometric mixtures with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air. Other combustion periods were also evaluated and all showed the nonlinear trend observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1468087412442122">Figure 10</xref>. Finally, the combustion variations for O<sub>2</sub> concentrations above 21% are constant and may be induced mainly by in-cylinder velocity fluctuations. This hypothesis is supported by the work of Enaux et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468087412442122">12</xref></sup> who linked the cycle-to-cycle variation in the combustion process to velocity fluctuations at the moment of spark timing. Similarly, Vermorel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468087412442122">13</xref></sup> showed, with large eddy simulations, that tumble breakdown induces high turbulence levels, which in turn influence the early flame growth and the combustion process from ignition to CA90. On the other hand, local equivalence-ratio variations are probably not a cause of the observed cyclic variations because it has been shown experimentally by Aleiferis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468087412442122">14</xref></sup> that a stoichiometric mixture, such as in the present case, does not correlate with cycle-to-cycle variations in combustion.</p>

These combustion-duration differences are similar to what was observed in the previous section with MBT spark timing.</p>

<p>From these results, it appears that the O<sub>2</sub> addition is responsible for a slight increase in combustion activity (faster chemical reactions) during the early flame-growth and fully developed turbulent-flame periods, which may also suggest a slightly faster S<sub>L</sub>. On the other hand, a reduction of O<sub>2</sub> with respect to air slows the combustion process considerably, due in part to a reduced S<sub>L</sub>. Adding or subtracting 2% of O<sub>2</sub> to the air does not translate into a similar change in ΔCA or ΔA<sub>f,norm</sub>. A short discussion of this subject will be presented at the end of the section.</p>
<p>Based on the results above, it was deemed important to investigate the importance of S<sub>L</sub> on the combustion process. In the first approach, S<sub>L</sub> was estimated for an initial stoichiometric mixture temperature of 400 K and initial pressure of 1 atmosphere by performing calculations with PREMIX (CHEMKIN Pro package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468087412442122">8</xref></sup>) with the high-temperature, iso-octane–air kinetics mechanism from Jerzembeck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468087412442122">9</xref></sup> (99 species and 669 reactions). Since the spark timing was the same for all the measurements, the initial conditions were also similar and thus, the comparison between S<sub>L</sub> for a given state should hold true. The PREMIX solutions were obtained with a grid of approximately 500 points.</p>
<p>S<sub>L</sub> calculations yielded two new variables. First, the change in combustion duration with respect to air, denoted ΔCA(%), is calculated using</p>

<p>where S<sub>L,O2</sub> is the laminar flame speed for a given stoichiometric iso-octane–O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air mixture and S<sub>L,air</sub> is the reference laminar flame speed in air (21% O<sub>2</sub>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412442122">Figure 13</xref> presents ΔCA(%) plotted against ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%). A ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%) value of zero corresponds to the air condition, while a positive value of ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%) corresponds to an increased O<sub>2</sub> concentration (23%, 25%, and 27%), and a negative value of ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%) is associated with 19% and 18% O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. As can be seen, the relationship between the variables is nonlinear. For O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air, each combustion marker is twice as small (approximately) as the change in laminar flame speed. For O<sub>2</sub>-deprived air, the trend is reversed, with the combustion marker duration increasing twofold with respect to the changes in laminar flame speed for 19% O<sub>2</sub>, while it is nearly three times ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%) at 18% O<sub>2</sub>. This trend is good for early flame growth (CA10 and CA(A<sub>f,norm</sub>=10%)) and for fully developed turbulent combustion (CA85-CA10).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1468087412442122">Figure 13</xref> shows that, at 19% and 23% O<sub>2</sub>, ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%) is equivalent, but the resulting change in ΔCA(%) is not. The difference in MFB can be accounted for by examining the combustion phasing. With air and 20 CAD BTDC spark timing, kept constant in all experiments, the CA10 ends at TDC. When the O<sub>2</sub> concentration is decreased, however, the slower S<sub>L</sub> results in a CA10 that extends into the expansion stroke. This, in turn, cools the mixture because very little energy is released during that early stage of combustion. The cooler mixture further reduces the ensuing combustion rate, extending the combustion process well into the expansion stroke. This can be illustrated by comparing the CA10 with 18% and 19% O<sub>2</sub>, which lasted 41 and 27 CAD, respectively. The longer early flame growth results in a longer CA85-CA10, which lasts 49 and 24 CAD with 18% and 19% O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Therefore, the combustion phasing for conditions in O<sub>2</sub> deprivation with respect to air enhanced the influence of a slower S<sub>L</sub> for constant spark timing.</p>

The duration differences along the ordinate were computed using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1468087412442122">equation (3)</xref> above. The results show that, at 25% O<sub>2</sub>, a concentration of approximately 13% of CO<sub>2</sub> is needed to have a CA10 duration similar to that of the reference state, while 15% CO<sub>2</sub> is needed for 29% O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air. The results are similar for fully developed turbulent combustion expressed by CA85-CA10. Furthermore, nonlinear behavior is observed when a high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is reached in the case of 29% O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air. This behavior is due, in part, to the combustion phasing when the combustion durations for the 29% O<sub>2</sub>/35% CO<sub>2</sub> mixture are similar to the case with 19% O<sub>2</sub>, presented above, with CA10 ending slightly ATDC. The combustion phasing for the 25% O<sub>2</sub>/25% CO<sub>2</sub> mixture is similar to that for air. Therefore, another possible contributing factor for the nonlinear behavior might be CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation at high temperatures, which in turn affects S<sub>L</sub>. Indeed, Halter et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412442122">15</xref></sup> observed a nonlinear behavior of S<sub>L</sub> experimentally and numerically in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> dilution. They linked this behavior to the fact that CO<sub>2</sub> addition increases the mixture’s specific heat capacity and also influences the chemical reactions because of CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation at high temperatures. In Halter et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468087412442122">15</xref></sup> CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation contributed between 50% and 25% of the observed reduction in stoichiometric iso-octane–air laminar flame speed when a 5% to 20% CO<sub>2</sub> dilution was used, respectively.</p>

It can be seen that all the data points for the influence of CO<sub>2</sub> on early flame growth fall nearly on a single curve, irrespective of O<sub>2</sub> concentration. This shows that the difference in CO<sub>2</sub> concentration results in a similar reduction of S<sub>L</sub>, regardless of the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the air mixture. This, in turn, similarly changed the combustion process in the engine, as expressed by MFB. This observation is limited to the concentrations presented in this section. It also illustrates the strong relationship between laminar flame speed and the combustion process within the engine.</p>

<p>Furthermore, for those operating conditions, CA85-CA10 and CA10 have similar durations, which accounts for the similar ΔCA observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1468087412442122">Figures 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1468087412442122">15</xref> with the two combustion periods. While Heywood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468087412442122">7</xref></sup> identified the CA10 as being flame propagation in the laminar regime, the link between the CA85-CA10 and S<sub>L</sub> is not surprising, since the turbulent flame speed associated with this combustion period is often expressed as a function of laminar flame speed and turbulence intensity (Linse et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468087412442122">16</xref></sup> and Landry et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468087412442122">17</xref></sup>) in modeling internal-combustion engines. Since engine speed was kept constant, the turbulence intensity was also similar from one experiment to the next. Consequently, the fully developed combustion difference can therefore be associated with the change in laminar flame speed due to variations in CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p>
<p>Finally, the advantage of increasing O<sub>2</sub> concentration above the reference state is increased resistance to CO<sub>2</sub> dilution. With air, a maximum CO<sub>2</sub> concentration of 10–15% is achieved experimentally, attaining 25% and 35% when the O<sub>2</sub> concentration is 25% and 29%, respectively. Therefore, the higher O<sub>2</sub> content makes the flame more resistant to dilution because of enhanced laminar flame speed and higher flame temperature. Chen and Axelbaum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468087412442122">18</xref></sup> identified the H + O<sub>2</sub>→ OH + O reaction as being beneficial to flame resistance to extinction because of the higher flame temperature associated with the O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air. The calculations performed herein with PREMIX for S<sub>L</sub> support this affirmation. For example, the flame temperature of 25%O<sub>2</sub> / 25% CO<sub>2</sub> / iso-octane mixture is 100 K higher than the 21% O<sub>2</sub> / 10% CO<sub>2</sub> / iso-octane mixture. The temperature difference for the 29%O<sub>2</sub> / 35% CO<sub>2</sub> / iso-octane mixture reached 200 K.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Experiments were conducted with an optically accessible single-cylinder engine fed with different stoichiometric iso-octane / O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air mixtures. Experiments conducted with O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air and MBT spark timing resulted in faster flame propagation, which can be linked to increased laminar flame speed and initial mixture temperature at spark timing. When O<sub>2</sub> deprivation, with respect to air, is used, the combustion process is similar to the lean combustion mixtures reported in the literature.</p>
<p>A second set of experiments at constant spark timing with different O<sub>2</sub>-enriched intake air mixtures was then presented. High-speed imaging and in-cylinder pressure data revealed that the lack of O<sub>2</sub> has a greater impact on the combustion process than O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air. This behavior can be linked to combustion phasing, which further influences the combustion process for slow S<sub>L</sub>. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between the difference in combustion period with respect to air (ΔCA(%)) and a difference in laminar flame speed with respect to air (ΔS<sub>L</sub>(%)) was observed, which indicates that the laminar flame speed variation is approximately twice as fast as the MFB duration variation for O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air, while the MFB duration variation is at least twice as fast as the variation in laminar flame speed for the lack of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Finally, two O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air mixtures with CO<sub>2</sub> dilution were compared to air/CO<sub>2</sub> dilution. It was observed that O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air allows an increased CO<sub>2</sub> dilution tolerance with respect to air. For example, 25% O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air needs approximately 13% CO<sub>2</sub> to achieve a combustion duration similar to air, while 25% CO<sub>2</sub> is needed to observe combustion deterioration. When air is used, only 10–15% CO<sub>2</sub> is needed to observe combustion deterioration. The increased tolerance to dilution in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air may be related to higher S<sub>L</sub> and flame temperature.</p>
