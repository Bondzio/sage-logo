<p>This magnificently researched history of print and its aficionados in Tamilnadu is a reminder (if we needed one!) that for those of us engaged in histories of the written, consumed and artifactual word, the book in its manifest forms is a passion. A.R. Venkatachalapathy’s ardent engagement with the subject is evident in the wealth of archival, material, fictional and autobiographical sources that he marshals and presents with elegance and verve across the dimensions of Tamil print culture since its beginnings in the sixteenth century (‘a head start over every other vernacular’, p. 6). He takes the story through to the broader emergence of print in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the slow transition from a patronage to an artisanal/capitalist system of support and production, and to the expansion of middle-class reading audiences with the proliferation of the novel yet the continuation of parallel ‘popular’ genres and finally into the age of digital technology.</p>
<p><italic>The Province of the Book</italic> (a title with rich multiple resonance) traces Tamil publishing history from the era of missionaries translating and printing religious texts, when the dominant indigenous textual practice was one of manuscript culture limited to the well-trained few, who passed on their knowledge through teaching circles dependent on oral reading and mnemonic learning. The older scholarly manuscript culture depended on closely guarded protocols of aural consumption necessitated by the technology of palm-leaf manuscripts with its particular orthography and text layout that is often difficult to decipher (detailed finely in Chapter 7, on modes of reading, though this would have been useful to have at earlier points in the volume). In the nineteenth century, this tradition coexisted with the beginnings of a print culture incorporating ‘non-missionaries and natives’ (p. 8), which inaugurated a long period of transition affecting every aspect of text production and consumption: what constituted authorship, how new technologies and emerging readerships enabled and demanded new literary forms (notably, the novel) and how generational cohorts were distinct in their practices and expectations of reading.</p>
<p>Venkatachalapathy next focuses on the emergence of the Tamil novel, as an outcome of the needs of publishers as well as the desires of readers, and on reactions to it. There were those who adamantly opposed such fictions as corruptive of community morals, especially amongst young women, a trans-cultural target of reading anxieties (Egypt saw an equally fretful debate about girls and novels, beginning in the late nineteenth century and similar discourses had erupted elsewhere, including in Europe and the Americas—a fine topic for comparative study). Quotations here suggest that it was men’s fantasies, <italic>their</italic> susceptibility to the seductive promises of fictional realism, that produced such anxiety over the girl as reader. And yet, the novel prevailed—sometimes titillating, often didactically moralising—to sustain publishers, printers and readers alike.</p>
<p>The sociology of readership—with its class and gender politics, in the framework of what Venkatachalapathy sees as the desired yet unachieved hegemony of the middle class—also undergirds what is perhaps the book’s finest achievement, a rich discussion of the parallel production of ballads and chapbooks, eschewed by the middle classes by and large and very much a part of a pre-existing oral culture of expression. Though much of this material has sadly been lost due to neglect and disdain, Venkatachalapathy has located more than enough—as well as archival and other sources—to offer an engrossing discussion of these works, their context of production and dissemination and the ways that text, performance and commercial venue intersected to produce (and define) particular audiences. Linking these circuits to Madras’s Gujili Bazaar and text production to the trade in many other commodities, <italic>The Province of the Book</italic> shows this was no isolated ‘province’. ‘The ignominy associated with the market—cheap goods, unscrupulous locksmiths, pickpockets, cutpurses, petty thieves and streetwalkers—became the brush with which to tar the books as well’ (p. 138).</p>
<p>Chapbooks as well as ‘more respectable’ publications came under the scrutiny of the colonial state, for activists of various oppositional stripes took advantage of publishing possibilities as nationalist and other ideologies came to prominence. What is fascinating here is the apparent divergence and ambivalence amongst different state actors concerning the relative importance and feasibility of prohibiting the written word, as well as the appropriate targets of surveillance and the strategies that their prospective prey used to avoid oversight or punishment. The state was hardly able to make a dent in the energetic Tamil publishing scene, despite layers of bureaucracy designed to do so.</p>
<p>This is one way in which <italic>The Province of the Book</italic> emphasises the contingencies of history. What gets published, by and for whom and in what medium; what is allowed to circulate and where and how it is read; the impact of everything from social aspirations to state surveillance on the genres and content that emerge; the force and limitation of patriarchal control over what and how the young imbibe; coeval distinctions and overlaps between manuscript, print and oral consumption of texts; and the sheer power of individual human determination—all are mutually determining and therefore anything but determinative. Furthermore, the structures of manual labour and the possibilities of technology and materials are shown as no less significant than the intellectual labour of text production. Because of this strong emphasis on multicausality and contingency, though, the author’s emphasis on the centrality of middle-class aspirations to ‘hegemony’ as a key factor in the proliferation of (certain kinds of) print seems perhaps overdetermining at times. And surely, as his evidence suggests, this social category is itself too voluminous and varying to easily categorise (whatever we have been told by social theorists).</p>
<p>In his preface, presaging his thick-descriptive use of autobiographical narratives of readers, writers and publishers over time, the author narrates his own professional engagement with print, as a librarian and participant in book publishing: ‘My workplace had been essentially a working museum of print’ (p. xi). The lovely smudge of newsprint on one’s fingers, the smell of books, the visual delight at beautiful printing and also (at least in my case, working on Egypt) at cheaply printed chapbooks with rudimentary drawings, the fascination with the changing conventions of the printed page, from layout to punctuation to type and the glorious materiality of books all inhere beautifully in these pages, through Venkatachalapathy’s lively narrative and the many ‘small voices of history’ (to borrow Ranajit Guha’s felicitious phrase) he offers us. In conclusion, <italic>The Province of the Book</italic> makes a strong case that in the age of the internet, Tamil book publishing is livelier than ever, eased (if troubled) by new technologies and expanding audiences. And no doubt by passions that the internet has not laid to rest and that the many personae of this book exemplify. Surely many of us empathise with the Tamil reader at the start of the twentieth century who (anxious about his wife’s disapproval at the household income spent on books) exclaimed, ‘What am I to do! I have an unusual craving for buying new books’ (p. 232).</p>
