<p>During the heroic age of Antarctic exploration, there was much discussion on the role of alcohol. The explorers expected to be able to consume alcohol, and the expeditions were supported by companies producing alcoholic beverages that used the Antarctic connection in their advertising. On the other side, it was said (incorrectly) than Fridjof Nansen, perhaps the most famous of the Arctic explorers, had taken no alcohol and this was used in the arguments against alcohol by the temperance movement. In general, alcohol consumption was low but it was felt that alcohol played an important role in maintaining the psychological welfare of the participants. A number of them had alcohol problems, and participation in an expedition was thought to be of benefit in that it would remove the temptation to consume alcohol. However, there were episodes of drunkenness on the ships and in the Antarctic. Cocaine was taken as one of a number of tonics but only one explorer is thought to have abused drugs, though another is said to have done so.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the heroic age of Antarctic exploration (1895–1922), expeditions to the Antarctic were organized by Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Sweden, Norway and Japan. Alcohol has been briefly mentioned in previous articles on the psychological aspects of these expeditions and the psychiatric disease occurring on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957154X12450139">Guly, 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957154X12450139">2012b</xref>), but the use and abuse of alcohol needs to be seen in its social context. While many aspects of the early Antarctic explorations are unique, other aspects would have been similar to life on ships, in overseas military messes and for other all-male groups in far-flung parts of the empires of Britain, Germany and France – countries which provided the majority of the Antarctic expeditions. This paper seeks to explore the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs during these expeditions.</p>
<p>All the expeditions were given much publicity, and the explorers were regarded as heroes and, often, as role models. Apart from alcohol consumption being a normal social activity, there would have been pressure from two directions. In the nineteenth century, the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption had become recognized, and the temperance and abstinence movements had gained much support. This was not just for health reasons, but also because of the effect of alcohol on behaviour and industrial production, and the fact that the heavy use of alcohol caused financial difficulties to families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957154X12450139">Burnett, 1999</xref>: 127–33). Fridjof Nansen, the greatest of all the Arctic explorers, led an expedition in the <italic>Fram</italic> to try to reach the North Pole (1895–6) and was often said to have taken no alcohol. Dr Gourdon (who went on the two French expeditions during this era) says: ‘The example of Nansen is often quoted by those who recommend abstinence …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450139">Gourdon, 1913</xref>: 31). For example it was said that ‘Dr. Nansen took no alcohol with him in his expedition to the North Pole, asserting that it was of no service in the treatment of disease, whilst its use was most dangerous in such cold as he had to encounter.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957154X12450139">Anon., 1901</xref>).</p>
<p>However, Nansen himself said: ‘We had no wine (brandy) on board’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0957154X12450139">Nansen, 1897a</xref>: 142–3) and is later quoted as saying that he took no alcohol once he started sledging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450139">Crafts, 1909</xref>: 73). He did take beer, and there were 20–30 bottles of cognac in the medicine stores of the ship; on at least one occasion, some of this found its way into a celebratory punch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0957154X12450139">Nansen, 1897b</xref>: 24). Interestingly for one whose name is associated with abstinence, he is quoted in an advertisement for Crown Malt Beer as saying ‘it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957154X12450139">Advert., 1901</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly there were differences between countries, and in France the medical and social problems of excessive alcohol consumption had also been recognized but wine was seen as a healthy drink and even as an antidote to alcoholism as long as it kept drinkers away from the more dangerous absinthe and spirits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0957154X12450139">Munholland, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An opposing pressure would have come from companies producing alcohol. A special ‘<italic>Discovery</italic>’ whisky was produced (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957154X12450139">Fig. 1a</xref>) and other companies donated alcoholic beverages and used the Antarctic connection to advertise their products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957154X12450139">Figs 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957154X12450139">1c</xref>). The connection with expeditions of the heroic age has continued to be used, for example in advertisements for Guinness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957154X12450139">Advert., 1953</xref>) and McKinlay’s whisky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957154X12450139">Advert., 1973</xref>).</p>

<title>The value of alcohol</title>
<p>Alcohol (usually, but not exclusively, in the form of brandy) was considered as a stimulant and a valuable drug. I will not discuss here the medicinal use of alcohol which has been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957154X12450139">Guly, 2011</xref>), but there was much blurring of the distinction between medicinal and social use of alcohol. It was often regarded as a useful invalid food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957154X12450139">Guly 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957154X12450139">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957154X12450139">2012b</xref>), and an extreme medical view was that, as alcohol was a stimulant, it should be beneficial in all disease states. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0957154X12450139">Wilks (1891)</xref> quotes a London doctor who ‘gave brandy to all his cases, for he found all the Bermondsey people weak and required it’. The French had another medical reason for drinking wine as ‘one cannot deny that wine is an excellent anti-scorbutic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450139">Gourdon, 1913</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>The role of alcohol on polar expeditions was much debated, but the Antarctic explorers almost universally felt that it had a social role. Roald Amundsen, the conqueror of the South Pole in 1910, wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>[A]n occasional glass of wine or a tot of spirits were things that we all, without exception, were very glad of. The question of alcohol on Polar expeditions has often been discussed. Personally, I regard alcohol, used in moderation, as a medicine in the Polar regions – I mean, of course, so long as one is in winter quarters … Nor was it only in winter quarters that we had use for alcohol, but also on the long, monotonous voyage through raw, cold, and stormy regions. A tot of spirits is often a very good thing when one goes below after a bitter watch on deck and is just turning in. A total abstainer will no doubt turn up his nose and ask whether a cup of good warm coffee would not do as well … And think of the important part a glass of wine or toddy plays in social gatherings on such a voyage. Two men who have fallen out a little in the course of the week are reconciled at once by the scent of rum; the past is forgotten, and they start afresh in friendly co-operation. Take alcohol away from these little festivities, and you will soon see the difference. It is a sad thing, someone will say, that men absolutely must have alcohol to put them in a good humour – and I am quite ready to agree. But seeing that our nature is what it is, we must try to make the best of it. It seems as though we civilized human beings must have stimulating drinks, and that being so, we have to follow our own convictions. I am for a glass of toddy. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957154X12450139">Amundsen 1913</xref>: 69)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Von Drygalski, the leader of the first German expedition felt: ‘It was definitely a good thing not to be altogether dry, as it [alcohol] improved our sense of well-being and raised people’s spirits in time of gloom. When there was nothing to drink, a conversation about it … seemed to be enough to produce a similar effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0957154X12450139">von Drygalski, 1904/1989</xref>: 217). Dr McLean (on the Australasian expedition) said that whisky, port and claret were used sparingly but were consumed at special dinners. These ‘had, on the whole, a very beneficial effect. The psychic factor is to be reckoned with during a long polar winter, so that anything in moderation, which assists to “raise the tide of life” … must always be a great good.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957154X12450139">McLean, 1919</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>Large volumes of alcohol were often taken on an expedition. On Scott’s <italic>Discovery</italic> expedition (1901–4), the spirit room contained 33 octaves of rum (an octave is one-eighth of a standard sherry cask and can vary between 45 and 68 litres), 70 cases of whisky, 9 cases of special liqueur whisky and one octave of special liqueur whisky.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0957154X12450139">1</xref></sup> In addition we are told that 27 gallons of brandy, 27 gallons of whisky, 60 gallons of port wine and 36 gallons of sherry were taken as ‘medical comforts’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957154X12450139">Armitage, 1984</xref>: 311), and the expedition was re-supplied at the end of the first year, with further large quantities of alcohol being taken south.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957154X12450139">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dr Jean-Baptiste Charcot, the leader of the French expeditions (and son of Dr Jean Martin Charcot) found a way to assist in the difficulty in storage: ‘I got over the difficulty partly by bringing wine very strong in alcohol, which we dilute with more than the same quantity of just warm water before giving it out. Thus a considerable space is saved.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957154X12450139">Charcot, 1910/1978</xref>: 219–20). The Japanese expedition took smaller quantities. The <italic>New Zealand Evening Herald</italic> commented, ‘The party will not be without liquid comforts, but one might well believe after perusing their declared supplies, that most of the men on board the Kwainan Maru [sic] are temperate. The complete list includes “four dozen wine, two dozen brandy and whisky, and five dozen beer” – all for twenty-seven men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957154X12450139">Anon., 1911</xref>).</p>

<title>Alcohol on board ship and at base</title>
<p>Apart from its ability to raise morale, alcohol consumption was (and is) a part of normal life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957154X12450139">Charcot (1910/1978</xref>: 219–20) wrote: ‘The French sailor is one of the best of fellows, but, unhappily, he must have his regular “rations”, without which he considers himself lost.’ For reasons of discipline, alcohol consumption on board ships has usually been restricted. Some ships are ‘dry’ and, on others, alcohol is rationed even if sometimes the ration seems excessive. Rum was part of the rations of the Royal Navy which supplied the men for Scott’s expeditions. Of the French expedition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450139">Gourdon (1913</xref>: 32–3) writes:<disp-quote>
<p>… To our sailors used to French wine and, besides, the law allows them a quart of wine per day as well as a tot of rum, this [abstinence] was not behaviour that it was possible to achieve. We had to maintain moderation and ensure that the ration was not exceeded. I am not against those who abstain: on the contrary I admire their praiseworthy efforts to save us from the scourge of alcoholism. With them, I agree that our brave Breton population, in particular, is ravaged by this sickness. But would one willingly start a rigorous cure just at the time that one is asking of these men a considerable effort and to adjust to new privations on top of their other difficulties? I strongly believe that it would be too much and would achieve nothing … It is distressing but true, these men that one can take to the end of the world joyfully, who face danger with a smile, will not work if one stops their alcohol.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, none of the official expedition books admits to alcohol excess, and almost all the writings on the expeditions say that it was used sparingly. Thus Dr Koettliz said of the <italic>Discovery</italic> expedition: ‘A fair amount of wines, spirits and champagne were provided but very little was taken. The men had their ordinary rum ration served out to them, the officers did not take any alcohol for weeks at a time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957154X12450139">Anon., 1905</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0957154X12450139">Von Drygalski (1904/1989</xref>: 83) wrote that, apart from parties, ‘our consumption of alcohol throughout was slight. It consisted, after we had used up the supplies in cask, of wine two days a week at mid-day, half a bottle of beer on Sunday evening, and in addition, while we were in the ice, a ration of grog two nights a week’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957154X12450139">Charcot (1910/1978</xref>: 220) reported: ‘we live soberly in the ward-room and I have succeeded … in abolishing the word “aperitif” altogether’. This last point was echoed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450139">Gourdon (1913</xref>: 34): ‘as for aperitifs, they were totally unknown on board and this is progress that will not be disdained by the most fervent propagandists of temperance’.</p>
<p>The relatively low consumption of alcohol is demonstrated by the fact that on the return of the <italic>Discovery</italic>, they had enough wine and spirits left over to be auctioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957154X12450139">Anon., 1904</xref>). Shackleton’s <italic>Nimrod</italic> (1907–9) expedition left Antarctica more hurriedly, and two full crates of whisky have recently been discovered at Shackleton’s hut at Cape Royds.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0957154X12450139">
<title>Sledging parties</title>
<p>It was usually felt that alcohol had no role on sledging expeditions. The advice for the <italic>Discovery</italic> expedition, based on Arctic experience, was that alcohol was best avoided ‘as an equal weight of some nutritious food might then be carried instead of it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957154X12450139">McLintock, 1901</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957154X12450139">Amundsen (1913</xref>: 69) wrote: ‘On sledging journeys one has, of course, to save weight as much as possible, and to take only what is strictly necessary; and I do not include alcohol under the head of strictly necessary things.’ However he did not always practise what he preached:<disp-quote>
<p>I … [did] a thing that I have always been opposed to: I had brought spirits with me in the form of a bottle of Norwegian aquavit and a bottle of gin. I thought this a suitable occasion to bring in the gin. It was as hard as flint right through. While we were thawing it the bottle burst, and we threw it out into the snow … The next bottle – “Aquavit, No. 1” – was like a bone but … we succeeded with care in thawing it out … and then we had one.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However this episode reinforced his views as: ‘I was greatly disappointed; it was not half so good as I had thought. But I am glad I tried it, as I shall never do so again. The effect was nil; I felt nothing, either in my head or my feet.’</p>
<p>The exception to this was medical alcohol. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0957154X12450139">Dr Wilson (1905)</xref> said of the <italic>Discovery</italic> expedition that ‘no alcohol was taken on sledge journeys, except for a small can of brandy for emergencies’. Emergencies might not necessarily be medical emergencies. Dr McLean, on the Australasian expedition (1911–14), related how a party of three men missed a depot and had to travel 67 miles with minimal food. ‘Fortunately, they had, as well, a small store of absolute alcohol, which was ordinarily used for lighting the primus stove. Without doubt, the stimulation of small quantities of the alcohol, taken from time to time, helped them in safety to the Hut.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957154X12450139">McLean, 1919</xref>: 119).</p>
<p>There are many examples of this medical alcohol being used for non-medical purposes, but the quantities did not usually allow for intoxication. On Christmas day during a sledging trip on the Australasian expedition, ‘McLean produced the whisky from the medical kit and served it out, much diluted, in three mugs. There was not three ounces in all, but it flavoured the water.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957154X12450139">Mawson, 1915</xref>: 339). On the King’s birthday, members of the Scottish expedition ‘as loyal subjects … celebrated the occasion by an extra feed of penguins’ eggs and drinking the King’s health in our medicinal supply of whisky: there was about a teaspoonful for each of us’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0957154X12450139">Rudmose Brown, Moss and Pirie, 2002</xref>: 89).</p>

<sec id="section5-0957154X12450139">
<title>Alcohol abuse</title>
<p>The official books describing the expedition make no reference to drunkenness, but diaries and memoirs written later provide evidence of some lapses.</p>
<sec id="section6-0957154X12450139">
<title>On board ship</title>
<p>Problems with water supplies on board ships of the time were common, both with regard to quantity and quality and would be made worse if there were small tanks and slow progress. On the Australasian expedition (1911–14), the water became contaminated with seawater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0957154X12450139">Riffenburgh, 2011</xref>: 103) and so had to be rationed. Problems also occurred on the <italic>Terra Nova</italic>, and Charles Wright complained that: ‘another result of the shortage of water is the lack of something decent to drink. One does pall of champagne, beer and ginger ale in the course of time. Indeed I can think of nothing more calculated to turn a man a rabid T.T. [teetotaller] than a voyage on the <italic>Terra Nova</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957154X12450139">Bull and Wright, 1993</xref>: 9). The importance of social gatherings has been mentioned, and even the nearly-teetotal Dr Wilson reported in his diary: ‘Woke up with a splitting headache, the result of drinking bad wine in large quantities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957154X12450139">Wilson, 1966</xref>: 83). Alcohol excess might be truly accidental. On the Scottish expedition:<disp-quote>
<p>We opened a barrel of porter, one of two that Messrs Guinness presented to the ship at Dublin. After we had run off a certain amount it stopped running and on opening the head of the cask we found that the rest had frozen solidly. The part we drew off was excessively strong, the watery part having frozen and left the alcohol … Several of them [the crew] were quite drunk. The unwonted hilarity this occasioned caused this day to be long remembered, and was named by the crew ‘the night of the porter supper’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0957154X12450139">Speak, 2003</xref>: 87)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, sailors drank when the ship reached a port. On the <italic>Discovery</italic>, drunkenness occurred in Capetown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957154X12450139">Skelton, 2004</xref>: 21) and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957154X12450139">Skelton, 2004</xref>: 31) and caused a death in New Zealand when one of the crew fell from the main mast and was killed instantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957154X12450139">Wilson, 1966</xref>: 86). The fact that this death was alcohol-related was hushed up. Skelton wrote ‘… verdict “accidental death”. Nothing came out about man being drunk or having a bottle at the masthead’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0957154X12450139">Skelton 2004</xref>: 33).</p>
<p>There was also drunkenness on board after the celebrations for the crossing of the equator which led to a sailor having his thumb bitten and fainting which caused work for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0957154X12450139">Dr Wilson (1966</xref>: 44). He said:<disp-quote>
<p>[T]he men have a way of saving up their tots in a bottle till they have enough to get really drunk, and then they do! Sometimes each man in a mess takes his turn and drinks the whole of the rum served out to the mess, so he can get comfortably fuddled once a week, and the rest of the week he gets nothing of course.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>French sailors had the same idea:<disp-quote>
<p>[I]n the middle of the Antarctic winter at the beginning of July in that difficult period when the absence of the sun, long periods of inactivity, monotony of long periods of being confined inside make their effects felt … we organized games, races, wrestling on the snow. One day the quartermaster went to find the commander to announce to him the preparation of a sensational test and moreover to ask for the authorization to give a very special prize. Everyone would give up their daily tot and it would all be poured out for the winner who would thus have a copious quantity of rum. Charcot refused categorically but proposed other kinds of prize. Nothing could be done to charm our poor frustrated lads: they preferred to give up their project. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450139">Gourdon, 1913</xref>: 32–3)</p>

<title>Problems in the Antarctic</title>
<p>The second German (<italic>Deutschland</italic>) expedition (1911–13) was almost certainly the most dysfunctional of the Antarctic expeditions of the era, and there was a significant problem with drunkenness. Filchner, the expedition leader, reported that ‘this drunkenness is a cancer’ and that the Captain indulged in ‘abundant consumption of whisky’ and set an example of open drunkenness on board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957154X12450139">Murphy, 2002</xref>: 102). While ‘Heim [the geologist] is always drunk but friendly’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0957154X12450139">Murphy, 2002</xref>: 99), the doctor ‘had repeatedly been conspicuously unpleasant due to drunkenness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957154X12450139">Filchner, 1994</xref>: 209).</p>
<p>The only other expedition on which there seems to have been organized drunkenness was Shackleton’s <italic>Endurance</italic> expedition (1914–17) after they had been stranded on Elephant Island and Shackleton had sailed to South Georgia to get help. James Wordie’s diary records:<disp-quote>
<p>Realising that the King’s health had been drunk on Friday [the King’s birthday] without alcohol, the experiment was made of putting methylated spirit in the milk: but it was a failure, it being Clark’s 90% preservative with a fair proportion of wood naphtha, which gave a sickly taste. However keen alcoholists seemed only too eager to drink other people’s leavings and became very merry accordingly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957154X12450139">Smith, 2007</xref>: 339)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It cannot have been too much of a failure as, at the midwinter concert, ‘three toasts were drunk in methylated spirits … as there was more than one distribution of methylated during the evening, some of the party were fairly merry …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0957154X12450139">Smith, 2007</xref>: 339). The ring-leader seems to have been Frank Wild who had been left in charge in Shackleton’s absence and who realized that Shackleton would not have been impressed, saying: ‘if the Boss turned up now, he wouldn’t take us off’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450139">Huntford, 2000a</xref>: 538).</p>
<p>Other expeditions had occasional lapses. Some members of the <italic>Southern Cross</italic> (1898–1900) expedition were overcome from carbon monoxide and looked for medicinal brandy for this. Bernacchi wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>We also made a most serious discovery on searching for brandy, we could not find a single bottle. There is not a drop left. The contemptible fool Borchgrevink [the expedition leader] has used all for his miserable little sledge journeys, taking as much as three bottles of Cognac alone at a time in addition to two or three bottles of whiskey and the same quantity of port. It has transpired that on the last journey with the two Finns, it was the common practice to make grog nearly every night using a whole flask full (which exactly contains a bottle) at a time. The Finns could only drink a glass jug of this and Borchgrevinck imbibed the remainder. He must surely have been drunk the whole time. Unless the doctor has a bottle or so, we have not a drop of brandy at Cape Adair for medicinal purposes. On this occasion we were obliged to use whiskey. It is really scandalous. There is no language strong enough to properly designate this disreputable beggar. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957154X12450139">Crawford, 1998</xref>: 148)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the Australasian expedition, the leader found that a bottle of port had been drunk and wrote in his diary: ‘… put a drop of croton oil [a purgative] in some of the Port in a bottle. Await results.’ He later discovered that the culprit was Dr Whetter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957154X12450139">Jacka and Jacka, 1988</xref>: 96–7).</p>

<sec id="section8-0957154X12450139">
<title>Alcoholism</title>
<p>At least three Antarctic explorers are known to have been alcoholics either before or after the expedition. (It is highly likely that there were more that we do not know about.) The most famous was the Norwegian, Hjalmar Johansen, who accompanied Fridtjof Nansen in the <italic>Fram</italic> on the Furthest North expedition. On his return to Norway they were celebrated as heroes, and Johansen was promoted to captain in the army but failed to cope and drank heavily and left the army. He rehabilitated during a stay at Spitzbergen from 1907 to 1909 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957154X12450139">Huntford, 2000b</xref>: 250–1). Nansen asked Amundsen to take him on his expedition, perhaps to help an old friend and as a way of getting him away from the temptation of alcohol.</p>
<p>At the time of the South Polar expedition, Johansen was an almost legendary figure. He was physically very strong, could drive a dog team, was an accomplished skier and knew how to survive on the ice. He was originally one of a party of eight chosen to set out for the South Pole. They started very early in the season but were driven back to their base by the intense cold. Johansen had argued with Amundsen against this early start, and following their return had a further row, in public, with Amundsen. Amundsen never forgave him and sacked him from the team that eventually reached the pole, with a team of only five men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957154X12450139">Huntford, 2000b</xref>: 392–7). Following the expedition’s arrival in Australia, Johansen started to drink again and was sent home in disgrace. Johansen continued to drift, and shot himself in 1913 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957154X12450139">Albretsen, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Another person who had an alcohol problem after his return was Dr Alister Forbes Mackay, one of the surgeons on Shackleton’s first (<italic>Nimrod</italic>) expedition (1907–9). The problem, which he himself recognized, is described in a biography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957154X12450139">Mills, 2008</xref>: 78–9). He had previously been a naval surgeon, and his biographer says that although he would have had the opportunity to drink to excess when he was in the navy, there is no evidence that he had a problem in the Antarctic and that it only seems to have occurred after his return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957154X12450139">Mills, 2008</xref>: 78). However, he is said to have missed the midwinter celebrations as he had drunk two-thirds of a bottle of whisky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450139">Huntford, 2000a</xref>: 229). In addition, Mackintosh (another expedition member) hinted at a problem. When a horse fell in the ice-cold water, it was:<disp-quote>
<p>apparently none the worse for his immersion although frozen pretty well stiff. Mackay, with great forethought, ordered a bottle of brandy for the pony! A grand opportunity as brandy always appeals to the ‘highlander’ and would be warming for man and beast! ‘Like cures like’ so the pony got the half bottle and the ‘Mac’ unselfishly took a ‘wee drappie’ himself. We could see the pony’s eyes watering very knowingly – saying probably to himself ‘Don’t finish it, old man, as I got it for you’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0957154X12450139">Newman, 1990</xref>: 56)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mackay seems to have had some self-awareness as, when he was admitted to a ‘home for inebriates’, he realized that this added ‘an additional stigma to my already rather (or very) dubious reputation’. He wrote: ‘My doctor in Edinburgh attributed my frequent lapses from the paths of strict sobriety to the kick on the eye which I received in S.A. [South Africa during the Boer War] I told him that I thought this a very charitable view to take of the case.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957154X12450139">Mills, 2008</xref>: 79).</p>
<p>In 1913 Mackay sailed on the <italic>Karluk</italic> on Stefansson’s Canadian Arctic Expedition. In a book on the expedition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0957154X12450139">Niven (2000</xref>: 14) says that ‘the hiring of Mackay was actually a favour to Shackleton, who was concerned about the doctor’s reckless behaviour and overindulgence in alcohol. Stefansson agreed to engage Dr Mackay as surgeon to get him away from “the evil influences of civilization”.’ On the ship he continued to drink and take drugs; when the ship became stuck in the ice, he and three others tried to escape over the ice in February 1914 and were never seen again.</p>
<p>Sir Ernest Shackleton, both before and during his third expedition on the <italic>Quest</italic> (1921-2), had started to drink heavily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450139">Huntford, 2000a</xref>: 677, 687). His biographers said that he had never allowed alcohol on board ship except for rare and special occasions, but that on the <italic>Quest</italic> he opened a bottle of champagne most mornings, offering it also to the officers and surgeons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957154X12450139">Fisher and Fisher, 1957</xref>: 473). They also quote Dr Macklin who reported a conversation with Shackleton shortly before he died. Shackleton (after being given some health advice) had said, ‘You’re always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?’ Macklin replied, ‘Chiefly alcohol, Boss I don’t think it agrees with you’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957154X12450139">Fisher and Fisher, 1957</xref>: 477).</p>
<p>Expeditions were seen as a safe place for people with alcohol problems because of the relative lack of opportunity for drinking to excess. Examples include Johansen and Mackay, discussed above, and Frank Wild (the most experienced Antarctic explorer of that era, with five expeditions to his name) who was the ringleader of the drinking exploits on Elephant Island. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450139">Huntford (2000a</xref>: 537) says that: ‘By his own account, the first time Mawson first met Wild, in New Zealand, during the <italic>Nimrod</italic> expedition Wild was being carried drunk out of a hotel. Since the Antarctic was virtually dry, Mawson reckoned, that there, Wild would be absolutely reliable’ on the Australasian expedition (and so it proved). Apart from the lapse on Elephant Island, Antarctic service kept him out of trouble, but he later developed a serious alcohol problem and died in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0957154X12450139">Mills, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0957154X12450139">
<title>Use of drugs</title>
<p>On the internet there are many references to Shackleton and Scott using cocaine, e.g. ‘Intrepid polar adventurer Ernest Shackleton explored Antarctica propelled by tablets of Forced March’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957154X12450139">Anon., 2010a</xref>), and ‘in 1909, Ernest Shackleton took “Forced March” brand cocaine tablets to Antarctica, as did Captain Scott a year later’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957154X12450139">Anon., 2010b</xref>). The truth is less exciting.</p>
<p>On their return from the attempt to reach the South Pole, the four expedition members ran out of food before reaching a depot. Marshall (one of Shackleton’s doctors) later described events:<disp-quote>
<p>Between 25th and 27th [December] we turned night into day with forced marches and brief rests, all food being exhausted, but twice we had sugarless and milkless tea or cocoa. Not until this moment did I produce 24 “Forced March” tablets (cocaine), and only then when I thought that we would make the depot before the effects of the last dose had ceased to be effective. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957154X12450139">Marshall, 1943</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>He described the same events in a letter to the <italic>British Medical Journal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957154X12450139">Marshall, 1942</xref>) and described this further in correspondence, writing:<disp-quote>
<p>The ‘Forced March’ (Cocaine preparation) was issued from 5.30 pm on the 26th, at hourly intervals [the recommended dosage schedule], until the early morning of the 27th, the supply being exhausted … While it lasted, the effect was dramatic and we had every hope of making the depot that night. The final collapse of two members was due to the reaction and failure to obtain the food which I was reckoning on, but was not available until about 15 hours later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957154X12450139">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Stimulating the body to make it do more work in the absence of nutrients is clearly risky and, because of the failure to reach the depot while still under the influence of the ‘Forced March’, Marshall said that he was ‘still guessing whether the “Forced March” nearly killed us or saved us!’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957154X12450139">4</xref></sup> After some of the party collapsed, Marshall went on alone to the depot to obtain the food they required and had some lumps of sugar. His letter continues: ‘The effect of the 2 lumps of sugar, some 15 hours later, was equally dramatic, and if I was asked to choose between the relative merits of these two stimulants, under similar conditions, I should choose sugar.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957154X12450139">5</xref></sup> This incident does not seem to justify the description of Shackleton exploring Antarctica ‘propelled by tablets of Forced March’.</p>
<p>‘Forced March’ (also known as ‘kola compound’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957154X12450139">Fig. 1d</xref>) was a combination of extracts of coca (active ingredient: cocaine) and kola (active ingredient: caffeine). The same drug was carried on Scott’s and Shackleton’s second expeditions and was certainly used by members of the Ross Sea Party section of Shackleton’s expedition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957154X12450139">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The British expeditions were not alone in taking cocaine preparations. The most common way of using coca as a general tonic was as a tonic wine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0957154X12450139">Spillane, 2000</xref>: 14–24), and the commonest preparation was Mariani wine which contained 6 mg of cocaine per fluid ounce. This was a weak solution when compared with cocaine in tablet form which came in strengths of half, one and five grains (one grain is 68.4 mg), and toxicity does not seem to have been a problem with this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957154X12450139">Karsch, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957154X12450139">Charcot (1910/1978</xref>: 48) records using it: ‘I … take them [Bongrain and Boland] some cakes and some Mariani wine to warm them’; and and he gave a testimonial to the manufacturers: ‘I am convinced that Mariani wine will contribute greatly to the success of the French Antarctic Expedition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957154X12450139">Andrews and Solomon, 1973</xref>: 243–6). Although the dangers of cocaine had been recognized, it was legal at the time and had medical uses. Tonics were much in vogue and, while the boundaries between legitimate tonics and stimulant drugs is blurred, the use of cocaine as described above would have been accepted as reasonable practice.</p>
<p>Other drugs were also used, in ways that they would not be used now; for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0957154X12450139">Dr Wilson (1905)</xref> wrote of snow blindness: ‘Sleep was the best and quickest cure of all, even if an injection of morphine had to be given to produce it.’ Cocaine was also taken as a local anaesthetic, particularly for use in the eye for snow-blindness.</p>
<p>I am aware of only one hint of drug abuse. This occurred during the Swedish expedition (1901–3) on which Dr Ekelöf is said to have been addicted to morphine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957154X12450139">Lewander, 2004</xref>) and his addiction and withdrawal symptoms caused problems with his research and in his relationships with his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957154X12450139">Lewander, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957154X12450139">2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Dr Mackay’s alcohol addiction is discussed above. There is no evidence that he abused drugs on Shackleton’s expedition, but he is said to have abused strychnine during the later expedition to the Arctic on which he died (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0957154X12450139">Niven, 2000</xref>: 73). Doctors, with their easy access to drugs, would be more prone to drug abuse than others.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Alcohol had a significant social role in the early Antarctic expeditions. Although drunkenness did occur on some expeditions, the relative lack of alcohol meant that that Antarctica was seen as a safe environment for those with known alcohol problems; however, when they returned to civilization they were, once again, at risk of abusing alcohol. The circumstances of Antarctic exploration were, in many ways, unique but attitudes to alcohol, as illustrated in this paper, were the product of the time and would have been shared with many other groups in society.</p>
