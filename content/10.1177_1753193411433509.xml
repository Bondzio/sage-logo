<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>A 6-year-old girl was referred after developing sudden spontaneous necrosis over the tip of the left index finger 3 weeks previously. The patient and her parents gave a history of episodes of pain, paraesthesia and discolouration, initially pale then blue and red, affecting all fingers on both hands and induced by the cold. She had no significant past medical history and there was no family history of vasculitis.</p>
<p>On examination there was a small area of necrosis over the pulp of the left index finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411433509">Figure 1</xref>). The area was healing well with no signs of infection. Clinically there were no cervical bruits, with synchronous radial pulses and equal blood pressure in both arms. There was no local pathology in the upper limb to suggest a thoracic outlet compression causing the problem. There were no cardiac murmurs and a structurally normal heart with no evidence of endocarditis, vegetations or central cause of embolism. Radiographs showed loss of the tuft of the terminal phalanx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411433509">Figure 2</xref>). The patient was positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA).</p>

<p>Over the course of a month the necrotic tip separated and the finger healed with conservative measures. When reviewed 3 months later there had been a small area of ulceration on the dorsal aspect of the thumb of the same hand which had healed uneventfully in the interim period. At the 6-month follow-up there had been no further episodes.</p>
<p>Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) refers to transient vasospasm of peripheral arteries and arterioles resulting in a triphasic colour change in the affected region. Most cases of RP in children are primary (idiopathic). Connective tissue diseases are the most common cause of secondary RP. Rare cases of hepatitis-induced paediatric RP have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411433509">Muwakkit et al., 2002</xref>). Cold exposure is the trigger in 90% of cases with primary and secondary RP; 3% of patients with primary RP and 10% with secondary RP reported that stress triggered the episode. In addition, 5% of primary RP cases and none with secondary reported episodes precipitated by exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433509">Nigrovic et al., 2003</xref>). As with adult cases, RP in children is more prevalent in the female sex. The overall prevalence is 14.9%; an 18% prevalence is reported in girls, and 12% in boys. The mean age of onset of symptoms of primary RP is 12.2 years and 12.7 years for secondary RP. Its occurrence in the first decade of life is rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433509">Nigrovic et al., 2003</xref>). Prevalence increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433509">Jones et al., 2003</xref>). Ninety per cent of patients with secondary RP are ANA-positive or have nail fold abnormalities. Thirty-nine per cent of primary RP cases are ANA-positive or have nail changes. Anti-phospholipid (APL) antibodies have been noted to be associated with RP in rheumatoid arthritis and there are case reports of APL antibodies in children with digital ischaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433509">Nigrovic et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, prostaglandins and L-arginine can reduce the frequency, severity and duration of attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433509">Herrick, 2003</xref>). Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil) and low-dose salicylates such as aspirin have been used in paediatric cases that had APL antibodies but there is little information about their efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433509">Nigrovic et al., 2003</xref>). Non-pharmacological treatments with thermal biofeedback and digital sympathectomies have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve digital circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433509">Herrick, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Digital gangrene is reported in 3% of children with secondary RP but did not occur in children with primary RP in the largest paediatric series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411433509">Nigrovic et al., 2003</xref>). A search has yielded no documented cases of digital necrosis in children with primary RP. Clinicians should be aware of RP as a cause of spontaneous fingertip ulcerations in children. The pattern of colour changes does not distinguish primary from secondary RP; nail fold changes and ANA and APL are the most useful discriminatory tests.</p>
