<abstract>
<p>Perceptions of school rules and punishment practices, particularly for racial and ethnic minority youth, are related to educational progress, psychological well-being, and adult stability and success. What remains uncertain is how the fastest growing segment of the population in the USA, the children of immigrants, perceives the rules and punishment practices within their schools. This study utilizes data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 and incorporates multilevel analysis to examine the children of immigrants’ perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices, which indeed reveal imperative findings. First generation youth have increased perceptions of just and fair punishment practices within their schools; however, Black/African American and Latino American third-plus generation youth have diminished perceptions of just and fair punishment practices within their schools. The implications of the evident racial and ethnic, as well as generational, disparities in the perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices in the USA are discussed more generally.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1462474512452518" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, perceptions of school rules and punishment practices, particularly those of racial and ethnic minorities, have received much attention. Racial and ethnic minority youth’s perception of rules and punishment practices within their lives and at school, impacts their overall well-being, stress and depression, criminal behavior, attitude and motivation in school, and educational progress and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kupchik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1462474512452518">LaFree, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474512452518">Rios, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1462474512452518">Wong et al., 2003</xref>). This is particularly alarming when it is projected that within the next 25 years, for the first time in US history, White Americans will represent less than half the total youth population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474512452518">US Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Research also demonstrates that the growing number of racial and ethnic minorities within the USA is related to immigration. Although racial and ethnic minority youth perceive the school rules and punishment practices as unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512452518">Bracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>), little is known about how the children of immigrants perceive school rules and punishment practices.</p>
<p>The USA has approximately 43 million foreign-born people, representing approximately 13 percent of the USA population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474512452518">US Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). As a result, 25 percent of all students in US schools have at least one immigrant parent. Unlike earlier immigration waves, where most immigrants were from Europe, approximately 85 percent of immigrants from the current immigration wave are from Latin America, Asia, or the Caribbean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1462474512452518">US Census Bureau, 2010</xref>). Due to the change in the racial and ethnic composition of this wave of immigration, persistent disparities linked to race and ethnicity may be contributing to the educational barriers that the children of immigrants face in US schools. Since children of immigrants are a rapidly growing segment of the population within the US school system, the need to understand the school experiences of this population is pressing. School is not only where the children of immigrants learn about US values, beliefs, and behaviors but also about their social and cultural role in US society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>). Kupchik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">2010</xref>: 7) stressed that youth in US schools may be learning the ‘wrong’ lesson when it comes to school rules and punishment practices by suggesting that ‘this lesson encourages passivity and uncritical acceptance of authority, which bode poorly for the future of democratic participation’; therefore, understanding how the children of immigrants perceive the school rules and punishment and punishment practices warrants investigation. Though prior research reveals how race and ethnicity matter in perceptions of school rules and punishment, these studies often assume racial or ethnic minority groups are homogeneous. In actuality, the terrain is more complex, so that not all Black/African American, Latino American, Asian American, and White American youth have similar within-group experiences.</p>
<p>This study extends the literature on race, ethnicity, and the children of immigrants’ experiences within the US school system by examining the multilevel relationships between generational status, race, ethnicity, and perceptions of school rules and punishment practices. This research makes use of multilevel analyses and employs nationally representative data on students’ school experiences to explore whether children of immigrants have distinctive patterns in their perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. The results revealing the potentially diminishing perceptions of fairness in school rules and punishment practices held by children of immigrants are discussed along with their implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1462474512452518"><title>Youth perceptions of school justice and fair punishment</title>
<p>It is well known that schools are institutions of socialization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474512452518">Dewey’s (1916)</xref> seminal work on education cemented the theoretical link between education and democracy. According to Dewey, schools could serve not only to level the playing field, but also as an apprenticeship for civic life. Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1462474512452518">Dewey (1916)</xref> argued that schools socialize and educate youth into appropriate social positions, roles, and responsibilities for a ‘democratic society’, researchers have scrutinized the socialization process that occurs within US schools. Unfortunately, schools can reproduce inequality and foster diminished perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices within schools for racial and ethnic minority youth.</p>
<p>Perceptions of school rules and punishment practices as just and fair are particularly important because schools are institutions of socialization where youth learn about social positions, roles, and responsibilities in a democratic society. The significance of students’ perceptions or views about the justice and fairness within their schools should not be underestimated. How youth perceive their school environment may be more important than ‘objective reality’, in that youth’s perceptions can influence their response, behavior, interactions, and education while in that school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kupchik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchick and Ellis, 2008</xref>). Consequently, there has been growing concern and research attention paid to the poor perceptions of school rules and punishment practices among racial and ethnic minority youth because it is arguably linked to educational progress and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512452518">Bracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474512452518">Cammarota, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>There are racial and ethnic differences to the perception of the clarity and enforcement of the school rules. School rules are often highlighted and emphasized to Black/African American and Latino American youth because it is a means of socializing youth towards accepting increased social control in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512452518">Bracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474512452518">Cammarota, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>). Although Black/African American and Latino American youth have heightened awareness of what the school rules are, Black/African American and Latino American youth have diminished perceptions of the school rules as fair and of the enforcement of these rules as just (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512452518">Bracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1462474512452518">Cammarota, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>). Although it appears that many racial and ethnic minority youth in the USA do not view schools as just and fair, what remains unknown is how the growing population of children of immigrants perceives the rules and punishment practices within their schools.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1462474512452518"><title>Schooling and immigration</title>
<p>US schools are institutions of socialization with which immigrants and their children come into contact. As a result of previous waves of immigration, US schools have undergone phenomenal transformations, with changes in educational philosophy, instruction, and curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1462474512452518">Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474512452518">Olsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474512452518">Rong and Preissle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474512452518">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). The ideological role of the school in educating and socializing the children of immigrants has been scrutinized, especially in regard to racial and ethnic educational inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474512452518">Olsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474512452518">Rong and Preissle, 2008</xref>). Because racial and ethnic disparities are historic and persistent within US schools, researchers have explored to what extent race and ethnicity are significant factors to be considered in the assimilation process.</p>
<p>The race and ethnicity of the majority of contemporary immigrants sets them apart from the previous waves of immigrants who were primarily from Europe. For the current wave of immigrants, many of them have never experienced prejudice associated with a particular skin color or racial type in their country of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>). Immigrants and their children are confronted with the reality of racial and ethnic classification and stratification in US schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474512452518">Kozol, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474512452518">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1462474512452518">Lareau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474512452518">Olsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1462474512452518">Rong and Priessle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474512452518">Waters, 1999</xref>). In this regard, the role of race and ethnicity may be significant in relation to the children of immigrants’ school experiences.</p>
<p>There is research examining the adaptation and assimilation processes of the new immigrants and their children; however, to what extent race and ethnicity are related to the assimilation process is often questioned by researchers. Conventional or ‘straight-line’ assimilation theorists argue that assimilation proceeds in a straight-line which promotes upward intergenerational mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1462474512452518">Alba and Nee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1462474512452518">Kasinitz et al., 2009</xref>). In other words, as each subsequent generation becomes more ‘American’, they are rewarded for their assimilation with increased opportunities for upward social, economic, and educational mobility. Segmented assimilation theorists, however, argue that race and ethnicity are significant in the assimilation process because social institutions, such as schools, have embedded racial and ethnic inequalities that present barriers toward upward social, economic, and educational mobility for the children of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1462474512452518">Gans, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1462474512452518">Rumbaut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1462474512452518">Zhou, 1997</xref>). Consequently, the process of assimilation becomes segmented because assimilation may facilitate either upward or downward mobility due in part to the race or ethnicity of the immigrant. It is this notion of a ‘downward’ trajectory toward educational failure that has raised much social concern for the schooling of the children of immigrants in the USA.</p>
<p>There are a number of findings associated with the children of immigrants’ community and school experiences that reflect one of segmented assimilation. First generation Latino American, Asian American, and Black/African American youth report high educational optimism but that educational optimism often declines by third-plus generation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474512452518">Kao and Tienda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco and Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Third-plus generation Black/African American, Latino American, and Asian American youth have higher dropout rates than their immigrant parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1462474512452518">Perreira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>). Finally, third-plus generation Black/African American and Latino American youth have more experiences with violence while at school in comparison to their first and second generation counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1462474512452518">Ewert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474512452518">Peguero, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474512452518">2011</xref>). Thus, examining the school-based experiences, such as perceptions of school rules and punishment practices, of the rapidly growing population of children of immigrants is warranted and needed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1462474512452518"><title>The current study</title>
<p>Perception of clear school rules and fair punishment practices can facilitate the youth’s successful socialization as a participating member of democratic society. The ideal of justice and fairness within a school is imperative because the educational system is the foundation of a democratic meritocracy. It is also important to acknowledge that there is a historical and ongoing pattern of racial and ethnic disparities within USA schools. The effects of students’ perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices could promote or derail educational progress and success, particularly for racial and ethnic minority youth. Many racial and ethnic minorities also have diminished perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices and suffer exponentially as a result. Although immigrants who migrate to the USA have increased optimistic beliefs that this nation is just and fair, which is often considered a major factor for immigration to the USA, today’s immigrants and their children face a reality of racially and ethnically disparate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>). Understanding the perception of school rules and punishment practices within an institution of socialization that prepares the fastest growing segment of youth in the USA, the children of immigrants, to enter a democratic society is imperative.</p>
<p>In sum, there are three research questions for this study. Is generational status a significant factor in understanding youth perceptions of just school rules and fair punishment practices within school? If so, is the relationship between generational status and perceptions of just school rules and fair punishment practices within school distinct for different racial and ethnic groups? If the relationship between generational status and youth perceptions of just and fair punishment practices within school indeed varies by race and ethnicity, do they reflect a pattern of segmented assimilation?</p>

<sec id="sec5-1462474512452518"><title>Data and methods</title>
<sec id="sec6-1462474512452518"><title>Data</title>
<p>The data for the research are drawn from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS). ELS is a longitudinal survey administered by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) for the National Center for Education Statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474512452518">NCES, 2004</xref>) of the US Department of Education. ELS is ‘designed to monitor the transition of a national sample of young people as they progress from tenth grade through high school and on to postsecondary education and/or the world of work’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474512452518">NCES, 2004</xref>: 7). These data include information about the experiences and backgrounds of students, parents, and teachers, and descriptions of the schools the respondent students attended.</p>
<p>As with most, if not all samples, the analytical sample is smaller than the original sample. This study focused on 12,030 public school students in the base year sample. As in previous research that investigated the experiences of the children of immigrants within US schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474512452518">Kao and Tienda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474512452518">Peguero, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474512452518">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1462474512452518">Rumbaut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco and Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1462474512452518">Zhou, 1997</xref>), because the intersection of race, ethnicity, and generation is central for a segmented assimilation analysis, this study focused on Black/African American, Latino American, Asian American, and White American public school students. Students who reported being Native American, multiple races and ethnicities, and/or no race and ethnicity were excluded from the analysis. Finally, data from students who only participated in the abbreviated survey (which did not include parents’ characteristics) were excluded from the sample because parents’ birthplace is essential information for measuring the student’s generational status. Thus, this research uses a subsample from the ELS data consisting of 9870 first, second, and third-plus generation public school students.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1462474512452518"><title>Perception of just and fair punishment school practices</title>
<p>Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>), perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices (Cronbach’s α = .84) are based on five Likert scale items (0 = Strongly Disagree, 1 = Disagree, 2 = Agree, and 3 = Strongly Agree) that the student self-reported: (1) everyone knows what the school rules are; (2) if a school rule is broken, students know what kind of punishment will follow; (3) the school rules are fair; (4) school rules are strictly enforced; and (5) the punishment for breaking school rules is the same no matter who you are.

Immigration and birthplace information for the students are reported on the parents’ survey. First generation students are children who are born outside the USA; second generation students are born in the USA and have at least one parent born outside the USA; and third-plus generation students are born in the USA, as well as both of their parents.</p>
<p>In the ELS survey design, students self-report their race and ethnicity. Black/African American, Latino American, and Asian American students are over-sampled to obtain a sufficient representation for statistical analyses of these groups. All of the analyses in this study incorporated sample weights which were calculated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474512452518">NCES (2004)</xref> to compensate for the survey design and non-response bias, and to present findings that are nationally representative (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474512452518">NCES, 2004</xref> for further details).</p>

<sec id="sec9-1462474512452518"><title>Student, family, and school characteristics</title>
<p>Previous studies have established which student (i.e. gender, achievement, involvement, misbehavior, and victimization), family (i.e. socioeconomic status, structure, and parental involvement), and school (i.e. diversity, poverty, size, security, and locale) characteristics are associated with perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices as well as the school experiences of the children of immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474512452518">Kozol, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474512452518">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kuphick, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474512452518">Olsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1462474512452518">Peguero, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1462474512452518">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco and Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco et al., 2008</xref>); thus, these control measures are included in this study.</p>
<p>Gender is coded male or female based on the student’s self-report of their biological sex. Male students serve as the reference group. Achievement is measured by using the standardized measure developed by RTI and NCES. ELS included a reading and math composite score based on standardized tests developed by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). The composite test score is the average of the math and reading standardized scores, re-standardized to a national mean of 50.0 and standard deviation of 10. Involvement (α = .63) measures if the student is involved in any of the following four categories of school-based extracurricular activities: (1) academic (e.g. honor society, band, yearbook, etc.); (2) school club; (3) intramural sports; and (4) interscholastic sports. Misbehavior (α = .86) is a constructed scale that counts the number of misbehaving acts the student self-reported while in school (0 = never, 1 = once or twice, 2 = more than twice): (1) cutting or skipping classes; (2) getting into a physical fight at school; and (3) getting into trouble for not following school rules. Victimization (α = .75) is a count variable (0 = never, 1 = once or twice, and 2 = more than twice) that is based on four items of within school victimization: (1) someone threatened to hurt me at school; (2) someone bullied me or picked on me; (3) someone hit me; and (4) someone used strong-arm or forceful methods to get money or things from me.</p>
<p>The NCES preconstructed measure of family socioeconomic status is a standardized (z-score) variable based on five equally weighted, standardized components: father’s/guardian’s education; mother’s/guardian’s education; family income; father’s/guardian’s occupational prestige; and mother’s/guardian’s occupational prestige (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1462474512452518">NCES, 2004</xref> for further details about preconstructed variables). Family structure is a dichotomous variable indicating if the student lives in a single-parent household or a two-parent household; single-parent households serve as the reference group. Parental involvement (α = .91) is an index based on eight items that measured parents’ involvement in their children’s school experience (each coded 0 = not involved and 1 = involved): (1) checking homework; (2) helping with homework; (3) discussing school courses; (4) discussing school activities; (5) discussing things studied in class; (6) discussing grades; (7) discussing transferring; and (8) discussing college attendance.</p>
<p>Diversity measures the proportion of racial and ethnic minority students who are enrolled at the school. Poverty measures the proportion of students receiving free or reduced lunch within each school. Size is measured as the total student enrollment of the school. Security (α = .85) is a count index where school administrators indicate whether the following security measures were implemented in their schools: (1) control access to school buildings during school hours; (2) control access to school grounds during school hours; (3) require students to pass through metal detectors each day; (4) perform one or more random metal detector checks on students; (5) close the campus for most students during lunch; (6) use one or more random dog sniffs to check for drugs; (7) perform one or more random sweeps for contraband; (8) require clear book bags or ban book bags on school grounds; (9) require students to wear badges or picture IDs; (10) require faculty and staff to wear badges or picture IDs; and (11) use one or more security cameras to monitor the school. School locale indicates whether the school is located in an urban or nonurban (reference category) locale.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1462474512452518"><title>Analytic strategy</title>
<p>Since the ELS is designed as a cluster sample in which schools are sampled with unequal probability and then students are sampled or ‘nested’ within these selected schools, ELS violates the assumption of independent observations. The nested structure of ELS (i.e. students within schools) makes multilevel modeling an appropriate analytic tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1462474512452518">Raudenbush et al., 2008</xref>). Because the outcome variable of the overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices is continuous, Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) is utilized to analyze the multilevel relationships between generational status, race and ethnicity, and students’ perceptions of school rules and punishment practices while controlling for student, family, and school characteristics. Because exploring each facet of students’ perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices is important, Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling (HGLM) analysis is utilized. Since each measure of students’ perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices (i.e. everyone knows what the school rules are, students know punishment for broken school rules, school rules are fair, school rules strictly enforced, and school punishment the same no matter who you are) is an ordinal variable outcome, and ordinal HGLM logistic regression is appropriate. With HLM and HGLM, it is possible to examine the ability of group-level (or school-level) variables to explain variation at the individual level. Thus, the relationships between student and school-level factors and students’ perceptions of school rules and punishment practices can be investigated.</p>
<p>The analyses proceed in several steps. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1462474512452518">Table 1</xref> presents descriptive statistics for the variables in this study. Because generational status is an important aspect of this study, the differences between generational status groups for key student-level variables are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1462474512452518">Table 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref> displays the HLM results of the relationships and interactions between the overall scale of perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices, generational status, race and ethnicity, and pertinent student, family, and school characteristics. In the baseline model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref>, the overall scale of perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices is regressed on race and ethnicity, as well as other student, family, and school characteristics. In model 2 of the same table, generational status is introduced into the analysis in order to assess the role of generation in relationship between perceptions of the schools rules and punishment practices. In model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table3</xref>, the interaction between generation, race, and ethnicity are considered. As proposed, to better understand each facet of the perception of the school rules and punishment practices, a disaggregated HGLM examination of each measure of the school rules and punishment practices is presented in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1462474512452518">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1462474512452518">5</xref>, while controlling for other pertinent factors.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref> shows the HLM results that examine the relationships between generational status, race and ethnicity, overall perception of the school rules and punishment practices, and other pertinent factors. Model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref> displays the baseline findings of students’ overall perception of the school rules and punishment practices on student, family, and school characteristics. While controlling for other variables, at this stage of the analysis, there appears to be no statistical difference in perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices between Black/African Americans, Latino Americans, Asian Americans, and White Americans.</p>
<p>In order to explore the first research question about the significance of generational status in the relationship between race, ethnicity, and overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices, generational status is added to the analysis in the second model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref>. First generation students (b = .414, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .001) have relatively higher overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair than third-plus generation students. There also appears to be no statistical difference between second generation students and third-plus generation students in relationship to their perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. It is also important to note that the inclusion of generational status into the analysis did not moderate the relationship between race, ethnicity, and overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair.</p>
<p>To examine the second and third research questions about the potential racial and ethnic differences in the children of immigrants’ overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices, the interactions between generational status, race, and ethnicity are added to the analysis in the third model of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1462474512452518">Table 3</xref>. In comparison to third-plus generation White Americans, first generation Black/African Americans (b = .583, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), Latino Americans (b = .402, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .01), Asian Americans (b = .299, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05), and White Americans (b = .570, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) have relatively higher overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair. These findings do suggest that generational status matters differently for distinct racial and ethnic groups in relationship to overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. Also, as suggested by segmented assimilation theory, first generation youth have higher overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair. More importantly from a segmented assimilation perspective, in comparison to third-plus generation White Americans, first generation Black/African Americans and Latino Americans have increased perceptions of school rules and punishment being clear and fair; however, those increased perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices appear to diminish as the children of immigrants assimilate. Finally, the effect of being a first generation immigrant seems to be the relatively strongest effect, in relation to other variables included in the study, in regards to their overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair. As revealed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis (2008)</xref>, the following analyses will present the distinct facets of overall perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices because there are conceptual and practical differences between clarity and enforcement of the school rules.</p>

<sec id="sec19-1462474512452518"><title>Student, family, and school characteristics</title>
<p>The following student and family characteristics are associated with perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. The relationship between the student and family characteristics and perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices are generally consistent across the five dependent variables. For student characteristics, females and more involved students have relatively more positive perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices whereas higher achieving, misbehaving, and victimized students have relatively lower perceptions of school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair. For family characteristics, students in families with higher socioeconomic status have relatively lower perceptions, while students who have more involved parents have relatively more positive perceptions, of the school rules and punishment practices being clear and fair. The role of school characteristics, however, is not as consistent. For instance, students who attend poorer and more securitized schools have relatively higher perceptions that everyone knows what the school rules are. On the other hand, students who attend larger schools have lower perceptions that everyone knows what the school rules are. Students who attend more racially and ethnically diverse and more securitized schools have relatively lower perceptions that the school rules are fair. Students in larger and more securitized schools have higher perceptions that the school rules are strictly enforced. Students in more racially and ethnically diverse and larger schools have higher perceptions that the school punishment is the same no matter who you are within their school. On the other hand, students attending poorer and more securitized schools have relatively lower perceptions that school punishment is the same no matter who you are.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1462474512452518" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>This study set out to examine the children of immigrants’ perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. There are important results related to the complex relationships between generational status, race, ethnicity, and perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices that need to be highlighted. In sum, there are three important findings related to the research questions that warrant discussion. First and foremost, generational status matters in understanding youth perceptions of school rules and punishment practices. Second, there are racial and ethnic distinctions in the patterns of how the children of immigrants perceive the rules and punishment practices within their school. Finally, this study’s findings could be aligned with a segmented assimilation theoretical framework.</p>
<p>First generation youth, in general, have more positive perceptions that the school rules and punishment practices are clear and fair. As noted, immigrants often bring with them a culture of optimism because the motivation for migrating to the USA is one of hope and opportunity. In many cases, immigrants’ country of origin or homeland is often used as a ‘dual frame of reference’, an alignment of their previous life before migration to their current life in terms of how to evaluate their experiences in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474512452518">Kao and Tienda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco and Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474512452518">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474512452518">Waters, 1999</xref>). Such a frame of reference enables first generation immigrants to feel that their life in the USA is significantly better than the life they left in their native country of origin. The children of immigrants, who do not have access to a dual frame of reference, do not see their current status as one of being ‘better off’; rather, they see themselves as the marginalized group compared to the dominant US culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1462474512452518">Kao and Tienda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1462474512452518">Portes and Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1462474512452518">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1462474512452518">Suárez-Orozco and Suárez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474512452518">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1462474512452518">Waters, 1999</xref>). To that point, there are also distinctive generational patterns among different racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>There is historic and persistent evidence of racial and ethnic inequality, especially for Black/African Americans and Latino Americans, within US schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1462474512452518">Kao and Thompson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474512452518">Kozol, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474512452518">2005</xref>). Racial and ethnic minorities, particularly Black/African Americans and Latino Americans, have diminished perceptions of justice and fairness from authority figures, law enforcement, and institutions of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1462474512452518">Bracy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1462474512452518">Hagan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1462474512452518">Kupchik and Ellis, 2008</xref>). For example, even though first generation Black/African Americans, Latino Americans, Asian Americans, and White Americans have increased perceptions of school punishment being the same no matter who you are, this study’s findings build upon the aforementioned research by suggesting it is specifically third-plus Black/African Americans and Latino Americans who have diminished perceptions of school punishment practices. There is also abundant evidence indicating that Black/African Americans are being disproportionately disciplined within US schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kupchik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474512452518">Morris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474512452518">Rios, 2011</xref>). Recent research also reveals a similar pattern of the overrepresentation of school sanctions for Latino Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kupchik, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1462474512452518">Morris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1462474512452518">Peguero and Shekarkhar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1462474512452518">Rios, 2011</xref>). As discussed, the current wave of immigrants may have not experienced prejudice associated with a particular skin color or racial type in their country of origin; however, upon arrival many immigrants and their children have confronted a reality of racial and ethnic discrimination in the USA. In this regard, it is plausible that as the children of Black/African American and Latino American immigrants assimilate, they are learning about the harsh realities of racial and ethnic educational disparate treatment and inequality, particular with school punishment practices, within the US school system.</p>
<p>This study’s research findings could be supportive of a segmented assimilation perspective. First generation Black/African Americans and Latino Americans have significantly increased perceptions in the fairness of who receives school punishments while third-plus generation Black/African Americans and Latino Americans have diminished perceptions in the fairness of who receives school punishments. Thus, a pattern of downward assimilation appears to be occurring in association with perceptions of the punishment practices particularly for Black/African American and Latino American youth. This study demonstrates that the intersection of race, ethnicity, and generational status has a significant role in youth perceptions of school rules and punishment practices, which can be important information for school administrators, educational researchers, and policymakers.</p>
<p>These findings have important implications for schools. Although there is a history of racial and ethnic disparate treatment by school faculty, counselors, and administrators, this study’s findings indicate that first generation youth indeed have enhanced perceptions of the school rules and punishment practices. Although within the USA, there is currently a heated debate over immigration policy and rhetoric that vilifies immigrants and their children is on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474512452518">Chavez, 2008</xref>), it is imperative for school administrators and faculty to provide a safe learning environment for all students but also to treat their students, including the children of immigrants, fairly and impartially.</p>
<p>As with most studies, there are limitations that often translate into further research questions. To better understand the role of generational status in students’ school experiences, the social, political, and economic environment of immigration should be considered. For example, the threat of a growing immigrant population may have resulted in an increase of social control and punitive justice polices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1462474512452518">Chavez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1462474512452518">Desmond and Kubrin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1462474512452518">Martínez and Valenzuela, 2006</xref>); future research should consider the impact of increased social control and punitive justice policies on students’ perception of school rules and punishment practices. Although there are many studies that reveal the detrimental effects of biased treatment for youth, the outcome of perceiving school as a place of differential treatment for the children of immigrants remains unknown. Although school characteristics were not central to this study’s analysis, the inconsistent relationships between school characteristics and students’ perceptions of school rules and punishment practices suggest that school context matters. For example, the school’s level of diversity is argued to be an important factor in determining how racial and ethnic minority youth are treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1462474512452518">Goldsmith, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1462474512452518">Watkins and Melde (2009)</xref> reveal that generational status is linked to perceptions of school disorder. Previous studies indicate that, in general, first generation youth are more likely to attend schools with higher rates of social and physical disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1462474512452518">Kozol, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1462474512452518">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1462474512452518">Olsen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1462474512452518">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that increased perceptions of physical and social disorder are linked to perceptions of justice and fairness for the children of immigrants. Additionally, student–teacher relations can also play a role in determining how the children of immigrants perceive their schools rules and punishment practices, especially if they are being treated in a negative or discriminatory manner. Recent research suggests that initially student–teacher relations are perceived to be strong for first generation youth but as the children of immigrants assimilate, those strong relationships between students and teachers reported by first generation youth appear to diminish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1462474512452518">Peguero and Bondy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1462474512452518">Watkins and Melde, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This study reflects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1462474512452518">Kupchik’s (2010: 6)</xref> sentiment of the ‘wrong lessons’ in relation to:<disp-quote>
<p>current discipline regime discourages students from thinking critically about power relations and governance. They learn in school that their voice does not matter – that they are powerless to change their environment or even to contest how they are treated when suspected of violating a school rule.</p></disp-quote>It is reasonable to assume that many racial and ethnic minority youth, including the children of immigrants, who have diminished perceptions of the society they live in as democratic, fair, and just is a serious social and educational problem that needs to be addressed. It is also plausible the children of immigrants are assimilating or being taught the ‘wrong lessons’ within US schools. The children of immigrants are the fastest growing segment of the US population, which has clear implications for the US school system, economy, and society. As the USA becomes increasingly immersed in a globally competitive market, addressing an educational system fraught with inequalities becomes imperative. The families with children who come to the USA are also of particular pertinence to the USA’s economic and social sustainability because these children are part of the future of the USA: its parents, its labor force, its voters, and its social, educational, and political leaders.</p>
