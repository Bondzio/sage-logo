<abstract>
<p>Our focus in this article is research interviews that involve two languages. We present an epistemological and methodological analysis of the meaning of qualitative interviewing with an interpreter. The results of the analysis show that such interviewing is not simply exchanging words between two languages, but means understanding, grasping the essential meanings of the spoken words, which requires an interpreter to bridge the different horizons of understanding. Consequently, a research interview including an interpreter means a three-way coconstruction of data. We suggest that interpreters be thoroughly introduced into the research process and research interview technique, that they take part in the preparations for the interview event, and evaluate the translation process with the researcher and informant after the interview.</p>

<p>Despite increased attention to language problems in recent years in Sweden, which like other countries has a substantial population of immigrants, studies examining methodological concerns in cross-cultural interviews are limited. In this article, we draw on insights derived from research with immigrant patients who were not fluent in Swedish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467705">Björk Brämberg, Nyström, &amp; Dahlberg, 2010</xref>). The challenge of language barriers between participant and researcher has been approached in two ways. The first way is interviewing conducted by “insiders,” i.e., a specific ethnic group studied by researchers fluent in the participants’ language. Empirical studies conducted by insiders are important because of the need for direct research on minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312467705">Heikkilä, Sarvimäki, &amp; Ekman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467705">Wallin &amp; Ahlström, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312467705">Yehya &amp; Dutta, 2010</xref>). The second way of addressing language barriers between participant and researcher is by using interpreters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312467705">Hjelm, Bard, Nyberg, &amp; Apelqvist, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312467705">2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312467705">Ny, Plantin, Karlsson, &amp; Dykes, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the loss of access to non-Swedish-speaking populations in research, there are concerns regarding the quality and validity of interviews using two or more languages. Researchers depend on interpreters’ intellectual skills and professional qualifications. Potential threats to validity arise in the process of the typical questioning and responding that takes place between researchers, interpreters, and informants during an interview. During this process, researchers must trust that their interpreters have summarized or modified the informants’ responses accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467705">Esposito, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467705">Kapborg &amp; Berterö, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A competent interpreter for qualitative interviewing is described as a person who is experienced in verbal translation and who shares a cultural background with the person being interviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467705">Pitchforth &amp; van Teijlingen, 2005</xref>). Competence as an interpreter also involves having personal knowledge about the informant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312467705">Gannagé, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312467705">Miller, Worthingson, Musurovic, Tipping, &amp; Goldman, 2002</xref>); however, personal knowledge between interpreter and informant can become a confidentiality issue. Matching the interpreter and informant with respect to ethnicity, gender, age, and other characteristics is of vital importance. Matching should be guided by the informant’s wishes and by the aim of the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312467705">Baker, Hussain, &amp; Saunders, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467705">Murray &amp; Wynne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312467705">Somerville, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Various recommendations about translation style exist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312467705">Essén et al. (2000)</xref> wrote that translation should be as verbatim as possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467705">Murray and Wynne (2001)</xref> stated that it is impossible to provide an exact, word-by-word translation. Other things to consider include the extent of an interpreter’s involvement in the research process, impact on findings, and the interpreter’s competence and the style of interpreting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467705">Pitchforth &amp; van Teijlingen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467705">Wallin &amp; Ahlström, 2006</xref>). Such considerations increase a study’s validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467705">Esposito, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467705">Kapborg &amp; Berterö, 2002</xref>). Despite an agreement on translation style, an interpreter will sometimes have to quickly decide what to translate and in what way—a complex process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312467705">Ingvarsdotter, Johnsdotter, and Östman (2010)</xref> have shown descriptions of a research process including an interpreter, primarily concentrating on rigorous techniques to eliminate bias. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467705">Squires (2009)</xref> was critical of the practice of keeping interpreters invisible in the research process, and highlighted the importance of describing interpreters’ credentials, as well as pilot-testing interview questions in the informant’s language. The choice of a word might work fine in the translation moment, but be problematic in analysis. The translation process is a complex phenomenon in need of illumination. In this article we present an epistemological and methodological analysis and description of qualitative interviewing conducted with an interpreter, discuss the meaning of interpretation, and identify components that increase the trustworthiness of such research.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312467705">
<title>The Empirical Study</title>
<p>The focus is a phenomenological study of immigrant patients’ experiences of participating in their care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312467705">Björk Brämberg et al., 2010</xref>). With a phenomenological lifeworld approach, we wanted to ensure a thorough understanding of the immigrants’ experiences of patient participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg, Dahlberg, &amp; Nyström, 2008</xref>). Lifeworld-based research focuses on the world as it is experienced, prior to the formulation of any hypothesis to explain it. In this study, data were gathered through open-ended interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312467705">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>). The analysis was performed using the descriptions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al. (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>The participants in the study received home care in a city in Sweden. Inclusion criteria included immigrant men and women in home care, aged 18 years or older. Exclusion criteria were forensic psychiatric care and severe mental illness. None of the men agreed to participate in the study but 8 women aged 54 to 89 years wanted to participate and agreed to be interviewed. All of the women had migrated during the 1980s and ‘90s from a variety of countries in Eastern Europe and the Middle East; 2 had been employed in Sweden. Only 1 woman spoke Swedish, although with some difficulty. In the other cases, the interviewing required an interpreter. Hence, five authorized interpreters in health and medical care, three women and two men, interpreted seven interviews. In Sweden, authorization as an interpreter is given by the Legal, Financial, and Administrative Services Agency. An authorized interpreter is entitled, on passing a special examination, to obtain a certificate of specialist competence as an interpreter within a given specialist field—health and medical care services or law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312467705">Kammarkollegiet, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The interviews were conducted in the informants’ homes by the first author, Elisabeth Björk Brämberg. She was seated facing the informant and the interpreter was seated to one side. The interviews were conducted in the form of a dialogue, and the informants were encouraged to talk freely about their experiences of the phenomenon. The first directive posed to each participant was to describe how she generally experienced the visits of the home care team. The informants were asked to recall and reflect on their experiences, and Björk Brämberg particularly noted replies that included experiences of participation in their care. The initial interview directive was supplemented with probes such as, “Can you explain it more?” or, “What did you think about that?” when the informant talked about issues that could be related to patient participation. The interviews were audiotaped, lasted 30 to 60 minutes, and were transcribed verbatim. Björk Brämberg discussed the proceedings with the interpreter before and after conducting the interviews, but the interpreters were not asked to comment on the transcribed interviews.</p>
<p>The research design was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg. Before the interview, the interpreter translated for the participants the written information about the study. The translation was followed by provision of information about their voluntary participation, that it was possible to withdraw at any time, that confidentiality would be protected, and that the interviews would be used as data in a study. After this procedure, written informed consent was obtained from all informants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049732312467705">
<title>The Process of Understanding</title>
<p>In lifeworld interviews, as well in all lifeworld research, the principle of openness is fundamental. To bring about new understanding of the phenomenon of focus, the researcher’s attitude during the research process should reflect openness to the phenomenon and to the participants who reveal their lived experiences of the phenomenon. Such openness demands that the researcher is immediately present in the situation to respond flexibly and to use insight when composing follow-up questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of an interpreter, however, is a challenge to the desired openness and immediacy. Although the presence of the interpreter provides support for the interview, immediate contact between the interviewer and informant is frequently interrupted. Therefore, openness as well as immediacy is challenged.</p>
<p>The interpreter’s task is to translate words or sentences from one language to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467705">Squires, 2009</xref>). For an interview, translating involves questions from the researcher to the informant and in turn an accurate and explicit account of the informants’ responses. But the process of translation is more complex than simply finding the right word and expressing it. An interpreter has to grasp the meaning of the questions asked by the researcher, and then echo the informant’s response in accordance with the researcher’s language and understanding. Hence, the interpretation process involves the problem of understanding itself.</p>
<p>“Understanding begins . . . when something addresses us. This is the first condition of hermeneutics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467705">Gadamer, 1995/1960</xref>, p. 299). Gadamer emphasized scientific openness and the ability of researchers to be aware of their own and the phenomenon’s worldliness. Preunderstanding has an essential role in understanding something in a new way. Neither understanding nor preunderstanding is a static state of mind, but is transformed as an individual experiences different situations, which happens along the individual’s life trajectory. All preunderstanding, or prejudice, as Gadamer put it, is affected by the historical time and by living conditions such as culture, social class, and geographical location. Gadamer stated that the “world horizon is a pre-supposition of all science as well, and is, therefore, more fundamental” (p. 247).</p>
<p>Here, we have the outer horizons of all understanding, including understanding of language and words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467705">Gadamer, 1995/1960</xref>). Sharing a common language implies agreement on words, nuances, and linguistics for dialogue, but cannot be depended on to identify a single and correct interpretation. When interpreters translate a dialogue between different languages, they have to understand the context of the questions and make a validity claim of the words in their own culture. Interpreters can be seen as participating in two cultures and at the same time being in-between, bridging the horizons of understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312467705">Lampert, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As human beings, we are dependent on language. Language is not something that is used neutrally. Words refer to everyone’s lifeworld and are used to make something visible, to explain it. One word or expression might have the same meaning for persons fluent in the same language, but could also have different meanings because nuances refer to different experiences. The word <italic>spring</italic> might be very differently interpreted by two persons, one of whom suffers from seasonal allergies and one of whom does not. For those not sharing the same language, words can be completely incomprehensible. This is the inner horizon of preunderstanding.</p>
<p>Understanding how a person speaks of an experience is about interpretation and an immediate grasp of meaning, which Merleau-Ponty explained as intentionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467705">1995/1945</xref>). When we see, hear, or in any way experience something, it is experienced as something which has meaning for us. Meaning comes, so to speak, in the same package as perception. That all understanding has these horizons is an epistemological fact. Mercifully, prejudices can be called into question and the horizons of understanding can be broadened, which happens when we experience something new or understand something in a new way. This assumes, of course, a willingness to broaden and meet the horizon of understanding of the other. Such willingness must refer to all forms of experiences, and includes thoughts as well as feelings, to guide understanding. Researchers learn and train their ability to keep checks on and bridle their processes of understanding, and to critically examine their preunderstandings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>). Such awareness cannot be expected from the untrained interpreter.</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732312467705">
<title>Revisiting the Empirical Study Including Interpreters</title>
<p>With the above-described epistemological framework, we wanted to revisit the empirical study of patient participation that had included interpreters. Our approach was still phenomenological but in this new analysis we took a different perspective, not of the first data, but of the process of research that had included interpreters. In dialogue, we recalled the experiences of the research events, trying to deepen the insights of the evolving understanding by way of phenomenological epistemology. In particular, we tried to relate to the phenomenological research principles of openness and “bridling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>From a phenomenological perspective, the process of translation means more than finding synonyms in two different languages. The language and the way the language is used shapes one’s view of the world. Researchers in a situation in which an interpreter is needed face the horizons of understanding of three involved persons: the informant, the interpreter, and oneself. In general, it is a delicate situation to support a rigorous process of understanding, avoiding misleading preunderstandings and encouraging the informant to find creative ways to describe something of importance. Hence, the interpreter’s task is to bridge the gap between different horizons of understanding. The interpreter acts like a bridge that enables the horizons of understanding to expand and even overlap each other. Such an epistemological dilemma has to be illuminated and cultivated for the interview to proceed in a positive way. To fulfill the methodological intentions of this article, we present the common structure of interview research, i.e., the preparation for, conduct of, and analysis of interviews, drawing on experiences from our empirical study together with the epistemological notions described above.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732312467705">
<title>Preparations Before the Interviews</title>
<p>Prior to commencing a research project, we suggest communicating with the translation agency to clarify the translation skills that are desired, and to request allocation of a contact person to receive information about the study’s design and mediate communication between the researcher and interpreters. In this way, researchers are assured that the contact person has specific knowledge about the interpreters at the agency. In our research, the agency person was directed to contact authorized interpreters who were competent in health and medical care situations. We also requested that the interpreters have experience translating research interviews.</p>
<p>Because of the language barriers, the first author contacted informants’ relatives to discover the informants’ preferences for interpreters. The relatives were informed about the study and asked if their relative would be interested in participating. The relatives gave information about which language and dialect the interpreter would be required to translate. They were also asked whether the informant would prefer a woman or a man as an interpreter; 2 of the informants preferred a woman.</p>
<p>It was a challenge to find interpreters who had specific knowledge about qualitative research interviews. None of the interpreters had experience with translating such conversations, but they were willing to learn more about phenomenological interviewing. Therefore, each interpreter was contacted individually by the first author and informed about qualitative interviews in general and more specifically about lifeworld-based research and open-ended interviews. The first author and interpreters discussed the linguistic nuances and synonyms. The interpreters’ knowledge was of vital importance in discovering relevant nuances and synonyms that would convey what it means to be a patient who participates in his or her own care.</p>
<p>As an essential aspect of the reliability of the interviews, we recommend that the researcher contact interpreters individually to introduce each into the study’s aim, design, and form of interviews. In particular, it is important to make sure that an interpreter understands phenomenological interviewing, which is more like an everyday dialogue than a question–answer affair. In particular, we recommend that the researcher and interpreter discuss the importance of openness and support for the informant’s reflections about the phenomenon of focus. For example, when follow-up questions are asked, interpreters are not free to interrupt, but are expected to listen to what they might consider repetitious.</p>
<p>The style of interpretation should be thoroughly discussed. Verbatim translation is preferable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312467705">Essén et al., 2000</xref>), despite the difficulty encountered in exact word-by-word translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312467705">Murray &amp; Wynne, 2001</xref>). If the informant talks at length about an important topic, the interpreter might ask the informant to wait while he or she translates what has been said. Another point of discussion is the conceptualization of the phenomenon. Swedish words might have different meanings in other languages; there might be linguistic nuances of importance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312467705">
<title>Conducting the Interviews</title>
<p>It is always important to pay attention to the context of the interview. When researcher and interpreter meet with the informant in her or his home, it is important to allow enough time for some conversation and becoming acquainted with each other. When seated, it is preferable that the interpreter sits to one side, allowing interviewer and informant to face each other. The interview should be audiotaped.</p>
<p>In our study, researcher and interpreter met outside the informant’s home to review the research questions. Some of the interpreters had read literature on qualitative interviewing and had questions concerning follow-up questions. Upon entering an informant’s home, the researcher and interpreter introduced themselves. The researcher then described the study’s aim and the open-ended interview technique to be used. The interpreter translated the written information about the study and written informed consent was obtained from the informant. The researcher and interpreter sat where the informant indicated, but at the same time, to increase immediacy, orchestrated a face-to-face position with the informant, keeping the interpreter to one side.</p>
<p>Once the opening phase of an interview is accomplished and a directive is given, the interviewer’s role is to follow the lead of the informant, to support and encourage the informant’s descriptions, narratives, and responses—whatever is divulged—as long as the research phenomenon remains the focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>). In this type of interviewing it is difficult to precisely plan the course of the interview. It is also difficult to plan an interview because “stories being narrated are constructed in the moments of the interview to the extent that neither the interviewers nor the informants can predict the details of what is going to be discussed in advance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312467705">Nunkoosing, 2005</xref>, p. 703).</p>
<p>Openness and immediacy are supported by the interviewer’s active listening and by responding with sensitive follow-up questions and prompts. Using an interpreter can diminish immediacy. In our study it became obvious how difficult it was to ask follow-up questions at the right time because the interpreter’s translation slowed the process. By the time a question could be asked, the informant had usually moved on to other thoughts. Hence, the emphasis on follow-up questions and prompts to capture the lived experience is significantly more important than in general interviewing. Sometimes proposing various synonyms is an effective tactic. Follow-up questions can also be used to lead the informant back to something previously mentioned. Occasionally the interviewer must be blunt in asking questions of the interpreter so as not to miss all the nuances of meaning. We recommend that the interpreting process be as simultaneous as possible and that the interpreter translates in the first-person voice. This means a word-for-word translation of the researcher’s request, such as, “I would like to understand . . .,” as well as the informants’ statements in the same way, such as, “Well, I . . . .” This strengthens the interpreter’s role as conduit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312467705">Squires, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>During one of our interviews, the interpreter questioned the need for follow-up questions; the interpreter argued that the question had already been asked. To resolve the misunderstanding the researcher and the interpreter had a short conversation in Swedish. Even if interpreters strive for verbatim translation during the interviews, however, it is not always possible to achieve. When such circumstances occurred in our study, the interpreters asked the informant to take a short break, during which the interpreter translated, and then directed the informant to resume.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312467705">
<title>After the Interviews</title>
<p>After the research interview, the focus changes and both the informant and the interpreter are asked to reflect on the interview and translation process, examining nuances of meanings between the two languages or sequences of the interview during which problems had been noted. The researcher should keep in mind that it is a potential conflict of interest to ask the informant about problems in the translation process, because an accurate translation is the interpreter’s responsibility. Asking an informant to comment on the translation puts the informant in the uncomfortable position of wondering if it is safe to criticize the interpreter. Similarly, the interpreter might not want to translate a critique from the informant to the researcher.</p>
<p>Our suggestion is to keep the dialogue open, but to avoid questions about the translation process that might be understood as evaluating the interpreter’s competence. If the interpreter does not fulfill the assignment, for example leaves dialogue with the informant untranslated, the researcher can talk to the interpreter in private or contact the interpreter’s agency. Audiotaping the interviews reduces the chances of omissions in translation. When the researcher has questions regarding the translation’s quality, we recommend using another interpreter to evaluate and assess the quality of the translation.</p>
<p>Our informants were pleased with the interviews and the opportunity to relate their experiences. Translation and translation style were discussed with the interpreters. The challenge of verbatim translation was discussed, with the researcher taking notes as the interpreter described the resolution of difficulties. Subsequently, these notes were used when discussing linguistic hindrances and translation style with the other interpreters. Some of the interpreters suggested that the concept of <italic>patient participation</italic> might have been new to the informants, given that the informants were elderly women who had immigrated from countries with a strict hierarchical order in health care that limited opportunities to participate in their own care. This was discussed in the study. We found that keeping notes about the interview was very useful. Reflections often led to suggestions for improving interview questions or identifying synonyms to use in the interview dialogue. Moreover, such notes were a valuable resource when discussing the study’s strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<title>Discussion and Comprehensive Understanding</title>
<p>In summary, in this article we have described the problem of understanding in research that involves an interpreter for two languages and the challenge of assuring the quality of such research. The epistemological notions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312467705">Gadamer (1995/1960)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312467705">Merleau-Ponty (1995/1945)</xref> illuminate the phenomenon of interpreting. To translate from one language to another in a research interview requires grasping the meaning of informants’ intentions and mediating the meaning with a different language. The interpreter’s task is to bridge the different horizons of understanding. We argue that the impact of the interpreter and the researcher can be minimized, but not eliminated.</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we recommend that research interviews conducted through an interpreter focus on grasping the essential meanings of the spoken words. This means that in addition to as nearly verbatim translation as possible, the interpreter must bridge the different horizons of understanding to mediate the meaning for a different language. Rarely is the interpretation style a precise word-for-word translation; rather, it is about translating meaning. Although it is clear that meaning must have priority over word-for-word translation, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467705">Wallin and Ahlström (2006)</xref> insisted, the interpretation has to be as accurate and verbatim as possible, despite the difficulties in such a task.</p>
<p>We concur with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312467705">Esposito’s (2001)</xref> notion that exact, word-by-word translation is a result of the dominance of logical positivism. The interpreter is seen as a culturally equivalent research instrument, with the focus on minimizing translation errors. Little or no attention is paid to the cultural context of the concepts inherent in the interview. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312467705">Im, Page, Lin, Tsai, and Cheng (2004)</xref> suggested that researchers should consider whether the research questions are relevant to the specific cultural group. In our empirical study on patient participation, we faced such problems in relation to the issue of translation. In Sweden, as well as in the rest of the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and the United States, health care legislation emphasizes the importance of patient participation when care is planned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312467705">Eldh, Ekman, &amp; Ehnfors, 2006</xref>). This means that professional care providers are responsible for providing information that enables patients to form an opinion about advice and to participate in decisions.</p>
<p>For some of the informants in our empirical study, the concept of patient participation was not well known. To accommodate these circumstances, synonyms were discussed with the interpreters and informants, and then used in the interviews. For persons born in countries with no tradition of patient participation, it might be difficult for informants to relate to this phenomenon. We did not want to exclude persons from taking part in research simply because they belonged to a specific cultural group. Unexamined assumptions about the relevance of cultural background presuppose that persons are products of specific culture, unable to reflect on culture or relate to experiences from other relevant contexts. Phenomenological interviewing has proven this to be untrue; hence, regardless of cultural background, interviews must led by the informant’s lifeworld.</p>
<p>Even in interviews with only the researcher and informant, the question of where meaning originates has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312467705">Dahlberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312467705">Kvale, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312467705">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312467705">Kvale &amp; Brinkmann, 2009</xref>). In a research interview without an interpreter, data are constructed from the informant’s recollections of a phenomenon, directly and indirectly guided by the questions and prompts of the researcher. Preferably there is an open dialogue between the researcher and the informant in which phenomenon-sensitive follow-up questions are asked. From this perspective, the research interview can be seen as a two-way coconstruction of data. Without dialogue there are no data. Involving interpreters in interviewing can be aggravating for researchers. The interview now includes three persons’ different experiences and horizons of understanding; consequently, a research interview including an interpreter means a three-way coconstruction of data.</p>
<p>Interpreters’ involvement is not solely a question of the correctness of translation or reliability as an instrument. The interpreter’s role and involvement in research interviews and research processes is usually referred to as a problem of validity and trustworthiness. Consequently, ensuring interpreters’ competence is of vital importance to strengthen a study’s validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312467705">Kapborg &amp; Berterö, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312467705">Pitchforth &amp; van Teijlingen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312467705">Wallin &amp; Ahlström, 2006</xref>). One way to evaluate the translation, and in a wider sense the validity and reliability, is to limit the number of interpreters to just one or two (Wallin &amp; Ahlström). We argue that it is difficult to limit the numbers of interpreters. One language might have different dialects; consequently more than one interpreter is needed.</p>
<p>As stated by Polkinghorne, the traditional understandings of validity and reliability “imply a system of concepts that is stable, context-free, and clearly delineated from one another, yet human existence points toward a conceptual system that changes, is context-dependent, and is organized around prototypical instances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312467705">1986</xref>, p. 129). We argue that interpreters’ involvement belongs to the extended context of the research situation, while acknowledging that such inclusion affects the study’s scientific quality. The potential for translation errors is present in all phases of the research, from planning to publication. To strengthen the value of the research outcome, we suggest that researchers introduce interpreters to the research world, and specifically to interviewing, by conducting with them a few pilot cross-cultural interviews. When reporting findings, scientific claims such as theoretical standpoints and contextual factors in language issues should be described. Moreover, the process of data collection and the way that interpreters participated in the research interviews ought to be thoroughly discussed.</p>
<p>Finally, the above described challenges are not the only ones related to language. The epistemological notions of research involving an interpreter do not differ radically from the situation that we non-English-fluent researchers face each time we publish our work in international journals. Editors and reviewers of scientific journals might also reflect on the meaning of interpretation and its influences on scientific quality.</p>
