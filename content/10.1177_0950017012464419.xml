<p>Corrections of misunderstandings make dull reading. However, the misunderstandings come so thick and fast in these reviews that it is impossible to respond to all three in the space given to one. Take just the first 400 words of the second review (by Cornelius). We do not make a ‘case for a more welfarist approach towards poverty reduction’. We do not use ‘the median income gap’. We do not argue that the ‘simultaneous intensification of individualism leads to whole societies becoming compromised in terms of the quality of community social and cultural capital that <italic>both</italic> the rich and the impoverished have at their disposal’. And we are simply bemused by the assertion that ‘one of the most significant criticisms’ of the book is the appreciation shown by the many audiences we were invited to speak to after its publication.</p>
<p><italic>The Spirit Level</italic> puts together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle collected from over 30 years of research by epidemiologists round the world working to discover the causes of the five- to 15-year social class differences in life expectancy which disfigure modern societies.</p>
<p>Note first that these health differences are not simply between the poor and the rest of society. They are gradients across whole societies: even those in ‘executive’ jobs with good education and incomes are less healthy than those immediately above them. This is about inequality, not poverty. Next is the now very well established finding of the importance of psychosocial health risk factors which work through the biological effects of chronic stress and are sometimes likened to more rapid ageing. Crucial here is the evidence from both observational and experimental studies, among humans and animals, that the most pervasive sources of chronic stress among the populations of developed countries hinge on the quality of social relationships: social status, social connectedness and the social environment in early childhood. For example, a meta-analysis of some 150 studies showed that friendship was slightly more important to survival even than smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017012464419">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>An understanding of the effects of psychosocial factors such as these comes not only from large follow-up studies of human populations, but also from studies of non-human primates where social status can be experimentally manipulated, as well as from social psychology experiments. In addition, research on the connections between social circumstances, subjectivity and health is often underpinned by measures of various hormones – such as cortisol, oxytocin, serotonin – and by aspects of cardiovascular function. These come close to serving as objective measures of subjectivity.</p>
<p>Health is one of very many outcomes which are strongly related to social status. Both mental and physical ill health have steep social gradients with rates increasing at each step down the social ladder. The same is true of violence, depression, drug abuse, poor educational performance, teenage birth rates, obesity, imprisonment, low levels of child wellbeing and others. It is of course implausible that stress should have a major impact on death rates but be otherwise invisible. What we show in <italic>The Spirit Level</italic> is that almost all the problems with social gradients are more common in more unequal societies. Social stressors like the decline in cohesion and trust and the rise in violence do indeed have many behavioural repercussions.</p>
<p>People sometimes have difficulty with the idea that greater inequality contributes to so many different problems. But the argument, in a nutshell, is simply that problems which are related to social status get worse when social status differentials get bigger. Bigger income differences lead to bigger social distances: snobbishness, downward prejudice, feelings of superiority and inferiority, status competition, insecurity and the consumerism they drive, all increase. The causal mechanisms involve a strengthening or intensification of all the processes by which social class imprints itself on us from early childhood onwards. In a sense our work provides a theory of problems with social gradients: they are responses to social status differentiation itself. It is therefore disingenuous for politicians to aspire to create a classless society without reducing the income differences on which the cultural markers of status and class depend.</p>
<p>Problems with social gradients are anything from twice to 10 times as common in more unequal societies. As various separate analyses show, these differences are so large because inequality affects the whole social fabric. It affects the poor the most, but even the top 5 per cent to 10 per cent (by education or income) do a little better in more equal societies.</p>
<p>Alternative explanations of these patterns face serious difficulties. Why do some societies perform systematically worse on such a wide range of apparently separate problems while others do so much better? Suggestions like ethnic mix, immigration, national culture, population size, public services and reverse causality have all been examined and found wanting.</p>
<p>Some of these relationships have been shown very many times in different settings. There are about 200 studies looking at health in relation to income inequality and about 50 looking at violence in relation to inequality. Multilevel and meta-analytic studies confirm these relationships. So too do time series studies. Even the more unequal provinces of China have worse health. Alan Krueger, the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors, recently produced a graph exactly confirming the tendency we had shown (using independent data) for societies with bigger income differences to have lower social mobility. So many new studies have confirmed our analysis of the effects of inequality that Paul Krugman, the economics Nobel laureate, remarked in his <italic>New York Times</italic> column that ‘Wilkinson-type views about the corrosive effects of inequality are going seriously mainstream’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0950017012464419">Krugman, 2012</xref>).</p>
