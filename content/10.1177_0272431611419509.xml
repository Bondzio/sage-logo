<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to analyze changes in communication with parents about matters of concern to 11- and 13-year olds. Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys conducted in Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland in 1993/94, 1997/98, 2001/02, and 2005/06 were analyzed by means of cluster analysis and analysis of variance. The results show that in most countries, the percentages of adolescents reporting difficulties in communication with parents increased from 1993/94 to 1997/98, and decreased afterwards. Analyses divided the countries into three groups with similar parent-child communication changes. These groups were neither related to the East-West division, nor to family structure differences. The confirmed cultural convergence between countries implies that family policy allowing parents of teenagers to devote more time to them should get the same priority in Eastern as in Western European countries.</p>

<p>Communication in the family is a dynamic factor, facilitating changes in the level of how families function in the fields of cohesion and flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0272431611419509">Olson &amp; Gorall, 2003</xref>). Different authors have defined communication as a spontaneous and symbolic process in which the members of the family share information through words, gestures, and expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272431611419509">Buck, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0272431611419509">Galvin &amp; Brommel, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0272431611419509">Olson, Gorall, &amp; Tiesel, 2004</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272431611419509">Blechman (1990)</xref>, one of the objectives of the communication act is to exchange information, influence others’ behaviors, and solve problems. This objective coincides with what is called positive communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0272431611419509">Olson, Russell, &amp; Sprenkle, 1983</xref>), defined as the exchange of clear and congruent messages that contain empathy, give support, and show an effective ability of problem resolution.</p>
<p>Both the messages and the affective factor define positive communication as a reciprocity process through which members of the family build-up relationships of closeness and intimacy and feel cared, supported, and valued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272431611419509">Blechman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0272431611419509">Reis &amp; Shaver, 1988</xref>). Using positive communication skills enables families to meet developmental or situational demands. It enables its individual members to share their own views, likes, desires, and feelings. The proper course of communication is the condition for achieving balance between the aspirations of children to separate from the family and the simultaneous desire to maintain emotional ties with individual persons. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0272431611419509">Satir (1988)</xref> points out, communication is the most powerful factor determining the type of relations with other people and the development of the self.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the ease of parent-child communication and satisfaction with relationships depend on many factors. Among these, the child’s age, gender (of child and parent), and economic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611419509">Currie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431611419509">Pedersen, Granado-Alcon, Rodriguez, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0272431611419509">Setterboulte, 2000</xref>). Adolescents’ evaluation of ease of talking with parents varies from country to country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611419509">Currie et al., 2008</xref>) and across years of survey, but there are no research examining these differences. It seems interesting to analyze the patterns of changes in contemporary teenagers’ families, and whether these changes are similar in different countries.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272431611419509">
<title>Developmental Changes in Parent-Child Communication</title>
<p>Communication between children and parents changes as the child develops. Parent-child relations evolve from an asymmetrical relationship (which is characteristic of childhood) to a more symmetric adolescent/parent relationship, where the family rules, the parents’ attitude toward adolescents, the patterns of discussion, and the transfer of feelings all undergo change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272431611419509">Anderson &amp; Sabatelli, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272431611419509">Collins, 1995</xref>). In the period of adolescence, emotional distance and the presence of conflict increase, and ease of communication with parents falls. Adolescence is often described as the most difficult and conflicted period of life, both for children and for their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272431611419509">Bee, 1998</xref>). Patterns which account for developmental changes in the adolescent youths (such as the development of logical thinking, criticism), in particular, discussion and negotiation, become the most effective forms of communication. Optimum methods of communication between parents and adolescents should provide young people with feelings of acceptance and mental support, but only to the extent that this does not interfere with their need for autonomy.</p>

<title>Gender Differences in Parent-Adolescent Communication</title>
<p>Perception of parent-adolescent communication varies by gender of parent and by gender of child. Adolescents report talking more with their mothers then with their fathers and they perceive mothers as more understanding and accepting then fathers (especially girls; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272431611419509">LePoire, 2006</xref>). In general, female adolescents exhibit greater emotional self-disclosure to parents and friends than male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0272431611419509">Stattin &amp; Kerr, 2000</xref>), but many researches show that boys are more disclosed to fathers than girls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272431611419509">Buhrmester &amp; Prager, 1995</xref>). Gender differences were found also in the directness of communication: boys communicate disagreements and suggestions more directly to their fathers, whereas girls utilize more indirect suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0272431611419509">Papini, Farmer, Clark, &amp; Micka, 1990</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of Parent-Adolescent Communication in Adolescent Health</title>
<p>Research showed that a good quality of communication with parents facilitates the functioning of the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0272431611419509">Schrodt, 2005</xref>), and constitutes one predictor of adolescents’ high self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272431611419509">Kernis, Brown, &amp; Brody, 2000</xref>), ego development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0272431611419509">von der Lippe &amp; Møller, 2000</xref>), low delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272431611419509">Bogard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272431611419509">Clark &amp; Shields, 1997</xref>), better conflict resolution skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272431611419509">Koerner &amp; Fitzpatrick, 1997</xref>), and coping with adverse situations (resilience; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272431611419509">Baxter &amp; Clark, 1996</xref>). For adolescents, finding it easy to talk with their mother or father about things that bother them acts as a protective factor for mental well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272431611419509">Levin &amp; Currie, 2010</xref>). Poor communication between children and parents is associated with risky behaviors, such as the abuse of psychoactive substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0272431611419509">Dunn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272431611419509">Granado, Pedersen, &amp; Carrasco, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0272431611419509">Velleman, Templeton, &amp; Copello, 2005</xref>). Ease of communication, and resultant feelings of satisfaction in the young person, are essential from the point of view of the latter’s health and healthy behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272431611419509">Guilamo-Ramos, Jaccard, Turrisi, &amp; Johansson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0272431611419509">Pedersen, Granado-Alcon, &amp; Rodriguez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0272431611419509">Setterboulte, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Ease of communication with parents is considered to be an indicator of both social support from the parents and of the family’s connectedness, with the parents remaining an important source of support through the adolescent period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272431611419509">Laursen, 1995</xref>). Adolescents who report easy communication with their mothers are more likely to report excellent or high-rated health, and are less likely to be current smokers, frequent alcohol drinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0272431611419509">Zambon, Lemma, Borraccino, Dalmasso, &amp; Cavallo, 2006</xref>) or sexually active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272431611419509">Lenciauskiene &amp; Zaborskis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0272431611419509">Resnick et al., 1997</xref>). Easy communication with parents may be a result of good relationships and emotional bonds built up by parents which prevent the unhealthy behaviors they themselves would disapprove of. Easy communication with parents can also facilitate self-disclosure, which is the best predictor of “monitoring” (parents’ knowledge of the child’s whereabouts, activities, and associations), preventing children from risky behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0272431611419509">Stattin &amp; Kerr, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-0272431611419509">
<title>Contextual Predictors of Parent-Child Communication</title>
<p>Besides developmental changes, contextual factors can also affect the parent-child communication and relationship. According to Bronfenbrenner’s ecological system model (1986), family life and the development of children are embedded in social, cultural, economic, and historical contexts which affect how parents relate to and behave with their children. Socioeconomic status, including social, economic, and work status, often defined by indicators of education, income, and/or occupation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272431611419509">Adler et al., 1994</xref>), can in many way affect parent-child interactions by determining values and attitudes toward parenting, parenting styles, methods of discipline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0272431611419509">Evans, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0272431611419509">McLoyd, 1998</xref>), and the involvement or support of the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272431611419509">Bradley &amp; Corwyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272431611419509">Evans, Boxhill, &amp; Pinkava, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0272431611419509">Tracy, Zimmerman, Galea, McCauley, &amp; Stoep, 2008</xref>). Cross-cultural analyses of family values and relationships show differences in values promoted by families in different countries, for example in Austria, the most important values are tolerance, cooperation, responsibility, and independence, but in Finland—equality between family members, communication, maintenance of affective relationships, and cordiality between parents and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272431611419509">Adams &amp; Trost, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last 30 years, most of the cross-cultural analyses were performed on the basis of differences in individualism. Usually, researchers conceptualize individualism as the opposite of collectivism (relative emphasis placed on the self versus the group or society), and contrast European American and East Asian cultural frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272431611419509">Hofstede, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431611419509">Oyserman, Coon, &amp; Kemmelmeier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0272431611419509">Rose, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0272431611419509">Shearman &amp; Dumlao, 2008</xref>). Various studies have documented cross-cultural differences in communication style based on individualism-collectivism dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431611419509">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0272431611419509">Shearman &amp; Dumlao, 2008</xref>). Individualistic cultures are linked to direct whereas collectivistic cultures are linked to indirect communication style. Individualism correlates positively with a focus on clear, goal-oriented communication, whereas collectivism correlates positively with concern about a target’s feelings and desires both to avoid negative evaluation and to minimize imposition on the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0272431611419509">Shearman &amp; Dumlao, 2008</xref>). In Europe, Western countries are considered as more individualistic and Eastern as more collectivistic societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431611419509">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Comparisons of European countries’ macroeconomic indicators (such as gross domestic product—GDP) show great differences between the richer Western countries and the poorer Eastern, post-Communist countries, but the changes over time are similar—according to The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0272431611419509">World Bank (2011)</xref> data, GDP per person has risen consistently over the last few years (particularly since 2000) in all the countries analyzed in this article. Analyses of global demographic and social trends, identifying and describing new and traditional social risks affecting children and their families, show that we can observe high rates of divorce, single mothers, children born outside wedlock, and in families with underemployment in all European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272431611419509">Gabel &amp; Kamerman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611419509">Georgas, 2006</xref>). Although there is a discrepancy between the levels of divorce for each country, there is nevertheless a general upward trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0272431611419509">Ziehl, 2003</xref>). A representative survey carried out in six European countries (funded by the European Commission in the Sixth Framework Programme) in 2007 shows that other widespread tendencies in Europe are rises in female employment and job-related spatial mobility, whether it be “residential” (changing one’s residence mainly for job-related reasons) or “recurring” (moving repeatedly between two or more places such as home and the workplace; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0272431611419509">Schneider &amp; Meil, 2008</xref>). People who are mobile for job-related reasons may have difficulties maintaining good family relations or organizing family work fairly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272431611419509">Collet &amp; Bonnet, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A possible explanation for family change is the convergence of family structures and family functioning in Eastern societies with those in Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272431611419509">Georgas, 2006</xref>). More and more researchers are considering the progressive process of globalization, customarily defined as an unparalleled increase in the flow of capital, goods, services, and information. Less mentioned are the increased political, legal, and cultural exchanges which are assumed to bring about convergence in these spheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611419509">Esmer, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed trends of changes in family life in Europe can be dangerous for family relationships and good parent-child communication. But, as research shows, most adolescents in all the countries considered state that conversations with parents about troubling matters are easy or very easy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431611419509">Pedersen, Granado-Alcon, Rodriguez, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>). The percentages of young people expressing such opinions are not identical in individual countries, or in subsequent waves of data collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611419509">Currie et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611419509">2008</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no research has examined the hypothesis of culture convergence in ease of parent-child communication and the cross-country similarity of changes in these patterns over time.</p>
<p>Investigating the variation of parent-child communication across different countries and at different times could thus contribute to a deeper understanding of this topic. Emphasis on early adolescence (11-13 years of age) can show changes in the period of transition from late childhood to adolescence, when difficulties in parent-child communication often begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0272431611419509">Santrock, 2007</xref>). Analyses of trends in parent/child communication allow us to answer the question of which direction the changes are heading in—whether they are optimistic, despite unfavorable social changes, and whether we can speak of positive trends in family relations—or rather of negative changes, demanding systematic solutions. Such a family policy should support parents, enabling them more active participation in a family life. It could include both parents’ education and better regulations of work hours and family leave policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272431611419509">Gornick &amp; Meyers, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Trend analyses also allow us to observe whether a convergence of change in parent-child communication exists between individual countries, and if so, whether these similarities occur between countries with similar histories (in other words, whether we can speak of a traditional division between Eastern and Western European countries), of a similar culture (individualistic or collectivistic), language, or also of a similar experience of economic changes. Analyses of these trends and their convergence between countries help to answer the question of determinants of family communication.</p>

<title>Research Questions and Hypothesis</title>
<p>The main aim of this article is to investigate the changes in communication between parents and 11 and 13 years old children across 16 European countries during 12 years (1993/94-2005/06).</p>
<p>The first major question in this study concerns changes that occurred in parent-child communication in European countries during the analyzed 12-year period. Based on data on dysfunctions in societies and the continued deterioration of families’ objective situations, such as the increase in divorces and job-related mobility, we hypothesize an increase of perceived difficulties in parent-child communication across the survey years.</p>
<p>The second major question is whether the trends observed in the individual countries are similar. Using cluster analysis we expected to discover the groups of homogenous countries. We hypothesize a convergence in ease of parent-child communication and cross-country similarity of changes over time. The specific research questions are whether we can observe cultural, historical, or economic convergence between countries.</p>
<p>The third, additional question is if we can observe any age and gender differences in ease of communication and analyzed trends. According to convergence in cultural and socioeconomic factors influencing children and parents regardless age and gender, we hypothesize similarity of observed communication’s changes for boys and girls, and for 11- and 13-years old children.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>International HBSC (Health Behaviour in School-aged Children: A WHO Collaborative Cross-national Study) studies are conducted every 4 years. These surveys explore the health and health-related behaviors of schoolchildren aged 11, 13, and 15 within the context of sociopsychological conditions (including family structure, socioeconomic status, and social relations). The studies are conducted in the same school year in all countries. The number of countries and regions participating in HBSC continues to grow: from five in 1983/84 to 41 countries and regions participating in 2005/2006 survey year. Within the schools, the study is conducted using the auditory method, in classes selected at random, in which the age of the students corresponds to the adopted criterion (average ages of 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 years). The recommended sample size for each of the three age groups is set at approximately 1,500 students. A minimum of 95% of the eligible target population should be within the sample frame. In the vast majority of countries, a nationally representative sample is drawn (Roberts, Tynjiila, Currie, &amp; King, 2007).</p>
<p>Our analyses were restricted to 11-13-year olds (early adolescents) from all European countries taking part in each of four waves of HBSC data collection 1993/4-2005/2006. The final sample consisted of 199,411 students from 16 countries, representing both Western and Eastern European countries (50.8% girls; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272431611419509">Table 1</xref> has a detailed overview).</p>

<title>Instruments</title>
<p>We used a standard international questionnaire, translated from English into the national languages. The HBSC questionnaire consists of an obligatory (mandatory) section, that each country is required to include for the production of an international common data set, and optional packages. In the mandatory section, there are two questions about ease of communication with the respondent’s mother and father. These items remained the same in all four survey years. Communication with parents is studied from the adolescents’ perspective, understood as the children’s cognitive reflection, and perception of the family’s functioning and dynamics.</p>
<p>Most of the questions on the international questionnaire concerning family life were changed across the survey years, and it is not possible to compare their results. The only unchanged item (apart from communication) was family structure (living with mother and father). For the economic situation in different countries, we had to use an external criterion (GBP/person, from Word Bank data).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0272431611419509">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>We asked the respondents “How easy is it for you to talk to the following persons about things that really bother you?” A checklist of close people including “father” and “mother” was then given, with the response options of “very easy,” “easy,” “difficult,” “very difficult,” and “don’t have or don’t see this person.” Although this is a single-item measure, it was used and validated in numerous national and international studies as a good measure of the respondent’s relationship with each of their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0272431611419509">Dallago &amp; Santinello, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272431611419509">Kuntsche &amp; Kuendig, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0272431611419509">Moreno, Muñoz-Tinoco, Pérez, &amp; Sánchez-Queija, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We collapsed the original answer options of “very easy” and “easy” into one category, “easy communication with . . . ” This was also done with the original answering options “very difficult” and “difficult” into “difficulties in communication with . . . ” The decision to collapse these two answering categories was dictated by two factors. First, in these analyses, the focus was placed on the incidence of the general phenomenon of difficulties in communication within the family, and not on their escalation. Second, such a categorization makes the results reported in the article strictly comparable to those of the international HBSC report which includes currently more than 40 countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0272431611419509">Currie et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611419509">2008</xref>). The option “don’t have/see this person” was used for either “mother” or “father,” and this data was considered as absent values (excluded from particular analyses—for communication with mother 4.5%, with father—10.5%).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0272431611419509">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Chi-square tests were performed to compare both gender-related differences and differences between study waves in the perception of communication with the mother and father.</p>
<p>In order to describe changes in parent-child communication through the four time-periods, a nonhierarchical <italic>k</italic> means cluster (quick cluster) analysis was conducted. Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of similar observations into subsets. It is sometimes used to analyze homogeneity of trends in mortality data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272431611419509">Antunes &amp; Waldman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272431611419509">Bansal &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>). The baseline level of communication (in 1994) and three indices of changes (1998/94, 2002/1998, 2006/2002) were investigated as a foundation for clustering. Level of change in a particular country was defined as the difference between time point <italic>n+1</italic> and <italic>n</italic> in the percentage of children who perceived talking to father/mother as difficult. This difference could be positive (worse communication) or negative (better communication). For our data set, we first defined two groups in the cluster analyses (<italic>K</italic> = 2), then <italic>K</italic> = 3, 4, and 5. Comparing alternative runs of <italic>k</italic> means with a given number of clusters we analyzed the sum of squared errors (distances to the closest centroid) as well as we looked for the best solution that maximize the difference between clusters. We compared classification based on cluster analysis and principal components factor analysis (PCA). High concordance measured by kappa was found. The three-group solution proved the most relevant, so it was applied in this study.</p>
<p>Then, the two-factor mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was applied as the general linear model (GLM) for the repeated measures procedure with quality of communication (i.e., variables not used in grouping, besides initial level in 1994) as main outcome measure. A test of the between-subjects effects showed the difference between the clusters, and a test of within-subject effects showed the interaction between cluster and time point (HBSC wave). Additionally, a one-way analysis of variance was applied to the test for each time point the null hypothesis of equality of detected clusters means, separately for parent-child communication, family structure, and economic situation.</p>
<p>SPSS v. 14.0 software was employed to conduct the statistical analyses.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The analysis of the international data showed that the vast majority of the young people participating in the research in the 16 European countries within the given period stated that conversations with parents about troubling matters were easy. Generally, 15.7% (equally boys and girls) of respondents regarded conversation with the mother as difficult, and 33.8% (26.1% boys, 41.3% girls; χ<sup>2</sup>;(1, <italic>N</italic> = 189,722) = 4,580.64, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) stated this of conversation with the father. Analyses conducted separately for four study waves by age and gender showed that in all survey years, older adolescents perceived communication with both parents as difficult more often than younger adolescents (totally, for communication with mother 18.8% vs. 12.5%, χ<sup>2</sup>;(1, <italic>N</italic> = 189,722) = 1,386.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; for communication with father 39.5% vs. 27.9%, χ<sup>2</sup>;(1, <italic>N</italic> = 178,494) = 2,692.67, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and more girls than boys perceived difficulties in communication with the father (for all study waves the statistical significant differences were assessed with χ<sup>2</sup>;, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Differences in perception of communication with the mother and father between study waves were significant for all gender and age groups (for full sample: with mother χ<sup>2</sup>;(3, <italic>N</italic> = 189,722) = 371.44 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; with father χ<sup>2</sup>;(3, <italic>N</italic> = 178,494) = 701.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The general trends in the increase or decrease of difficulties as perceived by adolescents in communication with parents were very similar, regardless of the parent’s or child’s gender or age (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272431611419509">Figure 1</xref>). In 1997/98 we witnessed the biggest increase of difficulties, but in the next survey (2001/02) the figures decreased. The next analyses were made for boys, girls and age groups together.</p>

<p>Differences between the study waves were also shown in the percentage of young people who negatively evaluated their communication with the mother and father in all individual countries. However, the observation of changes in subsequent waves of research in individual European countries showed that this process has not proceeded uniformly (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0272431611419509">Table 2</xref>). Although in all countries the difference in the percentage of young people who considered conversations with mother or father as difficult varied in subsequent years of research, the advantageous or disadvantageous changes took place there at various times.</p>

<p>Cluster analysis suggested that both for mothers and fathers, the pattern of change in communication is divided into three clusters. For mother-child communication, the first cluster included seven countries (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Slovakia, Switzerland), the second only one country (France) and the third eight countries (Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden). For father-child communication, the classification was very similar; only Switzerland was moved from Cluster 1 to Cluster 3. France was considered as an outlier, and the two main clusters were compared. The two-factor mixed ANOVA model estimated for mother-child communication showed that four time points differed significantly, F(3, 11) = 25.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Partial η<sup>2</sup>; = .875 presented a large effect. In a similar model for father-child communication η<sup>2</sup>; = .822, F(3, 11) = 26.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. In both models, the interaction between time point and cluster was significant, with partial η<sup>2</sup>; = .580 and η<sup>2</sup>; = .670, respectively. Test of between-subjects effects showed that the clusters differed significantly, both for mother-child and father-child communication; partial and η<sup>2</sup>; = .518 and η<sup>2</sup>; = .554, respectively, which means a medium effect.</p>
<p>Cluster 1 and 3 started from different baseline levels in 1993/94. In both, an increase in the percentage of children having difficulties in communication with parents was observed. The increase in 1997/98 was followed by a decrease in 2001/02. The decline continued in 2006, but only in the cluster that started from a higher level. As a result, the difference between clusters was significantly reduced at the final point (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272431611419509">Figures 2</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272431611419509">3</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the differences/convergence between Clusters 1 and 3 in four study waves, a ANOVA was conducted. Differences between the clusters in the percentages of adolescents perceiving difficulties in communication with the mother constantly decreased across the survey years (from 1993/94: <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = 25.57, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 to 2005/2006: <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = .69, <italic>p</italic> = .422); likewise with the father (in 1993/94 <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = 23.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; in 2005/2006 <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = .55, <italic>p</italic> = .470). Differences between the clusters in percentages of two-parent families and the mean GDP per person were not statistically significant in any survey years (for two-parent families: from 1993/94: <italic>F</italic>(1, 10) = 1.49, <italic>p</italic> = .249 to 2005/2006: <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = .00, <italic>p</italic> = .989; for GDP: from 1993/94: <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = 1.28, <italic>p</italic> =.279 to 2005/2006: <italic>F</italic>(1, 13) = .01, <italic>p</italic> = .948).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The research was focused on trends in evaluating conversations with parents about matters troubling young people. This variable is a good indicator of overall family relationships, and correlates well with the measure of attachment to the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0272431611419509">Pedersen et al., 2001</xref>). The results of research conducted in 16 European countries showed that the perception of communication with parents may depend on many factors, both personal and social, which confirms the ecological system model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272431611419509">Bronfenbrenner, 1986</xref>). Therefore, both universal issues in all waves of the surveys and countries, and specific issues in the trends across countries, might be observed.</p>
<sec id="section13-0272431611419509">
<title>General tendencies</title>
<p>In all surveys across all countries, the percentages of young people describing conversations with parents as easy or very easy were the highest among 11-year-olds. Children of that age are just entering adolescence—some authors call this period “middle childhood” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272431611419509">Kuczynski, 2003</xref>); therefore, the conflicts typical of adolescence do not affect the majority of the representatives of this age group. With age, there are more and more conflicts and difficulties in communication. Generally, boys perceived communication with the father more positively than girls. This may depend on differences in how fathers treat girls and boys, such as greater pressure exerted on girls to behave in socially “acceptable” manners, greater demands or greater limitation of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272431611419509">Brannon, 2002</xref>). Another explanation of this result could be that fathers are more involved with sons’ activities than those of their daughters. This shows that early involvement by fathers is a good predictor of closeness to both genders in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272431611419509">Flouri &amp; Buchanan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272431611419509">Grossman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272431611419509">Lewis &amp; Lamb, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Communication with mothers was assessed more often as easy or very easy than communication with fathers. The gender of the parent as the determinant of the ease of conversations is also reflected in empirical studies. The higher percentage of young people evaluating conversations with the mother as easy (as compared to conversations with the father) may be the result of the various roles played by each parent in the family. Mothers usually spend more time with their children, are more involved, empathic, emotional, as well as more supportive and protective against stress; while fathers teach their children how to cope with the surroundings and are more commanding, which may be perceived by young people as difficulty in conversation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0272431611419509">Fallon &amp; Bowles, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272431611419509">Harakeh, Scholte, de Vries, &amp; Engels, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0272431611419509">Leaper, Anderson, &amp; Sanders, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0272431611419509">Paquette, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The results support hypothesis that trends of changes in parents-child communication across the survey years are similar for boys and girls and for 11- and 13-years old children. This indicates that changes in the ease of adolescent-parent communication are determined by other, external factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0272431611419509">
<title>Trends Over Time</title>
<p>We found differences in the perception of communication with the mother and father between study waves for all gender and age groups. We hypothesized an increase in perceived difficulties in parent-child communication across the survey years. The hypothesis was not confirmed. In the most countries the prevalence of two-parent families has decreased during 12 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272431611419509">Currie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0272431611419509">Pedersen, Granado-Alcon, Rodriguez, &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0272431611419509">Setterboulte, 2000</xref>), but the child-parent communication doesn’t follow the family structure. It could be postulated that in cross-cultural family studies it is not enough to ask questions about structure of the family, but we should ask about the functional relationships between its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431611419509">Georgas et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The economic situation is an important factor causing stress in family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272431611419509">Conger et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272431611419509">Conger, Ge, Elder, Lorenz, &amp; Simons, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0272431611419509">Elder, Conger, Foster, &amp; Ardelt, 1992</xref>). In the present study, the greatest increase of difficulties in communication was observed across 1993/1994-1997/1998 survey years. The period 1993-1998 was the postcommunist time in Eastern Europe and Baltic countries, characterized by rapid economic and political changes that placed families under severe economic pressure. Special studies in this transformation period, conducted in Czech Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272431611419509">Hraba, Lorenz, &amp; Zdenka, 2000</xref>), Romania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0272431611419509">Robila, 2005</xref>) and Bulgaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272431611419509">Botcheva &amp; Feldman, 2004</xref>) have shown that the family stress model, developed in United States by Conger and colleagues (1992, 1994) worked also in Eastern Europe: economic pressure made spouses irritable and hostile, causing marital instability, harsh parenting, and adolescent emotional and behavioural problems. Results from 2001/2002 HBSC survey showed in most of the countries decrease of difficulties in child-parent communication. These results can be associated with stabilization of economic and political situation in Europe, and show how the different countries have accommodated to new situation. The collapse of socialist economic system in Eastern Europe and Russia have influenced the economic situation in many European countries, for example, Germany by incorporation of German Democratic Republic, Finland as becoming an important trading partner of Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272431611419509">Honkapohja &amp; Koskela, 1999</xref>). Thus, economic situation seems to be an important factor among determinants of parent-child communication.</p>
<p>The decrease in difficulties in parent-child communication in 2001/02 in most of the countries under study was quite optimistic and the changes between 2001/02 and 2005/06 in some countries constitute a continuation of this positive trend.</p>

<sec id="section15-0272431611419509">
<title>Cross-Country Differences and Convergence</title>
<p>In our study we observed some cross-country differences. The essential differences among the percentage of young people perceiving difficulties in conversations with their parents in various countries point to the fact that the ease of communication is conditioned by historical events and cultural determinants, which vary for different countries. In some countries, in all survey years, we observed high percentages of adolescents perceiving difficulties in communication with parents (as in the Czech Republic), in some countries such percentages were rather low (as in Poland, where in 2002 the percentage of young people evaluating conversations with any of their parents as difficult was the lowest of the countries under analysis).</p>
<p>We hypothesized a convergence in ease of parent-child communication and cross-country similarity of changes over time. This hypothesis was confirmed. Analyses with cluster sampling divided the countries examined into three groups. The selected groups neither correspond with an East-West division, nor with economic or family structure differences. The first group of countries, after an increase of communication difficulties in 1997/98, registered a constant decrease. Generally, these are countries with higher levels of perceived problems in parent-child communication. In the second group of countries, after an increase of communication difficulties in 1997/98, in 2001/02 a decrease was noted, and then in 2005/06, a stagnation, but generally these are countries with lower levels of perceived problems in parent-child communication. Across the survey years we can observe a convergence between countries in perceiving parent-child communication. The only country that does not follow this rule is France. In contrast to most countries, communication in French families improved in the 1994-2002 period, and suddenly worsened in 2006 (the difficulty in conversations increased by 8.3% for the mother and 15.1% for the father), which gave France the lowest position among all the 16 countries.</p>
<p>The observed convergence between countries in family life can be understood as a symptom of globalization processes. People in all countries watch the same movies and news channels, visit the same websites, enjoy the same fast food, and even laugh at the same jokes that are circulated on the internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0272431611419509">Esmer, 2006</xref>). Although nation-states are still the main centers of political decision making, the progressive enlargement of the European Union (in 1990 there were 12 countries, in 1995 15, in 2004 25, and in 2007 27) has caused Europe today to be more united and integrated than it has ever been in its history. Additionally, the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Communist system represented yet another momentous step toward political and economic integration. Most of the formerly Communist Eastern European states and some former Soviet Republics have acceded to the EU. Exchanges at all levels and in all spheres between the former East and the West intensified.</p>
<p>Diminishing cultural differences between Eastern and Western European countries were also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272431611419509">Kuntsche et al. (2011)</xref>. These authors showed cultural convergence in drunkenness among adolescents, explaining this not only by marketing practices, but also by referring partly to the breakdown of the relatively high social control of leisure time in the planned-economy socialist societies and partly to development and implementation of evidence-based prevention programs in Western countries. Similar explanation of cultural convergence in parent-child communication can be applied.</p>
<p>An explanation why analyzed countries form two main groups (clusters) with similar family communication trends: a mixture of Eastern/Western and richer/poorer countries, and one outlier (France) is not easy. Earlier cross-cultural analyses include some of the countries taking part in our research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272431611419509">Georgas et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0272431611419509">Oyserman et al., 2002</xref>). In meta-analyses of cross-culture differences in individualism/collectivism Oyserman et al. included data from Austria, Denmark, Estonia, and Germany (included to our first cluster), Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Russia (our second group) and France (our outlier). Comparisons show that the most individualistic countries are Germany and Poland (from two different clusters) and the most collectivistic are Russia, Hungary, Lithuania (from one cluster), and Denmark (from the second one). These analyses indicate that observed trends of changes in parent-child communication across 12 years are not associated with culture differences. Although parent-child communication depends on many factors (cultural, economic, and so on), a possible explanation of observed trends of changes could be globalization—process that causes European countries resemble each other. An extraordinary, negative trend observed in France needs a confirmation in the next survey. France was one of the least collectivistic countries in Oyserman’s meta-analyses. The next survey four years from now will show whether the globalization process also changes this country.</p>
<p>Looking at the results of our survey, we can see a need to make more analyses of trends in parent-child communication, accounting quality of this communication, as well as analyses considering more factors that can help us explain the tendencies we have observed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0272431611419509">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>To summarize the results of this study, it should be pointed out that the research was an exceptionally valuable initiative on a global scale, due to the use of the common multitopic questionnaire, conducted at the same time and in the same age groups. However, the question regarding the ease of communication as asked in the interview does not consider various other aspects of parent-child communication, and it can only be used as a very general measure, as a starting point for in-depth analyses. The repeatability of the HBSC Study allows the change trends in time to be traced; the interdisciplinary character of the research team, and the dynamic character of the research are its strong point. Future waves of study will add new communication scales, which will help in interpreting the observed trends in parent-child communication.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The study showed a convergence between countries in a quality of family life, and an acceleration of this process within last years. This is consistent with the recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; 2011) report about the changes in families. It means that families in different countries, regardless economic status of country, culture, history, or geographical position are changing in similar way. Now, in 2001/02 and 2005/06 we observed quite optimistic trends in parent-child communication, but earlier in 1997/98, difficulties in parent-adolescent communication increased in almost all countries. To avoid a repetition of such a situation, we need a family policy, specific for each culture, but with aims common for all countries.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0272431611419509">OECD (2011)</xref> report points also changes in family life associated with the growing numbers of mothers reentering the labor force or remaining in employment. The European polices, including flexible work schedules, job sharing, telecommuting, and part-work work with benefits, now reserved only for parents of young children, should be extend to the parents of young adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0272431611419509">Santrock, 2007</xref>). This change in work/family policy would enable parents to spend more time with their teenagers and improve family communication.</p>
<p>Strategies, which enhance the parent-child relationship, are recommended at a population level. Introducing regulations that enable families spend more time together (during leisure time, mealtime, and so on) will induce closer relationships and easier communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0272431611419509">Fulkerson, Pasch, Stigler, Farbakhsh, Perry, &amp; Komro, 2010</xref>). This way we will create better conditions for youth development and promote adolescents’ health and well-being.</p>
