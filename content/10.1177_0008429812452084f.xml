<p>Einar Thomassen is well-known and well-respected as a teacher and for his work on the religions of late antiquity, particularly with regard to gnosticism. Among his many contributions to scholarship, his recent book, <italic>The Spiritual Seed: The Church of the “Valentinians,”</italic> has been rightly hailed as a masterpiece in the modern study of Valentinian gnosticism. This Festschrift, occasioned by his sixtieth birthday, is divided into three sections, each one expanding outward from the one before. The first—with contributions from April DeConick, Jean-Daniel Dubois, Flavia Ruani, Karen King, Antti Marjanen, Louis Painchaud, Anne Pasquier, Nils Arne Pedersen, and John D. Turner—deals with “mystery and secrecy in the Nag Hammadi and related gnostic writings,” and includes discussions of the Peratics, various Sethian works, the Gospel of Philip, and Coptic-Manichaean use of “mystery.”</p>
<p>The second section—with contributions from David Brakke, Ismo Dunderberg, Dimitris Kyrtatas, Hugo Lundhaug, Birger Pearson, Paul-Hubert Poirier, and Tuomas Rasimus—addresses the issues of “mystery and secrecy in other Christian practices, text traditions, and material culture.” It includes articles on Evagrius, Shenoute, the Acts of Thomas, the Christ/fish ICTHYS acronym, and mystery and secrecy in Paul’s letters and the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The final section—with contributions from Jonas Bjornebye, Jan Bremmer, Christian Bull, Liv Ingeborg Lied, Marvin Meyer, Jorgen Podemann Sorensen, and Risto Uro—deals with “mystery and secrecy in non-Christian practices, text traditions, and material culture,” ranging from the Eleusinian mysteries to Jewish apocalyptic literature, Hermetic material, and Mithraism.</p>
<p>There are too many fine articles in this volume to discuss them all individually—and of course every reader will come to the volume with his or her own interests. April DeConick’s article on the Peratics, a group described by Hippolytus, and the first article in the volume, sets the bar extremely high. The Peratics have been somewhat “under the radar” in research on gnosticism: their reputation suffers partly from a modern disdain for astrology, as DeConick points out. Her intricate detailing of their system of astrological soteriology is fascinating, evocative, and a significant contribution to raising their profile.</p>
<p>Risto Uro provides a useful summary of cognitive and evolutionary theories of ritual. Ritual, being implicated in so many facets of human life (from individual to social, from experiential to historical), cannot be adequately discussed without invoking a wide range of approaches; Uro’s article serves to remind us of a range of theoretical possibilities that tend to be underused in work on gnosticism and related movements.</p>
<p>Also reminding us of the need for diversity, this time in our interpretations of gnostic work, is Louis Painchaud’s exploration (“ ‘Joseph le charpentier planta un jardin …’ (EvPhil 73,8–9): Sens apparent et sens caché dans l’Évangile selon Philippe”) of the discussion of Joseph the father of Jesus in the enigmatic Gospel of Philip. In addition to unraveling some of the allusions underlying the brief mention of Joseph, his work as a carpenter, and the fate of his son, Painchaud reminds us of the importance and prevalence of esoteric tactics in early Christian writing, and of their role not only in transmitting information to the reader, but also in encouraging the reader to develop and undergo his or her own enlightenment in the process of deciphering (the reader’s interpretation of) the text’s true message.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unexpected article in the volume is Tuomas Rasimus’ “Revisiting the Ichthys: A suggestion concerning the Origins of Christological Fish Symbolism,” in which he provides a tantalizing hypothesis of the origins of the well-known Ichthys acronym (the Greek word for fish; its letters were read as the first letters of Jesus Christ, God’s Son, Savior). This article is speculative in the best sense—that is, it does not by any means prove its case, but the hypothesis it constructs is very intriguing and strong, insofar as the evidence allows.</p>
<p>As a thematic collection, the book is not perfect. Not all of the papers in this volume are “keepers”—there are a few perfunctory articles, and a few in which the connection to the book’s theme seems tenuous. But seen as a collection of mostly intriguing articles by some of Einar Thomassen’s many friends and colleagues, the book is impressive and heart-warming. To be recommended to those with an interest in mystery and secrecy in late antique religion.</p>
