<abstract>
<p>This essay seeks to abstract from the works of Maximus the Confessor (580–662) a ‘theory’ of virtue ethics that engages Maximus’s own categories and language while still developing conversation with contemporary virtue ethics. First is a reconstruction of the larger cosmological (and moral) ‘narrative’—the <italic>oikonomia</italic> Maximus sees embodied in sacred history—that frames his essentially teleological understanding of the formation of virtue in created beings. The second part of the essay explores Maximus’s doctrine of the moral self as a synthesis of ‘diachronic’ and ‘synchronic’ dimensions, and details three identifiable protocols by which moral agents cultivate the Christian virtues: first, the development of intellectual virtues such as prudence that serve clear vision (<italic>theoria</italic>) of worthy moral ends; second, the appropriate ‘use’ of the passible faculties of desire and temper in alliance with reason; and third, the conditioning of the virtues within moral communities (monastery or church) characterized by relations of accountability, imitation, and the traditioning of moral wisdom.</p>

<body>
<p>Had Maximus the Confessor (580–662) been asked what he thought about virtue ethics, I am fairly certain that his response would have been, ‘Is there any other kind?’ And, unlike Aquinas (<italic>Summa Theologiae</italic> IaIIae.55-67), he ostensibly saw no need to set out a formal exposition of virtue ethics. Today virtue ethics takes its place alongside two other well-developed constellations of ethical theory—neo-Kantian deontology, and consequentialism—and is the subject of a growing array of critical studies, some of which interface with Christian theology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946813484409">1</xref></sup> But, generally speaking, we find little in the way of ethical theorizing as such in patristic literature. Even casuistic or pedagogic treatises like those of Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria that deal with specific moral problems (e.g. wealth, dress, military service, the snares of pagan culture) deal more with the formation of Christian character than with abstract justifications of how Christian moral norms operate. Patristic ethics built upon a venerable heritage of Christian moral wisdom that drew broadly from Scripture, philosophy, and an emerging cult of saints, largely with a view to inculcating Christianity’s theological virtues (faith, hope, and love) and cardinal moral virtues.</p>
<p>Living and writing in the first half of the seventh century, Maximus benefited from a long prior history of patristic appropriation of elements of Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic ethics that extended all the way back to Paul’s own use of Hellenistic moral philosophy. Even if he read some classical philosophers directly or used doxographies, his engagement with them was primarily filtered through Christian sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946813484409">2</xref></sup> Maximus indicates clear familiarity, for example, with the Aristotelian ideas that virtue is a habitus (ἕξις) of the soul,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946813484409">3</xref></sup> that it intrinsically leads to <italic>eudaimonia</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946813484409">4</xref></sup> and that virtue is by definition a ‘mean’ between dispositional extremes of excess and defect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946813484409">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Crucial as well to the tradition of patristic moral wisdom to which Maximus was beholden was the ever-expanding repertoire of Christian exempla drawn from sacred history and held forth for imitation (µίµησις) in biblical commentaries, homilies, and hagiography.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946813484409">6</xref></sup> Patristic interpreters had developed sophisticated ways of ‘intertextually’ weaving the stories of extraordinary saints with the unfolding story of Christians in the recent past and even in present circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946813484409">7</xref></sup> Maximus, like other monastic writers, regularly eulogizes biblical saints and holds them up as paragons of the Christian virtues,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946813484409">8</xref></sup> just as Byzantine hagiography in his time was increasingly adept at shaping narratives of recent saints according to biblical prototypes. The profile of the Christian ascetical or ‘philosophical’ sage, with virtues fully intact, was readily available to Maximus not only from hagiographical traditions but from the works of Evagrius Ponticus.</p>
<p>All this is to establish that the moral wisdom tradition in Maximus’s background was devoted much more to formation (παιδϵία) and practice (πρᾶξις) than ethical theory per se, though it was not without a strong component of <italic>theoria</italic> (θεωρία) in the sense of <italic>contemplative</italic> insight. And yet simply recounting Maximus’s own ascetical instructions on various Christian virtues and their associated practices would scarcely do justice to the larger cosmological, anthropological, and most importantly christological framework within which he understands the virtues to be cultivated. In what follows I propose to sketch how a ‘theory’ of virtue ethics might yet be abstracted from Maximus, as a major architect of Eastern Orthodox theological ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946813484409">9</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section1-0953946813484409">
<title>Maximus’s Cosmological (and Moral) Narrative</title>
<p>The privileged role ascribed to narrative in postmodern virtue ethics, especially in its Christian articulation, stems from the conviction that moral goods are inseparable from the virtuous pursuit of—or vicious aversion to—them in the teleological context of a <italic>vita</italic>, a life ‘storied’ by concrete moral testing and interlinking with the storied lives of others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946813484409">10</xref></sup> The dominant concern in patristic ethics is the larger moral and communal narrative weaving together the lives of the Christian faithful and engrafting them into the sacred story revealed in Scripture. Wayne Meeks has shown how early Christian ethics took shape from within a christocentric and universalizing ‘moral story’ in which the faithful could identify.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946813484409">11</xref></sup> I have argued elsewhere that the rich patristic notion of a divine <italic>oikonomia</italic>, the economy or strategy of the triune God’s self-revelation in creation and redemption communicated through catechesis and liturgy, functioned at one level to mark the dramatic elements and turning-points in the ‘thick narrative’ that is sacred history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946813484409">12</xref></sup> To identify the <italic>oikonomia</italic> as a narrative may appear strange, since in patristic thought the <italic>oikonomia</italic> entailed candidly metaphysical predications, whereas for us narrative does not self-evidently lend itself to those kinds of claims.</p>
<p>But in Maximus’s case I will justify this broadened definition of ‘narrative’, a definition that doubtless stretches it beyond the conventions of contemporary virtue ethics, on two counts. First, in Maximus as in his much earlier predecessor Irenaeus of Lyons, the <italic>oikonomia</italic>—while the subject of ontological claims about God’s ‘vertical’ condescension into space and time—still takes on a ‘linear’ progression in terms of ‘beginning’ (ἀρχή), dramatic ‘middle’ (µεσότης), and consummating ‘end’ (τέλος).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946813484409">13</xref></sup> Maximus’s seasoned summary of the <italic>oikonomia</italic> in his seventh <italic>Ambiguum</italic> is renowned for challenging the Origenist ‘myth’, which depicted the economy as a drama of spiritual creatures (τὰλογικά) falling from eternal bliss into material corporeality and striving to recover their primordial unity through the incarnate intervention of the one unfallen spirit, Jesus Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946813484409">14</xref></sup> Maximus corrects the Origenist cosmology by proposing that rational creatures are a constant composite of spirit and matter who have a definite beginning in time, and who move through their moral history en route toward a glorious and <italic>unprecedented</italic> end (deification).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946813484409">15</xref></sup> Building especially on Irenaeus, Athanasius, and the Cappadocians, he posits that creation has already been invested with the divine purpose sufficient to endure and transcend the Adamic fall and its repercussions. Christ the Logos, who already co-created the cosmos with the Father and the Spirit, encoded his ultimate will for rational beings in the archetypal principles (λόγοι) informing each and every created thing. Much like the <italic>rationes seminales</italic> in Augustine, Maximus’s <italic>logoi</italic> represent the archetypal patterns, ontologically and morally, according to which creatures are to fulfill their vocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946813484409">16</xref></sup> More importantly, Maximus believes, the Logos has invested or ‘incarnated’ <italic>himself</italic> in these <italic>logoi</italic> such that they are the pledges of his own abiding presence and resourcefulness in all rational creatures as they pursue their <italic>telos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946813484409">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The deep internal relation between Logos and <italic>logoi</italic> thus constitutes a kind of grid or map of the outworking of divine providence in Maximus’s cosmology. But on the concrete level of morality, the level of the τρόποι or ‘modes’ of existence in which creatures actualize the freedom grounded in the <italic>logos</italic> of their particular natures, the <italic>logoi</italic> set the stage for the suspenseful drama of dynamic interaction between Creator and creatures, a moral drama mirrored within Scripture and still playing itself out in the church’s foreground.</p>
<p>This brings me to my second justification for calling the <italic>oikonomia</italic> a narrative. For Maximus, the cosmic order undergirding Christian ethics is anchored in the peculiar narrative of Jesus of Nazareth, the Word incarnate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946813484409">18</xref></sup> More than any of his Byzantine forbears, possibly excepting Cyril of Alexandria, Maximus envisions the life, ministry, passion, and glorification of Jesus <italic>narrated in the Gospels</italic> as key to the larger mystery of cosmic salvation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946813484409">19</xref></sup> The entire <italic>universal</italic> order—the diversity of created natures, the networks and hierarchies that bind together intelligible and sensible creation, the harmony of virtues that integrate and unify creatures in their proper modes of existence—finds its ultimate coherence in the concrete particularity of Jesus, since nowhere was the Logos’s bearing of the <italic>logoi</italic> of creation more evident than in his incarnation, when he assumed all the vagaries of historical existence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946813484409">20</xref></sup> Only the believer, says Maximus, who through virtue and discipleship has come to grips with the mystery of Christ’s cross and resurrection, has any hope of knowing the <italic>logoi</italic> and ultimate purpose of creation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946813484409">21</xref></sup> Moreover, when he speaks of a ‘natural law’ embedded in the fabric of creation, it never stands on its own terms but is inextricably and irreducibly bound up with the ‘written law’, that is, the scripturally narrated economy of salvation, and with the ‘law of grace’ perfectly embodied in Jesus of Nazareth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946813484409">22</xref></sup> In this case Christian virtues may very well exhibit a morality that is ‘natural’ to humanity, but they spawn little more than random acts of kindness or justice unless they are reconditioned and recontextualized as real presences of Christ the Logos, who, being ‘the substance of all the virtues’, ‘incarnates’ and differentiates himself in the virtues of the Christian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946813484409">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946813484409">
<title>Transforming the Passible (and Desiring) Self into a Virtuous Self</title>
<p>For Maximus, the human self as a moral subject and agent is both diachronic and synchronic. The self is ‘diachronic’ as always being the accretion of its past—though not primarily in the sense of a trajectory of personal formation, like Augustine’s self in the <italic>Confessions</italic>, distended over a lifetime and struggling to be gathered into its true identity in God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0953946813484409">24</xref></sup> Maximus’s diachronic self is a person (Ủπόστασις), to be sure, but a person who, instantiating human nature (φύσις) as a whole, carries the collective marks of the history of that nature before and after the Adamic fall. It enjoys the endowments of the image of God (intellect, reason, freedom, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0953946813484409">25</xref></sup> It has a <italic>logos</italic>, the ‘natural principle’ (λόγος φύσεως) that predisposes the human being toward a final <italic>telos</italic> in God, as well as the freedom to act within the parameters of that <italic>logos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0953946813484409">26</xref></sup> But it also bears the stigmata of human nature stunted by fallenness and disorientation (misdirected desire, deviance of the passions, etc.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0953946813484409">27</xref></sup> Whereas Origen had defined the rational creature as a <italic>graduated</italic> composite of pure spirit (πνεŨµα or νοŨς), soul (ψυχή), and material body (σῶµα), soul and body having been provisionally added to the spirit after its primordial lapse, Maximus understands human nature from its inception-in-time to have all three as constitutive and as created in integral relation to each other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0953946813484409">28</xref></sup> And yet Maximus affirms the soul’s mediating function between spirit and body, as well as the Platonic hierarchy of the soul comprising reason (λόγος) and the lower drives of desire (ἐπιθυµία) and temper (θυµός).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0953946813484409">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>What I want to call the ‘synchronic’ self in Maximus is the self-conscious moral agent, which at any given point in time finds itself in an immediate existential condition (κατάστασις),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0953946813484409">30</xref></sup> the subject of an acquired configuration of dispositions and habits, with a mixed record of virtues and vices and a conscience to varying degrees tainted and convicted. In ascetical terms, this is the self constantly on the threshold of assimilation to God,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0953946813484409">31</xref></sup> which Maximus in one place sees exemplified in the figure of Moses, a proto-ascetic struggling at this threshold where the only way forward is perpetual striving toward virtue, since ‘immobility in virtue is the beginning of vice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0953946813484409">32</xref></sup> In Maximus’s asceticism, the synchronic self perennially strives to take ownership of the diachronic self, using and aligning all the natural faculties, even in their stunted condition, to cultivate virtue and spiritual knowledge, thus putting the inner house in order, which always entails, simultaneously, the healthy realignment of moral relations with other created beings.</p>
<p>Both in its diachronic and synchronic dimensions, the moral self is a <italic>passible</italic> self. Passibility (τὸ πάθος) is a complex notion in Maximus. Negatively it signals humanity’s postlapsarian condition, its susceptibility to pain and suffering, to deviant passions or emotions, and ultimately to death itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0953946813484409">33</xref></sup> But even more basically and positively for Maximus, there is the passibility that consists in created natures’ utter ontological dependence on the Creator’s gracious activity (ἐνέργεια), which funds creatures’ own potency (δύναµις), actuality (ἐνέργεια), and movement (κίνησις).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0953946813484409">34</xref></sup> This includes the creature’s ‘passivity’ to its own engrained desire (ἔφεσις; ὄρεξις) for God. Since creatures are not self-moved, creaturely desire is secured and ultimately sated only in relation to its divine <italic>telos</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0953946813484409">35</xref></sup> Though Maximus uses the language of ‘natural’ desire and will, such as found perfection in Christ the New Adam,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0953946813484409">36</xref></sup> he also concurs with Gregory of Nyssa and Dionysius the Areopagite that there is a deep passion or <italic>eros</italic> at the core of the creature that launches and energizes the whole passible self, preparing it for <italic>ecstatic</italic> union with God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0953946813484409">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>So how precisely does this passible self become a virtuous self? I propose that there are three major protocols for the cultivation of virtue in Maximus’s ascetical teaching, each of which will warrant closer analysis. First is the discipline of targeting appropriate ends, or goods, since virtues are, as in Aristotle, teleologically constituted and directed. This involves sanctified reason but also a deeper ‘seeing’ or contemplation (θεωρία) of the self and of the salutary order embedded in the <italic>logoi</italic> of all things, as well as developing a practical wisdom (φρόνησις) that merges contemplation and practice (πρᾶξις). A second protocol is the appropriate reconditioning of human desire and the beneficial ‘use’ of the passible faculties and the emotions themselves, since emotion factors decisively into the habituation of virtues. Third, the cultivation of virtue presupposes a moral-communal context marked by relations of accountability, the traditioning of moral wisdom, and the imitation of those already advanced in Christian virtues (on all of which points Maximus clearly presages postmodern virtue ethics).</p>
<sec id="section3-0953946813484409">
<title>Intellectual Judgment and Contemplation</title>
<p>Virtue is a matter of seeing well, not just doing well. While Maximus hardly believes that only the most spiritually astute Christian (the <italic>gnostikos</italic>) can exercise sufficient insight and foresight to cultivate virtue, he does assume that a maturing intellectual judgment is requisite for determining the appropriate ends that govern the virtuous life and one’s particular moral acts. Much of the real mental labor in turn consists in conforming the mediate ends of the particular mental, volitional, and practical operations that cumulatively make up that virtuous life to its indisputably supreme end, the triune God. Even if this supreme <italic>telos</italic> is encoded in the very nature of a human being, and is discernible through reason and contemplation, the mind even of the advanced ascetic is invariably beclouded by distracting thoughts (λογισµοί), errant representations (νοήµατα) of reality, demonically-inspired barrages of passion, and habitual vices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0953946813484409">38</xref></sup> Maximus’s debt here to Evagrius and the wisdom of desert eremitism is profound. The mind (νοŨς) must cut through this psychological morass, overcome its alienation from itself, and see everything, within the soul and without, in the perspective of divine wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0953946813484409">39</xref></sup> Such requires, at bottom, the cultivation of virtues at the level of perception itself, such as self-mastery (ἐγκράτεια), and especially prudence (φρόνησις), which Maximus dubs the foundation of reason and the very ‘act and manifestation of wisdom’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0953946813484409">40</xref></sup> just as virtue itself is the ‘concrete realization’ (Ủπόστασις) of this wisdom and wisdom is ‘the essence of virtue’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0953946813484409">41</xref></sup> Such wisdom requires taking command of sense experience (αἴσθησις) and the individual senses <italic>from the inside out</italic>. ‘Every passion’, he writes, ‘is invariably an interconnected composite of a sensible object, sense itself, and a natural faculty…irascibility (θυµός), desire (ἐπιθυµία), or even reason (λόγος) deviated from its natural function’. By a kind of intro-circumspection, the mind can nonetheless contemplate the true ‘synthetic end’ (κατὰ σύνθεσιν τέλος) of the sensible object, sense itself, and the implicated faculty, and thus remove the soul’s ‘impassioned disposition’ so as to see all of these clearly according to their <italic>natural</italic> purpose, which also has the effect of clarifying the image of God within the mind itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0953946813484409">42</xref></sup> Self-knowledge and the contemplation of the external nature of things are of a piece.</p>
<p>The mind in this process is thus no passive receptor. Its ‘seeing’ is active, probing, discerning, which is more plausible on the analogy of ancient notions of physical optics, whereby vision went out from the eyes like a beam and returned again with perceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0953946813484409">43</xref></sup> But, like other ascetics of his time, Maximus knew that physical sight, with its moral precariousness, could muddle clear intellectual vision.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0953946813484409">44</xref></sup> In order to see through to appropriate moral ends, the mind’s eye requires its own conditioning, not only by intellectual virtues like prudence but even more basically by faith itself, which Maximus calls ‘true knowledge from undemonstrated principles, since it is the substance of realities that are beyond intelligence and reason (cf. Heb. 11:1)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0953946813484409">45</xref></sup> Faith provides the mind its bearings as it contemplates the profoundly diverse <italic>logoi</italic> of created things and begins to fathom the Creator’s economy and one’s place within that economy. Rather than simply scoping out ‘evidences’ of a Creator, natural contemplation is a sanctified intuition of the strategy of divine activity, providence, and judgment, and of the intended relations among created beings. The goal of natural contemplation, which stops short of direct knowledge of the Creator,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0953946813484409">46</xref></sup> is the <italic>cosmic</italic> perspective or spiritual vision necessary to form virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0953946813484409">47</xref></sup> The contemplation of Scripture (θεωρία γραφική), moreover, is bound up with natural contemplation both because Scripture contains the so-called ‘<italic>logoi</italic> of the commandments’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0953946813484409">48</xref></sup> the deeper divine instruction of the Logos immanent in the various virtues,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0953946813484409">49</xref></sup> and because Scripture narrates how virtue and knowledge have been concretely embodied by exemplary saints.</p>
<p>This simultaneity of <italic>practicing</italic> the virtues and <italic>contemplating</italic> their underlying reality is accented in a comment of Maximus on the ‘seven spirits’ of Isa. 11:2-3:
<disp-quote>
<p>We go from abstention from evils through <italic>fear</italic> to the practice of the virtues by <italic>strength</italic>; from the practices of the virtues to the discretion of <italic>counsel</italic>; from discretion to the habitus (ἕξις) of the virtues, or <italic>knowledge-by-experience</italic> (ἐπιστήµη); from the habitus of the virtues to the <italic>knowledge</italic> (γνῶσις) of the principles (λόγοι) in the virtues; from this knowledge to the habitus transformed to the principles so known, which is the same as <italic>understanding</italic>; and from this understanding to the simple, precise contemplation of universal truth… Ascending through the eyes of faith, or illuminations, we are drawn together toward the divine unity of <italic>wisdom</italic>. And we ourselves gather this differentiation of gifts, which was instituted for us, together with the particular ascents in the virtues, toward the [divine] Cause of those gifts, and, in cooperation with God, neglect none of them, lest by becoming gradually negligent, we make our faith blind and sightless, devoid of illuminations by the Spirit through our works…<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0953946813484409">50</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Integrating contemplation and moral praxis (πρᾶξις) or performance requires, in Maximus’s view, the mediating role of reason. He recurs to the Christianized Stoic concept of ‘right reason’ (ὀρθὸς λόγος) such as judges the proper ‘use’ (χρῆσις) of all things, beginning with one’s thoughts of those things.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0953946813484409">51</xref></sup> Just as the divine Logos governs the movements of beings within the macrocosm of creation, sanctified reason umpires the different movements and functions within the microcosm of the soul, and serves, in Maximus’s evocative description, as the ‘interpreter and exegete of the virtues’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0953946813484409">52</xref></sup> This is because moral acts require not only right ends but also right motives and intentions, which must be continuously and scrupulously tested.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0953946813484409">53</xref></sup> Even <italic>agapê</italic>-love can become culpable if not properly motivated and oriented.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0953946813484409">54</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946813484409">
<title>Emotion and the Cultivation of Virtue</title>
<p>In English colloquial usage, many virtues sound simply like healthy emotional states. The Christian virtues that Maximus sees comprehended under the supreme virtue of love—hope, humility, meekness, self-mastery, patience, longsuffering, kindness, peace, joy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0953946813484409">55</xref></sup>—all conjure up not simply dispositions of character but identifiable emotions. Rosiland Hursthouse notes that a virtue, as a deeply entrenched disposition to act in a certain way, actually presupposes a host of interrelated activities: ‘emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0953946813484409">56</xref></sup> For Aristotle too, she suggests,
<disp-quote>
<p>The virtues (and vices) are all dispositions not only to act, but to feel emotions, as <italic>re</italic>actions as well as impulses to action… In the person with the virtues, these emotions will be felt on the <italic>right</italic> occasion, toward the <italic>right</italic> people or objects, for the <italic>right</italic> reasons…<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0953946813484409">57</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Aristotle, and later on the Stoics who critically built on his virtue ethics, aspired to intellectual ‘techniques’ to identify, modulate, and control emotions, and patristic moralists, including Maximus, were well aware of these.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0953946813484409">58</xref></sup> While Stoics and Platonists had debated whether emotions are <italic>diseases</italic> of the soul, misfiring <italic>judgments</italic> of the mind, or inevitable registers of the soul’s passible <italic>faculties</italic> (δυνάµεις) of desire and temper, Maximus, like the Cappadocians and Evagrius before him, saw relative value in all these definitions, and concurred with the Stoic axiom that the mind is morally responsible for the emotions and that emotions can have moral value determined by their trajectory or end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0953946813484409">59</xref></sup> This is fairly simple to see in the case of the vicious passions, or vices, in which the passible faculties cheat their ‘natural’ function for the sake of an illicit or illusory end. Envy is a good example, and was for patristic moralists a particularly deadly passion, in which reason permits the desiring faculty to pursue violence (attitudinal or physical) against the one envied, as if that will bring the pleasure of assuaging the emotional distress (λύπη) of resenting her for the good she is enjoying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0953946813484409">60</xref></sup> Virtues, on the other hand, require not only morally worthy ends, but the sustained conditioning of the passible faculties to elicit healthy projections of desire or aversion; and for Christian theologians like Maximus this entailed not only the intellectual preempting of unhealthy passions, or the ‘trickle down’ effect of the mind’s own stability, but also the ‘ground up’ ascetical disciplines of psalmody, prayer, and acts of self-mortification such as fasting.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0953946813484409">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Maximus gives substantial attention to the inner processes by which virtue, as a habitus (ἕξις) or disposition (διάθεσις) of the soul, focuses the will and ‘uses’ the passible faculties well. Even though passions or emotions by definition indicate something the soul experiences or ‘suffers’, and over which it often has no immediate control, the core faculties that underlie them—viz. desire (ἐπιθυµία) and irascibility (θυµός)—can be trained, aligned, and reoriented so as to provide the needed <italic>affect</italic> that textures and enriches moral action.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0953946813484409">62</xref></sup> Charity, for example, requires a particular quality of mercy, something well beyond what pagans meant when they described ‘pity’ (a point to which I shall return). Under the guidance of graced reason, the passible faculties could actually help to ‘interpret’ and embrace the good. As Martha Nussbaum has noted within ancient theories of emotion, emotions could be viewed not as pure disturbances or ‘blind surges of affect’ but as having a certain moral ‘intelligence’ or vision of their own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0953946813484409">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>Maximus understands the role of the passions or emotions in the cultivation of virtue and virtuous acts in terms of the challenge of dialectically negotiating the complexity of human passibility and seeking clarity amid its ambiguous moral status. Aristotle had understood this ambiguity vis-à-vis the position of the emotions on the borderland between the rational and irrational (animal) soul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0953946813484409">64</xref></sup> But as I explained earlier regarding the ‘diachronic’ self in Maximus, the moral agent is a composite of the prelapsarian self, whose reason, passible faculties, and free will have been ordered according to an original or ‘natural’ integrity and interconnection, and the postlapsarian self in which these faculties, stunted by Adamic sin, function in a fallen mode (τρόπος).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0953946813484409-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The chart above shows the structural tensions and teleological vectors in Maximus’s doctrine of human passibility. He spends little time dwelling on the prelapsarian state of human nature. Though by his original constitution Adam enjoyed a sublime passibility, a capacity for uninterrupted spiritual pleasure, the instant he came into being he abused it, thus orienting the passible faculties to fallacious goods and thrusting his human posterity into an experiential dialectic of illusory pleasure (ἡδονή) and multifaceted pain (λυπή).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0953946813484409">65</xref></sup> As a consequence, natural human desire and free will have deviated into a ‘gnomic’ mode (τò γνωµικόν), meaning that, loosed from their natural function, they have fallen into a pattern of obscured vision, private judgment of good and evil, and vacillation in determining and willing worthy ends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0953946813484409">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Maximus nonetheless sees a unique providence operative here. Formally, he defines γνώµη as ‘appetency internally predisposed (ὄρεξις ἐνδιάθετος) toward that which is in our moral power (ἐφ’ ἡµῖν), and the basis of our free choice (προαίρεσις)’, or also as ‘a disposition (διάθεσις) toward those things in our moral power on which we have deliberated with a desirous urge (ὀρεκτικῶς βουλευθεῖσι)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0953946813484409">67</xref></sup> It is more in his later works, where he is keen on recovering the absolute priority of ‘natural’ human desire and will, that Maximus accentuates the culpable dimension of γνώµη, virtually equating it with vacillation or moral myopia and denying its presence in Christ. Meanwhile, precisely the ambiguity of gnomic desire and volition ironically signals their moral potentiality. As our Adamic inheritance,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0953946813484409">68</xref></sup> γνώµη is what we immediately <italic>experience</italic> in our mundane life as free will, and presumes the need to <italic>form</italic> good decisions and to <italic>learn</italic> to make virtuous choices. Deliberation over what is good goes with the existential territory, even for the virtuous. Particularly in his earlier works devoted to spiritual doctrine, therefore, Maximus affirms a beneficial deployment of gnomic desire and will,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0953946813484409">69</xref></sup> and in these works credits Jesus himself with having perfected the gnomic mode during his earthly ministry (something he famously retracted in his later christological writings).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0953946813484409">70</xref></sup> How could Jesus model virtue unless he fully appropriated the human conditions for its realization? One lucid example is the gnomic mode of the emotion of fear, technically defined as the desiring faculty anticipating an apparent danger or shame.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0953946813484409">71</xref></sup> Jesus rescued this emotion in its gnomic mode from degenerating purely into a function of self-interest and, in his Passion, converted it into a ‘voluntary’ fear ready to face death with resolve, this because he commanded his fear with a ‘philanthropic disposition’ (φιλανθρώπῳ διαθέσει).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0953946813484409">72</xref></sup> In the utter ‘passivity’ of his suffering servanthood (Phil. 2:7) he exercised an ‘active disposition’ (ἐνεργὴς διάθεσις) enabling him to rule the carnal passions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0953946813484409">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>In view of Jesus’ perfect reorientation of gnomic desire and will, Maximus envisions the possibility for a broad array of human emotions to be enlisted in service of virtue. If emotions are embodied expressions of natural passible faculties, albeit deviated into a gnomic mode, they can still be ‘used’ well, or more specifically, redirected to aid <italic>natural</italic> desire and will in pursuing salutary ends. Referencing the four cardinal passions from Stoic tradition, Maximus writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The passions…become good in those who are spiritually earnest once they have wisely separated them from corporeal objects and used them to gain possession of heavenly things. For instance, they can turn <italic>desire</italic> (ἐπιθυµία) into the appetitive movement of the mind’s longing for divine things, or <italic>pleasure</italic> (ἡδονή) into the unadulterated joy of the mind when enticed toward divine gifts, or <italic>fear</italic> (φόβος) into cautious concern for imminent punishment for sins committed, or <italic>grief</italic> (λυπή) into corrective repentance of a present evil. In short, we can compare this with the wise physicians who remove the existing or festering infection of the body using the poisonous beast, the viper. The spiritually earnest use the passions to destroy a present or anticipated evil, and to embrace and hold to virtue and knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0953946813484409">74</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As the soul’s two passible drives are capable of producing manifold passions or emotional states, in which there is a psychological hierarchy of relations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0953946813484409">75</xref></sup> there are also multiple prospects for using these emotions virtuously or viciously, despite the vulnerability of human affections. Like the Cappadocians and Evagrius, for example, Maximus seizes on anger, the primary expression of the incensive faculty (θυµός), as useful for galvanizing moral resolve and for fervency in clinging to good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0953946813484409">76</xref></sup> He gives more attention, however, to the desiring faculty (ἐπιθυµία; τὸ ἐπιθυµητικόν), since the diverse aspects of desire profoundly condition the manifestation of love, the beginning and end of all the virtues, which cuts across all of the levels of the soul and of the soul–body relationship, healing and reintegrating all the faculties in the pursuit of virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0953946813484409">77</xref></sup> Maximus thoroughly interweaves the erotic and agapeistic dimensions of love, often treating them as inextricable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0953946813484409">78</xref></sup> Not only <italic>erôs</italic> but even <italic>agapê</italic> he calls a ‘blessed <italic>passion</italic>’ (τὸ µακάριον πάθος) indispensable to deification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0953946813484409">79</xref></sup> <italic>Erôs</italic> is not a purely acquisitive appetite for the ultimate satisfaction of the soul’s aspiration. It has a providential purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0953946813484409">80</xref></sup> It names the soul’s deep longing for transcendence and ecstasy, yes, but not apart from the refiner’s fire of ascetical training, through which human desire is tested and rarefied. ‘Passionate communion’ (ἐρωτικὴ σύγκρασις) with God also presupposes a <italic>lateral</italic> communion, an ‘infallible pleasure (ἀδιάπτωτος ἡδονή) and indivisible union’, among all those who share this ‘erotic’ grace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0953946813484409">81</xref></sup> In one of the scholia on Dionysius ascribed to Maximus, he even speaks of the cosmic character of this erotic communion, the <italic>erôs</italic> that passes from God, to the angels, to Christians, and even to irrational and inanimate creatures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0953946813484409">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>For Maximus, numerous passions or emotions can become virtues through good use, and edify and enrich the outworking of love as the archetypal virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0953946813484409">83</xref></sup> Some of these are considered only marginally or provisionally virtuous in Greco-Roman moral philosophy. Hope, for instance, was for Stoics a throwaway emotion useful only to philosophical novices,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0953946813484409">84</xref></sup> whereas Maximus cherished it as vital along with the other ‘theological’ virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0953946813484409">85</xref></sup> Grief (λυπή), a shattering emotion for Stoics that demanded precise methods of modulation (µετριοπάθεια), was claimed by Maximus, like other ascetics of his time, as transmutable into godly sorrow for sin, a <italic>sine qua non</italic> of repentance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0953946813484409">86</xref></sup> Mercy (ἔλεος), which endured in pagan tradition as occasionally meritorious but never intrinsically virtuous, and which Stoics criticized because we customarily pity persons for misfortunes outside their control that have no moral consequence, took on a whole new life in patristic ethics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0953946813484409">87</xref></sup> Gregory Nazianzen, one of Maximus’s theological heroes, called mercy, especially deep compassion (εỦσπλαγχνία) for the poor, the supreme manifestation of <italic>agapê</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0953946813484409">88</xref></sup> Maximus amplifies the properly empathetic dimension of this mercy, calling it ‘voluntary self-identification’ (ἐκούσιος συνδιάθησις) with another who suffers, and treating it as a consummately deifying virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0953946813484409">89</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Formation of Virtue within Christian (and Human) Community</title>
<p>The reorientation of human desire and free will requisite for the formation of Christian virtue is unimaginable for Maximus apart from imitation, accountability, compassion, and traditioned moral wisdom within communities, monastic and ecclesial. His asceticism presupposes the Eastern desert tradition, where the wisdom of the elders was passed on, through aphorisms and object lessons, to monastic disciples held in rigorous account for their every thought and action. Maximus’s <italic>Liber Asceticus</italic> (<italic>Exposition of the Ascetic Life</italic>), a work fashioned in the genre of monastic ‘conferences’ elsewhere exemplified in the <italic>Apophthegmata patrum</italic> and the <italic>Collationes</italic> of John Cassian, sets forth the instructions of an elder sage in dialogue with a younger disciple. Lying behind this genre, the rich young ruler’s paradigmatic question to Jesus (Matt. 19:16-22 and par.) was often rephrased by monks in the <italic>Apophthegmata</italic> as ‘What must I do to be saved?’—echoing the axiom that monastic <italic>philosophia</italic> was a royal road to salvation, not just virtuosity. Maximus’s monastic disciple opens the dialogue of the <italic>Liber Asceticus</italic>, ‘I beseech you, father, what was the purpose (σκοπός) of the Lord’s incarnation?’—followed by ‘What commandments ought I to perform, that I may be saved?’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0953946813484409">90</xref></sup> The abba’s subsequent instruction frames the life of monastic virtue in terms of the imitation of Christ, a well-worn theme in patristic ethics to which Maximus adds his ‘realist’ mysticism, his conviction that Christ the Logos not only sanctions and models the virtues but also ‘incarnates’ himself in the <italic>logoi</italic> of the commandments to virtue.</p>
<p>Maximus takes for granted that the imitation of Christ plays out, communally, in obedience to the abbot, or, in the ecclesial context, to the bishop, as well as in the emulation of biblical saints and martyrs. But first there is the much larger, <italic>macrocosmic</italic> perspective. Indeed, the whole of creation is pre-designed to be a matrix of assimilation to the Trinity. Maximus thoroughly embraces Dionysius the Areopagite’s vision of the world (and of the ‘cosmos’ mirrored in biblical revelation) as a grand theatre of cosmic mimesis, in which lower creatures imitate the virtues of higher creatures (including angels and heavenly beings) by a graceful, proportional, and worshipful hierarchy encompassing sensible and intelligible creation alike.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0953946813484409">91</xref></sup> At this macrocosmic level, Maximus imagines all creatures, in their diverse levels and stations, to be summoned to the imitation of God’s virtues and to the ‘surrender’ (ἐκχώρησις) of their personal, gnomic will to the work of God within and among them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0953946813484409">92</xref></sup> Love—the ‘cosmic virtue’—descending into its multiple forms and converting the fragmented, individuated wills of all creatures, brings about the universal transformation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0953946813484409">93</xref></sup> In his encomium on love, Maximus writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>For nothing is more truly Godlike than divine love, nothing more mysterious, nothing more apt to raise human beings up to deification. For it has gathered together in itself all good things that are recounted by the <italic>logos</italic> of truth in the form of virtue, and it has absolutely no relation to anything that has the form of wickedness, since it is the fulfillment of the law and prophets. For they were succeeded by the mystery of love, which out of human beings makes us gods, and reduces the individual commandments to a universal meaning (<italic>logos</italic>). Everything is circumscribed by love according to God’s good pleasure in a single form, and love is dispensed in many forms in accordance with God’s economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0953946813484409">94</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The immediate focus of Maximus’s teaching on love and the formation of virtue, however, is their cultivation within the <italic>microcosm</italic> of the human person and human community, be it the monastery, the church, or social interactions beyond sacred precincts. The internal integrity of the human microcosm is altogether bound up with the state of one’s relationships. Nowhere is this more evident than in Maximus’s treatment of <italic>apatheia</italic> (ἀπάθεια), ‘dispassion’, which he knew from Evagrius and others to be the consummate ascetical virtue of rising above the fray of passions. Maximus envisions <italic>apatheia</italic> more robustly and positively as a virtue of the well-ordered soul that has used the passions to good purpose and fixed the heart’s desire on the love of God and neighbor. <italic>Apatheia</italic> is not, then, just a state of serenity or detachment at the end of ascetical combat but the very condition out of which virtue and love arise and thrive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0953946813484409">95</xref></sup> Indeed, it is not a personal achievement but a grace operative in the synthesis of individual ascetical discipline and social intercourse.</p>
<p>Within the intimacy of Christian friendship, one’s virtues are more immediately in evidence and more rapidly brought to fruition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0953946813484409">96</xref></sup> The real test of the integrity of love and virtue is the struggle—probably the most salient in Maximus’s entire ethics—to overcome illicit self-love,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0953946813484409">97</xref></sup> and to love all persons equally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0953946813484409">98</xref></sup> The struggle is heightened if we recall that love subsumes the other virtues as well, and, in the context of any one relationship, bears the weight of <italic>cosmic</italic> reconciliation. Equal love is first and foremost an imitation of God’s own indiscriminate and philanthropic love,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0953946813484409">99</xref></sup> but it is also the key agent for healing the displaced desires and fragmented inclinations (γνωµαί) that alienate creatures from one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0953946813484409">100</xref></sup> Love’s scope is not only moral but also ontological, since it works under divine providence to assuage the bodily as well as existential inequalities among human beings, and to recover their natural equality and kinship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0953946813484409">101</xref></sup> This is how Maximus understands the apostle Paul’s admonition in 2 Cor. 8:14 for Christians to fill up others’ deficiencies with their own abundances. Such cannot be exclusively a matter of almsgiving or eleemosynary acts; it requires the full panoply of virtues arising from prudent, well-ordered, and compassionately disposed selves.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Concluding my attempt to abstract a ‘theory’ of virtue ethics from Maximus the Confessor, let me return to Rosiland Hursthouse’s deduction from Aristotle and other classical thinkers that ‘to possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset’. Any virtue entails a constellation of perceptions, desires, aversions, dispositions, emotional impulses, expectations, and so on aligned toward morally appropriate ends. Though Maximus draws broadly and often unsystematically from the philosophical traditions, he too understands virtue to be a complex construction, a configuration of intellectual insight, healthy interplay of the soul’s faculties, divinely redirected desire, emotional stability, alliance of soul and body—all of which are deepened and sharpened by sheer moral experience (πεῖρα). For Maximus’s moral subject, however, this configuration is couched within the larger economy that enfolds both the prelapsarian and postlapsarian—or ‘natural’ and ‘gnomic’—dimensions of the moral self. The ultimate horizon of Christian virtue, moreover, is defined once for all in the new ‘theandric’ mode of human existence inaugurated by Jesus Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0953946813484409">102</xref></sup> His incarnation both brings to fruition the latent moral resources of human nature and radically liberates passible human beings to cultivate love and all the virtues, and to the perfection of passibility itself. One is passively ‘seized by God’, says Maximus, precisely to the extent that one actively manifests God by performing the virtues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0953946813484409">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>Distinctive also in the Confessor’s virtue ethics is his customary juxtapositioning of the universal and the particular, the macrocosm and the microcosm, in the outworking of the triune God’s creative and redemptive economy. The larger, cosmic dimension of reconciliation and redemption, embracing the whole hierarchy of creation, constantly weighs upon the ‘local’ manifestation of love and the virtues—whether in the deserts, the monasteries, the churches, the networks of Christian friendship, even individual human relationships. But the converse is true as well. In view of the historical particularity of Jesus of Nazareth, there is also a privileging of the perspective of the instantiations of the virtues ‘from below’, since these are the concrete means of healing and transforming creation patiently and incrementally. Maximus indicates that each individual embodiment of virtue is tributary to a comprehensive, indivisible unity of divine wisdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0953946813484409">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all of this, the true center of gravity is the ‘mystery of love’, which situates all the salutary expressions of human love and virtue in the context of the revelation and embodiment of God’s own <italic>philanthropia</italic>. In this mystery, divine kenosis and human ascent in deification intersect and mirror each other. Furthermore—and here is truly a centerpiece of Maximus’s virtue ethics—Christ the Logos condescends to dwell in the virtues of the virtuous, availing himself personally and intimately to those drawn to him by reason, desire, fervency, and the full array of psychic and somatic faculties. Few would want to dispute that this mystery of love is, in the long run, Maximus’s signature legacy in Eastern Orthodox ethics.</p>
