<abstract>
<p>In his comment on Bleicher (2013) Magny presents a revised version of his score method and reaffirms that it can prove a possible influence of solar activity on Central European lake levels. He also stresses the diagnostic value of archaeological lake site settlements. This paper points at methodological problems that are not yet resolved in the revised version. Since there is great consensus that not only is the the Sun a primary forcing factor in the climate’s system, but also that its effect cannot be expected to be linear for all of the Holocene, the use of the score record is questioned. The proposed relation between archaeological lake site settlements and solar activity is shown to be doubtful.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In his comment on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483629">Bleicher (2013)</xref>, because the critique was based on the interpretation of the low lake-level data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny (2013)</xref> explains his methods and presents calculations on the basis of high lake-level data to support his earlier results. The high lake-level data are thought to be more precise and therefore more representative for the Holocene even though they are less abundant. Furthermore, he points out that the identification of water-table phases had been achieved before the score method had originally been adopted.</p>
<p>As a reaction on the critique of the score method he presents a revised version that primarily consists of a reduction of information by dropping the differentiation between 1- and 2-sigma ranges and tree-ring dates (2, 1, and 3 points, respectively, to 1 point for all categories). This method is meant to give more robust results, avoiding the imitation of the calibration curve’s movements. The results closely resemble those of his earlier studies, supporting, in his view, the interpretation that the score records really reflect lake-level phases. He sees further proof for this in the prehistoric pile dwellings, whose presence and absence are seen as indicators of changing water-tables. Thus, he confirms that the lake-level phases are not methodological phantoms, but rather, robustly identified events, and, as shown by the similarity with the residual C<sup>14</sup> record, clearly climatically induced. He continues by reporting other such studies which came to the conclusion that solar activity has had an influence on the climate and which found a relation between climate and lake levels. The viability of the link between Sun and lakes seems to be reinforced by a comparison of the development of Holocene solar radiation as changed by orbital factors with trends in alpine treeline and the sedimentological record of Lake Cerin.</p>
<p>In his conclusions he denies that his method is a variant of a cumulative probability function (CPF). A mathematical test of his new method’s robustness is not presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0959683613483629" sec-type="methods">
<title>A critique of the new method</title>
<p>To evaluate the revised score record it is not necessary to calculate new null models. The logical problem can be made sufficiently clear by using his figure 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny, 2013</xref>: figure 3). There are four radiocarbon dates and the resulting score. The dates cover a timespan of 850 years. Strictly speaking, these data just say that within 850 years there have been four events of unknown duration. Given the 2-sigma ranges it is even possible that none of these were synchronous. The revised score values give, for each time window, the number of events that can possibly have happened synchronously. If we sum the score values in the histogram we get 30. But we are neither dealing with 30 events, nor can this sum value be explained by the durations of the events – because they have not been determined. So the important point to note is that the score histogram only evaluates dating ranges, i.e. possibilities (not probabilities in this new version). Consequently we are again confronted with the same question as before: are these dating ranges independent of solar activity? Of course they are not, as has been demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683613483629">Bamforth and Grund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483629">Bleicher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683613483629">Chiverell et al., 2011</xref>). It is not sufficient to claim that ‘a radiocarbon date mainly reflects the age of the dated event and its position in the Holocene, while the precision strongly depends on the position of the measured sample on the calibration curve’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny, 2013</xref>). In fact, the age determines the position on the calibration curve and the two cannot be separated! Accordingly we must conclude that if the dating ranges are heavily influenced by the calibration curve then this is also the case for the histogram of these.</p>
<p>So the new score histogram is possibly an improvement on the former version, because the reduction to exclusively 1-point scores tends less to obscure the number of events. Still, the heavy influence of the solar activity on the result via the calibration process provokes serious doubts as to whether the comparison with the very same proxy is viable.</p>
<p>Other points need to be raised: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny’s (2013)</xref> statement that there are no common features between a CPF and his score histograms lacks a justification. The author has tried to demonstrate the relatedness by parallel computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483629">Bleicher, 2013</xref>: figure 2).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny (2013)</xref> correctly points out that a phase of high water-tables can rather be seen as a phase of a higher frequency of raised water-level events. So it is correct to enter several dates from one lake. Still one should note that such situations will result in an aggregate record that is dominated by single lakes or small groups of lakes.</p>
<p>Comparing the single episodes (employing the term ‘episode’ here, although the temporal character of these is uncertain) it is not quite clear how many events it takes to classify as an episode. In the time between phase 13 and 14 we have the same score values (one to two) during a time of high solar activity as during phases 2, 4, 6, 7 or 10. We are furthermore not informed how many lakes’ records reach back into this time but show no high water-tables. Thus we cannot say how widespread the event may have been.</p>
<p>The long duration of phase 15 is caused by one radiocarbon date from Lake Zurich which has a dating range of nearly 1000 years. It is therefore not appropriate to attribute the event to phases of less duration. This is a related problem to the ‘segment length curse’ in dendroclimatology. The example of this radiocarbon date also demonstrates another drawback that remains in the new version: the imprecise date attributes about 20 score points to the record, while a precise dendro-date adds only one.</p>

<title>On the relation between climate, solar activity and lake levels</title>
<p>Magny is, of course, correct in stressing possible climatic influences on lake levels and the general influence of solar activity on climate. It was not the idea to completely deny a possible climatic influence on lake levels, but rather to question the use of an aggregate record given the vast differences in their individual hydrological systems. In order to not carry owls to Athens, the different possible non-climatic causes for lake-level variability need not be listed here by an archaeologist. This is not to say that there do not exist lakes whose water level is primarily climatically driven. But the score record, with its drawbacks, is no basis to argue that this holds true for many, or most, lakes in a larger region for many millennia. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683613483629">Magny’s (2013)</xref> list of other records that are probably related to solar activity could thus easily be longer but still misses the point. Of course the Sun is one of the main forcing factors of our climate’s system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613483629">Gray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683613483629">Wanner et al., 2008</xref>). However, given the complexity of this system the history of solar activity is not the same as climate history, as these authors clearly point out. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683613483629">Gray et al. (2010)</xref> explicitly mention that the link between precipitation (important for lake levels) and solar activity is less consistent than the one between solar irradiance and air temperature. The idea in comparing the radiocarbon dates of high- and low-level water-table events with selected climate proxies of independent chronologies was to show that there is rarely enough basis to assume that several lakes behaved contemporaneously in a similar way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683613483629">Bleicher, 2013</xref>) or are related to known climate events. When Magny uses, for example, one of the eight Central European cooling phases of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683613483629">Haas et al. (1998)</xref> to support the climatological significance of his phase 9, he does not mention that of these eight cooling phases only two correlate well with phases of low solar activity, while four happened during phases of higher solar radiation – the opposite to the point he is trying to prove.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0959683613483629">
<title>The significance of prehistoric lake site settlements</title>
<p>The relation of solar radiation to archaeological settlements on the lake shores is also unclear. If we compare the tiny lakes of Upper Swabia with the larger Lakes Constance, Zürich and Neuchâtel, we find roughly the same phases of lake shore occupation. But Lake Federsee is only a few meters deep and has no relation to glacial meltwater from the Alps. In fact, it does not even have an outflow. In comparison, Lake Zürich shows a very different situation with its complicated history of two rivers – the Sihl and Limmat – of which the Sihl sometimes flowed into the lake and sometimes not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683613483629">Schindler, 1981</xref>), while the Limmat was a constant outflow with a fixed lower limit because of a rock barrier. It is furthermore 136 m deep and heavily influenced by meltwater from the Alps. So if we observe similar patterns in human behavior at both lakes, then this rather indicates that the reason was cultural and not climatic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683613483629">Suter et al. (2005)</xref> also argued that solar activity determined the presence of human settlements on the lake shores by comparing dendrochronologically dated prehistoric villages with the beryllium<sup>10</sup> record from the GISP 2 ice core. A closer examination reveals that this relation is disputable since the authors stretch and squeeze the time axis of the beryllium’s record in order to produce synchronicity and avoid contradictory results. The flexibility (or uncertainty) that would be necessary in the beryllium record’s chronology to establish the proposed synchronicity is actually not given (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683613483629">Southon, 2002</xref>) and several settlement-peaks are out of phase compared with the Be<sup>10</sup> record. So the hypothesis that the prehistoric pile dwellings are determined by lake-level changes caused by solar activity leads us into the logical trap that the Sun would have followed human behavior and not vice versa.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>No-one would deny today that the Sun has an influence on climate. Nor is it questionable that climate can influence lake levels. But there is little evidence that the relation between solar activity and Central European lake levels as a whole was stable and linear. Magny himself has convincingly pointed to more complicated relations and causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683613483629">Magny and Bégeot, 2004</xref>, 2013). The critical point is that the aggregation of all lake-level radiocarbon data from very different lakes into one record is not helpful because it must overestimate the linear effect of the Sun and generalize the result.</p>
<p>It is not quite understandable why Magny focuses so much on the score record as a tool. With his full sedimentological records he surely has data that give better indications of the character and duration of events and can provide more convincing evidence of parallel developments in groups of lakes.</p>
