<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777k"><title>Paul Betts, <italic>Within Walls – Private Life In The German Democratic Republic,</italic> Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010; 336 pp.; £39.00 hbk; ISBN 9780199208845</title>
<p>East German Socialism was predicated on the ideal of human transformation, whereby each individual would turn to socialism, with society becoming a collectivity of socialist human beings. In its ideal type, such a society would know no distinction between the public and the private; individual ownership would be minimized, and disparities of wealth would barely exist. Common access to culture, education and the means of production would ensure equal welfare to all who participated in the socialist transformation of the state. Despite this utopian vision, the private acquired remarkable significance in socialist Germany, as Paul Betts shows in his latest, outstanding book. The prominence of consumer goods, of private dachas, and of individual family celebrations demonstrates that although the experience of the private sphere changed under socialism, it continued to resonate in the realities of GDR life.</p>
<p>Rather than analyzing well-trodden aspects of GDR popular culture, Betts explores life spheres that were critical to private life, but which have thus far barely been evaluated. Examining the transformation of the Protestant Church, for instance, Betts notes that declining rates of baptism, confirmation and churchgoing led to a privatization of religious life. This allowed the Church to acquire particular significance in everyday life. While it continued to play a role as a large welfare provider, landowner and supporter of minorities, the Church also provided cherished space for private spheres outside the scrutiny of the party.</p>
<p>An examination of divorce court proceedings provides a further perspective on the changing meanings of the private over the four decades of the GDR’s existence. In the 1950s and especially the 1960s the protection of the family was considered a public, socialist good, which could be endangered by individual shortcomings. The state had a duty to help the parties involved in divorce proceedings to overcome their failures as much as possible, and so it took great interest in affecting the private behaviour of individuals. From the 1970s this changed. Court files became less detailed, and arguments that posited a lack of individual private fulfilment more common as a basis for divorce. In short, the state came to recognize a private right to individual fulfilment, with the court sanctioning expectations of sexual liberation, private pleasure, and the overcoming of patriarchal social attitudes.</p>
<p>The growing focus on the private gave rise to individualized decorations of standardized pre-fabricated flats, and a growing attention to – and fetishization of – Western goods. Significantly, Betts notes that this does not mean that the party relinquished its socialist aspirations; however, it was forced to respond to these changes in individual tastes. Thus the private sphere came to constitute a central realm within which the accommodation between the party’s aspirations and the citizens’ desires took place.</p>
<p><italic>Within Walls</italic> is remarkable in a number or respects. In opening up a different perspective on culture and society in the GDR, Betts provides a new account of the relationship between citizens, state and party. In doing so, he offers insight into how that relationship changed. In concrete terms, we obtain a fresh understanding of how individuals adapted to, contested with, and changed in the face of socialism over 40 years. And we also see how the party changed in turn. This may not sound spectacular in principle, but Betts’ chapters on the family courts and the disputes commissions, for instance, provide a completely new account of the ways in which citizens used the means of socialism to negotiate individual concerns with each other, and in relation to socialism. Moreover, the book charts in new ways the trajectory of socialism. Betts belies what has become almost a standard narrative of a relatively straightforward decline of socialist values from the 1970s. Instead, he demonstrates the efficacy of many socialist institutions at resolving social conflicts and guaranteeing personal claims and desires, even if this meant an acceptance in practice that individuals were not perfectable socialist human beings.</p>
<p><italic>Within Walls</italic> considers the private sphere as ‘a social claim and political assertion’ (222). This allows for a more sophisticated consideration of Albert Hirschmann’s ‘Exit’ and ‘Voice’ paradigm; for in showing how the private became an intensely politicized sphere of accommodation and negotiation between party and society, we are sensitized to the many subtle ways in which GDR citizens could use their ‘voice’ throughout the GDR’s existence. To be sure, this was not quite the ‘voice’ that Hirschmann had in mind in relation to political participation. Still, the ways in which individuals could learn to express their selves in myriad ways suggests that GDR culture and the party were more dynamic than has often been portrayed. And this goes a long way to explaining the longevity of the GDR, and its relative stability.</p>
<p>Betts provides not just a thought-provoking account of the nature of GDR society through the interaction between socialism and the private sphere; he also helps us understand better the nature of the GDR’s collapse, and the continued significance of the GDR’s semi-private social world. After 1989, this took on a new form as the ‘relationship between people and things’ (230), manifesting itself through informal networks, cultural artefacts and subcultures that became a focal point of ‘Eastalgia’, an idealized longing for life in East Germany. In this way, the private sphere continued to be a critical ground in which East Germans appropriated, adopted and contested the politics, society and culture within which they moved. Paul Betts has written a book that is central to a new understanding of the GDR, providing a sophisticated perspective on why the unloved state lasted for as long as it did, as well as why the state ended ‘in a whimper’ (238) when its time had come.</p>
