<abstract>
<p>Playing Orff instruments provides students with a wide variety of opportunities to explore creative musicianship. This article examines the benefits of classroom instrument study, common challenges encountered, and viable teaching strategies to promote student success. The ability to remove notes from barred instruments makes note accuracy more accessible, freeing students to focus on more sophisticated musical elements related to balance, blend, and dynamics. In addition, many Orff arrangements are easy to learn because of the common use of simple ostinato figures and limited harmonic structures. Although these patterns may be simple to grasp, they can be difficult to perform with rhythmic control. Students often rush the beat, causing faulty precision within the ensemble. Within a few measures, ensemble unity can be lost. Teaching solutions offered in this article focus on strategies related to technique development, efficient diagnosis, and effective modeling.</p>

<body>
<p>Almost every semester for the past 7 years, I’ve taught an undergraduate course entitled, “Techniques of Classroom Instruments.” In this class, we spend a lot of time examining successful teaching techniques in an Orff setting. A variety of peer teaching experiences often precede a videotaped lesson taught to elementary students in nearby public schools. When students return to campus to reflect on their experiences, they frequently exclaim, “You were right! Teaching this stuff to kids is much more challenging than I thought!” They soon discover that when teaching a song, if one or two children have pitch issues, the rest of the class can usually progress without too much distraction. But when teaching an Orff arrangement, if one student begins to rush a xylophone part, the entire ensemble can easily fall apart. Fortunately, after discussing various strategies to improve the lesson, my students have the opportunity to go back to the schools and teach the same lesson to a different class. Not only do their lessons run more smoothly, but their appreciation for the teaching process is also much deeper.</p>
<p>The difficulties preservice teachers experience cannot be blamed solely on inexperience. In a study examining the teaching practices of recognized Orff Schulwerk teachers, analysis showed that even the “best of the best” sometimes struggle to get students to play together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1048371311414879">Taylor, 2006</xref>). Yet the advantages of facing these challenges are worth the effort expended.</p>
<p>Research shows that students usually enjoy playing classroom instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311414879">Boswell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311414879">Bowles, 1998</xref>), which may serve as motivation for continued learning. Although children often enjoy singing in kindergarten and first grade, they may sometimes be more reticent and self-conscious about singing as they grow older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311414879">Blyler, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311414879">Bowles, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1048371311414879">Mizener, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1048371311414879">Phillips &amp; Aitchison, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1048371311414879">Siebenaler, 1999</xref>). This is not to say that teachers should abandon singing because some students may be uncomfortable with the process. To the contrary, teachers can use instrumental study as a contingency to encourage and reinforce good singing. In addition, Orff instruments can be used to help children explore other National Standards, including improvisation, composition, listening, and analysis.</p>
<p>Many aspects of Orff instruments and accompanying activities lend themselves to student success. The ability to remove bars from xylophones, metallophones, and glockenspiels allows students to focus on a variety of musical issues without having to worry about note accuracy. Likewise, many Orff arrangements are based on short ostinato figures that are easy to learn and memorize. Correspondingly, harmonic patterns are frequently confined to simple structures that are developmentally appropriate for students’ current skills. As students progress, proficiencies related to rhythmic precision, balance, and blend can be refined to foster sophisticated listening and motor skills that may serve them well for years to come.</p>
<p>Conversely, Orff instruments present some unique challenges. Xylophones and many nonpitched percussion instruments’ sounds are characterized by strong attacks followed by limited resonance. If students do not synchronize initial attacks, limited reverberation will fail to mask the initial imprecision. Furthermore, unlike singers and wind players, the breath does not usually serve as a unifying device to help coordinate entrances.</p>
<p>Consider also that although simple, repetitive ostinati are often easy to learn, playing one figure repeatedly can be a mind-numbing task, making it especially difficult to concentrate on rhythmic control. When concentration wanes, rhythmic precision often suffers. As many have discovered, students typically want to rush the underlying beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371311414879">Drake, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371311414879">Ellis, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1048371311414879">Gordon &amp; Martin, 1993</xref>-1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1048371311414879">Kuhn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1048371311414879">Kuhn &amp; Gates, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1048371311414879">Rohwer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1048371311414879">Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1048371311414879">Thackray, 1972</xref>). Complicating matters further, research has shown that people have difficulty perceiving rushing during performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371311414879">Madsen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1048371311414879">Miller &amp; Eargle, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1048371311414879">Wang, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1048371311414879">Wang &amp; Salzberg, 1984</xref>). Students may not even be aware of the problem that eventually serves to undermine ensemble unity. The urge to rush may be related to a sense of personal tempo that can approach 100 beats per minute or faster among elementary students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371311414879">Frego, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1048371311414879">Walters, 1983</xref>). Playing slower sometimes goes against basic instincts. Tempo accuracy becomes even more challenging when teachers ask students to play at rates faster or slower than the original tempo learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371311414879">Duke &amp; Pierce, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1048371311414879">Pierce, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1048371311414879">Rohwer, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As with any skill, the benefits of learning often outweigh accompanying challenges. Rewards incurred from steadfast study can include heightened listening, independence, and improved concentration. Achieving these goals requires time, commitment, and diligence. Unfortunately, many elementary music teachers have very limited time with their students. Some see their students twice weekly, whereas many others see their students once or less per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1048371311414879">U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2002</xref>). Because of these time limitations, teachers need to use effective instructional strategies as efficiently as possible. Skilled teachers know that working hard and working efficiently are not always synonymous. If students are struggling, instructors may need to alter pedagogical strategies to help facilitate improvement. Several strategies to consider are listed here.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311414879">
<title>Effective Instructional Strategies</title>
<list id="list1-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Consider implementing a short warm-up routine to help develop technique.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Orff instruments are not difficult to play; however, they do require motor skill development that may be unique compared with other activities encountered in students’ daily lives. Many secondary ensemble directors begin rehearsals with regular warm-ups designed to help students nurture fundamental technique. Elementary students playing Orff instruments might also benefit from warm-up exercises designed to help develop mallet technique. Playing barred instruments requires proper posture, hand position, and execution. Whereas bouncing off the middle of a bar might be easy for some students, this skill can be challenging for others—especially young boys whose motor skills may lag behind their female peers. Improvisatory warm-up activities based on pentatonic scales could allow students the freedom to concentrate on physical technique without having to worry about “playing the right notes.” Later in the rehearsal, when particular notes and rhythms are required, students may be less distracted with issues related to technique and better able to concentrate on other musical demands.</p>
<list id="list2-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Choose music carefully that matches students’ technical capabilities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Just as with secondary bands, choirs, and orchestras, some Orff arrangements may simply be beyond the scope of students’ technical facility at the present time. Elementary students often have limited experience with anything other than unison singing until they reach music teachers’ classrooms. If singing a simple round in two parts challenges some students, playing Orff arrangements in multiple parts (many containing five or more independent lines) could be especially daunting. Repertoire matching students’ current capabilities provides more opportunities for learning and expression than music requiring advanced skills beyond their means. That is not to say that teachers should “take the easy way out.” If the repertoire is too easy, students will become bored and lose interest. If it is too difficult, they will become frustrated and want to quit. Yet if the music provides interesting challenges that allow for reasonable skill development, students may more readily experience feelings of satisfaction and accomplishment. Of course, finding materials perfectly suited to each class could be very challenging. With this in mind, teachers could simplify parts to accommodate students’ current abilities. Likewise, instructors could even write their own pieces or arrangements. Orff Schulwerk certification courses typically provide excellent instruction to help facilitate this process.</p>
<list id="list3-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Use specific feedback consistently to identify performance problems.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Any arrangement that contains appropriate challenges will probably be met with some student errors. Typical problems often include rushing the pulse and resulting precision errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1048371311414879">Taylor, 2006</xref>). Teachers should not assume that students will be aware of their errors. As obvious as performance problems may seem, students may be so engrossed in their own individual part that they are unaware of what is happening around them. For this reason, teachers need to give students succinct, specific feedback about their performance each time they play. General feedback in the form of “That’s wrong,” is virtually useless. “You’re rushing on beats 3 and 4,” is specific and gets right to the heart of the problem. Likewise, specific praise is much more effective than general praise. Using students’ names makes it even more powerful. “Anna, excellent steady pulse!” is much more effective than “Good job!”</p>
<list id="list4-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Follow specific feedback with specific directives that provide viable solutions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Just because students know what the problem is does not mean that they know how to make improvements. Teachers who grew up with natural musical abilities may assume that everyone can figure out what needs to be done once a problem has been identified, but that is not always the case. For instance, after feedback, students may know that they need to stop rushing, but they may not know what to do to make that happen. A variety of physical factors may be contributing to this problem. Some children may need to lower their shoulders and physically relax. Others may need to play softer to reduce tension and anxiety that lead to rushing. Still others may not be set in a ready playing position, causing them to come in late on the first note and accelerate other notes in their hurriedness. Many other issues that are unique to particular students could be the culprit. Teachers must use visual as well as aural cues to diagnose students’ performance issues. Instructors may even want to think of themselves as “musical physicians” who provide “musical prescriptions” for success. Doctors who assume patients know how to treat their own ailments would be virtually useless. Imagine the following scenario:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Doctor:</speaker>
<p>You’re sick! Get better!</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Patient:</speaker>
<p>What should I do to get better?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Doctor:</speaker>
<p>Well, I told you what’s wrong! Isn’t it obvious?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Patient:</speaker>
<p>No, it’s not.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Doctor:</speaker>
<p>Well, just figure it out!</p>
</speech>
<p>As ludicrous as this scenario would be, even experienced teachers sometimes make similar assumptions. Prescribed treatment must be given after diagnosis.</p>
<list id="list5-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Demonstrate what you want to hear as well as what you do not want to hear.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once treatment has been diagnosed, teachers need to model how it should be administered through demonstration. Returning to the medical analogy, when patients go to the pharmacy for medication, the bottle almost always tells them how many pills to take, how many times a day to take them, and whether or not to ingest medication with or without food. If the treatment is more complicated (e.g., injections, etc.), a nurse will often show the patient how to administer the dosage. Similarly, teachers need to show students how to perform tasks differently. Frequent positive examples can be extremely powerful. In addition, used judiciously, educators can occasionally contrast what they do not want (negative modeling) with examples of what they do want (positive modeling). This is a luxury medical professionals do not often have. A nurse demonstrating proper injections would be unwise to inject air into a vein to show the deleterious effects of such administration. Someone could die. Yet music teachers can show students how increased physical tension might lead to rushing without any fatalities. Importantly, such a demonstration needs to be followed with positive examples of relaxed playing that culminates in a steady rhythmic pulse. Of course, when implementing negative modeling, teachers need to choose their examples wisely. For instance, a demonstration of rushing might help clarify how easily pulse can vary; whereas, demonstrating destructive manners of playing (e.g., striking a drum too hard, etc.) could simply give students tempting ideas they had not yet considered! Positive modeling should exceed negative modeling, but occasional contrasts may help “drive home” the point the teacher is trying to make. In general, it is not enough to show students what is wrong: they need to see and hear good examples of proper performance.</p>
<list id="list6-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Focus on musical directives, rather than procedural matters.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Because Orff instruction often incorporates rote learning and memorization of layered ostinati, it is very easy for teachers to focus on procedural instructions about who plays which part and when, rather than more important musical directives. Correct notes and rhythms, although important, do not result in a musical product. Should the passage be played softer? Louder? Slower? Faster? More crescendo? Students need teachers to verbalize these musical goals. Repetition without specific instruction not only reinforces current playing inaccuracies but generally wastes time. Even when repeating a passage to solidify an improvement, students need to know why they are repeating the passage. A simple phrase such as, “Let’s see if we can maintain our steady tempo three more times, even if we change the dynamics,” can provide needed focus to maintain concentration during positive practice. In this way, students always know what to focus on to make improvements or reinforce successful playing.</p>
<list id="list7-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Shorten student performance episodes to ensure success.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Good teachers are usually very skilled at providing carefully sequenced instruction designed to foster student success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371311414879">Duke, 2005</xref>). Research has shown that expert secondary teachers give students multiple opportunities to perform short passages of music successfully. On average, these passages last no longer than 10 to 15 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311414879">Cavitt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311414879">Derby, 2001</xref>). This concept is especially important in Orff settings. As simple as many repetitive ostinati can be to learn, maintaining concentration during these tasks can be incredibly challenging. When concentration wanes, tempos vary, and rhythmic precision becomes inaccurate. After a few measures, the entire ensemble falls apart because no one can stay together. Rather than waiting until everything falls apart, teachers need to engage students in short performance episodes that begin and end successfully. Once students maintain a steady tempo with synchronous precision for two measures, performance trials can be lengthened to reach the desired length. This strategy allows students to succeed more regularly in small steps which can build confidence and increase motivation.</p>
<list id="list8-1048371311414879" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Encourage students to listen to each other.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although Orff ostinati are often based on simple, repetitive patterns, they are also frequently layered in four or five parts, providing many students with their first experience performing independent parts as an ensemble. In an effort to play their parts independently, students may forget to listen to those around them—even classmates playing the same part. Because this experience may be novel, teachers may want to consider creating MIDI recordings of pieces that provide students opportunities to hear how all the parts should blend together. Of course, these recordings should not be used as a “play-along” crutch, but instead could serve as useful models.</p>
<p>Student learning may be enhanced further by allowing children to verbalize what they admire in the examples they hear. Likewise, analyzing and discussing their own playing could be empowering. Taping students during rehearsal might be highly effective if they are given opportunities to reflect on positive and negative aspects in their own performance. Continuing in this vein, students could also be encouraged to consider solutions to the problems they identify, thereby encouraging higher order thinking skills that may lead to deeper understanding. When students are given a more active role in the learning process, understanding may become more personal and meaningful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1048371311414879">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In short, playing Orff instruments is not as easy as it looks, but the rewards can be immense. To promote continued enthusiasm, teachers must work hard to ensure student success at each stage of their musical development. Rather than functioning as a passing novelty easily dismissed after initial exploration, instrumental study can be a venue for developing refined elements of musicianship. The strategies suggested in this article can actually be used in a variety of teaching settings, with or without instruments. Regardless of the setting, process and product do not have to be mutually exclusive categories. Each day’s activities can result in beautiful, aesthetically pleasing sounds if teachers structure tasks effectively. In the process, the journey toward musical excellence can be immensely gratifying.</p>
