<p>From its opening words which claim that it has been written ‘in the belief that an important choice is offered to the Church of England: to embrace her historic mission to evangelize and serve the whole people of this country, or to decline into a sect’ <italic>For the Parish</italic> pulls no punches. Its authors set forth a devastating critique of the report <italic>Mission-shaped Church</italic> and the ‘Fresh expressions’ movement associated with it. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524611427359">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Davison and Milbank accuse the whole initiative of faulty methodology, an inadequate theology and a capitulation to market values. They hit out at what they perceive as ‘special interest groups’ that suggest the traditional ecclesiology of the Church of England has been abandoned and that there are profound implications here for both the Church’s self-understanding and our conception of salvation. These are serious charges and this is a serious book. The early chapters on form and content, mediation, questions of soteriology and ecclesiology are thorough and raise important theological questions that cannot be overlooked either by advocates of Fresh Expressions or the traditional parish model. The later chapters place a more practical emphasis on the presence of the Church in public spaces and offer a wide range of examples of parish life in its engagement with culture. Davison and Milbank regard the traditional parish model as offering a far grittier prophetic witness against the inadequacies of contemporary culture, especially consumerism.</p>
<p>The first chapter on ‘The union of form and content’ argues that form and content are more closely bound together than the Fresh Expressions literature supposes or is willing to admit. It draws upon Wittgenstein and his interpreter Fergus Kerr and goes on to criticise Fresh Expressions for ignoring post-liberal theology, represented by, among others, George Lindbeck. This is one of the most challenging chapters for the Fresh Expressions movement as it questions its very methodology and accuses it of assuming that Christianity is virtually culture-free (pp. 22ff).</p>
<p>Davison and Milbank argue that Mission-shaped Church endorses segregated communities and the idea of the ‘homogenous unit principle’ (chap. 4), a criticism that disturbs many who look on as single-interest communities are embraced as churches, whether a bread-making group, a bikers’ church or a Mums and toddlers’ meeting. Surely the Church is about communities that embrace all kinds of people who would not otherwise relate? That has been the great strength of the village church where the squire and the farmer kneel to receive communion at the altar rail together. The fact that Mission-shaped Church seeks to keep such groups related to the traditional Church as a ‘mixed-economy’ is down-played here in order to bring to the fore the questionable ecclesiology underlying homogenous groups. Further debate and theological work is clearly required in this area and this book ensures the urgency of the task. It is good to see such a rigorous defence of the inherited model of Church which is clearly not dead yet, and Davison and Milbank offer many examples of lively and life-giving Christian witness. One has to wonder, all the same, how far most of the population of Britain today would relate to what appears here as a fairly middle-class literate culture. It has a 1950s feel with its descriptions of Cowslip Sunday and candle-lit processions. That said, I wondered whether the desire to connect with our Anglican roots and concern to bring the sacred into the world and make it visible as expressed here is so far apart from what much of Fresh Expressions is about. Many are finding their way to faith and indeed into the Church because of their longing for roots, or for the sacred in what for many is a world experienced as disconnected and meaningless. It would seem that many Fresh Expressions focus on these very things and from experimenting with liturgical forms to new monasticism actually draw heavily on the inherited Christian faith. Thus Fresh Expressions can be a bridgehead as much as a barrier to people joining the mainstream Church.</p>
<p>In chapter 5 we are given a picture of Fresh Expressions that represents the triumph of the new over the established, novelty over stability, the chosen over the given, pastiche over authenticity, and the virtual (or general) over the actual (or particular). It is a damning portrait. The authors of <italic>For the Parish</italic> are highly critical of post-modernism and post-modernity which they claim is anathema to the Gospel. They recognise that Christians sell out all too easily to the consumer mentality around them and their call for the transformative power of the Gospel to shape the life of Christian discipleship is a wake-up call to us all. The whole question of discipleship is vital to the future of both the traditional Church of England and to the Fresh Expressions movement. Passionate about the parish, the writers claim that it is better at discipleship and argue strongly that we need its history, its tradition, its liturgy and its heterogeneous make-up for the purpose of Christian formation.</p>
<p>In chapter 6 we move away from a critique, towards a positive vision of mission that is based on their understanding and valuing of mediation, set out in an earlier chapter. Davison and Milbank talk about rebuilding a Christian imagery in the parish, about place, about our inheritance, about redeeming time and restoring memory. They write about the parish being where we begin to learn the grammar of the Christian life, about it being the nursery of heaven, the place of peaceable difference. They are surely right that it is by learning to be the people of God that we learn to put on the virtues through worshipping together. They are critical of the image adopted by ‘Fresh Expressions of ‘dying to live’, which they say implies a rejection of the traditional parish and a highroad to segregation. It is not clear, however, that this biblical principle of the Incarnation necessarily leads to separation. It is a missional principle that has always been taken seriously in the spreading of the kingdom. Clearly the writers of <italic>For the Parish</italic> have a very different approach to the nature of the relationship between Gospel and culture. Yet both are trying to engage with it in ways that connect and are in step with God’s purposes for the world.</p>
<p>For this reviewer, the important concerns of the book were constantly undermined by the unkind and discourteous tone of the writing, which thankfully has not been the general tone of the traditional parish the authors are so eager to promote. More serious is that some of the accusations aimed at ‘Fresh Expressions’ and <italic>Mission-shaped Church</italic> do not stand up to close scrutiny. The latter sought to base itself on clear theological foundations, but it was not intended to be a heavy-weight theological document. It seems unfair then to launch an attack in the style of a theological juggernaut.</p>
<p>The other noticeable feature of the book is how <italic>un-ecumenical</italic> it reads. It completely ignores other Christians, yet one thing that the decline of the Church in general has made clear is surely that we must embrace mission together and not in competition with each other. This at least has been the approach of many Fresh Expressions in situations where our divisions are meaningless at best and destructive at worst.</p>
<p>For this and for many other reasons, <italic>For the Parish</italic> will ensure that lively and rigorous discussion of these vital issues will continue.</p>
