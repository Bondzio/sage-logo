<abstract>
<p>The history of Pentecostalism is embodied in the lives and activities of individuals often marginalized by their societies. Particularly, women have often served as pioneers and catalysts for the growth of this religious movement. Despite their pivotal role and visible presence, Pentecostal women continue to be omitted in the history of Pentecostalism. The case study of Myrtle Viola Whitehead provides historical recovery of a female evangelist and church planter in early Pentecostalism. Reading her testimonies, ministerial records, and songs inspires a second look at the task of Pentecostal history.</p>

<p>Pentecostalism began its rapid progression and expansion in the United States during the first quarter of the twentieth century. People young and old, Hispanic, African American, and White, began leading this grassroots religious phenomenon. But who were these leaders? In the last 25 years, historians have composed thousands of pages tracking this movement and many histories have been written exposing the leadership of greats such as William Seymour, Charles Parham, C.H. Mason, and A.J. Tomlinson.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040573611424328">1</xref></sup> Yet in the effort to establish Pentecostalism in its proper place of recognition, I fear something tragic has indirectly happened. By hastily and uncritically borrowing traditional techniques of history in order to present respectable histories, historians have often overlooked many of the early leaders that made this movement an actuality. In these historical accounts, many of the foremost leaders have been forgotten, lost in the archives or not considered influential enough to be remembered. Probably the most common victims of these mistakes are women leaders. In this brief essay I will present the story of one of these forgotten women—Reverend Myrtle Viola Whitehead—as a case study of Pentecostal leadership and then employ her history as a constructive critique for the project of Pentecostal history.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0040573611424328"><title>Myrtle Whitehead: A Case Study of Pentecostal Leadership</title>
<p>On February 5, 1887,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040573611424328">2</xref></sup> Myrtle Whitehead’s life began in rural Franklin County, Georgia. Not much different than many other children born at the close of the nineteenth century, her birth took place at home and without fanfare. The second of six children born to John (J.W.) and Frances Lou Whitehead, Myrtle was remembered as a “black-headed, dark brown eyed girl.” Yet Myrtle’s childhood was short and toilsome. J.W.’s occupation of farming in the post-Reconstruction South wrought a difficult life that required the labor of his entire family. Economic hardship forced J.W. not only to farm but also to work sporadically at an ore mill in order to feed his family. Adding tension to the situation, Frances Lou was chronically ill throughout her life creating a vacuum of much needed maternal leadership and family structure. Myrtle, as the first of four daughters, was expected to leave school to cook and sew for the family when her mother’s illness often recurred. Though Whitehead longed for a formal education, her life “deprived [her] of many privileges” and education was unfortunately one of them. She would later, as an adult, attend a year of teacher certification courses in Bowman, Georgia, but honestly revealed in her ordination exams that she had not attained an “eighth grade” education. Yet she still was able to prove that she had “a fair education” through personal study and reading.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040573611424328">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many today would describe Myrtle’s family atmosphere as tough or harsh. But it is this family of trials and close-knit relationships to which Whitehead attributed her character. Despite many potential reasons for enmity and bitterness, Whitehead chose to allow her context to compel her. This compulsion was clearly voiced in her statement of thanksgiving for “being reared by good moral parents…the training they gave me will always be an inspiration to me.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040573611424328">4</xref></sup> Throughout her life, tragedy and hardship regularly appeared but she did not allow them to dampen her spirits. Instead, this difficult life of crises served as a catalyst for her intense relationship with God through dynamic encounters. Hardships not only chronologically framed her direction and ministerial calling, they also functioned as prompters to her praxis-oriented theology of testimony and experience.</p>
<p>Leadership was visible in Myrtle from a very early age. Cross Roads Baptist Church remembered her as the little girl who “stood on a stump and preached” in her backyard and how “it seemed God had a plan for…[her] life” even as a child. Myrtle’s church leadership was recorded as early as 1906 (ten years prior to her Pentecostal experience) when she played the organ, taught Sunday school, and served as an officer in the young women’s auxiliary and in the youth ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040573611424328">5</xref></sup> Like many early Pentecostals in the rural southeast United States, Myrtle received her Christian conversion experience during a Baptist revival before she was ever exposed to Pentecostalism or what she would later call the “new gospel.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040573611424328">6</xref></sup> Her reflections on adolescence depict a religious faith growing stagnate: “I began to get out and seek of worldly things and soon became cold in my [religious] experience.” Myrtle voiced her monotonous religious routine and longing for something more, later in life: “I just lived the best I could, working in Sunday school and different departments of the church…[yet I] did not know anything about a deeper experience.” Her movement away from this religious stagnation was further propelled by the tragic death of her nephew “little” Earl Whitehead in 1915. Through this tragic and unexplainable visit of the “death angel,” she found that she “was not ready to give up…there was a desire” in her and she felt compelled “to be a blessing to people.” In pursuit of this desire to serve God, Whitehead tried several roles that were available to her as a woman: nursing, sales work, and even teaching school. But as became characteristic of her life, sickness greatly affected Myrtle’s vocational trajectory. After a “serious operation,” Myrtle was forced to move home again and had to resign from her role as a teacher.</p>
<p>Around the same period, she began a courtship with William Bruce of Lavonia, Georgia, and soon was engaged to be married. In the middle of her preparation for the wedding and transition into married life, illness struck again, this time in William’s body. Myrtle received a letter from William just a few weeks before the wedding telling her to cancel the arrangements because he was seriously ill. By the time Myrtle arrived at his bedside, William was not conscious enough even to speak to Myrtle. Myrtle described this as “the saddest hour of my life.” Yet unknowingly, it was in this state of crisis that her personhood and leadership was primed for the place of its greatest potential fruition. In this time of crisis, Whitehead was introduced to Pentecostalism. Through a friendship with the Smith family, neighbors who had recently moved from South Carolina, and a tent revival led by Reverends “Capshaw” and “Stargel,” Whitehead was confronted with what these people called “the Church of God” and a “new gospel.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040573611424328">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Myrtle approached these tent revival services out of cautious curiosity, but soon was captivated. She “became hungry for that kind of religion” and found a felt, Divine response for her “thirst for a deeper experience.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040573611424328">8</xref></sup> In these tent services, she received two new “deeper experiences.” The first was sanctification on September 22, 1916. Sanctification took the form of Divine grace acting and empowering through the felt Holy Spirit, who empowered a turning from sin. Sanctified and fully invested, she even found herself preaching at the meeting on October 6, 1916. After the service, she stayed awake all night seeking with continual prayer until she received a second experience, baptism in the Holy Spirit, in which she spoke in tongues as the Holy Spirit gave the utterance, a sign that she was empowered and emboldened to witness for Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040573611424328">9</xref></sup> Local established Methodist and Baptist churches were not receptive to these new “deeper experiences” and the “new gospel.” Myrtle struggled to leave the fellowship of the Methodist and Baptist churches of her childhood because she could not deny her “deeper experiences.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040573611424328">10</xref></sup> When the tent meetings concluded after seven weeks, in spite of the reservations of the Whitehead family, Myrtle, along with six others, organized a new church in Hartwell, Georgia, devoted to this “new gospel” of sanctification and baptism in the Holy Spirit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040573611424328">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the death of her nephew and the loss of her teaching career, only to be followed by the death of her fiancé William, Myrtle’s affection and energy now revolved around this “new gospel.” It was in this state of crisis that this “new gospel” and “deeper experiences” empowered this seemingly average northeast Georgia woman to be a pioneer leader in what is recognized today as the fastest growing branch of Christianity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040573611424328">12</xref></sup> This new, passionate experience of God instilled within her “a burden for lost souls,” and she soon found herself co-leading in house meetings throughout northeast Georgia. Amidst Myrtle’s early evangelistic involvement, she felt a calling to ministry. As she later recounted, “one Thursday I walked the floor, cried, and prayed because of the burden of lost souls. I told my mother I must leave them and go tell the world about Jesus…the Lord called me that day to preach His word. I said ‘yes! Lord I’ll go.’” Though she had not attended high school, college, or seminary, she knew she was empowered and informed because of her “deeper experiences” of God and employed her gifts towards the spreading of this “new gospel” of Pentecostalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040573611424328">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of her family’s initial dismay towards joining this new “kind of religion,” she launched forward and began preaching with a “burden” that “the Gospel must be carried to all nations,” and with a willingness “to go anywhere Jesus sends me.” Preaching in haste, Whitehead’s evangelism took on a sense of urgency: “Seems like I can’t go fast enough to get the glad news…to the world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040573611424328">14</xref></sup> Whitehead soon discovered she was a gifted speaker whose sermons “brought conviction.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040573611424328">15</xref></sup> Yet hers was not a popular task; with only a dozen adherents to this “new gospel” in her rural community, Whitehead had to rely on internal compulsion while lacking external social and familial support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040573611424328">16</xref></sup> Facing opposition from her family about her conversion and calling, she declared that she would follow her new calling, even if that meant her leaving home and family. Recognizing Myrtle’s determination and commitment, her father finally relented declaring, “Myrtle, you’ll never have to leave home to serve the Lord.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040573611424328">17</xref></sup> Yet she would later reveal that her calling was not contingent on J.W.’s affirmation. She “was willing to leave home rather than give up Jesus” because though she “love[d] father and mother, brother and sisters,” she “love[d] Jesus above all.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040573611424328">18</xref></sup> Compelled and independently decided, she conducted her first revival on August 1, 1917 in Walhalla, South Carolina, traveling with only her youngest sister, Amma. It was at these revival meetings that Amma received her own “deeper experiences,” as she was “saved, sanctified, and received the Holy Ghost.” Her conversion precipitated the experiential conversion of Myrtle’s other two sisters, Hattie and Della, and eventually their mother, Frances Lou.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040573611424328">19</xref></sup> Then, finally, in 1918, Myrtle’s father J.W. was converted at a revival she led in Westminster, South Carolina.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040573611424328">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opposition to Whitehead’s preaching of Pentecostalism took both physical and social form as Whitehead’s ministry continued. Whitehead testified that there were three times in which she found herself dodging attempts on her life while preaching. In South Carolina, a mob unsuccessfully attempted to “burn the arbor” where Whitehead was conducting “brush arbor” worship services. Then they hid in the woods and threw a large rock at her car as she fled the protest. In the same confrontation, a handgun was fired, yet no one was badly injured. On another occasion in Dawsonville, Georgia, a mob sought to attack her with knives but miraculously she was not physically harmed. She was, however, spat upon in the confrontation. Finally, during a “cottage meeting,” a worship service conducted in rural residences, someone threw a large rock through a window just barely missing Whitehead’s head.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040573611424328">21</xref></sup> Still the largest challenge that Myrtle ever faced in life was death. In 1924, the “death angel” entered Myrtle’s life again as her mother, trusting in divine healing instead of medical treatment, finally died after a life of chronic sickness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040573611424328">22</xref></sup> To many, Myrtle’s struggle was eclipsed by her passion to tend “the revivals’ fires,” and to reach “souls,” recorded in her published articles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040573611424328">23</xref></sup> But in a song she composed during the crisis of her mother’s death, Myrtle’s words reveal the true emotion of her personal loss: “I am lonely, Oh, so lonely; since mamma has gone away; but I’m trusting in my Saviour; to comfort and help me day by day.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040573611424328">24</xref></sup> Three years later, Whitehead would preach this “new gospel” with greater commitment, through the lens of this loss, proclaiming she was “preaching it [more] than ever before.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040573611424328">25</xref></sup> This “new gospel” was a “deeper experience” that affected even her approach to bodily wellness (specifically trusting God for healing without medicine) and she continued this practice and teaching of divine healing even after her mother’s death.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040573611424328">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1929, this woman leader from the little village of Hartwell, Georgia, was on a three-year evangelism trek that spread from Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040573611424328">27</xref></sup> It is likely that Myrtle was the first voice for this “new gospel” of a Pentecostal experience for many of her hearers. As she canvassed these “new fields,” she led worship in unconventional ways: in houses, a courthouse, and once even in a borrowed Methodist convention hall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040573611424328">28</xref></sup> By 1932, it seemed that Whitehead would continue to preach outside of northeast Georgia for the rest of her ministry. But then at the request of her aging father, she made the journey home to visit the elderly J.W. Planning to meet him in Toccoa, Georgia, Myrtle would never see him alive again. On July 16, 1932, while traveling to reunite with his daughter, J.W. Whitehead was tragically killed when his car was struck crossing a train track. He lived no longer than what seems to have been “45 minutes” after the accident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040573611424328">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mourning the tragic loss of her father, Whitehead’s ministry was now focused closer to Hartwell, Georgia, again. It was in this re-evangelizing of her early revival sites that Whitehead met a co-laborer for her calling. After evangelizing alone for years, Whitehead met Pauline Jackson, a woman from Walhalla, South Carolina, who received the baptism in the Holy Ghost during one of Whitehead’s revivals and felt a call to ministry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040573611424328">30</xref></sup> These two women composed a dynamic evangelism team that traveled constantly, conducting tent revivals where both would preach, sing, and play music. It is remembered that Myrtle played the guitar, violin, organ, and sang powerfully during their meetings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040573611424328">31</xref></sup> One of Whitehead’s and Jackson’s tent revivals in Tennessee recorded “one hundred and fifty saved, one hundred sanctified, and seventy received the [baptism in the] Holy Ghost.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040573611424328">32</xref></sup> Their evangelism produced a lasting effect, because new churches were planted at the conclusion to many of Whitehead’s and Jackson’s evangelistic revivals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040573611424328">33</xref></sup> After Jackson died in 1944, Whitehead still continued her ministry as an evangelist, but at a slower pace. Her ministerial records reveal that Whitehead preached consistently, even twice in her final year of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040573611424328">34</xref></sup> Finally, on December 1, 1962, Myrtle raised her arm and before dying looked upwards and declared, “Oh what a beautiful place, what a beautiful place!”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040573611424328">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Credentialed as an “Evangelist,” at the age of 30, on July 17, 1917 in the Church of God (Cleveland, TN), Whitehead held these credentials until her death on December 1, 1962. During those 45 years, Reverend Whitehead preached 2,293 sermons, led 1,707 individuals to “salvation,” 690 to “sanctification,” and 471 to the experience of “baptism with the Holy Ghost.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040573611424328">36</xref></sup> Myrtle has been named by her home congregation as “one of the pioneers of Holiness that has helped pave the way for us” and is remembered by her family as a “saint of God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040573611424328">37</xref></sup> Though known as a powerful and effective preacher, Whitehead repeatedly in humility characterized herself through her calling as a servant of the gospel. For Whitehead, the vocational call to ministry was much more than the articulation of a doctrinal theology, it was an embodiment that blended her theology and cosmology as she actively preached and evangelized as a “sister in Christ” “in the battle for lost souls” and “looking for Jesus to come.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040573611424328">38</xref></sup> At least seven church plants can be connected to Whitehead’s evangelistic work between 1918 and 1940 in Georgia and South Carolina. The social norms of what a woman could, and could not, do were eclipsed for Whitehead by her calling to this “new gospel.” Traveling by bus, and even (early on) being driven by relatives in carriages and then in car, Whitehead was on the move, ministering in Bowersville, Buford, Dawsonville, Hartwell, Lavonia, Mountain City, and Pitts, Georgia; Belton, Newry, Oakway, Townville, Walhalla, and Westminster, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040573611424328">39</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040573611424328"><title>A reconsideration of Pentecostal history</title>
<p>Researching early Pentecostalism, I stumbled across an article written by Whitehead in 1916 and was taken aback by the boldness that filled her words. Intrigued by her testimony of faith in practice and by the song “Going through with Jesus” that she had included in her article, I avidly began research on her life and work. I eventually discovered 29 articles published in her denomination’s periodical. Many of these articles were as short as a paragraph, yet all contained pieces of that same strong voice I had read in the first article. Testimonies of the great revivals, divine healings, sermonic teachings on healing, and church plants filled the section of the page attributed to her. With such amazing things happening through and around an individual, I assumed that a history containing her story would easily be found. But to my surprise, there was practically nothing recorded on Whitehead outside of her denomination’s ministerial statistics file. No Pentecostal histories contained her name, not even the history of the denomination that licensed her. By finding Whitehead’s family, I was exposed to the oral stories, family memories, and brief snippets of writing that preserved the identity of this Pentecostal leader. It was through creative reconstruction, reading between the lines of the short publications in the denominational periodical, listening to family traditions, and critically re-evaluating the meaning of Myrtle’s Pentecostal leadership that an intriguing observation developed.</p>
<p>Presenting Whitehead’s story illustrates more than just the delayed recognition that she deserves; it also constructively illustrates the unconventional way that I believe Pentecostal history is found. As a grassroots religion, the history of Pentecostal leadership often resides not in libraries, denominational credentials, or even in denominational archives; it is to be found in personal writings, family stories, and narratives. This project of Pentecostal history requires risks and a justifying imagination. In light of social constraints and the cultural contexts, most early Pentecostal leaders did not have titles but were unofficially endorsed through their ministerial effectiveness. Ecclesial titles and positions were often self-created and many times retroactively applied. Whitehead’s subordinate credentialing illustrates that as Pentecostal groups organized into denominational bodies, ordination processes often reflected social restrictions on gender and race, rather than theological principles of empowerment that were embodied by many women leaders like Whitehead. Mixed documentation in early Pentecostal periodicals reflects the social restriction of acknowledging women’s leadership. Reading Whitehead’s personal account parallel to her published articles further substantiates the “pragmatic” social rubric into which the reports and leadership of women were hidden. Accounts of Whitehead’s leadership were often edited to reflect a participatory or assisting role to another male in attendance so that social norms would not be put into turmoil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0040573611424328">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>In light of these historical inaccuracies and structural discriminations, a reconstructive history is required if women leaders in the Pentecostal tradition are finally to be recognized. This task is more challenging than discovering male Pentecostal leaders. Yet this task is crucial and necessary in order to record the reality of the lives of the leaders which substantiated the audacious theological assertions that early Pentecostalism preached and practiced. When I asked Whitehead’s nephew if it was controversial for Whitehead to be preaching as a woman in the first quarter of the twentieth century, he answered quickly, “In those days, we had a lot of women preachers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0040573611424328">41</xref></sup> As I read Whitehead’s many report-like articles, I was astounded at the number of female writers represented in these periodical pages that confirmed his statement. So what adjustments must the historian make in order to record their leadership?</p>
<p>Even when a historian looks beyond titles to results, more must be done to record the dignifying and honest histories of Pentecostalism. This is especially true for Pentecostal women simply because many of their results were not properly recognized originally, even when they were active and effective. The historian must not take for granted that women ministered in spite of restraints. Most notably, ordination tiers that denied women equal recognition with men were active in the case of Myrtle Whitehead who, as a woman, had to be ordained as an “evangelist” and not a “minister.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0040573611424328">42</xref></sup> In order to retrieve these stories, the historian must essentially cultivate credentials for these leaders by rereading their reports and articles in light of personal writings, sermons, songs, and poems that were never screened or recast for publications with secondary aims of cultural acceptance.</p>
<p>Whitehead’s melodic words, “I’m going through with Jesus, tho friends may forsake me here,” substantiate much more than a mere report.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0040573611424328">43</xref></sup> They reveal the approach of many unrecognized grassroots women leaders. These leaders who largely remain unknown are greatly responsible for the spread of the Pentecostal movement. The story of Myrtle Viola Whitehead, and the realization of her great leadership in Pentecostalism, provide a challenge to reconsider the project of Pentecostal history through alternate voices and examples of leadership. Essentially, these women’s voices deserve not only to be recognized in the histories of Pentecostalism, but should direct and instruct the methods in which those histories are composed.</p></sec>
