<p>Y. Subbarayalu’s collection of selected articles on the Chola period was long due, and the service it has rendered to the world of scholars, especially those working on south India or using it as a comparative entity, is immense. Over the years one has been reading his contributions and marvelling at the richness and clarity of his analysis, and that too in a period which saw some of the intellectually stimulating writings by M.G.S. Narayanan, R. Champakalakshmi, Burton Stein, G.W. Spencer, James Heitzman, Rajan Gurukkal and Kesavan Veluthat, among others. Pieced together the collection has a flavour of its own. The work distinguishes itself by not allowing historiography to subsume history, the economic and socio-political processes and structures at play, which have been delineated very carefully across time and space, lucidly unfold their own narratives. Each chapter, including those on the Chola state, has a brief historiographical statement interwoven into the body of the text to enable the reader to have a sense of the problem and related issues, and that is about all insofar as historiography is concerned. He has brought his decades of research experience, including insights from geography, archaeology and epigraphy, as well as a long association with Noboru Karashima, during which each has supplemented the other, to bear on the work.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 focuses on the history and historiography of Tamil epigraphy since its beginning under Colonel Colin Mackenzie at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century. It reflects on aspects of south Indian inscriptions, including Tamil–Brahmi. Issues related to the linguistic study of inscriptions, their format, the objects of donation, and the importance and limitations of studies based on inscriptions have been highlighted. This on its own could have easily constituted a comprehensive Introduction. However, given the author’s meticulous concern for details he goes on to provide us with an independent fresh Introduction, which acquaints the reader with the gamut of information that follows. Chapter 2 in dealing with a set of three inscriptions from Pulangurichi dated to the middle of the first millennium CE is a prelude to the subsequent chapters. It focuses on the beginning of a new agrarian order, clearly removed from the Sangam setting, the emergence of the <italic>nadu</italic> or locality level socio-political entity, and the northern cultural intrusion, especially in the domain of religion. These developments evolved through the succeeding centuries and manifested themselves in mature forms under the Cholas. This is followed by contextual analyses of personal names, titles and terms occurring in the records. They yield rich evidence for our understanding of the well-to-do in society in early medieval south India, as also the changing meanings of certain terms over time.</p>
<p>The next section has chapters engaging with land measurement, classification, the Chola revenue system, quantification of land revenue, land sales, the social categories involved in the act and the ultimate beneficiaries of such transactions. The corporate bodies and their representatives, landholders, cultivators, tenants and slaves and social change, including the transformation of occupational groups into castes in the later part of Chola history, not only receive their necessary due but also contribute to the discussion of agrarian history in the round. Reflections on trading groups and aspects of trade, particularly long-distance and maritime activities, in about three chapters, lend wholesomeness to the economic history of the times.</p>
<p>The intricate details about land measurements and revenue assessments that has been worked out based on the classification of land graded by its quality, availability or non-availability of irrigation facilities and so on, the discussion on groups of taxes such as <italic>kadamai</italic> and <italic>kudimai</italic>, the latter representing labour levies on the cultivators to meet the requirements of the village community, temples, palaces and even officials on tour, together with those in cash from the artisans and merchants and sundry taxes bring into full view the administrative apparatus of the Cholas at play. It is suggested that most of the state revenue was derived from the delta region of the Kaveri, which constituted the core territory, and it amounted to 87,000 metric tonnes. The use of the statistical method of analysis has been highly rewarding. Its use in also analysing land sale documents brings to light the patterns available for the different phases of Chola history. The gradual decline in the position of the Brahmanas as landholders and corresponding emergence of the temples as important landed institutions during the twelfth–thirteenth centuries is a pattern which corresponds with what has been obtained for other regions of south India and Odisha during the same period. The discussion on the non-Brahmana or ordinary (<italic>vellanvagai</italic>) villages, the <italic>vellala</italic>s, their titles, their changing composition from the eleventh century onwards, their representatives and corporate bodies invest the work with excitement. These rural settlements comprised about 80 per cent of the total land under cultivation; the rest belonged to the Brahmanas and temples as a part of the land-grants bestowed on them. Any generalisation based on the latter without factoring in the former risks the danger of being ahistorical. And this being true of the Tamil south with thousands of land grant inscriptions will have a bearing on the other regions with far fewer such land transaction records.</p>
<p>The chapters on maritime trade and merchants at Barus in Sumatra are important because they unambiguously bring out the relationship between Ayyavole-500, Anjuvannam/Hanjamana and Manigramam, all of which were trading groups. Anjuvannam on the Malabar and Coromandal coasts or its variant in the Konkan coast comprised West Asian traders, constituting of Jews, Arabs, Muslims, Christians and Parsees. Though the early references to these bodies go back to the ninth century, the Arabs particularly, began to be more conspicuous from the eleventh century onwards.</p>
<p>Besides unveiling aspects of long distance and maritime trade in the Indian Ocean; these kinds of evidence also unravel the contemporary social dynamics and the perception of the ‘other’ in Indian society. The concluding chapters engage with the Chola state, which is an extension of the author’s earlier ideas on the subject. The state is studied in relation to concomitant processes of social and economic changes. Consequently, it has been possible to delineate stages in the history of the state spread over almost 400 years. The expansion and consolidation of the state is seen to be reflected in high-sounding royal titles, broadening of the political apparatus, administrative reorganisation and enhancement of the financial foundations of the Cholas. Importantly, these developments are shown to have converged with growth in the agrarian and non-agrarian sectors, as well as symmetrical changes in society. There is some discussion of the familiar conceptual categories of the state, but all of them are seen to be problematic for characterising the Chola state. Curiously however, the Integrative model of state formation has not been in the range of consideration, despite its close correspondence with the author’s approach.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the bewildering richness in the recent past of studies on south Indian history, this book, given its thoroughness with the sources and ability to rise above the obvious quite tellingly, will easily remain a convenient reference point for much of Chola history for years to come.</p>
