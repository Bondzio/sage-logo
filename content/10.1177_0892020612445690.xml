<abstract>
<p>In this piece Peter Kent, headteacher of Lawrence Sheriff School in Rugby in the UK, reflects upon the role of the student voice in selecting and recruiting new teaching staff. Contextualised by some recent unsympathetic reporting in the UK media, Peter explains why for their school community, using the student voice to inform teacher recruitment has been successful. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>I have been the headteacher at Lawrence Sheriff School for 13 years. Our school is an 11−18 boys’ school of 900 students located in Rugby, a large market town in Warwickshire. The school is popular and has a catchment drawn from local towns and the rural areas around them. We have always tried to capture and use the student voice to help support the running of the school, and more recently, to support the recruitment of new teaching staff. In recent years use of students to interview of applicants for teaching posts has received a lot of bad press. Apocryphal stories have circulated about pupils asking a potential teaching candidate to sing their favourite song, whilst rejecting another applicant because ‘he looked like Humpty Dumpty’. Amidst a chorus of ‘this never happened in my day’, many have dismissed such interview panels as the latest evidence of declining educational standards in the UK.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the truth is rather different. In reality there are fewer horror stories about interviews for teacher recruitment carried out by students than there are about those carried out by adults. Far from being an embarrassment, my experience as a headteacher is that when young people are given the chance to take part in interviews they are perceptive, thoughtful and quick to see things that I have missed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0892020612445690">
<title>Context</title>
<p>I remember several years ago coming towards the end of a discussion with an applicant for a senior teaching post within the school. Though tense on arrival, the candidate had interviewed well. We assumed that an interview with the headteacher had understandably made him nervous:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Any questions that you would like to ask us?’ I reassuringly asked. ‘No,’ he replied in relieved tones, ‘this interview has been so much easier than my last one with your Year 7 and 8 pupils!</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Rather than ask interviewees to teach a sample lesson, a process which we had found to be artificial and often misleading, applicants for posts at Lawrence Sheriff are asked to spend half an hour being interviewed by members of the school council drawn from Years 7−13, children aged 11−18 years old. The panel is chaired on an alternating basis amongst the year groups. Hence candidates have sometimes been surprised to find a panel containing senior students nonetheless being chaired by a student from the younger age groups.</p>
<p>Questions posed by the learners to applicants have been challenging and thoughtful, for example: <disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>‘Why would I enjoy being in your lessons?’</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>‘Would you be able to keep good discipline?’</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>‘I’ve always found your subject hard. How would you help me?’</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Or even:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>‘If you were a fish, which one would you be and why?’</italic>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Whilst students only make a recommendation to the final interviewing panel, to date their comments have been extremely accurate, and in almost every case their nominee has been the person finally appointed. Feedback from interviewees has been extremely positive, and many have commented that this stage of the interview process provides the clearest insight into the culture of the school. Over the past ten years students have taken a role in interviewing for over sixty different teaching and non-teaching posts within the school.</p>
<p>On the very rare occasions that our policy of student interviewers has been questioned, I have pointed out that I am not asking anyone to do anything that I have not done myself. When I applied for my current headship just over ten years ago, I remember suspiciously reading the phrase ‘student panel’ on the interview schedule. My experience was that the students had a set of reasonable questions to ask, which reflected their concerns at that time. Just as their questions were direct, so they expected me to give an open and clear answer.</p>
<p>The student panel were particularly concerned that the school did not have whole-school assemblies and I immediately pledged that I would re-introduce them (I had no idea how, but I was desperate for the job!). Pupils also repeatedly asked me how I would develop the school’s house system, a method of organising the pastoral groupings of the school amongst different age groups, emphasising that they particularly appreciated the opportunity that it provided for different age groups to work together. The school’s deputy head sat in the corner and made frantic notes, the look on his face betraying his obvious bemusement at a set of priorities that did not reflect his own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0892020612445690">
<title>Consequences for institutional leadership and management</title>
<p>It was only when I became headteacher that I realised how far-sighted student questions had been. My early weeks in the school helped me see what they had realised: that the school needed ways to build and enhance its sense of community. Re-introducing whole-school assemblies offered the easiest and most effective way of doing this. Hence, somewhat to my surprise, I found myself carrying out the promise that I had made in the interview room within three months of coming to the school.</p>
<p>Their second question took longer to act upon. I spent the next six years grappling with ways to further develop the sense of community within the school. It was only when my newly appointed deputy suggested that this could be done through a structure of vertical tutoring based around the house system, that I realised how dull and slow I had been. The students on my interview panel were way ahead of me − they saw the need for a strategy that I had spent six years muddling towards.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>My own experiences point towards the real reason why student panels are regarded with suspicion. As adults we find it difficult to admit that we do not have a monopoly when it comes to creativity and insight. Pupils bring a unique and important perspective to the process of making decisions within schools because they know so much about what actually happens (as opposed to what we would like to think is happening). Their priorities may not be the same as ours, but that makes it doubly important that they are involved in appointments and are not ignored. </p>
<p>Over the next few years the UK government will pour hundreds of millions into structural change in the educational system and the establishment of the provision of new types of school. How ironic in these times of austerity that at present the education system is neglecting the best resource that we have, one that is freely available to schools: the students themselves. If we spent just a fraction of our resources on improving the way in which we listen to students, the impact upon the education system in the UK could be more profound than any of the structural or pedagogical initiatives adopted by successive administrations over recent decades.</p>
