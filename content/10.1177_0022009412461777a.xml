<sec id="sec1-0022009412461777a"><title>Shelley Baranowski, <italic>Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler</italic>, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010; xii + 368 pp.; US$24.99 pbk; ISBN 9780521674089</title>
<p>The last two decades have seen an expansion of scholarship on Germany’s colonies and imperial projects, both real and imagined. These innovative and interdisciplinary works have been situated in the nexus of studies on postcolonialism, Orientalism, nationalism, empire and genocide. Synthesizing much of this recent research, Shelley Baranowski has written a history of German imperialism from unification in 1870 to 1945, although the result is also a new history of the Third Reich. Despite the book title’s suggestion of a smooth development from Bismarck to Hitler, Baranowski reveals the twists and turns in German policies and nationalist imaginaries.</p>
<p>The crooked line of continuity that runs through the book centers on the ‘tensions of empire’ that she argues existed between dreams of total triumph and nightmares of utter defeat. The creation of the Bismarckian Reich is Baranowski’s starting point for Germanys apparent security dilemma: in the eyes of nationalists, the <italic>kleindeutsch</italic> solution created a fractured, incomplete nation-state; the unrequited desires for unity and security then spilled into imperial projects and expansionist ambitions, which only endangered Germany more. As she notes, the politics of imperialism was a source of division, especially between radical nationalists and the government. For example, the Pan-German League arose in part as a reaction to the perceived weakness of the monarchy. Baranowski is careful to negotiate the tension between continuity and comparison that runs throughout the book. Colonial projects in Africa resulted in a genocidal campaign against the Herero, yet she states clearly that Imperial Germany was not Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>For Baranowski, the mobilization and experience of the First World War was a formative development: the victories in and occupation of much of eastern Europe, the economic pressures of war, and visions of defeat spelled out the need for a great continental empire, and these calls only increased after the war’s end in 1918. This extreme nationalism further crippled the fledgling Weimar democracy that had been colonized by the victorious Allies, but Baranowski stresses that the decline of the republic and the rise of the Nazis was not preordained until the economic crisis of 1929. Of the three Germanies covered by Baranowski, National Socialist mobilization before 1933 and state control afterwards takes up well over half the book. Likewise, overseas and continental imperialism are discussed throughout the work, but they appear to have only an indirect continuity with the Nazi vision of <italic>Lebensraum</italic>. Hitler, for example, consistently dismissed the need for overseas colonies. Baranowski contextualizes the plans for <italic>Lebensraum</italic> in a broader overview of the nazification of Germany, including <italic>Gleichschaltung</italic> and antisemitic racial legislation. Importantly, she shows that interwar policies in other countries were also in dialogue with eugenicists. Yet the Nazis took racial hygiene to a biological racist extremity unmatched elsewhere, and Baranowski emphasizes that the eastern expansionist ideas of German elites (both Nazi and conservatives) fed into racial planning that played out in the Second World War.</p>
<p>The long-standing colonial traditions and ambitions in the East seemed to prefigure German wartime policies, but Baranowski describes its often haphazard development, in which pragmatic factors intertwined with ideological ones. This uncertainty is apparent in the case of Poland: on the one hand, it was an object of Weimar and Nazi hatred; on the other hand, Hitler decided to attack only after failing to win Poland over as a junior partner. Her description of the decision to invade the Soviet Union could likewise be seen in terms of a moderate functionalist explanation: she suggests that growing Soviet intransigence to German control was crucial. Reading <italic>Nazi Empire</italic> in this way, anti-Bolshevism and <italic>Lebensraum</italic> ideology were necessary, but not sufficient, causes for the attack. It struck this reviewer that this evolutionary approach could be the key to one of the paradoxes of Hitler’s expansionism: the immediate transfer of Germans from the Baltics and elsewhere in Eastern Europe to German-occupied Poland in 1939–40 actually de-Germanized those areas of the Soviet Union that were supposed to be the Reich’s future <italic>Lebensraum</italic>.</p>
<p>Political and economic domination of Europe remained the core motivations for Hitler and top Nazi leaders even as the war turned against Germany. It is in this context of the tide and ebb of war that Baranowski then places the Holocaust, which is the focus of her last chapter. Exclusionary violence existed before 1939, but there were no plans for total extermination until the war began. The Final Solution, she explains, evolved from a series of factors: the growing number of Jews under Nazi control, the ultimately unworkable Madagascar Plan, and the attack on the Soviet Union. One of book’s main achievements is the concise but revealing account of the pan-European dimensions of the Nazi empire. Baranowski stresses the essential German impulse of the Holocaust, but it is the nuanced interaction of local, regional and military officials in occupied and allied countries (especially Romania) that enabled German success in this war against the Jews.</p>
<p>One weakness in the book is the lack of working definitions of colonialism and imperialism. While Baranowski is careful to differentiate the contested meanings among various strands of imperial thinking, overseas and continental territorial expansionist plans can appear conflated in the concepts of empire and imperialism. Despite assertions that the pursuit of empire was supported by broad swathes of the population and found wide acceptance in the Imperial period, the actual influence of imaginations of the East and empire remained vague. Likewise, conservative desires to revise Weimar Germany’s eastern border are portrayed as a call for empire. Yet the role of imperial expansionist thinking in electoral victories and support for the Nazi regime is difficult to pinpoint, as Baranowski herself suggests. After all, the war hardly unleashed a pent-up <italic>Drang nach Osten</italic> for most Germans. It was incredibly difficult to find settlers or administrators living within Germany’s interwar borders who were willing to relocate to Eastern Europe. Finally, the book ends somewhat abruptly without a conclusion and raises the question: How did the long-tradition of empire disappear or express itself in different ways after 1945?</p>
<p>Despite these remaining questions, Baranowski’s study contains a wealth of voices and chilling examples that would make it an excellent choice for undergraduate seminar discussion. At the same time, it is a valuable overview of recent research that serves specialists well.</p>
