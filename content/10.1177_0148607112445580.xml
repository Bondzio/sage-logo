<abstract>
<p>This lecture reviews the current understanding of how insulin resistance, as a marker of the metabolic stress, is involved in recovery after major surgery. Insulin resistance develops as a graded response related to the magnitude of the operation. It lasts for weeks after medium-size surgery and affects all parts of body metabolism. Although hyperglycemia develops, muscle and fat uptake is reduced and other non-insulin-sensitive cells have an increase in glucose uptake as a result of the elevated glucose levels. Reduced glucose uptake and storage in muscle along with loss of lean body mass help explain reduced muscle function that will impair mobilization. The increased uptake of glucose in non-insulin-sensitive cells is involved in the development of several of the most common postoperative complications, including infections and cardiovascular problems. Many of the perioperative treatments in use are outdated, and modern care involves a multimodal approach with several treatments, such as preoperative carbohydrate treatment instead of overnight fasting, continuous epidural anesthesia for postoperative pain care, early feeding, and mobilization, all of which affect insulin by reducing the stress and enhancing recovery. Most of the previous mandatory catabolic responses to surgery can be avoided, resulting in substantially faster recovery and fewer complications. Methods to implement these modern treatments have been developed and used in Europe, resulting in improved care and shorter length of stay.</p>

<title>Historical Reflection</title>
<p>In one of the first studies found on PubMed, Rhoads et al in 1946 studied the effect of preoperative force feeding of patients with poor nutrition status and high surgical risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607112445580">1</xref></sup> The authors fed patients for 5 days preoperatively with a ≥0.8-g/kg nitrogen diet and achieved improved nitrogen balance, better postoperative outcome with regard to mobilization, and improved cardiovascular stability in a standardized tilt test. These early experiments showed that nutrition is important and that metabolic preparation is feasible and effective. What is striking about this study from 65 years ago is that the subject of study remains the same today: focus on muscle, protein, and postoperative function along with metabolic preparation before surgery to improve outcomes. So, the issues from the early days remain, but today we have new insights and possibilities. Our understanding of metabolic changes to surgical stress has increased, and this has helped us develop new ways of addressing problems facing surgeons for many decades.</p>

<sec id="section2-0148607112445580">
<title>Why Insulin Resistance and Enhanced Recovery?</title>
<p>Elective surgery is a treatment involving a deliberate injury to the body to remove disease or to repair organs. In response to any injury, the body sets off a series of reactions, including rapid neuroendocrine responses, setting of stress hormones, and activation of the cytokine and immune reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0148607112445580">2</xref></sup> These reactions lead to several changes in all parts of body metabolism, mobilizing substrates from all depots, and a general catabolic situation is established. In elective surgery, these metabolic changes can be reversed by the use of insulin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112445580">3</xref></sup> However, in the postoperative situation, several-fold higher levels of insulin are needed to achieve the same metabolic effects as preoperatively, indicating a state of postoperative insulin resistance. Interestingly, when targeting and achieving normal glucose levels with the insulin infusion, free fatty acid levels, urea excretion, and substrate oxidation are all normalized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112445580">3</xref></sup> This shows that insulin resistance is present in all main parts of metabolism but also that insulin resistance can be counteracted in a synergistic way when achieving normoglycemia using insulin. This study was carried out in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, and in more extreme stress, the situation may be different. Nevertheless, in major elective surgery, treating postoperative insulin resistance has been shown to normalize insulin action and the main components of metabolism. This is important, as will be outlined below.</p>
<p>Just as Dr Rhoads and his colleagues realized many years ago, we can influence elements in our perioperative care that will affect the outcome and recovery of the patient. Although feeding the undernourished patient was perhaps the most obvious nutrition treatment in those days, today we know that many perioperative care elements will have effects on metabolism directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>But to set the scenario right, we need to begin by defining the clinical goals for recovery in our postoperative patients. In general, we want the patient to recover to his or her preoperative function. This means in simple clinical terms that we want the return of bowel function, meaning both being able to eat and to have the bowels moving. Patients should be in control of pain using oral analgesics and be mobile to the extent they were before the operation. And of course, we want to avoid any complications. Once all these factors are achieved, the patient is actually ready to be discharged (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607112445580">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Insulin is the main anabolic hormone in the body and essential in governing all parts of metabolism. In doing so, insulin is also part of the regulation of the return of many functions in postoperative recovery outlined above, and insulin resistance is also important for the development of postoperative complications. In addition, many of the perioperative treatments have direct or indirect effects on insulin action. In recent years, several studies have shown that insulin resistance is a major key to the understanding of recovery after surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112445580">4</xref></sup> but also for the development of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112445580">5</xref></sup> This recent study showed that the degree of insulin resistance when the patient was leaving the operating table was related to the risk of complications, particularly infectious complications.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s, Henrik Kehlet, a surgeon from Denmark, introduced the concept of a multimodal approach to recovery after surgery, called fast-track surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607112445580">6</xref></sup> and using this model published a report of 17 patients discharged with a median postoperative stay of 2 days after open colonic resections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607112445580">7</xref></sup> At that time, the postoperative stay was around 10 days in most modern institutions (and still remains so in many institutions around the world), so this caused quite a sensation when it was published. Kehlet and his work was a major source of inspiration for a group of surgeons in northern Europe who decided to start a collaboration to further explore the possibilities of improving outcomes and recovery after surgery using insights to metabolism and nutrition as a platform for further improvements. We were pleased to find Dr Kehlet involved in the initiation and early work of this group, called the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) study group (see the Acknowledgments). We intentionally renamed the concept <italic>ERAS</italic> to focus on recovery instead of speed per se. The term <italic>ERAS</italic> is now an accepted term for multimodal perioperative care programs resulting in fast recovery.</p>
<p>The study group focused initially on colonic resections and, based on Kehlet’s initial protocol, refined and updated it to a consensus review published in 2005<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607112445580">8</xref></sup> describing a protocol for evidence-based perioperative care. This has since further developed into consensus protocols for also rectal surgery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112445580">9</xref></sup> and protocols used in liver surgery in the group have also been presented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607112445580">10</xref></sup> This work is now being extended into other domains of surgery, including upper gastrointestinal (GI) surgery, gynecology, and urology, and the principles of these concepts have been published in many surgical domains as reviewed by Kehlet and Wilmore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607112445580">11</xref></sup> Certain features are common to these protocols, particularly the way they act: by reducing the stress reactions caused by the surgery and supporting the return of key functions (ie, GI function and mobilization).</p>
<p>From a traditional care situation, the evidence in the literature shows that many of these old routines need to be abandoned (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112445580">Table 2</xref>). This means many of the traditional care elements, many of them causing major discomfort for the patient, should be abandoned for the better of the patient.

<p>The use of ERAS protocols has been shown to have marked effects not only on general recovery after surgery but also in reducing complications. A meta-analysis from 2010, based on 6 studies from 4 countries where the ERAS group employed at least 4 ERAS elements in the care protocol compared with traditional care, showed a mean reduction in length of stay of 2.5 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112445580">12</xref></sup> Perhaps more important was the finding of a reduction of complications by about 50%. Obviously, such improvements have marked implications for the patients, staff, hospital organization, and the costs of care. Indeed, a report from New Zealand showed that even when employing a very ambitious program to start an ERAS program with travels across the world for the ERAS team and full-time staff employed, the average saving per patient was more than $5000 for the first 50 patients, mainly due to shorter length of stay and reducing costs for complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607112445580">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>How Insulin Resistance Is Affected by Perioperative Care Elements</title>
<p>A key objective in the recovery of the patient is to have gut function return as fast as possible. Securing energy intake is important because studies show that just allowing low glucose intake intravenously, such as 50 g in 2000 mL/d, results in marked insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0148607112445580">14</xref></sup> Healthy volunteers treated this way for 3 days lost about 50% of their insulin sensitivity. Bed rest in this shorter time span caused no further resistance. However, long-term bed rest, shown by Biolo and his team,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607112445580">15</xref></sup> results in a marked change in protein metabolism, significantly reducing protein synthesis. When combined with hypocaloric nutrition, protein breakdown is further enhanced. Protein balance is affected by insulin, and in particular, insulin has been shown to reduce protein breakdown, whereas protein synthesis in muscle is more affected by the availability of amino acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607112445580">16</xref></sup> Other studies show that bed rest rapidly impairs aerobic capacity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607112445580">17</xref></sup> further impeding mobilization. Apart from bowel function and mobilization, avoiding pain is an important aim for recovery. One reason for this is that pain per se causes insulin resistance as shown by some elegant studies by Greisen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112445580">18</xref></sup> So for all 3 aims of recovery, insulin resistance is an important component.</p>

<sec id="section4-0148607112445580">
<title>How Best to Define and Measure Insulin Resistance?</title>
<p>How best to define insulin resistance? The initial studies of insulin resistance focused on glucose metabolism,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607112445580">19</xref></sup> and this remains the cornerstone of all recent studies as well. However, other studies have shown that not only glucose metabolism but also protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607112445580">20</xref></sup> and fat metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607112445580">21</xref></sup> are affected, so insulin resistance affects all parts of metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607112445580">3</xref></sup> A more appropriate and broader definition of postoperative insulin resistance is as follows: below-normal insulin effect of insulin for glucose, protein, and/or fat metabolism in the postoperative phase.</p>
<p>How best to measure insulin resistance? Determinations of insulin sensitivity or resistance should be performed in situations when insulin can be expected to be active. At basal levels in the fasted state, insulin levels remain at about 5–12 µU/mL in plasma (variations depending on methods used), and at this level, insulin has minimal effects on glucose and protein metabolism. Glucose is supplied by endogenous production at a rate of about 2 mg/kg/min, and glucose uptake is at the same low level and minimally affected by insulin. However, as soon as nutrients are consumed, insulin is released to levels about 6–8 times the basal levels. At these levels, glucose production is shut off, and peripheral glucose uptake is enhanced about 3- to 4-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607112445580">22</xref></sup> This elevation in glucose uptake is seen only at the higher physiological levels of insulin, whereas half the elevation (3-fold increase from basal) has no effect on glucose uptake. In the early postoperative situation, it is the glucose uptake that is the main cause of insulin resistance. Because this mechanism is activated only at high physiological levels (meal levels) of insulin, it is necessary to use a method allowing studies of glucose metabolism at these levels. The change in glucose turnover at the low basal fasting levels represents at most 10%−15% of the total whole-body insulin resistance after surgery. Therefore, determinations of insulin resistance using basal glucose and insulin levels will not detect whole-body insulin resistance appropriately in surgical patients. Methods such as homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607112445580">23</xref></sup> using these basal levels report results that are very different<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0148607112445580">24</xref></sup> from studies using the appropriate methods (ie, the hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic clamp).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112445580">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Insulin sensitivity in normal adult elective surgical patients varies by a factor of 7–8. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112445580">Figure 1</xref>, the relative change after any given procedure group is more consistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112445580">4</xref></sup> The greater the operation, the more resistant the patient becomes. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0148607112445580">Figure 1</xref> also shows that the surgical technique makes a major difference since laparoscopic techniques render minimal resistance, whereas the same procedure done using open techniques results in a 50% fall in sensitivity.</p>

</fig>
<p>After a medium-size upper abdominal procedure, such as open cholecystectomy, insulin resistance remains for about 2–3 weeks even in uncomplicated postoperative patients. Further analysis has shown that insulin resistance is an independent predictor of length of stay. Along with the type of surgery and blood loss during surgery, this parameter explains more than 70% of the variation in length of stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607112445580">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>When examining the details of the change in glucose metabolism in the postoperative insulin resistant state, it was found that the driving forces behind hyperglycemia were both an increase in glucose production and a reduction in glucose uptake in the periphery. At the cellular level, muscle is the main tissue for insulin-mediated glucose uptake. In muscle, there is a reduced activation of the specific glucose transporting protein, GLUT 4, after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112445580">26</xref></sup> This is likely to be caused by reduced activation of the insulin signaling system in the cells, including PI-3 kinase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112445580">27</xref></sup> At the same time, glycogen formation is reduced in the postoperative insulin-resistant state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112445580">28</xref></sup> Thus, the overall change in glucose metabolism that develops very fast in surgery holds many similarities to that found in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0148607112445580">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>How can insulin resistance be involved in postoperative recovery? In insulin-resistant states, there will be less effective facilitating glucose transport into the muscle cell, and less glycogen is stored as well. At the same time, there will loss of protein from the muscle, rendering overall loss of lean body mass. These 2 factors in combination, less energy and less structural protein, result in lower muscle function and less capacity to mobilize. In addition, studies in patients with burns have also shown that insulin has an important anabolic role for wound healing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0148607112445580">29</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-0148607112445580">
<title>Insulin Resistance and Complications</title>
<p>Many of the most common complications developing in surgery are similar to those occurring in diabetes; the difference is that they develop within days in surgery and often after a much longer time in diabetes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0148607112445580">Table 3</xref>). It is also noteworthy to find that the cells involved in many of the complications are not dependent directly on insulin for their glucose uptake. These cells include immune cells involved in infections, endothelial cells for cardiovascular complications, and neural cells for neuropathies. These cells take up glucose mainly depending on the prevailing glucose level in the plasma (and interstitial fluids). These cells have no storage capacity for glucose, so the only pathway for glucose once inside the cells is through glycolysis. Brownlee<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112445580">31</xref></sup> very nicely showed how these cells, when overloaded with too much inflow of glucose, eventually start producing oxygen free radicals, leading to changes in gene expression in many cells, causing further enhancement of inflammation, which in turn causes further insulin resistance in a vicious cycle. Similar findings are now being unraveled also in surgical insulin-resistant states. Recent studies from muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0148607112445580">32</xref></sup> and adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0148607112445580">33</xref></sup> show increased inflammatory signaling developing during surgery. Many of the recent findings of changes after surgery are in line with changes reported in diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0148607112445580">31</xref></sup> including signs of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, causing further inflammation.</p>

<p>Since the first study by van den Berghe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0148607112445580">34</xref></sup> from 2001 showing reduced mortality in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients when lowering glucose to normal levels as opposed to allowing hyperglycemia, the interest in glucose control has been very high. The reduced mortality was associated with avoiding subsequent developments of complications when glucose was under control. The action taken was to secure reinstatement of insulin action (ie, treating insulin resistance). This lowered a range of complications, including infections, renal failure, polyneuropathy, and the need for assisted ventilation. Subsequent studies in the medical ICU were less clear, and a large multicenter trial in more severely stressed mixed ICU patients reported increased mortality when using strict glucose control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0148607112445580">35</xref></sup> Interestingly, in trauma and postsurgical patients, the subgroup of patients in that trial who were the closest to the patients in the first van den Berghe trial showed a similar trend for lowering mortality as well. This suggests that in surgical patients, controlling glucose by treating insulin resistance is beneficial by avoiding the development of complications. This is very different from using insulin to treat insulin resistance in a severely stressed septic medical patient with the complication already present. This may very well help explain some of the differences between the results in various ICU trials of glucose control.</p>
<p>In less stressed studies, such as in consecutive patients with colorectal cancer, data suggest that glucose metabolism is highly relevant when explaining developments of common postoperative complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0148607112445580">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112445580">37</xref></sup> In patients with a normal HbA1c as opposed to an elevated level and lower glucose levels during the postoperative course, the risk of complications, dominated by infections, is lower. The patients with elevated HbA1c before the operation had no known diabetes, and probably the derangement in glucose metabolism was because of the cancer disease for which they had surgery. Another finding was that elevations in glucose were associated with higher CRP levels, indicating again an association with the inflammatory responses. This study was performed in an advanced ERAS environment where both groups of patients consumed an average of 1500 kcal/d spontaneously using hospital food complemented with some nutrition supplements. The glucose values given were the averages of 5 taken throughout the day and thus mostly postabsorptive glucose levels.</p>
<p>The most convincing evidence to date of the role of insulin resistance in surgical complications is a recent study from Montreal where almost 300 patients undergoing thoracic surgery were studied using the clamp method while being operated on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112445580">5</xref></sup> Sato et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0148607112445580">5</xref></sup> reported that the risk of complications, particularly serious infections, was proportional to the degree of insulin resistance when the patient left the operating table. This finding was independent of several other factors, including the presence of diabetes. The fact that hyperglycemia impairs several key functions of the immune system is well known since many years from studies both in surgery and in diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0148607112445580">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although it is clear that hyperglycemia and insulin resistance have a negative impact on outcomes in surgery, many seemingly basic questions still remain. For instance, it is still not clear which glucose level, taken at which time and in which situation, is the most predictive for risk or should be the target for treatment. Hence, we have no clear guidance whether the basal glucose level is the important one. If so, how long should we wait after turning off intravenous (IV) infusions of nutrients or after enteral or oral feeding? A very recent study in colorectal patients indicates that even small elevations of peak glucose levels increase the risk of complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0148607112445580">37</xref></sup> Although these questions do seem basic, getting the right answers to them still remains an important challenge.</p>

<title>Enhanced Recovery Protocols: Integration and Protection Against Insulin Resistance</title>
<p>ERAS protocols are standardized integrated care protocols adjusted to the patient’s journey to minimize the stress reactions to surgery and support the return of functions. The protocols are based on available evidence in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112445580">9</xref></sup> A very important component of the ERAS philosophy is to keep up a continuous audit and follow up the outcomes but also the compliance to the protocol items in the protocol. This is important because all elements of the protocol have been shown to have a direct impact on the outcome. Many of the care protocol items have direct or indirect effects on insulin resistance (see below).</p>
<p>The following example shows how metabolism and function, as well as the different elements, interact. In the preoperative phase, we can choose to minimize the developments of insulin resistance using 2 simple and readily available treatments: preoperative carbohydrate treatment instead of overnight fasting and epidural anesthesia. These treatments will also affect the postoperative phase and treatments given at that stage of the patient’s journey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0148607112445580">
<title>Preoperative Carbohydrates</title>
<p>Overnight fasting is probably the best-known medical “rule” worldwide. It was first proposed after the first anesthesia death reported in 1848.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0148607112445580">39</xref></sup> The main reason behind the proposal was to ensure an empty stomach at the time of anesthesia. To secure this, it was felt that an overnight fast would be sufficient. However, it was not until in the 20th century that it became the standard preparation for elective surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0148607112445580">40</xref></sup> when an author of a textbook simply stated this a rule. From then on, most authors did the same, until the entire idea of overnight fasting was questioned, proven unnecessary, and finally changed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0148607112445580">41</xref></sup> Overnight fasting causes discomfort such as thirst, hunger, headaches, and anxiety, and intake of clear fluids taken up until 2 hours before anesthesia does not increase the gastric volumes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0148607112445580">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0148607112445580">43</xref></sup> On the contrary, intake of clear fluids stimulates the stomach to empty and has often been reported to reduce residual gastric volumes. The risks associated with aspiration are related to the patient’s comorbidity rather than the time of fasting, with the exception of patients with slow gastric emptying. Intake of clear fluids is now recommended up until 2 hours before anesthesia and surgery. Intake of water, tea, coffee, and some juices has been shown to reduce thirst and sometimes hunger and headaches. However, clear fluids have little if any effect on body metabolism, and with the fasting routines applied, the body is set to undergo stress in a fasted state. For most people in any other situation, this would be an unnatural way to prepare for stress. This certainly applies for normal workdays but also for sports. Some early animal experiments in hemorrhagic stress and endotoxemia several years ago set us off to question if the fasted state was good or bad (reviewed in Ljungqvist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0148607112445580">44</xref></sup>). In short, these studies showed that in hemorrhage, glucose had a life-saving role in fed rats with glycogen stores available. In acute hemorrhage, glucose was rapidly released to secure plasma refill by osmotic means, shifting water from cells to the extracellular space. Fasted rats succumbed to the same bleeding. They also had a more pronounced endocrine stress response. Also, in endoxemic stress, fed rats had a survival advantage over those withheld food overnight.</p>
<p>Body metabolism has natural diurnal variations (for a very didactic description of normal human metabolism, see Frayn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0148607112445580">45</xref></sup>). In the morning shortly after waking up, most people have breakfast, usually a mixed meal. This elicits the release of insulin. Insulin has many effects on body metabolism, and among many other actions, insulin will not only secure the storage of nutrients but also change the oxidation from fat to carbohydrates, while also activating glucose transport into muscle and fat and glycogen and fat storage as well as protein anabolism. All of the above are reversed by stress, and many of the reactions are also affected by the overnight fast (although this is perfectly normal).</p>
<p>The most obvious way to change metabolism from the overnight fasted state to the fed state was to give a carbohydrate load. This was initially done using IV glucose at a high concentration (20% glucose) and dose (5 mg/kg/min)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0148607112445580">46</xref></sup> and later using a mixture of complex carbohydrates as an oral drink<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0148607112445580">47</xref></sup> that showed to improve preoperative well-being while also emptying fast enough to be safe for clinical use. Later studies showed that intake of this drink completely reversed the setting of overnight fasting while stimulating glucose uptake, shutting down gluconeogenesis, and thus setting the patient to a much more anabolic state than the fasted state before the onset of the surgical stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0148607112445580">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0148607112445580">48</xref></sup> This elevation of insulin sensitivity is believed to carry through to the postoperative situation, where several studies in major surgery have shown that the preoperative carbohydrate treatment results in substantially less postoperative insulin resistance (for reviews, see Ljungqvist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0148607112445580">25</xref></sup> and Nygren et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0148607112445580">49</xref></sup>). Recent studies from China showed that this treatment has direct effects on intracellular muscle signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0148607112445580">27</xref></sup> Preoperative carbohydrates result in postoperative higher activation of PI-3 kinase. This is a key intracellular signal activating, among other things, the glucose transporter GLUT4. Early studies indicated that GLUT4 activation is reduced after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0148607112445580">26</xref></sup> In addition, the same Chinese study also showed that tyrosine protein kinase activity, a key anabolic signaling pathway, was maintained at a higher level after surgery in patients given preoperative carbohydrates. This helps explain the intracellular mechanisms behind some earlier findings of improved anabolic status with this treatment. Yuill et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0148607112445580">50</xref></sup> showed improved muscle mass, Crowe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0148607112445580">51</xref></sup> showed less nitrogen losses, and Henriksen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0148607112445580">52</xref></sup> reported improved vastus muscle strength postoperatively from the addition of a preoperative carbohydrate treatment compared with fasting or placebo. The finding of improved strength was associated with higher glycogen synthase activity, and the difference between groups was present as late as a month after surgery. Another effect reported for preoperative carbohydrate treatment is less immune depression after surgery as indicated by improved HLA-DR expression of monocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0148607112445580">53</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0148607112445580">
<title>Combining Feeding With Pre- and Postoperative Epidural Anesthesia</title>
<p>By placing an epidural with local anesthetics in the mid-thoracic region (Th 6–9) and activating it before the onset of the operation, the release of 2 key stress hormones, epinephrine and cortisol, is markedly reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0148607112445580">54</xref></sup> These 2 hormones are well known to cause insulin resistance, and when blocked, postoperative insulin resistance was reduced by almost 50%. Using this mechanism to reduce insulin resistance and at the same time also employing preoperative insulin stimulation by using preoperative carbohydrates was tested by Soop et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0148607112445580">55</xref></sup> Combining these 2 treatments along with immediate postoperative complete enteral feeding resulted in an almost complete abolishment of insulin resistance. During the course of the first few days of complete feeding, glucose levels remained within normal fasting levels while no insulin was given (or required). Another metabolic effect of the combinations of treatments was the maintenance of complete nitrogen balance. This study shows that it is possible to almost completely avoid postoperative insulin resistance, and in this situation obviously, the need for any additional insulin to control glucose may not be needed. This is very useful in the postoperative phase at the wards where insulin treatment to control glucose may be difficult to maintain with appropriate levels of safety.</p>
<p>There are other reasons for success of the above protocol. The epidural block, maintained the first few days after surgery, also serves effectively to control pain while avoiding the use of opiates. The use of epidurals has been shown to have a marked effect on GI motility, with a meta-analysis indicating 2 days faster recovery of motility using epidurals vs opiate-based analgesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0148607112445580">56</xref></sup> This is another key to making enteral feeding work early after surgery. Furthermore, any nutrient consumed while less resistant to insulin will be used in a more anabolic or normal way. Again, the preoperative carbohydrate and the epidural work together for better metabolic effects. Last, pain control is important not only for patient comfort but also to avoid insulin resistance, as shown by Greisen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0148607112445580">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-0148607112445580">
<title>Minimizing Insulin Resistance and Supporting Anabolism</title>
<p>Although the above example is just one of many illustrating how a multimodal approach is useful to control and support the enhancement of recovery after surgery, several other factors are involved. These include patient information and patients’ active participation in their own recovery, the use of the right premedication (if used at all), surgical techniques, avoiding hypothermia, fluid balance during and after surgery, and immediate mobilization (for references, see Lassen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607112445580">9</xref></sup>). Many of these have direct or indirect effects on metabolism, as alluded to above. Some new developments may well prove to be included in the next generation of recommendations. These include some reevaluation of the concept in the setting of minimally invasive surgery, as it is slowly but gradually making its way into more complex surgical procedures. Laparoscopic surgery markedly reduces insulin resistance, as shown many years ago.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0148607112445580">57</xref></sup> Restoring gut function is another key area, where chewing gum is showing to be a novel approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0148607112445580">58</xref></sup> This will have indirect effects on insulin resistance by supporting the return of intake of food and nutrients. Similarly, maintaining fluid balance is another key area often overlooked, both in terms of gut function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0148607112445580">59</xref></sup> but also for avoiding complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0148607112445580">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0148607112445580">61</xref></sup></p>

<title>Making the Patients’ Journey While Maintaining Metabolic Control</title>
<p>From the above discussions, we can review the patients’ journey in the traditional care pathway and compare that with the ERAS protocol using insulin sensitivity (or resistance) as the marker of the metabolic stress. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0148607112445580">Figure 2</xref> gives an arbitrary (and not strictly scientific) illustration of how different treatments in traditional vs ERAS care affect insulin sensitivity. The figure shows that the ERAS protocol allows the patient to maintain insulin sensitivity throughout the perioperative phase by using treatments that will avoid the development of insulin resistance. Avoiding fasting, using an epidural, and controlling pain and mobilizing after surgery will minimize the development of insulin resistance. By stimulating insulin pre- and postoperatively using carbohydrates and feeding, respectively, again insulin activity is kept more normal.</p>

<title>ERAS and Outcomes</title>
<p>Although numerous studies show very good clinical results in the literature, many of these findings are slow to find their way into daily clinical practice. Sometimes it is clear what should be done, and clinicians are well aware of what should be done, but it is still not done. A very good example of how hard it can be to have simple yet markedly effective treatments introduced into practice was given by Dr Levy (Brown University),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0148607112445580">64</xref></sup> who presented a keynote lecture at the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Clinical Week in 2007. In his lecture, he presented a study from Germany where intensive care specialists were asked if they use low tidal volume ventilation in their patients. This type of ventilation was shown to reduce mortality and has no extra cost, and it can easily be used on any modern ventilator. Ninety-two percent of the responders replied they did use this mode of ventilation. However, the authors surveyed the actual setting of the ventilators and found that only 4% were set the right way. This illustrates that even if we do know what should be done and may think we are doing the right thing, it is only when we actually check what is being done that we know for sure. Therefore, to make an ERAS protocol work in real-life medical practice, you need to have full control over what is actually being done in detail with every patient.</p>
<p>For this reason, the ERAS study group set out about 10 years ago to measure the use of every element in the protocol agreed upon and store them in a database for comparisons between the units but also to support the implementation of the ERAS protocol in each unit involved. This proved to be most useful and showed that the different units did quite differently,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0148607112445580">65</xref></sup> that improved results could be achieved rather quickly,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0148607112445580">66</xref></sup> and that a protocol alone was not enough to be successful and improve results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0148607112445580">67</xref></sup> Using the experience from this multicenter collaboration and the expertise of CBO Kwaaliteetsintitut in the Netherlands, a training program using an ERAS database was set up, and several hospitals in the Netherlands participated in this program and successfully changed and improved practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0148607112445580">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0148607112445580">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Single-center studies also showed that indeed, the better the compliance to the protocol elements, the better the outcomes. Gustafsson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0148607112445580">70</xref></sup> showed that with the improvement of compliance from below 50% to above 90%, length of stay was brought down from 9.4 to 6 days and complications from 45% to 19% in 940 mixed colorectal cancer surgery patients. Discharge earlier was not associated with more readmissions. On the contrary, readmissions came down from 11% to 2%, showing that patients actually recovered faster. Further analysis showed that the 2 independent factors determining outcomes were carbohydrate treatment and avoiding overload of fluids. As a sign, again, of the interaction between different elements, carbohydrate treatment was associated with less IV fluid needs. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized trials with at least 4 elements of the ERAS protocol on the treatment group reported similar findings. It showed that length of stay after colonic resections was reduced by 2.5 days and complications reduced by 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607112445580">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Although surgery and perioperative care are constantly developing, it is often a very slow process to implement new care modalities into daily routines. Traditional care is associated with marked metabolic reactions with major catabolism rendering massive insulin resistance and protein losses, and in this setting, major complications and prolonged recovery are not uncommon. Today it is possible, using modern multimodal care principles, to avoid almost all of the negative sides of the metabolic responses and insulin resistance and render the patient in an anabolic state very fast even after major surgery. The employment of ERAS principles has been shown to markedly improve outcomes by reducing complications and speed up return of functions. An important mechanism behind these improvements is the understanding and control of metabolism. As much as surgeons like to believe that it is only the surgical skills that make the difference, recent insights have taught us that metabolic control is another important factor to recognize. With these insights, I feel that it is fair to say that metabolism and nutrition are back in the surgical arena today. The main challenge ahead is how to support units to employ modern perioperative care pathways for the further improvement of surgical care.</p>
