<p>The Rural Infrastructure and Agro-industries Division (AGS) of the FAO has been consistently producing scholarly and practical publications taking advantage of its unique vantage point and ability to marshall experiences from across the developing world that has proved to be immensely valuable to academicians and practitioners alike. The book under review reflects this particular strength and counts as yet another valuable contribution.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of papers selected through a competitive process of agro-industrial development workshop held in Beijing, China, in August 2009, as part of the technical programme of the Triennial Conference of the International Association of Agricultural Economists. As the editors state it, the mandate of this enterprise is to find enabling models and policies that support agro-industries development in the developing world. What lessons can be learned in agro-industrial development promotion worldwide, that can be valuable to the design of policies and strategies to favour investments, improve efficiency and foster competitiveness and inclusiveness in this sector?</p>
<p>Both the title and the framing of the core question that the project seeks to answer presume that agro-industries are important and their special promotion is perhaps essential. Understanding both these aspects is key to appreciating the endeavour of the editors. The editors discuss the former quite explicitly and indeed comprehensively in their introduction, but discuss the latter aspect less than desired. Agro-industries are indeed an important source of employment and income generation worldwide. In most developing countries, agro-industries are dominant in terms of their contribution to value-added in manufacturing, ranging between one third and two thirds of all manufacturing depending on the relative contribution of agriculture to the economy. They have important multiplier effects, on employment, income and when value-added is close to the areas of production can promote inclusive growth and equitable distribution of income gains. While its importance as a sector is well recognized, like the rural non-farm sector as a whole, which has often been described as a policy of no man’s land, the sphere of agro-enterprise development too, located as it is at the cusp of agriculture and manufacturing, poses particular challenges for policy making especially in the context of smallholder agriculture or artisanal production. Successes have come in diverse forms and contexts and different countries have crafted country-specific policies with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Given these twin issues, the book addresses an important imperative of our times and focuses, as the editors put it, on three broad themes: (i) models and approaches to agro-industrial development; (ii) agro-industrial development experiences in Africa, Latin America and Asia; and (iii) international experiences in commodity and technology development. The first four chapters, (Chapters 2–5) discuss alternative business models and approaches to agro-industrial development. Chapters 6 to 9 present agro-industrial development experiences in selected African countries, China and India. The third theme is covered in Chapters 10 to 13.</p>
<p>Edward Mabaya (Chapter 2) explores the use of business networks as an innovative institution as opposed to clustering and technology parks, which are necessarily confined to a space, though all of them share the essential features of networks. He examines the conditions of successful enterprises in the context of seed sector development in Africa. The issue of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) is the subject of Sukhpal Singh’s paper (Chapter 3) where he offers a comparative perspective between Thailand and India, examining its prospects and role along the supply chain. Francisco J. Bueso and co-authors explore the role of donors using the case of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Export Promotion Program for SMEs in El Salvador (Chapter 4). They highlight the role of research and development (R &amp; D) as a lever for securing donor funding but emphasize the role of targeted training and technical assistance and funding. They also underscore the role of networks in the flow of knowledge. John Wilkinson and co-authors elaborate on a very specific policy challenge of maintaining family enterprises in the context of an industrial agriculture (Chapter 5). Using the Brazilian experience with agro-industry pilot project PRONAF (National Program for the Strengthening of Family Agriculture), the authors illustrate a policy intervention that has involved and represented diverse actors from state and society in achieving its goal.</p>
<p>The papers that address the second theme put forth experiences in specific regions. Vasant Gandhi and Dinesh Jain provide detailed descriptions on the mosaic of models that constitute the agro-industrial sector in India trying to extract learnings from the experiences with these models (Chapter 6). Hugh Deng throws light on one of the best known large scale pan-national policy interventions in the world, namely China’s township and village enterprises (Chapter 7). Mustafa Jouli similarly addresses national policy making in Tunisia focusing on levers to promote investment (Chapter 8). Paul Thangata and co-authors discuss the nuts and bolts of the PPPs in sub-Saharan Africa relating to fertilizer market development (Chapter 9).</p>
<p>Collectively, these contributions present a wide variety of business models and approaches in developing countries, including those driven by business networks, agro-based clusters, food parks, export processing zones and other types of alliances. They also demonstrate that while these initiatives might be private sector led or public sector driven, PPPs have emerged as important. Essentially, the merits of PPPs are well-recognized; these empirical accounts demonstrate the efficacy and challenges of PPPs in practice. As the editors point out, it is evident from the contributions that PPPs facilitate sharing of risks and costs, catalyze technological development, dissemination and adoption and have the potential to realize greater impact where resources are limited. In general, cluster-based approaches seem to be especially beneficial to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), as they offer economies of scale that enhance competitiveness. All the authors attempt consciously to identify key elements of successful models or adoption of innovative technologies, for instance, the role of capacity-building activities, extension, financial backing and technological development along the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The chapters focused on commodities offer a detailed and careful analysis of commodity based approaches delineating how the state can leverage the natural emergence of clusters and take these to the next level in terms of addressing broader concerns of poverty and rural development. The discussion of the mango cluster in southern India (Mysore Sudha and Froukje Kruijssen, Chapter 10), cassava in Africa (Lateef Sanni in Chapter 11 and Adebayo Abas and co-authors in Chapter 12) and horticulture in Vietnam (Katinka Weinberger and Antonio L Acedo Jr. in Chapter 13) each bring out the power and scope of focused attention to value addition in specific commodities either for export or for domestic markets. All the contributions are very rich and provide valuable insights into the functioning and the structure of markets as also the role of policy in very specific spatio-temporal contexts. As the editors point out in their introduction, the choice of targeted commodities is strategic in nature either from a comparative/competitive advantage or economic development/poverty reduction perspective. For example, in Ghana and Nigeria where cassava is a staple crop, the governments have provided incentives and resources collectively known as Presidential Initiatives for the processing and utilization of the crop. Other governments have established Export Processing Zones (EPZ) and agro-processing units to enhance commercial export oriented agriculture.</p>
<p>The diversity of contributions in terms of coverage, depth and approaches presents a huge challenge for editors. They have however done a remarkable job in collating them and extracting lessons from these. For the sake of clarity and brevity, this review focusses on the salient findings rather than discussing in detail the individual contributions in the voluminous work.</p>
<p>As the editors point out, most of the institutional and policy interventions discussed in the book have focused on SMEs, either representing farmer interests or constituting farmers themselves (as in cooperatives). These reflect the dominance of SMEs in the agro-industrial sector of developing countries, whether oriented towards exports or domestic markets. Further, all the papers in the volume acknowledge that supportive policies and institutions are critical for accelerating the development of agro-industries. This is of course the dominant message of the project itself, but it is also worth noting that the two are linked. The scale of these enterprises, especially in the context of large scale industrial agriculture, demands the provision of an enabling environment that support their existence. This is the case even when these small enterprises have emerged without any specific policy impetus from the state. A third aspect that comes through is the need for these institutional and policy interventions to evolve over time and space in response to prevailing challenges and opportunities, be it in their respective economies or in the larger global context, with a sensitivity to particular social and economic imperatives. The story of Brazil’s PRONAF illustrates this particularly well.</p>
<p>Another recurring point throughout and one that the editors pick to highlight is that beyond the traditional financial incentives, governments across the world have come up with innovative market incentives (blending regulations, for instance) and institutional purchases to address market uncertainties that would in turn reduce the risks associated with the investments. Invariably, an important ingredient that the editors emphasize is stakeholder ownership and commitment to initiatives if new approaches are to be sustainable and successful. Overall, it is clear that while agro-industries promotion itself is an important issue, it is equally important to acknowledge that ability to intervene in a dynamic environment calls for considerable creativity.</p>
<p>The editors have met the challenge of combining the very diverse subjects of the papers quite successfully. One would however have liked to see a more rigorous documentation in some of the contributions. Some papers suffer from sticking to generalities and the reader is burdened with the task of gleaning lessons that are not entirely obvious, despite the editors’ insightful introduction. Perhaps the imposition of more parameters on the authors in terms of data presented could have enabled interesting comparisons.</p>
<p>The discussion of agro-enterprises in the context of inputs, be it seed or fertilizer, is a valuable illustration of the role of PPP along the entire chain, but sits somewhat oddly with the other discussions mainly because the issue of agro-enterprise is motivated with an overwhelming focus on the use of agricultural produce as raw materials. The editors do point out for example that Malawi PPPs have been instrumental in ensuring access to inputs by small-scale producers; this in turn has impacted productivity positively and resulted in a steady flow of raw materials for agro-processing. Nevertheless, there is a need to go beyond this, to reconceptualize the role of agro-enterprises in more holistic and comprehensive ways. This perhaps calls for another project another time.</p>
