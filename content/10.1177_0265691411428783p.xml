<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783p"><title>Miriam Eliav-Feldon, Benjamin Isaac and Joseph Ziegler, eds., <italic>The Origins of Racism in the West</italic>, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2009; 333 pp., 42 illus; 9780521888554, £59.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>Any book expressly using the term ‘racism’ in its title and not about the twentieth century is bound to be controversial. The term, and the book’s contents, are taken from the ‘Racism in Western Civilization before 1700’ Gilman International Conference held at Tel Aviv University in 2005, though Benjamin Isaac’s recent book, <italic>The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity</italic>, is clearly also influential. The book broadly aims to chart the development of ideas of racism within Europe from the fifth century BC to 1700.</p>
<p>As with so many claims about the nature of race and racism, readers will inevitably disagree with some assertions. This is particularly the case with the ‘Introduction’ by the editors. In addition to describing modern ‘racism’ as ‘a clearly defined ideology’ (1), they also claim racism was ‘an attempt to justify prejudice and discrimination through an apparently rational analysis of presumed empirical facts’ (4). ‘Racism’ is separate from ‘other forms of prejudice and chauvinism’ because ‘the former claims that the characteristics of the other are determined by nature while the latter attributes them to custom, social forces or education and the like’ (12).</p>
<p>These claims are problematic for several reasons, including the self-acknowledged point that the term ‘racism’ clearly did not exist during the period under investigation. To get around this, the authors almost uniformly describe attempts to give prejudice an intellectual framework as ‘proto-racism’, or ‘the prototype of racism… in the full sense, but it is an early form which precedes Darwin, based on pre-modern scientific concepts’ (Isaac, 33). Yet this assumes that a standardized notion of ‘racism’ did at some point come into being, just as it assumes that what constitutes a ‘scientific concept’, modern or otherwise, is always clear. For a modern historian, this simplistic depiction of modernity grates.</p>
<p>The issue of definitions is further complicated by the editors’ insistence that racism (and implicitly proto-racism) ‘should include any systematic attempt to rationalize the division of human beings in groups based on presumed inborn physical and other characteristics’ (10). This would seem to include aspects such as madness or promiscuity, often thought to be hereditary, while possibly excluding negative Greek attitudes towards Africans, as shown in David Goldenberg’s chapter. Insisting on the narrow focus of ‘racism’ or proto-racism’ rather than wider human difference can, in consequence, seem a rather arbitrary and a-historical approach.</p>
<p>However, the editors should be celebrated for putting together a collection of papers that apply and challenge their premises in an almost uniformly strong and provocative way. The interesting range of chapters are divided chronologically, beginning with ‘Antiquity’, which covers ‘Racism: A Rationalization of Prejudice in Greece and Rome’ by Benjamin Isaac; ‘The Invention of Persia in Classical Athens’ by H. A. Shapiro; David Goldenberg’s nuanced interpretation of how Africans were viewed by the Greeks; and ‘Early Christian Universalism and Modern Forms of Racism’ by Denise Kimber Buell.</p>
<p>The second section, ‘The Middle Ages’, covers the period from c. 1100, when direct European contact with the outside world began to increase, and focuses on evolving scientific understandings of the body and environment in Peter Biller and Joseph Ziegler’s chapters, and on an intriguing theme of ‘blood’ in chapters by Charles de Miramon and David Nirenberg. Like Shapiro, Robert Bartlett engages less with the conceptualization of ‘racism’ and focuses on how imagery demonstrates racial attitudes in the Medieval period, especially the depiction of non-Europeans. Valentin Groebner, meanwhile, examines the relationship between sex and racism in his chapter about ‘miscegenation’.</p>
<p>The final section, the ‘Early Modern Period’, reflects the growing religious strife in Europe and the expansion of European empires. Ronnie Po-chia Hsia looks at the different ways in which Protestants and Catholics viewed Jewish conversion in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, while Miriam Eliav-Feldon examines attitudes towards Gypsies, a subject too often neglected in existing studies. Anthony Pagden, typically masterful, and Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra, meanwhile, provide cogent examinations of the interplay between ideas of difference and imperial expansion.</p>
<p>Despite some obvious differences, the authors jointly argue that the intellectual framework of racism, and the very languages used within modern Europe to describe ethnicity and race all originate within Greek culture and were transmitted through later intellectual writings which depended heavily on Greek sources. Actually ‘proving’ the link between pre-1700 discourse and modern ideas is not always convincing: there is an emphasis on elite sources, and the editors admit that the book fails to provide a consistent definition of racism. However, there are only a few weak chapters and the book is a rich dialogue about the myriad ways historians understand and write about human difference. Such a book will undoubtedly fuel further debates about the intellectual history of racism in Europe.</p>
