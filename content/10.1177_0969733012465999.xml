<abstract>
<p>College students have become more representative as blood donors, mainly to help other people. This study ascertained the association between spirituality and adherence or intention to donate blood in post-graduate students. In this quantitative and cross-sectional study, participants were 281 students from a post-graduate programme at a Brazilian public university. After complying with ethical requirements, data were collected through a questionnaire for sociodemographic characterization and identification of blood donation practices, followed by the Spiritual Well-Being Scale. Descriptive statistics and parametric tests were used for data analysis. A total of 74% of the participants were female and 26% were male. Previous experience and/or intention to donate blood were found in 75.3%; 14.3% donated blood periodically. In addition, 12.2% were not adept to donation and 12.5% were inapt. Spiritual Well-Being scores were similar between individuals who are not adept and those who donate periodically. In conclusion, in the sample, spirituality and blood donation are not associated, but spiritual well-being and gender are. To enhance blood donation, further research is needed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spirituality and medicine have always been closely linked. Recent studies have indicated its importance, ranging from patients’ clinical recovery to its acknowledgement as a determinant factor in quality of life, due to the greater probability of good health habits, supportive behaviours towards other people and psychological well-being in people with a spiritual view towards life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733012465999">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The spirituality concept is complex, multidimensional and comprises several factors that can vary according to the individual’s life and experience. In this study, we consider spirituality as characterized by values related to the self, to others, to nature, to life or to something that is considered finite.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012465999">2</xref>
</sup> Through spirituality, an internal (body, mind and spirit) and external (people, environment, living beings and universe) integration exists, granting vitality and meaning to life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012465999">3</xref>
</sup> Some common points are found between the concepts of spirituality and religiosity, although both refer to different domains. Religiosity can be understood as a system organized in beliefs, practices, rituals and symbols that offer proximity with the sacred, the transcendent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733012465999">4</xref>
</sup> Aspects related to this process can influence individuals' personal life and level of religious involvement, affecting their habits and their relation with the world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733012465999">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733012465999">6</xref>
</sup> Spirituality, on the other hand, refers to a more personal, private domain of beliefs and values that are not necessarily related to collective religious practice.</p>
<p>Among different components of man’s spirituality, altruism arouses our attention because, in some studies, it has been seen as the main motivation for spontaneous blood donation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733012465999">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733012465999">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012465999">8</xref>
</sup> The French philosopher Auguste Comte, one of the idealizers of positivism, introduced the word ‘altruism’. It is based on observation and experience, and its general formula includes love out of principle (altruism), based on order (organization of society) and aiming for progress. In Comte’s definition, altruism is the virtue that refers to the attitude of living for other people. For a person to be altruistic, he or she needs to dominate the egoistic instincts that naturally exist in all human beings, revealing the benevolent dispositions that are also present in the essence of the being.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733012465999">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In Brazil, the constant lack of blood can be considered a public health problem. In that sense, knowledge is needed on the main reasons why people donate blood, as well as further investigation of why a large majority of the population does not, so as to propose strategies to strengthen donor capture. In this context, we raise the hypothesis that donating blood may be related to broader factors such as spirituality.</p>
<p>Brazilian Ministry of Health Decree No. 1.353, issued on 13 June 2011, sets guidelines for haemotherapy services, determining that any blood donation should be voluntary, anonymous, altruistic and neither directly nor indirectly remunerated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733012465999">10</xref>
</sup> Haemotherapy services are specialized sectors that require nurses’ knowledge with a view to responsible and competent action. Considering the importance and complexity of haemotherapy services, the Federal Nursing Council (COFEN) issued COFEN Resolution No. 200/1997, which establishes rules for nursing professionals’ activities in haemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733012465999">11</xref>
</sup> One of the explanations for this degree of complexity is the fact that haemotherapy nurses deal with different ethical premises, ranging from the production of blood components, which demand an analysis of donors’ habits and attitudes, to patients’ transfusion needs. In this context, nursing plays different roles, including blood donor capture to respond to transfusion demands. Therefore, research on attitudes that can support the development of new blood-related policies to attract other donors is extremely necessary.</p>
<p>As young individuals in good health, over the years, college students have become a more representative group among blood donors, mainly motivated by the intent to help other people.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012465999">12</xref>
</sup> The aim of this study was to ascertain the association between spiritual well-being and adherence or intention to donate blood in a population of post-graduate students.</p>

<sec id="section2-0969733012465999" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This descriptive and cross-sectional quantitative research involved a sample of post-graduate students in health at a public university. The study was developed after authorization had been obtained from the Research Ethics Committee at the Clinics Hospital of the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto Medical School (HCFMRP-USP), in Opinion 8508/2010. After receiving information about the research aims, students were invited to answer two questionnaires and formalized their acceptance through the signing of the informed consent form, guaranteeing their anonymity and data confidentiality, as well as the possibility to drop out of the research at any time, preserving the respect for ethical values, whether in nursing research, clinical care or any other related activity as one of the foundations of the nursing profession.</p>
<p>A convenience sample of students in a <italic>stricto sensu</italic> post-graduation programme at a public university in São Paulo State, Brazil, was obtained. The students had a background in Biomedicine, Occupational therapy, Medicine, Nutrition, Nursing, Physiotherapy, Dentistry, Pharmacy or Psychology. All students properly enrolled in one statistics subject were included, blood donors or not, above 18 years of age and independent of religious belief, who formalized their acceptance through the signing of the Informed Consent Term. Out of 301 invited students, 281 participated.</p>
<p>The researchers collected the data during the students’ academic activities, in the classroom, with the help of two printed questionnaires. The first comprised the research subjects’ characteristics and the second the Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012465999">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012465999">14</xref>
</sup> Both questionnaires were easy to complete, with a total answer time of approximately 15 min. The researchers stayed in the classroom during the application of the questionnaire and clarified any doubts that came up.</p>
<p>Paloutzian and Ellison<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733012465999">13</xref>
</sup> developed the SWBS in the United States in the 1970s. It is a pioneering instrument on the theme and is considered a reference for authors who design spirituality measures. Other scales exist, including Spiritual Involvement and Beliefs Scale; Mental, Physical and Spiritual Well-Being Scale and Spiritual Issues Assessment, among others. This instrument was chosen because it is widely used and has been previously tested in different contexts,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012465999">14</xref>
</sup> besides the fact that it adapted better to the present research objectives and is easy to understand and apply. It was validated in Brazil in the year 2000, in the analysis of the original scale, and high reliability rates were obtained.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733012465999">14</xref>
</sup> The SWBS consists of 20 questions, and answers should be given on a 5-point Likert scale. The total scale score is the sum of scores for the 20 questions, with a possible range from 20 to 120. The two following subscales are included: the Religious Well-Being Scale (RWB) and the Existential Well-Being Scale (EWB). The RWB corresponds to the sum of scores on the 10 even questions and the EWB corresponds to that of the 10 uneven questions. Higher values indicate greater religious well-being and greater existential well-being.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>According to answers on the participants’ attitudes towards blood donation, data were grouped in four groups for analysis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Group I</italic>. Individuals who donated blood once and intend to donate again;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>

</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>

<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Group IV</italic>. Individuals who have previously donated but who do not intend to return for further donations, those who do not intend to donate and those who have never considered the possibility of donating.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>After grouping the data, statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.2. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to test the associations between SWBS scores and classifications of attitudes towards blood donation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although increasing, the number of college students who donate blood in Brazil still does not represent a considerable group among donors. This contributes to the reduced blood supply at times of heightened demand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733012465999">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733012465999">15</xref>
</sup> Knowledge on the donor profile and their sociodemographic variables, opinions, motivations and feelings contribute to the design and development of public health policies that educate, mobilize and encourage new voluntary donors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733012465999">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The mean age for blood donation was 28.2 years, in line with the report ‘Profile of Brazilian Blood Donors’<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733012465999">17</xref>
</sup> and coherent with the young population, in good state of health, and with great potential for blood donation. Concerning the religious variable, Catholicism was most participants’ belief, followed by Spiritism, with a predominance of women in both religions. In Brazil, according to data by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in the year 2000, most of the population was Catholic, followed by a small percentage of Spiritists. In social groups with higher education levels, however, the Spiritist religion is more frequent than in the general population.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733012465999">18</xref>
</sup> There is a greater probability that religious individuals will practice acts of charity when compared with people without religious bonds.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733012465999">19</xref>
</sup> As blood donation represents an attitude of benevolence, some kind of relation is expected between religiosity and attitudes towards blood donation.</p>
<p>In some countries, studies show that, besides altruism, religious beliefs can be considered the second most frequent motivation for blood donation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733012465999">20</xref>
</sup> In others, however, religiosity was not associated with the history of blood donation, except in Catholic men between 35 and 44 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733012465999">21</xref>
</sup> Most participants consider that they are free to perform and practice their beliefs and convictions and have close friends who for some reason disapprove of blood donation. Among those who had donated once and intend to return for further donations, a small part did this because they felt pressured by other people and knew about some receiver’s need. Periodic donors, people who intend to return for new donations or people who intend to become blood donors have relatives who donate and also talk to their friends about the importance of donating, which indicates that discussions about the theme and family examples contribute, or not, to the post-graduate students’ adherence to this practice; they do not represent a decisive factor for this attitude though.<sup>

<p>Normally, at first, voluntary donors are guided by a request, which can come from a friend or relative who needs blood.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733012465999">22</xref>
</sup> Yet, various other factors and aspects contribute to make individuals donate blood, such as reward in work hours, publicity, social pressure and serology tests. Many people turn to haemotherapy units not for an altruistic act but to get serology tests related to sexually transmitted diseases,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733012465999">8</xref>
</sup> representing one of the main problems in the production of high-quality blood components.</p>
<p>Perceptions on blood donation can differ among donors and people who have never donated. Non-donors do not see donation as an important voluntary act.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733012465999">23</xref>
</sup> In the study sample, the Kruskal–Wallis test evidenced no association between the SWBS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0969733012465999">1</xref>), RWB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0969733012465999">2</xref>) and EWB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0969733012465999">3</xref>) and attitudes towards blood donation. As observed, assiduous donors (group I), people who intend to return for new donations (group II) and even people who intend to donate (group III) display similar scores compared to people who have previously donated and do not intend to return (group IV), people who have never donated and do not intend to (group IV) and those who have never considered the possibility of donating (group IV). Therefore, the similar scores between individuals who are not adept to donating or do not intend to donate, as opposed to periodic donor or people who intend to donate, explain the lack of association between SWBS, RWB and EWB.</p>
<p>There has been great discussion in recent times about the importance of addressing spirituality-related issues in undergraduate programmes, not only in nursing but also in all human health programmes. The scenario, however, reveals colleges’ resistance against the inclusion of complex disciplines such as spirituality in their course curricula, feeling unprepared or even believing that this theme should only be discussed in the intimate sphere.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733012465999">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There is a great gap in literature on the relation between spirituality variables and blood donation. Some studies demonstrate a significant correlation between spiritual well-being and health,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733012465999">25</xref>
</sup> defending the idea that individuals’ opening to the spiritual dimension can enhance their potential towards self-accomplishment and personal growth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733012465999">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It can be inferred that some college students who are blood donors have been driven by values that include love of other people. As mentioned, among others, principles of beliefs related to the well-being of people, the environment and all living beings, in short the universe, characterize spirituality. Today, these values have set the tone and even paradigms in health institutions, specifically in nursing service organizations, with a view of achievement and more adequate development of each person’s potential as a Being in professional life.</p>
<p>Organizations today, more than ever, are considered live systems of human beings and, thus, start to demand that their human capital be willing to act not only on the dimensions of body and mind but also on the spiritual dimension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733012465999">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To respond to health institutions’ current demands, conducts permeated by the ethics of attitudinal commitment are requested from nurses. One dimension of attitudinal commitment is related to interiority. In this perspective, nurses' work is based on the acknowledgement of their own interior reality and other people's acceptance, the ability to feel compassion, understanding and the feeling of generosity.</p>
<p>In this more humane environment, the care delivered, high-quality and personalized services, and the way caregivers relate with their work go beyond DOING and reach the dimension of BEING.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The results presented in this article do not evidence that graduate students’ attitudes towards blood donation are related to their spirituality, measured according to the SWBS and its subscales, leading to the conclusion that further research is needed to explain the factors associated with the act of blood donation. Deeper knowledge of sociodemographic variables, attitudes, values and beliefs is needed and is fundamental for the future development of haemotherapy.</p>
