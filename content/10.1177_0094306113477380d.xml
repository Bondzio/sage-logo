<body>
<p>The <italic>Mansfield [CT] Independent News</italic> arrived in my mailbox the other day. Perhaps because I had been thinking about the two books under review here, I was struck by the line under its bold-faced title: “‘Information is the currency of democracy.’ Thomas Jefferson.” Both <italic>After Broadcast News</italic> (by communications scholars Bruce Williams and Michael Delli Carpini) and <italic>The Space of Opinion</italic> (by sociologists Ronald Jacobs and Eleanor Townsley) emphasize how vital public information is to the maintenance of a democratic government; the communications team is more direct than sociologists in addressing the neoliberal market for information.</p>
<p>Instead of discarding the free four-page monthly, I read it, googled its three-person staff, and felt it captured the transformation of media that the two books discuss. Here is why: The “Independent” seemed independent in name only; like early nineteenth-century newspapers, it expressed its ideological commitment regarding the activities of the town council. Its publisher is the head of the Republican Town Committee. Its editor used to write an often vitriolic blog about town government on the local <italic>Patch</italic> (owned by AOL) that, unsolicited, had began to appear in the inbox of my university account a year or so ago. While a vitriolic newspaper story may still be an oxymoron, these days a vitriolic blog is not. On <italic>Patch</italic>, the editor’s column was accompanied by a bright color-photo in which she embraces a statue of Thomas Jefferson in the manner associated with family snapshots. She also is a regular at town meetings and she sometimes contributes nasty criticisms of the council and its Democratic majority during the broadcast of the town council meetings on a public-access channel of the local cable provider. Like the famous broadside attacks aimed at Thomas Jefferson, her tone does not seem politely rational to me. All told, that is a lot of local political commentary available in a town of roughly 15,000 people, not counting the students who live on the University of Connecticut campus.</p>
<p>Although I can have face-to-face exposure to local political events, I experience them through the media. I have no choice but to encounter non-local events through the media. The authors of the two books under review would probably find me a responsible and informed citizen. I watch news and opinion shows, read several on-line newspapers, and when I am driving, I sometimes listen to the radio talk-shows of people whom I believe to be despicable reactionaries. (I want to know what they are thinking, but I do not think they care much about me.) Partly because of my choices, partly through the structure of communication in a complex society, the media do indeed actively filter the world for me. They have not merely annexed, but replaced Habermas’ mythic eighteenth-century coffee shop where male citizens informally discussed the political matters of an emerging democratic society.</p>
<p>The scads of information which I routinely encounter seem to affirm the common understanding that more news and opinion is available in the digital age, and so we have all experienced an increase in digital democracy. However, some social scientists find that digital democracy may be a myth, because the “Internet has shifted … the bar of exclusivity from the <italic>production</italic> to the <italic>filtering</italic> of political information” (Hindman, p. 13, emphasis in the original). For instance, with its combination of political news and gossip about stars, Yahoo receives 3.8 billion page views a day. Before, corporate gatekeepers filtered what could become news. Now anyone with access to a computer can post a political blog, but even larger conglomerated gatekeepers decide what information people will routinely encounter. To be sure, some people eschew the routine. Exemplifying processes described decades ago, they seek out sources of information which will affirm their own opinions. As users selectively expose themselves, relatively few online newspapers and blogs become more powerful and the others lose their economic base. Rather than becoming more enlightened about the viewpoints of those with whom they disagree, these users reinforce their belief in their own political rectitude; they become politically stubborn.</p>
<p>The authors of both <italic>After Broadcast News</italic> and <italic>The Space of Opinion</italic> worry about democracy in the digital age. To discuss what is happening to Jefferson’s “currency of democracy,” Jacobs and Townsley present results of content analyses about how expressions of political opinions have changed across media from the years 1993–1994 to 2001–2002. Jacobs and Townsley also discuss entertainment as opinion; they introduce their data with an historical and theoretical understanding of American media. In <italic>After Broadcast News</italic>, Williams and Delli Carpini offer a terrific historical treatment of the transformation of the mediated information called news in the United States. They emphasize that the conflation of news and entertainment is not a novel phenomenon; the Yahoo homepage reproduces the mix of information typical of the first page of a mid-nineteenth-century newspaper. Even though Williams and Delli Carpini present a very idealistic vision of a democratic debate about the next media regime and perhaps because Jacobs and Townsley pay limited attention to the economic interests of the media and to issues of raw power, the two sociologists seem more naïve.</p>
<p><italic>After Broadcast News</italic> is a history of American media systems and a prayer for the future. The book departs from other histories by specifically addressing a key issue in our own time: how news and entertainment were once joined to one another and are inextricably linked again. Williams and Delli Carpini use the term “media regime” to refer to “a historically specific relatively stable set of institutions, norms, processes, and actors that shape the expectations and practices of media producers and consumers” and note that the word regime “signals the degree to which any stable media system depends on actions by the state….” (p. 16). By treating media regimes as social formations, the product of social choices, rather than technological inevitability, they emphasize how media systems are shaped by interactions and struggles between the media and the state. These influence what information media present and how they present it. Deploying terms introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477380">John Fiske (1996)</xref>, they remind us that contemporary renderings of political occurrences are “multiaxial;” they revolve around representations of multiple media so that these media realities meld with everyday reality to produce a “hyperreality,” defined as “‘a postmodern sense of the real that accounts for our loss of certainty in being able to distinguish clearly and hierarchically between…the modes of its representation’” (p. 118). Again quoting Fiske they note that multiaxiality “transforms any stability of categories into the fluidities of power” (p. 120). The authors hope that recognition of this transformation and that their analysis of earlier media ages will free us from blithely accepting the practices of the Age of Broadcast News (the 1930s through the 1980s) as the appropriate, even proper way of talking politics. (The 1930s saw the inauguration of state regulation of radio and television supposedly to serve the public good, a policy transformed in the 1980s when the Soviet bloc collapsed and neoliberalism emerged as a new political and regulatory principle.) Before the explosion of media, Williams and Delli Carpini point out that Americans had accepted the objectivity of professional journalists as the norm and insistently distinguished between news and entertainment. These norms and distinctions no longer work. Not only do many twenty-somethings get their news from <italic>The Daily Show</italic>, from Facebook or from Tweets, but today producers are no longer distinct from users. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477380">Bruns [2008]</xref> has termed these producers/users “produsers;” c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094306113477380">Oscar Westlund 2011</xref>.) Whether employed by a media organization or blogging at home in pajamas, many produsers do not abide by the professional code of objectivity that dominated the news media for much of the twentieth century. Some contemporary political exchanges, especially those on talk radio, cable news, and blogs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094306113477380">Sobieraj and Berry 2011</xref>), have more in common with the vitriolic attacks directed at Thomas Jefferson than the rational exchanges among informal groups. The authors hope that their explanation of how the Age of Broadcast News both expressed and shaped its times will open us to the possibilities inherent in our emerging media age.</p>
<p>Wisely, Williams and Delli Carpini do not attempt to predict the shape of the emerging media regime, but hope that there will be active public debate about its characteristics. Without informed debate, they argue, “the democratic potential of this new environment will likely be lost to a series of incremental decisions largely driven by market forces and entrenched political interests” (p. 289), as happened when earlier media regimes emerged. Their hopes for such a debate are quite idealistic: it should involve transparency, pluralism, verisimilitude, and practice to create a democratic media environment and they provide extended discussions of what they mean by these terms. “Transparency” refers to “the ability of participants in politically relevant, mediated communication to know who is speaking to them,” including knowledge of the “economic interests of a movie studio” (p. 289), as well as those of a newspaper chain, to be able to assess sincerity and authenticity of the people, organizations, and institutions being mediated, and finally an audience familiar with the rules used to construct public information. “Pluralism” indicates “openness of the media environment to diverse points of view and the equal accessibility of these different views” (p. 295). Because “[b]oth transparency and pluralism take as a given that truth and objectivity are problematic concepts that have lost their authority,” Williams and Delli Carpini praise verisimilitude, defined as “the likelihood or probability of truth” that requires “authors of any media text be aware of and take responsibility for its deeper truth claims, even if these claims are not strictly verifiable in any formal sense” (p. 305). Williams and Delli Carpini cannot explain how the debate will avoid the partisanship and entertaining nastiness of Rush Limbaugh, Bill O’Reilly, or Keith Olbermann. By practice, they refer to the use of the media to model appropriate interactions and to participate in political engagement. While the authors thus recognize that news/entertainment is not rational, they nonetheless fervently hope that debate about the emerging media system will not succumb to a pugilistic metaphor (accusation/counter-accusation; punch/counterpunch). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094306113477380">1937</xref>, Leo Rosten tried to explain why so many news accounts sounded like a reprise of a boxing match rather than a sophisticated analysis of, say, economic policies. He wrote “journalists place a premium on conflict, particularly conflicts between well-known persons. An attack is news” (Rosten: 258). Those conflict-ridden accounts helped to sell newspapers, as did the comics page and movie reviews. Williams and Delli Carpini recognize that the media are businesses. They nonetheless hope that open debate will enable the state to design a media regime that serves citizens, not merely corporations.</p>
<p>In <italic>The Space of Opinion</italic>, Jacobs and Townsley engage in a radically different enterprise. Rather than looking at how the form of news changes as media regimes succeed one another, they address patterns of opinion and commentary found in the seemingly expanded media environment (“seemingly,” because if the point of elite control has indeed shifted from news production to dissemination, the range of opinion available in the media may not have expanded all that much). For them, the space of opinion, such as newspaper columns and political talk shows, represents “mediated deliberation” which can be “successful” without being “fair” and extends beyond the supposedly objective page of news reports. They set out to learn how different media formats tend to encourage different kinds of speakers and performative styles (p. 71). They ask this question, because they want “to link the normative commitments of the three ideal-typical models [of mediated communication] with their different degrees of tolerance and preference for specific parts of the media space” (loc. cit.). These are the “rational model,” “Habermasian theories of informal publics and complex democracy,” and “cultural models…recognizing…drama, disagreement, and strategic communication.” To oversimplify, they are asking who is correct, the followers of Robert Park, Jürgen Habermas, or Jeffrey Alexander? Also, do some theories apply to some media spaces but not others? If so, what are the consequences?</p>
<p>Jacobs and Townsley seek their answer in content analyses of the opinion columns of two very different national newspapers, <italic>The New York Times</italic> and <italic>USA Today</italic>, and patterns of appearances on four distinctive Sunday morning talk shows, <italic>Face the Nation</italic> (CBS), <italic>Crossfire</italic> (CNN), <italic>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</italic> (PBS), and <italic>Hannity &amp; Colmes</italic> (Fox News). Identifying both the media and the commentators with cultural fields, they ask who writes for which newspaper and appears on which TV show. Are members of one branch of government more likely to appear on one kind of show than another? Are “think-tank intellectuals” (as Jacobs and Townsley call them) more likely to appear on talk shows than to write newspaper columns? (They are.)</p>
<p>The patterns might be interesting, but how do they matter? And are data about a ten-year period sufficient to get an inkling of the future? Do the patterns foretell a less centrist political environment than had been typical during the Age of Broadcast News? Jacobs and Townsley answer yes and no: the proliferation of opinion formats has created a dense environment replete with “intertexual references…this circulation of opinion still works from the center, where authoritative opinions are produced, and then moves outward” (p. 239). Newspaper op-ed pages and Sunday talk shows reference one another. The cable shows, such as <italic>The O’Reilly Factor</italic>, reference the mainstream media in “a critical way with the suggestion that those formats are biased, elitist or limited.” And even newer formats, such as <italic>The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</italic> and the now defunct <italic>Countdown with Keith Olbermann</italic>, in turn criticize them. Jacobs and Townsley hope that this “nested cross-commentary”—this “ensemble of spaces and…the nature of critical dialogue that takes place between them”—is “a fundamental part of the quest for a more just and rational civil society” (p. 246). I do not share Jacobs and Townsley’s confidence that more media contribute to more democracy. In the short run, I experience political stubbornness and hear railing diatribe.</p>
<p>Ultimately Jacobs and Townsley, and to a lesser extent Williams and Delli Carpini, are optimists because they minimize the raw power of the media. I am not referring to theories about how the media influence public opinion or even ideas about how the media are a filter. Nor am I disparaging Williams and Delli Carpini’s sophisticated discussion of the construction of hyperreality. Rather, for me, the difference between optimistic American and more realistic European theories is captured by the distinction between two verbs—mediate and mediatize. Both sets of authors use the American terms “mediate” and “mediation.” The process of “mediatization” is more redolent of power. As the Danish scholar Stig Hjarvard has explained, the term “mediatization” refers to “a double-sided process of high modernity in which the media emerge as an independent institution with a logic of [their] own” to which other institutions must accommodate and “also become an integrated part of other institutions,” such as “politics, work, family and religion, as more and more of these institutional activities are performed through both interactive and mass media” (Hjarvard: 105). Those media have such power that Hjarvard’s definition has replaced the older meaning of mediatization: to annex one state to another state, allowing the former ruler to maintain his title and some authority.</p>
<p>The problem of mediatization is quite complex. It is not just that newspapers (online and hard copy), television, radio, blogs, magazines, movies, a smart phone, and even popular songs filter the information (news/entertainment) that I know about my town and about national and international affairs. The filtering or mediation matters, as both Jacobs and Townsley and Williams and Delli Carpini point out in very different analyses of representations of 9/11 and the American war on terror. (Williams and Delli Carpini’s discussion includes such entertainment as network talk shows.) It is even more important that a myriad of institutions design themselves to be presented in the media and in doing so, they may take the rules that govern the media as their own rules. Put somewhat differently, as institutions and individuals produce themselves, they embody the media.</p>
<p>These two very useful books forced me to clarify my ideas. I recommend them as a way to start thinking about political institutions in today’s media environment.</p>
