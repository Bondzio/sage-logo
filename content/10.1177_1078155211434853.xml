<sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are routinely used as first-line adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors. The current recommended length of treatment with an AI is 5 years. Arthralgias have been frequently cited as the primary reason for discontinuation of AI therapy. Various treatment strategies are proposed in literature, but a standardized treatment algorithm has not been established. The initial purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and management of AI-induced arthralgias in patients treated at Kellogg Cancer Center (KCC).

<sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The retrospective chart review included 206 adult patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who were receiving adjuvant therapy with an AI. A multidisciplinary treatment team consisting of pharmacists, collaborative practice nurses, and physicians met to develop a standardized treatment algorithm and corresponding EMR documentation tool. The treatment algorithm and documentation tool were developed after the study to better monitor and proactively treat patients with AI-induced arthralgias.</p></sec>
<sec><title>Results/conclusions:</title><p>The overall incidence of arthralgias at KCC was 48% (<italic>n</italic> = 98/206). Of these patients, 32% were documented as having arthralgias within the first 6 months of therapy initiation. Patients who reported AI-induced arthralgias were younger than patients who did not report AI-induced arthralgias (61 vs. 65 years, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002). There was no statistical difference in the incidence of arthralgias in patients with a history of chemotherapy (including taxane therapy) compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy (<italic>p</italic> = 0.352). Of patients presenting with AI-induced arthralgias, 41% did not have physician-managed treatment documented in the EMR. A standardized treatment algorithm and electronic chart documentation tools were then developed by the multidisciplinary team.</p></sec>

<p>Breast cancer is a common cause of cancer-related deaths in women in the United States, second only to lung cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211434853">1</xref></sup> Approximately 207,100 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in 2010 and an estimated 40,000 breast cancer patients died of the disease during the same time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155211434853">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aromatase inhibitors (AIs), anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, are routinely used as first-line adjuvant treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women and as second-line adjuvant treatment, after tamoxifen therapy, in premenopausal women. AIs are also indicated for first-line treatment of hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155211434853">2</xref></sup> In the United States, in 2010, a reported 566,000 patients were receiving therapy with an AI. (Source: Novartis US 2011) The choice of treatment, AI or tamoxifen, depends on numerous variables including patient age, menses status, tolerability, as well as co-morbid conditions. The current recommended length of treatment with an AI is 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211434853">3</xref></sup> Frequently cited adverse effects associated with AI therapy include hot flashes, insomnia, fatigue, osteoporosis, and arthralgias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155211434853">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Arthralgias are often underreported adverse events related to treatment with AIs and are frequently cited as the primary reason for lack of compliance and/or discontinuation of AI therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211434853">4</xref></sup> The most commonly affected joints are wrists, hands, knees, back, ankles, and feet, which can significantly affect the quality of life for the patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211434853">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Studies have suggested that arthralgia symptoms are likely due, in part, to a reduction in estrogen levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211434853">5</xref></sup> Literature also suggests that new-onset arthralgias or worsening of pre-existing arthralgias may be greater than 40% during the first year of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155211434853">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434853">7</xref></sup> Addition of AI therapy to patients with taxane-induced arthralgias appears to increase the incidence of arthralgias four-fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211434853">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Data from the ATAC trial, which randomized postmenopausal women to either anastrozole 1 mg or tamoxifen 20 mg daily, reported more joint symptoms in women taking anastrozole as compared to those taking tamoxifen (35.2% vs. 30.3%; OR 1.25 [1.11–1.40]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155211434853">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Morales et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211434853">4</xref></sup> prospectively assessed intra-articular and tenosynovial changes associated with AI therapy. Tenosynovial changes in MRI (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0074) as well as a decrease in hand grip strength (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0049) were seen in patients with AI-induced arthralgia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155211434853">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mao et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434853">7</xref></sup> conducted a cross-sectional survey of 300 postmenopausal patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant AI therapy. Forty-seven percent of patients surveyed associated AIs as a cause of joint pain with the average onset occurring within the first 3 months of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434853">7</xref></sup> Pain in wrists/hands, ankles/feet, elbow, and knees were most often reported in conjunction with AI use (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434853">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time of this study, there was not a standardized best practice model in place for the management of AI-induced arthralgias at the Kellogg Cancer Center (KCC), NorthShore University HealthSystem, or available in literature. The objective of this study was to perform a retrospective chart review to describe the incidence and management of AI-induced arthralgias in patients treated at KCC. A treatment algorithm and an electronic medical record (EMR) documentation tool were developed to facilitate standardization of AI treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1078155211434853" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was an IRB-approved, retrospective chart review. All charts of patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1 January 2003 to 31 October 2009, were reviewed for potential inclusion. All patient-related data were obtained from EMRs and were accessible only by the investigators. All patient information was managed in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Patients were included if they were postmenopausal and were diagnosed with stage I–III hormone receptor positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>The patient’s age, length of AI therapy, reports of arthralgias, and arthralgia management were the most important types of data collected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155211434853">Table 1</xref>).

<p>After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 439 patient charts were eliminated; 206 patient charts remained for evaluation. Of these, 136 patients were taking anastrozole, 66 letrozole, and 4 exemestane. The overall incidence of AI-induced arthralgias in KCC patients was 48% (<italic>n</italic> = 98). The average length of AI therapy was 31 months for patients with arthralgias and 24 months for those without arthralgias (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). Patients who reported arthralgias were younger than patients who did not (61 vs. 65 years) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002).</p>
<p>Of the 98 patients with reported AI-induced arthralgias, 88% were managed without AI therapy alteration. Two of the twelve patients who had therapy alterations were changed to tamoxifen and one patient had a dose reduction. Nine patients were switched to a different AI agent and of those five were eventually discontinued from AI therapy. Of the five patients who were discontinued from therapy, one patient was originally prescribed anastrozole, then changed to Femara, then to exemestane, and finally discontinued from anti-estrogen therapy. Four patients were originally prescribed letrozole and then changed to tamoxifen before being discontinued from therapy.</p>
<p>Patients with arthralgias were managed with various therapies including herbals (17%) such as fish oil, glucosamine and chondroitin, calcium, flaxseed, vitamins D and E; over-the-counter pain relievers (5%) such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen; prescription pain relievers (8%) such as hydrocodone/APAP; non-pharmacological therapies (2%) such as yoga or exercise; or a combination thereof (27%). Treatment modality did not affect whether patients were able to continue treatment with initial AI therapy: herbals (<italic>p</italic> = 0.208), over-the-counter pain relievers (<italic>p</italic> = 1.00), non-pharmacological therapies (<italic>p</italic> = 1.00), prescription pain relievers (<italic>p</italic> = 0.725). Forty-one percent of patients with AI-induced arthralgias did not have management documented in the EMR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1078155211434853"><title>Discussion/Conclusion</title>
<p>AIs are an important class of anti-hormonal therapy for breast cancer treatment. Unfortunately, therapy is sometimes complicated by adverse effects such as arthralgias. This study was conducted in order to assess the impact of arthralgias on AI patients in our institution. The overall incidence of AI-induced arthralgias (48%) found in the KCC study was comparable to the 40% incidence reported in literature (<italic>p</italic> = 0.352).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155211434853">5</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155211434853">7</xref></sup> Although not fully understood, patients who developed AI-induced arthralgias were younger than patients who did not (<italic>p</italic> = 0.010). A plausible explanation for this could be that women who have been postmenopausal for a longer period of time might not feel the reduction of peripheral estrogen as acutely as younger women during AI therapy and thus may report arthralgias less frequently. This may account, in part, for the age difference among patients experiencing arthralgias.</p>
<p>Of the nine patients who had a change in AI therapy, four were changed to letrozole and four to exemestane. One patient was discontinued from AI therapy and changed to tamoxifen. Five of the nine were eventually discontinued from all anti-estrogen therapies.</p>
<p>Contrary to what is suggested in literature, previous chemotherapy treatments did not appear to play a role in the development of arthralgias regardless of whether taxanes were used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211434853">8</xref></sup> In this study, there was no significant statistical difference in the incidence of arthralgias in patients who received chemotherapy compared to those who did not (<italic>p</italic> = 0.352). This held true even if the previous chemotherapy regimens contained a taxane (<italic>p</italic> = 0.489).</p>
<p>The majority of patients who developed arthralgias (88%) were able to continue AI therapy. The data also showed that arthralgia management modalities did not change patients’ ability to continue AI therapy.</p>
<p>Thirty-two percent of the study patients developed AI-induced arthralgias during the first 6 months of treatment. This was significantly different than what was reported in literature, which suggested that 60% of AI-induced arthralgias would occur during the first 6 months. Since documentation of arthralgia management was found in only approximately 60% of patients, it is possible that documentation delay, omission, and/or inconsistency influenced the timing of the documented arthralgia onset. In light of the fact that this study was a retrospective chart review, incomplete documentation may have affected the data.</p>
<p>To facilitate identification, documentation, and management of AI-induced arthralgias at KCC, a treatment algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155211434853">Figure 1</xref>) and documentation tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155211434853">Figure 2</xref>) were developed and built into the EMR after the results of our study were reviewed. The treatment algorithm was based on information found in literature and anecdotal experience gathered from KCC breast oncologists.

<sec id="sec7-1078155211434853"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Hess, in the article ‘Retrospective Studies and Chart Reviews’ states that retrospective studies can serve a useful purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211434853">10</xref></sup> They may help clarify a hypothesis which then can be prospectively tested.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211434853">10</xref></sup> However, retrospective chart reviews are inherently limited by nature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211434853">10</xref></sup> As was discovered in our study, data may be missing, ambiguous, or unavailable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155211434853">10</xref></sup> Documentation of arthralgia management was found only in approximately 60% of patient charts. It is entirely possible that the delayed onset of arthralgias was influenced by incomplete or inconsistent documentation.</p>
<p>Literature has suggested a correlation between previous chemotherapy exposure, particularly taxane therapy, and an increase in the development of arthralgias with AI therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155211434853">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155211434853">12</xref></sup> Our study showed no difference in the incidence of arthralgias between those who received chemotherapy and those who did not. It is possible that any chemotherapy-induced effect had resolved by the time of first documentation of AI-induced arthralgias. This might account for the lack of statistical significance between these groups when a difference had been previously noted in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155211434853">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1078155211434853"><title>Future directions</title>
<p>A subsequent review is planned post-implementation of the electronic tools to determine the impact of the treatment algorithm and documentation tool on patient care at KCC. A patient survey will also be performed to determine the efficacy of the treatment algorithm. Trials need to be undertaken to prospectively determine the efficacy of AI-induced arthralgia treatment.</p>
