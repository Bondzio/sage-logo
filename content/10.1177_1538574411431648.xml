<italic>Objective:</italic> Previous studies have focused on early outcomes of thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs). Late results remain ill-defined. The purpose of this study is to review the midterm results of our experience with endovascular repair of BTAIs. <italic>Methods:</italic> A retrospective analysis was performed reviewing all endovascular repairs of BTAIs from 2002 to present. Preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables were recorded. Clinical end points included aortic-related mortality, stroke and paraplegia, hospital length of stay, procedure-related complications, endoleaks, and reinterventions. Computed tomography data sets were postprocessed for assessing integrity of stent grafts and late complications. <italic>Results:</italic> A total of 24 cases of BTAIs treated with TEVAR were identified. Thoracic endovascular repair was successful in treating BTAIs in all patients and there were no instances of procedure-related death, stroke, or paraplegia. One access complication occurred, requiring an iliofemoral bypass. Actuarial survival estimates and freedom from reintervention at 5 years were 88.7% and 95.8%, respectively. No late endoleaks, stent fractures, or device migration were identified. One patient required a secondary intervention 1 year following the initial repair to treat a pseudocoarctation syndrome caused by a diaphragm at the distal half of the stented aorta. This was treated successfully with repeated endografting. <italic>Conclusions:</italic> Thoracic endovascular repair for BTAIs can be performed safely with low periprocedural mortality and morbidity. Midterm follow-up data presented in this report further support the therapeutic role of endoluminal approach for treating BTAIs in anatomically suitable patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the recent clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery, endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injuries (BTAIs) should be performed preferentially over open surgical repair (OR) or nonoperative management.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411431648">1</xref>
</sup> This recommendation is based on low quality evidence. Moreover, the documented reduction of mortality, morbidity, and paraplegia rates following endovascular repair of BTAIs has been tempered by the increasing reports of device-related complications, reinterventions, and even conversion to open repair. Until now, only a few studies have provided midterm follow-up data and/or have assessed the integrity of the devices placed in the thoracic aorta for managing BTAIs.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>In 2007, we reported our early experience with endoluminal repair of BTAIs and compared outcomes of both OR and thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR) of such injuries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411431648">7</xref>
</sup> We found that TEVAR resulted in significantly less combined mortality and morbidity when compared with OR. These results have caused an institutional shift in practice patterns, whereby aortic transection patients have been treated preferentially by TEVAR when anatomically suitable. The purpose of this study is to review the midterm results of our experience with endovascular repair of BTAIs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574411431648">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>All the endovascular repairs of the BTAIs performed at our institution between January 2002 and February 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Electronic medical records, trauma registries, and a prospectively maintained endovascular database were reviewed, along with preoperative and postoperative computed tomography angiograms (CTAs). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables were collected and recorded. Clinical end points included aortic-related mortality, stroke and paraplegia, hospital length of stay, procedure-related complications, endoleaks, and reinterventions. A classification scheme that has been reported before was used for grading the severity of aortic injuries, namely, grade I (intimal tear), grade II (intramural hematoma), grade III (pseudoaneurysm), and grade IV (rupture).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411431648">8</xref>
</sup> Moreover, computed tomography (CT) data sets were postprocessed using a 3-dimensional workstation (Aquarius; TeraRecon, San Mateo, California) for assessing integrity of implanted stent grafts and late complications (migration, collapse, or late endoleaks).</p>
<p>Prior to 2002, all patients referred to McGill University tertiary care center with BTAIs were treated with open surgery (11 cases). In 2002, we performed our first endovascular repair of BTAIs, and in 2007, we reported our early experience with endovascular treatment of BTAIs (12 TEVAR and 16 OR).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411431648">7</xref>
</sup> Since then, all patients with BTAIs requiring treatment have been treated with TEVAR. The procedure has been described before.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574411431648">7</xref>
</sup> In brief, all endovascular procedures were performed in the operating room by the vascular surgery service using portable C-arm fluoroscopy (OEC 9800, GE medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). Timing of aortic repair was dictated by patient stability and severity of other injuries. Stabilization of immediately life threatening conditions such as intra-abdominal and intracranial hemorrhage took precedence. Repairs were preferentially done using the Talent self-expanding thoracic endovascular stent graft (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, California). The grafts were oversized by 10% with respect to aortic diameter. Patients were anticoagulated with intravenous heparin during stent graft deployment when there was no contraindication for anticoagulation. Follow-up post-TEVAR was by serial CT scan with contrast, prior to discharge, at 6 months, 12 months, and then annually. The long-term postoperative treatment consisted of aspirin (80 mg once daily [OD]).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were expressed as means ± standard deviation. The evaluation of actuarial survivals was carried out according to the Kaplan-Meier nonparametric method. The actuarial survivals were reported at 5 years (with 95% confidence intervals). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).</p>

<p>Thoracic aortic injuries were identified on an IV contrast-enhanced CT scan acquired during the initial trauma assessment (2 patients also had preoperative angiography). Four patients had a grade I injury (intimal tear with intraluminal thrombus), 1 patient had a grade II injury (intramural hematoma with some periaortic fluid collection), and 19 patients had grade III injuries (pseudoaneurysms). The mean proximal aortic neck diameter of the treated aortas was 23.65 ± 3.6 mm (range, 18-34 mm), the mean distal aortic neck diameter was 21.2 ± 3.3 mm (range, 17-27 mm), and the mean distance between the lesion and the ostium of the left subclavian artery (LSA) was 11.9 ± 14.7 mm (range, 0-50 mm).</p>
<p>The median time from admission to aortic intervention was 19 hours (range, 3.6-380 hours), and 17 (70.8%) of 24 patients were treated within the first 24 hours. Of the 24 TEVAR procedures, 23 were performed under general anesthesia, while 1 patient had TEVAR under spinal anesthesia. The mean duration of the procedure was 126 ± 60.6 minutes. Early in our experience, adenosine was used selectively for zone 2 deployments in 4 patients, and in 2 more patients, deployment of the device was performed during rapid pacing. No patient had a spinal drain placed before the TEVAR. Three patients required a conduit for arterial access (common iliac conduit in 2 cases and aortic conduit in 1 case). Of the 24 patients, 10 (41.7%) were anticoagulated with a single bolus dose of unfractionated heparin (5000 units), while the rest of the patients had local heparin saline flushes of the access arteries to prevent local thromboses.</p>
<p>All the procedures were completed successfully with deployment of a single endograft. The implanted grafts were 18 Talent and 4 Valiant thoracic stent grafts (Medtronic), 1 Zenith TX2 (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana), while in 1 patient an Endurant iliac limb was used (Medtronic). The ostium of the LSA was intentionally covered in 14 patients (60%). The mean use of contrast was 103.5 ± 39.6 mL. The mean number of blood units transfused was 0.17 ± 0.4 units per patient. Complete exclusion of the false aneurysm was obtained and confirmed intraoperatively in all but 1 case. In 1 patient with a large pseudoaneurysm, a small proximal type I endoleak was seen on completion angiogram. No further intervention was done. Transesophageal echocardiography and CT scan at 72 hours postoperatively showed collapse of the false lumen with no flow outside the stent graft. No aortic reinterventions and no additional endovascular procedures were performed at the immediate postoperative period. One access complication has occurred (right iliac avulsion), requiring an iliofemoral bypass. No patient required extra-anatomic bypass as a result of covering of the origin of the LSA. The mean ventilator, intensive care unit, and hospital days were 6.2 ± 7.5 days, 9.4 ± 7.5 days, and 35.4 ± 28.9 days, respectively. No perioperative or 30-day deaths occurred. There were no instances of new paraplegia or paraparesis.</p>
<p>One patient needed a reintervention. This was a 17-year-old patient with a grade III BTAIs following a high-speed motor vehicle accident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411431648">Figure 1</xref>
). Associated injuries included a closed head injury, multiple rib fractures with left pulmonary contusion, left kidney and splenic lacerations, and a pelvic fracture. On preintervention CTA measurements, the diameter of the proximal aortic neck was 22 mm, the diameter of the distal neck was 18 mm, and the distance from the LSA was 6 mm. The patient had early endovascular repair of his BTAIs during the first 24 hours. A 24 × 112mm Valiant endograft (Medtronic) was implanted that covered the origin of the LSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411431648">Figure 1</xref>). Follow-up CTA at 1 and 6 months showed successful exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm with no endoleaks. Approximately 1 year later, the patient developed significant hypertension and started complaining about symptoms of intermittent claudication. The Doppler ultrasound examination revealed 60 mm Hg pressure gradient between the right arm and the ankle level. A repeat CTA showed a diaphragm at the distal part of the stent graft that was the cause of the pseudocoarctation syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411431648">Figure 2</xref>
). The patient had already been started on 3 antihypertensives by the referring physician to control hypertension, and he was also placed on clopidogrel. Laboratory test results for congenital or acquired thrombophilia were negative. A second endovascular procedure was planned and a custom-made stent graft 24 × 60mm (Cook Medical) was inserted and deployed via the left femoral artery to cover the flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574411431648">Figure 2</xref>). Placement of the endograft was uneventful, the lumen expanded easily and postdeployment balloon dilatation was performed with a Coda balloon (Cook Medical). Immediate postoperative improvement of patient’s hypertension and symptoms was noticed and the patient remains clinically well 6 months later. He is currently on no medication apart from aspirin 80 mg OD.</p>

<p>Two late deaths have been reported during the follow-up period; both deaths were not related to the aortic stent graft. Actuarial survival estimates and freedom from reintervention at 5 years were 88.7% and 95.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574411431648">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574411431648">4</xref>

). All patients had had predischarge CTA but 4 of them refused to have any further radiological follow-up. The morphometric analysis of stent grafts in the 20 patients with postdischarge follow-up showed no late endoleaks, migration, and stent fractures of collapse. A degree of “bird beak” configuration was noticed—defined as a wedge-shaped gap between the undersurface of the stent graft and the inner curvature of the aortic arch—but this was limited even in patients with highly angulated arches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1538574411431648">Figure 5</xref>
). The proximal bare metal spring facilitated good apposition of the proximal edge of the fabric with the arterial wall, but it was protruding itself into the aortic arch, crossing the ostia of the LSA, and/or left common carotid artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1538574411431648">Figure 5</xref>). In 3 cases, we noticed short dissection-like flaps, linear, or circumferential thrombus at the distal part of the stent graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1538574411431648">Figure 6</xref>
). These lesions had no clinical sequelae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Two meta-analysis compared contemporary reports of BTAIs repair and showed that mortality, paraplegia, and stroke rates are significantly less after endovascular repair that are after OR.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411431648">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574411431648">10</xref>
</sup> Similarly, the AAST2 (American Association for the Surgery of Trauma) prospective multicenter study indicated that endovascular repair is associated with significantly lower mortality, although in this study there was a considerable 20% risk of device related complications and almost 15% endoleak rate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574411431648">11</xref>
</sup> Our 5 year follow-up data are in line with what has been previously reported by Marcheix et al who reported 100% freedom from aortic reintervention and survival estimates at 5 years,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411431648">2</xref>
</sup> and those of Patel et al who reported 94% freedom from aortic reintervention at 4 years.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411431648">4</xref>
</sup> Even though long-term durability of TEVAR for BTAIs remains unknown, midterm follow-up data presented in this report further support the therapeutic role of endoluminal approach for treating BTAIs in anatomically suitable patients.</p>
<p>On the basis of our short-term and midterm results, we have progressively evolved our treatment approach for managing BTAIs in our institution. It has been reported before that the possibility of free rupture 4 hours after admission is quite low, suggesting that there is some latitude in the approach to patients who are diagnosed with BTAIs more than 4 hours after arrival.<sup>

</sup> According to some studies, the latter subset of BTAIs in patients may be managed expectantly based on the surgeon’s impression of the radiographic findings, concurrent injuries, and availability of resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411431648">12</xref>
</sup> Expectant management involves effective control of the blood pressure with beta-blockers or other antihypertensive medications. However, hypotensive therapy may be challenging in cases of increased intracranial pressure, with a risk of a decrease in the cerebral perfusion pressure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574411431648">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574411431648">16</xref>
</sup> In order to allow management of concurrent traumatic injuries and because of the safety and simplicity of the endovascular repair of BTAIs, we currently advocate early (&lt;24 hours) treatment of such lesions. A therapeutic approach without systemic anticoagulation allows a more timely treatment in the multiple-injured patient with associated closed-head or orthopedic injuries. Of all the patients in our series, 60% had their BTAIs treated with only heparin saline flushes of the access arteries without developing any thrombotic complications. In general, if there are no signs of free rupture of aorta (grade IV injury), the other life-threatening injuries are treated first and the endovascular repair of grades II and III aortic injuries is performed within 24 hours. For grade I injuries, expectant management with serial imaging has been suggested based on the early evidence, showing that most type I injuries heal spontaneously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411431648">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574411431648">8</xref>
</sup> We also support this approach, but we had to proceed in early endovascular repair of 4 grade I injuries, due to coexisting intraluminal thrombus and closed head injuries that precluded antihypertensive and/or anticoagulation therapy. Early endoluminal repair of such injuries, when anatomically possible, simplifies management of concurrent injuries—especially, in the older subset of this population.</p>
<p>In the setting of emergent aortic repair, coverage of LSA can be managed expectantly. In this series, the LSA had to be covered in 58% of the treated patients and none of them required subsequent left carotid–subclavian bypass. A dominant or ectopic left vertebral artery and a patent left internal mammary artery coronary graft would be an indication for the use of a carotid–subclavian bypass.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411431648">17</xref>
</sup> In such cases, consideration for LSA bypass may be reasonable, if time constraints and associated patient injuries permit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411431648">18</xref>

<p>Late follow-up remains a challenge with respect to patient compliance. Of the 24 patients, 4 refused any kind of radiological follow-up and poor compliance of this patient cohort is well documented in the literature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574411431648">12</xref>
</sup> There are also concerns regarding radiation exposure over what will potentially be many decades of follow-up. Based on our midterm results and in accordance with other reports, we currently increase the surveillance interval in patients with stable aortic reconstruction and may introduce MRI in the regimen as well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411431648">19</xref>

<p>We used preferentially the Talent thoracic device for treating BTAIs because till 2008, this was the device with the smallest available diameter (22 mm) that could be used to treat small aortas (up to18 mm). This device had improved radial strength over both the TAG and TX2 devices and there have not been any reports of collapse.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411431648">20</xref>
</sup> It features a proximal uncovered bare metal spring with 5 peaks that seems to prevent any significant gap between the undersurface of the stent graft and the lesser curvature of tightly curved aortic arches (“bird-beak” configuration). However, the proximal uncovered bare metal spring may protrude into the arch crossing the ostia of the supra-aortic branches. In such cases, there is always a theoretical risk of aortic wall erosion or clot formation and embolization to the supra-aortic arteries, although we have not noticed any clinical events in this series.</p>
<p>One patient needed a reintervention after developing pseudo-coarctation syndrome. Alvarez et al have recently reported a similar case of preocclusive thrombosis at the distal portion of an endograft, presented as leg paraparesis and hypertension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411431648">21</xref>
</sup> The patient was a 17 years old male, and 11 months earlier he had endovascular repair of a BTAIs by a TX2 stent graft (Cook Incorporated, Bloomington, Indiana) implanted distally to the LSA.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411431648">21</xref>
</sup> The authors did not provide any intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination data or histopathologic evidence of the explanted stent graft. They hypothesized that a 30% oversizing of the device—outside manufacturer’s guidelines—favored development of a kink in the device, making it susceptible to thrombosis. The size of the aorta and the implanted stent graft was identical to those of the patient needed reintervention in our series.</p>
<p>Without having any histopathologic evidence, it is difficult to define the exact nature of the diaphragm that developed at the distal site of the stented aorta in our case. We consider that this represents a detachment of the fibrinous film that covers the luminal surface of the endograft, with possibly some associated thrombus. Little is known about the healing of endoluminally placed aortic prostheses, and unlike the healing process observed in a variety of animal species, the extent of healing in humans after the placement of endografts is rather incomplete.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411431648">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574411431648">23</xref>
</sup> Most of the flow surface of a vascular graft placed in humans persists as an acellular fibrinous lining.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411431648">22</xref>
</sup> Poor healing of the stent graft in our case and subsequent detachment of the luminal lining may be related to the increased oversizing at the distal aortic neck. The body of evidence supports the premise that graft healing mandates contact between the graft material and the arterial wall to achieve healing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574411431648">24</xref>
</sup> Incomplete apposition may wrinkle the luminal surface and interfere with the growth of the acellular layer of fibrinous material or even promote thrombus formation. We have noticed in 3 more cases in this series dissection-like flaps and linear or circumferential thrombus at the distal part of the endografts and in all these cases there was &gt;20% distal oversizing of the stent graft. Development of thrombus material at the distal end of the Talent stent graft—treated successfully with anticoagulation—has been reported before, as well as fractures of the nitinol skeleton of the device.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411431648">2</xref>
</sup> No stent fractures or late endoleaks noticed in this series.</p>
<p>The long-term implications of stent graft placement in the thoracic aorta are unknown. There are a number of issues that have to do with the morphology of the thoracic aorta and the status of endovascular devices, which can impact the short-term and long-term outcomes of this therapy. Because of the younger age of this cohort, the aortic diameters are smaller and the aortic arches tighter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574411431648">25</xref>
</sup> Proper sizing of the device is critical in avoiding complications such as endoleaks or collapse of the prosthesis. Our current practice is to oversize the stent graft by 10% to the thoracic aorta. That is not always possible because of a limited range of sizes and conical shapes. A new generation of devices are now available that may address a lot of these problems. The new cTAG device (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona) is available at 21 mm diameter and can be used to treat aortas of 16 mm diameter according to manufacturer’s instructions, with excellent conformability at the aortic arch. The Valiant stent graft with the Captivia delivery system (Medtronic) allows controlled deployment with accurate placement and has high radial force and is available both with and without proximal bare stents; while the Zenith TX2 graft with the Pro-Form system (Cook Medical) offers better conformity at the inner curvature of the arch and also is available without a proximal bare metal stent. Some authors have drawn attention to the need of new devices designed specifically for use in young trauma patients, namely, smaller diameter devices able to conform at the tight curve of the aortic arch, with radial reinforcement to prevent late collapse and with smaller profile for the smaller access vessels of the young.<sup>

<p>This study is limited by its retrospective nature and relatively small numbers. Despite these shortcomings, it demonstrates that TEVAR of BTAIs can be performed safely with low-periprocedural mortality and morbidity and low complication/reintervention rates in the midterm. In general, patients with BTAIs are young with long life expectancy that in any case exceeds the current experience with thoracic stent grafts. The question that comes easily is what is the durability of these devices and what are their clinical implications if left in the thoracic aorta for 4, 5, or even 6 decades? Collection of long-term data from large series of trauma patients treated with one device is not easy because of continual advances in technology and stent graft design that make new improved devices available. However, reports on smaller series long-term follow-up data and analysis of complication may improve the management of patients with BTAIs and result in the design of better endografts.</p>
