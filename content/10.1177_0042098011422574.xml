<abstract>
<p>The paper looks at arts-related employment in 135 Canadian urban areas over 35 years (1971–2006), successively examining location patterns, co-location with knowledge-rich industries and impacts on employment growth. Arts-related employment is found to be highly concentrated in the very largest urban centres, with no indication of change. Smaller places with particular attributes (attractive natural setting, proximity to large urban centres) are increasingly successful in attracting arts-related activities, but this is not necessarily associated with stronger employment growth or the development of knowledge-rich industries. Evidence of co-location with knowledge-rich industries is weak, but stronger for larger cities. No consistently significant relationship exists with employment growth. This holds true for all cities, irrespective of size. If a synergy exists between the arts and local development, the paper concludes, it is limited to specific industries and only operates in the context of large cities.</p>

<p>Promotion of the arts is increasingly put forward as a means of stimulating local economies. This calls forth three questions. Where do arts-related activities locate? What is their impact on local economies, specifically on the development of knowledge-driven industries? How important is urban size? Do, in sum, strong arts communities act as drivers of local development, not only for large urban economies but also for smaller ones? In search of an answer, this paper proposes an analysis for 135 Canadian urban areas over a 35-year period (1971–2006). The analysis examines the relationship between what we call the ‘arts community’ (producers and consumers), urban size, employment in knowledge-intensive industries and employment growth.</p>

<title>A Word on Definitions: Creativity, Culture, Art</title>
<p>The past few years have seen an outpouring of writings bearing the adjective ‘creative’, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011422574">Caves (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011422574">Cooke and Lazzeretti (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011422574">Florida (2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011422574">2000b)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011422574">Hall (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011422574">Hospers (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011422574">Howkins (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011422574">Landry (2000)</xref> among the more prominent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011422574">Phillips (2011)</xref> does an excellent job of reviewing this literature. Definitional debates are a recurrent feature of the literature. As might be expected, each author has his or her own definition of ‘creative’. Alternative frameworks for defining ‘creative’ industries and occupations can be found in de <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011422574">Miranda <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422574">McGranahan and Wojan (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011422574">Smith and Warfield (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0042098011422574">Throsby (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0042098011422574">UNCTAD (2008)</xref>. Arguably, the most all-encompassing and also most well-known definition is that proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011422574">Florida (2002a)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011422574">Evans (2009)</xref> notes the range of perspectives in the creative cities/new economy literature with a plethora of sometimes overlapping concepts. However, the arts and cultural industries are most often assigned a leading role. The driving force, one implicitly understands, is the presence of restless and unconventional souls willing to challenge established ideas, attributes generally associated with poets, artists and other ‘creative’ types, be it in Viennese coffee houses or Greenwich Village. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011422574">Florida’s (2002b)</xref> Bohemian index, basically the concentration of workers in the arts and culture, conveys a similar message. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011422574">Scott (2008)</xref>, although coming from a different perspective, also makes the link between cultural production and what he calls the creative field. The production and consumption of goods with a high cultural cognitive content and the ‘creativity’ that underlies them are, Scott argues, core attributes of modern economies.</p>
<p>The debate surrounding the definition of cultural industries is no less lively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011422574">Cooke and Lazzeretti (2008)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011422574">Smith and Warfield (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011422574">Staber (2008)</xref> go to some length to explain that ‘creative’ and ‘cultural’ industries are distinct if related, the latter essentially as a subset of the former. In Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011422574">Statistics Canada (2004)</xref> proposes a framework for classifying cultural industries and occupations, applied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011422574">Coish (2004)</xref> to industries and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422574">Olfert and Partridge (2011)</xref> to occupational classes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob (2011)</xref> modifies the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011422574">Statistics Canada (2004)</xref> framework, eliminating certain industries and introducing others, notably ‘Book, periodical and music stores’, used as proxy for the local consumption of cultural goods and services.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the arts and those who appreciate them, a subset of a subset, but whose operational definition is no easier. Like the two previous concepts, a totally satisfactory, universally agreed-upon definition, does not exist. The definition used here is discussed in greater detail later on. However, two points are worth mentioning now. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011422574">Coish (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob (2011)</xref>, industry, not occupational, classes are used—a necessary constraint if we wish to compare employment in ‘the arts’ with employment in other industries. Secondly, the definition aims to capture not only workers in the arts, but also individuals with a taste for the arts, part of a broader ‘arts community’. We implicitly assume that consumers of the arts, amateur artists included, are no less artistically inclined than those formally employed in the arts.</p>

<title>Where Do Artists Locate?</title>
<p>The evidence for the concentration of arts-related activities in the very largest cities is overwhelming. For the US, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011422574">Markusen and Schrock (2006)</xref>, using a grouping of artistic occupations, found that the two highest relative employment concentrations by far (measured by location quotients) were in the greater New York and Los Angeles areas, with San Francisco an honourable runner-up in third place. For Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422574">Olfert and Partridge (2011)</xref>, using cultural occupations, find the highest employment shares in Canada’s four largest metropolitan areas. In Britain, the dominance of London is indisputable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011422574">Nathan 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Why should artists concentrate so overwhelmingly in large cities? The not terribly original answer is agglomeration economies. Taking the seven pillars of agglomeration suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011422574">Polèse (2009)</xref>, five apply to artists: scale economies, centrality, localisation economies, diversity and buzz. The infrastructures that artists require to make a living are subject to economies of scale: film and sound studios, concert halls, theatres, museums, etc. Artistic productions, notably in the performing arts, are typical of services where production and consumption are spatially fused and thus are subject to central place theory. Broadway is no fluke; that is where market potential is highest. The role of localisation economies—proximity to other artists and related professionals—hardly needs to be explained. The same can be said for diversity. Artistic productions—films, plays, TV series, operas—require a variety of talent in constantly changing proportions. And finally buzz. Most artists, certainly in the entertainment industry, are nothing if not social animals. To be ‘where it’s at’ and to be seen lie at the very heart of many artistic professions.</p>
<p>The forces driving artists towards large cities are seemingly irreversible. Authors concerned with the fate of small places often bemoan what is seen as a big-city-centric bias of the current creative discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011422574">Gabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011422574">Lewis and Donald, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422574">McGranahan and Wojan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011422574">Petrov, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011422574">Waitt and Gibson, 2009</xref>). If the relationship between creativity, culture, the arts and cities is as strong as the evidence suggests, then the relationship becomes essentially circular. Agglomeration, creativity, culture and the arts are inextricably intertwined and attempts to separate them make little sense in the end.</p>
<p>Where does this leave small cities? The previous paragraphs may have overstated the advantages of big cities. Several studies have observed the presence of artistic colonies in small places. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011422574">Markusen and Schrock (2006)</xref> observe that artists sort themselves out among US cities in an irregular fashion not closely related to size once we move below the largest cites. Others, using various creative class definitions, point to the pull of places favoured by climate and geography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011422574">Gabe <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422574">McGranahan and Wojan, 2007</xref>). For Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422574">Olfert and Partridge (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011422574">Petrov (2007)</xref> all note the attraction of places in the Rocky Mountains and on the Pacific coast, but also of small places near major urban centres with strong concentrations around Toronto and Montreal. Case studies of small cities that have succeeded in developing a cultural/artistic economic base also point to the importance of location. Huddersfield, England, studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0042098011422574">Wood and Taylor (2004)</xref>, is close to Manchester; Wollongong, Australia, studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0042098011422574">Waitt and Gibson (2009)</xref>, is near Sydney and certainly helped by the proximity of surf beaches.</p>
<p>In sum, smaller places—given the right attributes—can attract artists less anchored to the city. Writers are an example, less tied to the scale-sensitive infrastructures mentioned earlier. The Internet and e-mail should make this easier today. Places near large metropolitan areas may attract artists whose daily presence in the city is not required, but who nonetheless need to stay in touch. Artists may also settle in such places because of local demand. Vacation-home owners (not the poorest segment of the population), young green-oriented households, tourists and retirees are typically above-average consumers of cultural products: summer theatres, art galleries, etc. The rise in general of quality-of-life considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011422574">Rappaport, 2009</xref>) should, one would expect, fuel the growth of arts-friendly communities. This <italic>a priori</italic> is good news for small places. Yet, what is the evidence that this will, in turn, stimulate further economic activity?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098011422574">
<title>The Link with Growth</title>
<p>Although admittedly somewhat blunt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011422574">Phillips (2011</xref>, p. 251) nicely puts the question: “What is special about arts entrepreneurship that makes it more desirable than a cheese factory?”. The arguments in favour of a positive relationship between the arts and local economic development are powerful, but the empirical evidence is scanty at best. The case for the ‘special’ positive impact of artists on economic growth is convincingly presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011422574">Markusen and King (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011422574">Markusen and Schrock (2006)</xref>. The authors coin the term ‘artistic dividend’ to describe that impact. The most direct impact and easiest to measure is that of the arts as an export-base industry, where locally produced artistic products are sold outside the community or, alternatively, outsiders come to consume locally produced art. Think of a local artist whose gallery is a prime destination for tourists and who sells hundreds of paintings around world. Here, the impact is not all that different from a cheese factory.</p>
<p>However, the attribute that ‘makes the arts special’ is their assumed indirect impact on economic growth via their impact on ideas and in turn on innovation and productivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011422574">Potts (2009)</xref> views cultural industries as part of the ‘innovation system’ of the broader economy. In the language of economics, the presence of arts-inclined individuals makes the whole local economy more productive, a true spill-over effect. We found no empirical study that isolated such a spill-over effect; but this does not mean that no effect exists. The link with industries such as advertising and the film industry is easy to make; indeed, making films <italic>is</italic> an artistic activity. For Montreal, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011422574">Shearmur and Rantisi (2011)</xref> point to the links with the city’s fashion industry. More to the point, it is difficult to see why the presence of artists would have a discernable effect on productivity in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals and aerospace in which Montreal also exhibits above average employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011422574">Bourne <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Empirical examinations of the link with growth have generally been for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011422574">Florida’s (2002a)</xref> creative class or variations thereof. Most point in the direction of no relationship or, alternatively, of a weak relationship compared with other predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011422574">Donegan <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011422574">Boschma and Fritsch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011422574">Glaeser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011422574">Hoyman and Faricy, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011422574">McGranahan <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). For US urban areas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011422574">Glaeser (2005)</xref>, using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011422574">Florida’s (2002a)</xref> definition, finds that the positive relationship with growth disappears once human capital variables are introduced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011422574">Hoyman and Faricy (2009)</xref> also find that human capital is a better predictor of growth. For Germany, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011422574">Boschma and Fritsch (2009)</xref> find that educational levels are better predictors of patent activity.</p>
<p>The relationship with growth is problematic for another reason: the geographical mobility of the class of people assumed to be the instigators of growth, at the heart of the debate on the direction of causality. Do people follow jobs or jobs people? The creative class concept supports the ‘jobs follow people’ hypothesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011422574">Storper and Scott (2009)</xref>, proponents of the opposing viewpoint, argue that the main motivation for migration remains jobs, creative class arguments notwithstanding. Using Swedish data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011422574">Asheim and Hansen (2009)</xref> support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011422574">Storper and Scott (2009)</xref>. For non-metropolitan US counties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011422574">McGranahan <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref> observe a positive statistical relationship between the proportion of creative class workers and business start-ups. However, they also found that this synergy (their word) was largely absent in counties with few natural amenities. What then is the ‘true’ causal variable: is it natural amenities or the proportion of creative class workers? It may well be that amenity-rich places attract the most dynamic (or prescient) individuals within the creative class group; prescient, because amenity-rich places offer better business opportunities. In an earlier study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422574">McGranahan and Wojan (2007)</xref> found that the creative class grew most rapidly in sunny and mountainous areas, suggesting that it is more drawn than others to high-amenity areas. Which then is the true causal variable fuelling growth: the community’s natural attributes; people’s tastes for these attributes; the characteristics of the people with those preferences?</p>
<p>Causal dynamics are not necessarily the same for small and for big places. New York and Los Angeles are not primarily competing on natural amenities; neither are Toronto and Montreal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011422574">McGranahan and Wojan (2007)</xref> find that the urban and rural members of the creative class (as measured by them) are different, the latter with significantly fewer college-educated, bringing us back to the interlocking relationship with human capital. Big cities have higher shares of college-educated individuals. Yet, this still leaves the direction of causality open. Are these better educated, ‘creative’ individuals the drivers of big-city growth or the consequence? The evidence is by no means conclusive.</p>
<p>To conclude this section, a case could be made that a dynamic local arts scene and a growing local economy are opposites. The Beatles came out of Liverpool during a period of economic decline. Detroit, during a period mired by riots and racial tension, gave rise to the Motown sound. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011422574">Caves (2000)</xref> reminds us that commerce and the arts are often antagonistic: the former is primarily about making money; the latter is about giving meaning. Artistic creativity exists in the poorest and most technologically backward societies. Yet, to conclude that artistic creation and economic growth are opposites is ultimately as simplistic as arguing the opposite case. The true relationship will most probably continue to elude us. Perhaps there is none. That said, we now turn to our exploration of arts-related employment in Canadian cities.</p>

<title>Data, Definitions and Methodology</title>
<p>Arts-related employment is analysed along three dimensions: its evolution (1971–2006) across the Canadian urban system; co-location with two knowledge-intensive industry groups; and, its relationship with growth in knowledge-intensive industries and in overall employment.</p>
<p>The data used are drawn from six censuses of Canada (1971, 1981, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006), based on special Statistics Canada tabulations. The complete data series covers all of Canada. To ensure comparability over time, urban areas only are considered, defined as all urban places with a population of at least 10 000 in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011422574">1</xref></sup> These are either Census Agglomerations or Census Metropolitan Areas, defined by Statistics Canada, distinct labour markets delineated by commuting sheds. The urban dataset has 135 observations. The terms ‘urban area’, ‘urban place’ and ‘city’ are used interchangeably. The 135 urban places accounted for 81 per cent of Canadian employment in 2006; the 34 largest (populations over 100 000) for 70 per cent. For the three industry groups studied here (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011422574">Table 1</xref>), the 135 urban places account for respectively, for 89 per cent, 95 per cent and 91 per cent of employment in 2006.</p>

<p>Industry classes are standardised over time. In 1997, Canada introduced NAICS (North American Industrial Classification System), changing from the previous SIC (Standard Industrial Classification). The initial pre-1996 dataset contained 141 SIC-coded industry classes. The new updated dataset has 126 industry classes, rearranged and recoded to match NAICS. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the harmonisation of the two classification schemes was unproblematic. Case-by-case verifications were carried out where necessary, with the help of Statistics Canada sources to ensure data consistency over time.</p>
<p>The principal conceptual issue is the definition of arts-related employment, as well as of the industries with which we wish to compare it. The choice of industry groups was in part guided by the need to avoid possible endogeneity problems. This also lies at the heart of the choice of ‘the arts’ rather than broader cultural or ‘creative’ definitions. The broader the definition, the greater is the risk of circular causation, in which the growth in one industry essentially subsumes growth in the other. For non-arts industries, the challenge is identifying groupings which, although potentially impacted by the arts, are not <italic>in</italic> the arts. Choices are necessarily constrained by the 126 classes for which standardised industry definitions are available over time.</p>
<p>To represent arts-related employment (‘the arts’ or the ‘arts community’), four industry classes were chosen, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011422574">Table 1</xref>. The first three are self-explanatory. The fourth—NAICS 4512, 4532—aims to capture consumers of artistic output. However, this class, as coded in the dataset, includes stationery and gift stores. To test for a possible bias, possibly towards tourist destinations, spatial distributions in 2006 were compared. Location quotients for this ‘arts consumer’ class were positively correlated with the other three, but not overly so (coefficient: 0.66), which we found reassuring; a very strong correlation would have meant that this class adds little new information. The places with the highest quotients revealed no systematic bias towards certain types of cities. Many were small, places that do not necessarily rank high in arts variables as such, but were home, we may assume, to relatively higher (although small in absolute numbers) proportions of consumers of artistic products. If anything, this class improves the readings for small places. Certain classes generally included in cultural industry definitions, notably broadcasting, are explicitly excluded because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob (2011)</xref> notes, the location of employment in broadcasting in Canada is strongly influenced by political considerations, given the weight of large public broadcasters (CBC/Radio Canada), introducing a bias towards provincial and territorial capitals.</p>
<p>The identification of knowledge-rich industries <italic>a priori</italic> impacted by artistically inclined individuals can lead in several directions. Clothing manufacturing is a possible candidate since fashion includes a design component. However, this industry contains a large component of low-paid workers, hardly knowledge-intensive. At the other end of the spectrum, some industries are so close to the arts community as to make the relationship almost circular. Besides broadcasting, already discussed, advertising comes to mind, both often included in definitions of cultural/creative industries. As noted earlier, such industries, although undeniably part of the knowledge economy, were excluded.</p>
<p>Two industry groups were chosen respectively in the service sector and in manufacturing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011422574">Table 1</xref>). The high-tech manufacturing group includes industries with strong research components and high shares of university-educated workers, in principle consumers of artistic products. Turning to services, the software, IT and computer services group is more directly linked to the arts. This group is arguably the archetypal example of the modern symbiosis between the arts and engineering. Industries in this group are continually evolving. New industries keep popping up with fresh labels, which is why nominally detailed industry classes at the four-digit level (such as NAICS 5112 and 5114) refer in practice to broad categories. It is in this constantly evolving group that the Internet (in its various shapes) hides out and where one would expect to find young ‘whiz-kids’ dreaming up ever newer computer applications.</p>
<p>The methods used are fairly straightforward: standard (Pearson) correlations and (OLS) regression analysis, supplemented by maps. Correlation and regression results are sensitive to the presence of outliers, an important consideration for the urban size variable. The use of straightforward population (or employment) figures pulls results towards the largest urban centres, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver in the Canadian case, all with populations over two million. Tests were performed for the relationship between the arts variable and urban size, using both straightforward size numbers and logarithmic transformations. Tests were also performed with and without the three largest urban centres. The log results varied only slightly from those with straightforward size numbers, reducing the value of coefficients somewhat. However, the elimination of the three largest cities pushed results below the required significance level, both for the entire urban system (<italic>N</italic> = 135) and for a subset of larger cities (<italic>n</italic> = 34). It was thus decided to use straightforward size figures and retain the largest urban centres.</p>
<p>The metric chosen to describe city industry specialisations is the standard location quotient (LQ), where the reference point (the denominator) is the urban system (<italic>N</italic> = 135) for given years. The advantage of the location quotient is that values are expressed in <italic>relative</italic> terms compared both with other cities and values for given years. Thus, the quotient allows us to standardise values over space and over time. Among its disadvantages is the high volatility of values for smaller places, a reflection not only of the inherent volatility of the economy of smaller places but also of the weight of larger urban places in the denominator, creating a ceiling above which location quotients will rarely go for the largest urban centres. Although the location quotient is well known, it is nonetheless worthwhile to recall the basic equation</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011422574">Table 2</xref> shows results for various LQ-based indicators of spatial distribution from 1971 to 2006. For the entire urban system (<italic>N</italic> = 135), standard deviations have fallen over time (0.60 in 1971; 0.36 in 2006), a sign that arts-related employment is dispersing. By the same token, the maximum location quotient, consistently attributed to the small city of Stratford, has been falling. Correlations over time (with LQ 2006) have remained largely stable since 1981, but are not all that high, generally in the order of 0.60, suggesting an urban system where places often change rank. The correlation with urban size is surprisingly weak, never rising above 0.33, and also remarkably stable. For this group at least, which includes a majority of small cities (populations &gt;100 000), relative size does not seem to be a strong location factor.</p>

<p>The picture changes once we consider only the largest cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011422574">2</xref></sup> Now size matters more, with a correlation coefficient of 0.87 in 1991, its highest point. The effects of size (agglomeration economies) only become dominant, it appears, above a certain threshold. This is not entirely surprising as one would expect size differences among small places to be swamped by other factors such as location and natural attributes. For the 34 largest cities, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042098011422574">Table 2</xref> suggests a generally stable urban hierarchy for arts-related employment, notably since 1981. Standard deviations are lower, correlations across time higher and the maximum LQ hardly changes. Given the growth in arts-related employment (five-fold since 1981), this stability says a lot about the persistence of factors driving the location of arts-related employment among larger cities.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011422574">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the relationship between urban size and arts-related employment, exhibiting an upward-sloping regression line, as expected. Canada’s three largest urban areas stand out with LQs well above 1.0, visible outliers. However, deviations from the regression line are instructive for understanding why size alone is not a sufficient predictor. Vancouver stands out with an LQ significantly above the predicted value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011422574">Glaeser (2011)</xref> cites Vancouver as the arch-example of a ‘consumer city’ (where people <italic>want</italic> to live in order to consume its attributes), noting that it is regularly at the very top of global quality-of-life rankings, saying</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Add in Vancouver’s abundant coastline, beautiful mountains, and lovely countryside, and nobody could deny that the city has been extravagantly blessed by nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011422574">Glaeser, 2011</xref>, p. 239).</p>

<p>Montreal, Quebec’s major metropolis, is slightly above the regression line. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011422574">Olfert and Partridge (2011)</xref> refer to a ‘Quebec advantage’ with reference to the role of culture in French Canada. Toronto’s position below the line is not entirely unsurprising; it is Canada’s largest city and dominant financial centre, but without any exceptional natural or cultural attributes. Recalling that the location quotient is a measure of <italic>relative</italic> concentration, this result also signifies that Toronto is home to a proportionally higher number of workers in other sectors of the economy (notably, finance and corporate support services) whose taste for the arts is perhaps not all that strong. Bankers and brokers are perhaps too busy (or too harried) to go the opera or take piano lessons?</p>
<p>The differences for smaller cities (but still above 100 000) are more telling. Above the regression line, Halifax and Victoria are ocean-front cities; the latter, like Vancouver, is known for its mild climate and superb natural setting. Niagara–St Catharines is a tourist destination. Regina, in the centre of the cold Canadian Prairies, is somewhat of a mystery; proof that every rule has its exceptions. However, like Halifax and Victoria, it is a provincial capital. One would expect capital cities to have proportionally higher shares of arts-related employment. Senior civil servants are generally university-educated, well-paid and likely to be above-average consumers of cultural products. Capital cities generally house institutions (museums, concert halls, etc.) related to the arts.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, below the regression line, Windsor, London, Hamilton, Trois-Rivières and Saguenay are industrial cities with high shares of blue-collar employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011422574">Bourne <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). They are home to large manufacturing plants respectively, in the auto industry (first two cities), steel, pulp and paper, and aluminium smelting. That blue-collar cities should be less oriented towards the arts is not surprising. On the other hand, the presence below the regression line of Edmonton and Ottawa, both capital cities with populations over one million, provides additional warning that generalisations must not be taken too far.</p>
<p>The differences in the dynamics of big and small urban places are highlighted by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011422574">Table 3</xref>, which lists the 20 highest LQs for 1981, 1991 and 2006 (<italic>N</italic> = 135). For small cities, a <italic>consistently</italic> strong (above-average) presence in the arts is the exception. Only Canada’s three large metropolitan areas register LQs above unity for all three years, with Stratford the sole exception. Only two other cities, Halifax and Charlottetown (in italics), are consistently among the top 20, both provincial capitals in maritime locations.</p>

<p>For small places, a strong arts community is often the outcome of particular circumstances. Taking the five small cities with LQs of 1.25 or above in 2006 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042098011422574">Table 3</xref>), Huntsville is situated in the Muskoka Lakes, cottage country, region north of Toronto; Whitehorse is the territorial capital of the Yukon; Elliot Lake in Northern Ontario markets itself as a destination for retirees with planned retirement communities; Kentville is a small community in Nova Scotia’s Annapolis Valley, known for its mild climate and bucolic surroundings, within easy reach of Halifax. Finally, the star of the show, Stratford Ontario (population 30 000), took off as an arts destination in the 1950s with the founding of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, which remains highly popular; it has since become home to a small colony of actors and others linked to the performing arts. Its success in attracting a steady flow of theatre-goers owes much to location: it is 30 km and 50 km respectively from Kitchener–Waterloo and London (both with populations near to half a million) and 130 km from Toronto.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0042098011422574">Figures A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422574">A2</xref> (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0042098011422574">Appendix</xref>) respectively for 1991 and 2006, and which include rural areas, illustrate the dual role of location and natural amenities, consistent with the findings of others. A comparison of these figures confirms the dispersion of arts-related employment to smaller places between 1991 and 2006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422574">Figure A2</xref> having noticeably more shaded areas (LQs above 1.0). Leaving aside odd outliers with small numbers (i.e. rural parts of the Abitibi and Saguenay regions in Quebec), most above-average non-metropolitan LQs share one of two characteristics (or both): proximity to a large metropolitan area; attractive natural attributes such as lakes, mountains, shorelines. The growth of arts communities around Toronto is clearly visible. The Laurentides, traditional playground of Montrealers, also stand out. The economy of the small town of Ste-Adèle north of Montreal is highly dependent on weekend tourism, vacation homes and long-distance commuters. Such places are essentially extensions of the respective metropolises, falling within their respective recreation and retirement sheds. Places blessed by nature are not difficult to identify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422574">Figure A2</xref>),notably in the west. The high scores of places in the Canadian Rockies and on the Pacific coast require no further comment. The high scores of places in Nova Scotia suggest that eastern maritime locations are also benefiting from the general attraction of shorelines.</p>

<title>Co-location with Knowledge-rich Industries</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042098011422574">Table 4</xref> shows the relationship over time between relative concentrations in arts-related employment and employment in SI services and in H-T manufacturing. For SI services, correlations with arts LQs are positive but weak for <italic>N</italic> = 135 and not significant in 1991. Correlations are considerably higher for larger cities (<italic>n</italic> = 34) and also fairly stable since 1991, with coefficients varying between 0.50 and 0.63. The relationship is more tenuous for H-T manufacturing, with no significant correlations for <italic>N</italic> = 135, and barely so for the 34 largest cities, only significant for three years. To test whether consistent strength over time in the arts might be a better predictor of a community’s capacity to attract knowledge-intensive industries, the relationship with industry LQs (2006) was examined using the mean LQ for arts-related employment over time (1971–2006 and 1981–2006). The relationship is now much stronger (notably for <italic>n</italic> = 34).</p>

<p>For larger cities (populations above 100 000), an argument could thus be made for a positive relationship between a well-established arts community and SI services and (but less so) H-T manufacturing. However, in both cases, the three large city outliers weigh heavily on the results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011422574">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098011422574">3</xref>). Once removed, the correlation coefficient for SI services falls to 0.5 and ceases to be significant for H-T industries. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011422574">Figure 2</xref>, the three largest metropolitan areas are now close to the regression line, with Toronto spot on, reinforcing the impression that the relationship is pulled by the top three. For smaller urban areas (but still above 100 000), deviations from the regression line do not reveal a clear pattern. They do, however, suggest possible reasons why a strong SI service sector might emerge independently of the arts. Ottawa and Calgary stand out as fairly large cities with a strong SI services sector, but comparatively weak arts communities. One would expect the link with the arts to be influenced by the type of SI services consumed. The interface with fashion and broadcasting is self-evident, as noted earlier, but less so for computer services generated by public administration (Ottawa) or by oil exploration (Calgary).</p>

<p>All the cities below the regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0042098011422574">Figure 2</xref>, with the exception of Niagara–St Catharines, are located far from major markets. Some are important regional centres for the arts (St John’s, Halifax and Winnipeg<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011422574">3</xref></sup> are examples), but this is not, visibly, matched by a strong SI services sector. Above the regression line, Kitchener–Waterloo stands out as having developed a strong SI services sector despite a low score on the arts, and also as the principal outlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098011422574">Figure 3</xref> with a strong H-T manufacturing sector. Kitchener–Waterloo is home to RIM (Research In Motion), producer of the Blackberry mobile phone. It is difficult to argue on the basis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0042098011422574">Figure 3</xref> that the arts and high-tech manufacturing are closely related. Among the three large metropolitan areas, both Vancouver and Montreal deviate significantly from the regression line, the former towards the bottom and the latter towards the top. Vancouver’s attractiveness to the arts community is apparently not a sufficient condition for generating a strong high-tech manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>To test for the comparative roles of the Arts and urban size in explaining the location of knowledge-rich industries, four regressions were performed for each industry group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042098011422574">Table 5</xref>). The dependent variable is the respective 2006 industry group LQ. In each case, the second independent variable with urban size alternates between the 2006 arts LQ and the mean 1971–2006 arts LQ. When the 2006 arts LQ is used, it is either swamped or eliminated by the urban size variable. When replaced by the mean arts LQ, it dislodges the urban size variable in two cases, notably for SI services (<italic>n</italic> = 34), where the beta coefficients are reversed. The two seemingly contradictory results are evidence of the interdependency between urban size, the arts and SI services, raising issues of colinearity and circularity from which it is difficult to escape.</p>

<p>Let us consider urban size from another angle, focusing on small cities. For all cities (<italic>N</italic> = 135), we saw that the relationship with urban size is weak for both H-T manufacturing and arts-related employment, suggesting that both often locate in small places. Yet, we found no significant relationship between H-T manufacturing and arts-related employment. To understand the apparent contradiction, we turn to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0042098011422574">Figures A3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098011422574">A4</xref> (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0042098011422574">Appendix</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0042098011422574">Figure A3</xref> confirms the big-city orientation for SI services; high LQs are rare outside major metropolitan areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098011422574">4</xref></sup> H-T industries, in contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098011422574">Figure A4</xref>), are often located in small places, but with a tendency to form clusters in and around major metropolitan areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011422574">Polèse and Shearmur (2006)</xref> observe that such clusters are the corollary of the big-city orientation of SI services. One reason H-T manufacturing firms cluster near (but not necessarily in) a large metropolitan area is that they are consumers of SI services.</p>
<p>A comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0042098011422574">Figures A2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0042098011422574">A4</xref> reveals major differences in the geography of H-T manufacturing and arts-related activities <italic>outside metropolitan areas</italic>. Both often locate in small places, but not necessarily the same places. For high-tech manufacturing, the Montreal–Ottawa and Toronto–Kitchener clusters dominate the landscape. No equivalent clusters exist in the west. In other words, the geography of small places attractive to the arts crowd is not necessarily the same as the geography of small places with concentrations of high-tech manufacturing. Both artists and high-tech firms may seek out small places, but for different reasons. Indeed, an argument can be made that the two are opposites. Natural amenities are in part capitalised in real estate values with correspondingly higher wages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011422574">Denis-Jacob (2011)</xref> observes, for small towns, that cultural employment and real estate values are positively correlated. Manufacturing plants seek out smaller places in search of lower real estate and labour costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011422574">Henderson, 1997</xref>), exactly the opposite attributes of amenity-rich places.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0042098011422574">Table 6</xref> shows correlations between arts-related employment in base years and employment growth in subsequent years. Arts-related employment is subtracted from the ‘all employment’ variable to eliminate endogeneity problems. The results require little commentary. The relationship is not significant for the vast majority of cases. Additional correlations were performed for alternative combinations and permutations of time-periods. The results are always the same. The relationship with employment growth is weak at best. The relationship with the two knowledge-intensive industry groupings is even more tenuous.</p>

<p>The lack of a relationship, specifically for small places, between a strong arts community and knowledge-rich employment is further brought home by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0042098011422574">Table 7</xref>, listing the 20 urban places, big and small, with the consistently highest arts LQs. High LQs for all three (arts, SI services, H-T manufacturing) are the exclusive preserve of the two largest metropolitan areas, Toronto and Montreal. Vancouver falls below unity for H-T manufacturing. No small ‘arts-friendly’ city exhibits LQs above unity for both SI services and H-T manufacturing. Most small places exhibit frankly dismal readings for both industry groupings. LQs range from a low of 0.06 to a high of 0.39 for the towns of Kentville, Courtenay and Penticton, all very pleasant places in picturesque surroundings. In others, Dolbeau–Mistassini and North Battlelford, LQs fall completely to zero, the latter home to a regional museum. These are admittedly fairly remote places, but are warning signals that investments in the arts are rarely sufficient to overcome the disadvantages of small size and distance.</p>

<p>Outside Toronto and Montreal, the only other city with LQs above unity for both knowledge-rich industry groups is Ottawa, favoured both by size <italic>and</italic> location. Calgary has size but not location. Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island (PEI), comes closest to fitting the bill of a small arts-friendly place in a comparatively remote location with relatively high values on both knowledge-rich industry groups. Charlottetown is a pleasant coastal city, provincial capital and home to the local university, a useful combination. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011422574">Polèse and Shearmur (2002)</xref> observe that PEI’s success in attracting high-tech manufacturing (aerospace and airplane assembly, notably) owes much to comparatively low wages, a legacy of the Island’s agriculture and fishing-based economy, a rare combination of pleasant surroundings and low costs.</p>
<p>We end with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098011422574">Figure 4</xref>, illustrating the evolution of the three industry groups in cities, two big and two small. Montreal exhibits consistently high scores for arts-related employment, an example, one could say, of an artistically ‘creative’ city. Montreal’s scores on the two industry groups are also fairly stable, but with a steady improvement since the 1980s, notably for SI services. One could thus argue (only ‘argue’; these results do not constitute proof) that Montreal’s success for this industry group—which includes computer gaming and graphics—owes something to the parallel presence of a strong arts community. Overall growth of the Montreal economy has, however, remained below average, which suggests that growth effects, if they exist, are confined to specific industries. The picture for Vancouver is almost the polar opposite, a rising star with a growing arts community and a rapidly growing economy, but not matched by a growing SI service sector (in relative terms). The H-T manufacturing sector is steadily moving up, but is still well below Montreal’s scores. In sum, two cities with visibly strong arts communities, but different trend lines.</p>

<p>For smaller cities, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098011422574">Figure 4</xref> leaves little doubt that Charlottetown is a success story: a consistently strong arts component plus impressive growth in both knowledge-rich industries (for SI services, note the end of the dot.com boom in 2000). Again, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0042098011422574">Figure 4</xref> is not sufficient to establish a causal link with the arts, but neither can it be rejected. As noted earlier, a more likely explanation is a fortuitous combination of factors of which a strong arts community may be one. In contrast, it is difficult to see a link between Stratford’s success as a small (performing) arts centre and knowledge-rich industries. Its score on SI services remains dismally low. The sudden upsurge in H-T manufacturing after 2001 is most likely to be a reflection of Stratford’s location, a mere 30 km from Kitchener–Waterloo. However, a case study would be required to verify this.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Looking at 135 Canadian cities over a 35-year period, we successively examined the location of arts-related employment, possible links with employment in knowledge-rich industries and, lastly, with local employment growth.</p>
<p>On location, the findings mirror those of other studies on the geography of ‘creative’ employment in general. Arts-related employment is highly concentrated in the three largest urban areas, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, exhibiting consistently high concentrations over time. Concentrations in smaller places are rare (but growing). Smaller places that were successful in attracting arts-related employment displayed one or both of the following attributes: attractive natural setting (seashore, lakes, mountains); proximity to a large metropolitan area. Both types of communities are multiplying, reflecting the growth in retired populations, changing preferences and the rise of long-distance commuting. Being a provincial capital also helped in Canada.</p>
<p>The relationship with knowledge-rich industry groups was found to be weak, with no indication that this is changing. Arts-related activities can provide an economic base (like other export industries) for smaller cities with the attributes already mentioned, but we find little evidence that they act as magnets for knowledge-intensive industries. Arts-related employment is growing in smaller ‘pleasant’ places, but employment in knowledge-intensive industries is not necessarily following.</p>
<p>The relationship with knowledge-rich industries was found to be stronger for larger urban areas (population above 100 000). However, the relationship is largely pulled by Canada’s three largest metropolises. If a synergy exists between the arts and specific knowledge-rich industries, the results suggest that it only operates in the context of large cities.</p>
<p>No consistently significant relationship was found between arts-related employment and subsequent employment growth. This holds true for all periods, urban size classes and industry groups. The diverging trajectories of Canada’s three large metropolises, all with strong arts communities, highlight the ambiguous nature of the relationship with growth. Only the two largest, Toronto and Montreal, exhibit consistently above average employment in both knowledge-rich industry groups, but with differing total employment growth.</p>
<p>Summing up, our findings do not allow us to conclude that the presence of individuals working in (or interested in) the arts is not a positive factor for the development of specific industries. However, they do suggest that, where such a relation exists, it is part of the broader fabric of agglomeration economies of large cities and not an independent determinant of success. A firm specialising in computer graphics will certainly be on the lookout for artistically gifted individuals, but also for qualified engineers, talented programmers, experienced managers, marketing wizards and willing investors, a combination it is unlikely to find in small cities. Being a magnet for artists is undoubtedly a positive attribute, but there is little evidence that it is a sufficient condition to jump-start the economy of small places (and even large ones).</p>
