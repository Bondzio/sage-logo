<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early after stroke, approximately two-thirds of all patients experience impaired arm function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512443138">1</xref></sup> and only 50% of cognitively intact and medically stable patients obtain satisfactory dexterity in the course of the first three months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512443138">2</xref></sup> Regaining arm function is essential for independency in activities of daily living and contributes to health-related quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512443138">3</xref></sup> A vast body of research addressing the hemiparetic arm has emerged during the last years, but it is still a challenge to choose the most effective approach for regaining satisfactory arm function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512443138">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443138"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512443138">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although suitable for only a subgroup of patients with mild to moderate paresis of an arm, constraint-induced movement therapy and modifications of this approach have attracted a lot of scientific attention. Constraint-induced movement therapy or modified constraint-induced movement therapy are intensive training programmes in which the patients are supposed to overcome learned non-use by forced use of the affected arm. This is usually achieved by wearing a mitt on the unaffected arm for several hours a day and by extensive task-related training for the paretic arm. Studies have demonstrated promising results of this treatment approach when compared to standard care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512443138">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443138"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512443138">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, studies comparing constraint-induced movement therapy or modified constraint-induced movement therapy with dose-matched control interventions show ambiguous results, especially concerning patients in the acute or subacute phase post stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512443138">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512443138">10</xref></sup> In some studies more improvement was found in patients receiving constraint-induced movement therapy or modified constraint-induced movement therapy compared to dose-matched training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443138">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443138">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512443138">12</xref></sup> while the superiority of these approaches was not corroborated in other studies with patients in the acute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512443138">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512443138">14</xref></sup> or subacute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512443138">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512443138">16</xref></sup> phase post stroke. In a recent review it was suggested that a shorter training time per day may be more beneficial for patients in the acute phase, since detrimental effects for higher intensity constraint-induced movement therapy were found when applied very early after stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512443138">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the unilateral focus on the affected arm in constraint-induced movement therapy, different bilateral approaches have been developed. The coordinated use of both hands is requested for most manual daily life activities, therefore the training of interlimb coordination is considered important to prepare the patients for a natural use of both hands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443138">17</xref></sup> It has been proposed that bilateral arm training contributes to a normalization of inhibitory influences of the contralesional hemisphere on the ipsilesional and stimulates recovery by activating similar networks in both hemispheres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512443138">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512443138"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512443138">20</xref></sup> Evidence for a superior effect of different forms of bilateral training has been reported in two reviews,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512443138">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512443138">21</xref></sup> but was not supported in another review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512443138">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on previous research we cannot conclude that one treatment approach is better than the other, taking into account the time involved and the activities practised. The objective of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of modified constraint-induced movement therapy with dose-matched bimanual task-related training for patients in the subacute phase post stroke. As modified constraint-induced movement therapy has more often been reported to be superior to other treatments, our hypothesis was that modified constraint-induced movement therapy was more effective than bimanual training in improving arm function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0269215512443138" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A randomized controlled trial was applied. A computerized random numbers generator was used for randomizing the patients in blocks of four patients into a modified constraint-induced movement therapy or a bimanual training group. Opaque, sealed envelopes were prepared by a person not involved in the study, classifying the patients into one of the two groups.</p>
<p>The patients were recruited from two hospitals in the City of Bergen, Norway.</p>
<p>Eligible participants were patients with a single ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke or a former stroke with no residual motor impairment, meeting the following inclusion criteria: between 2 and 16 weeks post stroke, upper extremity paresis with ability to extend the affected wrist and fingers at least 10 degrees, but still experiencing pronounced deficits in dexterity as characterized by a score of &lt;52 on Action Research Arm Test (maximum score = 57).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512443138">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Exclusion criteria were: additional neurological diseases, unstable medical conditions, musculoskeletal disorders affecting arm mobility and severe cognitive impairment (&lt;24 on Mini Mental State Examination).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512443138">23</xref></sup> The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee No. 3.2008.478 (135.08) and informed written consent was obtained. According to a power calculation a total of 60 patients were to be included to discover a clinically relevant change of 5.7 on Action Research Arm Test with <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05, β 0.80.</p>
<p>Participants in both intervention groups received the same time of task-related arm training with an experienced occupational and/or physical therapist, 4 hours a week for four weeks, both on an inpatient and outpatient basis. In addition the patients received written self-training exercises adjusted to their current motor capabilities at least three times during the intervention period. They were expected to use the affected arm actively at least 2–3 hours a day, preferably in daily life activities. Both the training with a therapist and the self-training programme followed ‘shaping’ principles (i.e. the motor tasks were adapted to increasing motor function to maintain a challenging character). Therapists were encouraged to focus either on bilateral or unilateral activities where possible. The patients were asked to write a log about the time spent exercising. The proposed exercises were as close to daily life activities as possible, but included also strength training and mobility training when appropriate. Other necessary rehabilitation was provided according to individual needs.</p>
<p>Patients in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group were supposed to wear a mitt on the less affected arm for 4 hours a day and record the time of actually wearing the mitt in their logbook. Their self-training programme focused on unilateral activities. In the bimanual group a stronger emphasis was put on bilateral activities. In ballgames the patients were prompted to use both hands when throwing and catching the ball, while patients in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group were requested to use the affected arm only. Other specifically bilateral activities with need of both hands to perform the task were, for example, using cutlery, tying a knot and a ribbon, folding a towel, banging in a nail. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215512443138">Table 1</xref> shows some examples of unilateral and bilateral activities. Activities were also tailored to the individual interests and needs of the patients.</p>

<p>Patients in both groups were reminded to use the affected arm as often as possible and the logbooks were checked regularly. Arm function was assessed three times by experienced occupational and physical therapists, before and after intervention and three months after the end of intervention. Blinding of raters was achieved by recruiting therapists from other wards not involved in treatment of the study participants. The main outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test, a widely applied, reliable and valid assessment tool of arm motor function with a total score ranging from 0 to 57 (best motor function).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512443138">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512443138">24</xref></sup> It is recommended for assessing arm motor function in acute stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512443138">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Secondary outcome measures were the Nine-Hole Peg Test and the Motor Activity Log. The Nine-Hole Peg Test is a well-established measure to assess dexterity of the hand, focusing on fine motor skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512443138">25</xref></sup> Scores were calculated as pegs per second.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215512443138">26</xref></sup> The Motor Activity Log is a structured self-report measure of amount and quality of use of the affected arm in 30 daily life activities, each measured on 0–5 scales. Higher scores reflect more frequent use and better quality of movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215512443138">27</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section10-0269215512443138">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data were analysed using SPSS 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, I, USA). Differences between the groups at baseline were examined by chi-square tests for categorical data and independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous data. Normal distribution assumptions and homogeneity of variance were examined for all outcome measures using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene’s test and visual inspection of normality plots. Change scores within each group were examined by paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests and between groups with independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests: (1) between test scores at baseline and after four weeks of treatment, (2) between test scores at baseline and three months of follow-up. ANCOVA was applied to determine differences between groups after treatment and at follow-up, using baseline scores as covariate. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05.</p>

There was no difference between the groups at baseline with regard to age, sex, side of paresis and test scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215512443138">Table 2</xref>). There was two drop-outs, one in each group, due to other medical problems. All the 28 remaining patients completed the intervention and assessments. Due to problems with patient recruitment, an interim analysis was conducted after the inclusion of 30 patients. As only minor differences in change between the groups were found, the trial was stopped, although the originally planned number of participants had not been achieved.</p>

<p>There was no significant difference of change between the groups on the Nine-Hole Peg Test, but also here were significant improvements within each group. (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512443138">Table 3</xref>). The mean Motor Activity Log scores at baseline in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group reflected little use and poor quality of movement. Arm function was enhanced after intervention, with mean of scores 3–3.5 at follow-up, reflecting reduced but frequent use of the affected arm. However, the groups did not differ at any assessment time (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05) with respect to amount and quality of use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215512443138">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The logbooks showed that the targeted 2–3 hours of daily self-training usually were achieved. The reported frequency tended to be higher in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group 160 (21.2) minutes/day than in the bimanual training group with 144 (25.0) minutes/day, <italic>P =</italic> 0.08. The actual mitt use in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group was less than the targeted 4 hours, with a mean of 213.1 minutes/day (34.3), or roughly 3.5 hours. Most patients explained that this was a result of the necessity of using both hands in domestic chores and other activities.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>No superiority of the modified constraint-induced movement therapy approach over a bilateral task-related training in improving arm function in the subacute phase post stroke was found. The randomization led to a balanced allocation, and blinded raters secured unbiased assessments. Both groups received the same amount of training with a therapist, and the same cognitive strategies to increase adherence and compliance. The difference between the groups was wearing a mitt in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group vs. no restraint in the bilateral group, and a focus on unilateral vs. bilateral exercises, respectively. The groups did not differ at any of the test points in any aspects of motor function as assessed with Action Research Arm Test or Nine-Hole Peg Test, or in self-reported amount and quality of use of the paretic arm as assessed with the Motor Activity Log.</p>
<p>There are several aspects that should be considered when interpreting the results from the present trial in the light of other studies. One aspect is the dose and the content of the treatment provided in both experimental and control groups, another is the phase post stroke that the patients were in. In a recent review a superior effect of modified constraint-induced movement therapy over traditional rehabilitation was found, however, the trials included acute, subacute and chronic patients, and the intensity and content of the control intervention varied considerably.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215512443138">28</xref></sup> Thus, both less intensity and content of the offered control treatment may contribute crucially to the superiority of modified constraint-induced movement therapy. We eliminated these confounders by providing the same intensity of training and a task-related approach to both groups.</p>
<p>There are ambiguous findings when looking at studies targeting subacute stroke patients and providing an equal dose of treatment to the control group. In accordance with Page et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443138">8</xref></sup> Myint et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512443138">11</xref></sup> found a more beneficial effect of modified constraint-induced movement therapy in such patients when compared to dose-matched standard rehabilitation, which included compensatory techniques and stretching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512443138">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269215512443138">29</xref></sup> Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512443138">30</xref></sup> found differences in favour of modified constraint-induced movement therapy after two weeks, but not at the end of the four-week treatment period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269215512443138">30</xref></sup> Two recent Swedish trials could not establish a difference between the treatment groups wearing a restricting sling or mitt and the controls groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512443138">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512443138">16</xref></sup> Neither did the acute patients treated in the Vector trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512443138">14</xref></sup> differ in outcome. Taken together, there is mounting evidence that bilateral training approaches can be as effective as constraint-induced movement therapy or modified constraint-induced movement therapy in the subacute phase post stroke, especially when the control intervention has a similar content and all patients are stimulated to use the affected arm as much as possible. A possible reason for this may be found in the original theoretical basis for constraint-induced movement therapy, the ‘learned non-use model’. Learned non-use means a compensatory behavioural pattern of mostly using the not affected arm, where underlying motor function of the paretic is not exploited. This pattern may not be established yet in acute and subacute patients, thus enabling them to avoid learned non-use when prompted to use the hemiparetic arm.</p>
<p>In the present study we focused on either unimanual or bimanual training in the respective groups. Bimanual training is supposed to alleviate impaired motor function after stroke by exploiting uncrossed pathways and intercallosal connections and to contribute to the normalization of inhibitory influences between the hemispheres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512443138">21</xref></sup> The symmetry constraint, a mechanism coupling both arms may also be an avenue to facilitate motor function of the affected arm when applied in synchronous bilateral training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269215512443138">31</xref></sup> As McCombe and Whitall point out, the primary reason for bilateral arm training is the fact that we usually use both arm in a coordinated manner in everyday tasks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443138">17</xref></sup> The underlying neurophysiological control mechanisms of bimanual movements are quite different from unimanual movements, leading to activation of extensive networks in both hemispheres, comprising a stronger involvement of the supplementary motor area and cingulate gyrus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215512443138">32</xref></sup> It seems reasonable that retraining of motor function post stroke should at least to some degree comprise bimanual exercises.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512443138">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Practical considerations have also to be taken into account, such as the individual’s situation and the resources available. We applied a treatment regimen that is implementable in different healthcare settings with limited therapist attention. The focus on self-training made the participation of outpatients possible, but increased the responsibility and the burden for each participant. More therapist supervised training or a group setting may have enhanced motivation and fun, and might have made it easier to comply with the treatment regimen.</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is the limited sample size, due to problems with recruitment of eligible patients within the intended timeframe. We conducted an interim analysis after having included half of the intended patients according to a former power calculation, which revealed no difference. Since no trend in favour of one of the groups could be detected the end of the trial this seemed justified. Ideally, a third group only receiving standard rehabilitation should have been included, but then an even larger sample size would have been required.</p>
<p>We applied a treatment approach that can be implemented both in inpatient and outpatient settings with rather low therapist contact and a strong emphasis on self-training. This implies that the control over what the participants did was limited and we had to rely on the logbooks. At the same time the participants were instructed to report the training time and the time of wearing of the mitt as realistically as possible. Although there was a unilateral focus in the modified constraint-induced movement therapy group and a bilateral focus in the bimanual group, a certain overlap could not be avoided in connection with self-training of functional tasks. In combination with the limited training time with the therapist, this might have diluted the differences between the approaches. However, the reported compliance for wearing the mitt was approximately 3.5 hours daily on average, which was less than intended, but still a rather frequent unilateral use of the affected arm.</p>
<p>The external validity of the study is limited to the selected group of patients in the early phase after stroke eligible for constraint-induced movement therapy. Nevertheless stroke is a widespread health problem and even subgroups represent a large number of patients on a global basis. The joint body of evidence that has emerged in research since the beginning of the present study indicates that constraint-induced movement therapy or modified constraint-induced movement therapy in the subacute phase post stroke is no more beneficial than bimanual training, as was also found in our study. This implies that constraining the affected arm may be unnecessary for most patients in the subacute phase after stroke. Treatment approaches should focus on using the affected arm, but at the same time comprise bimanual tasks.</p>
