<p><italic>Aim:</italic> Various animal and human studies have contributed to the idea of cortical structural–functional alterations in migraine. Defining concurrent cortical alterations may provide specific insights into the unfolding adaptive or maladaptive changes taking place in cortex in migraine.</p>
<p><italic>Methods:</italic> From a group of 60 episodic migraineurs, 20 were recruited to the study. Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, structural and functional cortical measures were compared in migraineurs who experienced increased frequency of attacks (HF; 8–14 days/month; <italic>n</italic> = 10), to those who experienced less frequent migraine attacks (LF; &lt; 2 days/month; <italic>n</italic> = 10), and to healthy controls (HC; <italic>n</italic> = 20).</p>
<p><italic>Results:</italic> Parallel structural and functional differences were found as follows: (i) HF patients showed higher thickness in the area representing the face in the post-central gyrus, which correlated with the observed stronger functional activation, suggesting adaptation to repeated sensory drive; (ii) smaller cortical volume was observed in the cingulate cortex that correlated with lower activation in the HF group; and (iii) similarly significant structural and functional differences (HF &gt; LF) were observed in the insula that may reflect potential alteration in affective processing.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion:</italic> These results suggest differential response patterns in the sensory vs. affective processing regions in the brain that may be an adaptive response to repeated migraine attacks.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0333102412445622" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cortical changes in migraine have been noted since the earliest descriptions of visual phenomena by Hubert Airy in the 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0333102412445622">1</xref>), and recent functional studies continue to show alterations in a number of cortical regions in migraine patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412445622">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0333102412445622">3</xref>). Alterations in cortical processing include commonly associated phenomena in migraine including evidence of alteration in cortical function in migraineurs. These have included cortical excitability in primary sensory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412445622">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0333102412445622">5</xref>); lack of habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0333102412445622">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0333102412445622">8</xref>), increased sensitivity to sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412445622">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0333102412445622">10</xref>), noise (phonophobia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412445622">11</xref>), and smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0333102412445622">12</xref>) in the interictal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0333102412445622">11</xref>). These alterations can be explained in part by recent findings in rats that show trigeminovascular inputs from the dura distribute nociceptive information to a number of cortical regions including the primary somatosensory cortices and insular cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412445622">13</xref>). Such data suggest that migraine-induced activation of the trigeminovascular system may through these inputs define correlative neurological symptoms observed in migraine patients.</p>
<p>In parallel with functional imaging studies, anatomical studies of altered brain morphology (gray matter and white matter tracts) have contributed to the idea of structural-functional alterations in migraine. Most of these studies have been performed independently – that is studies reporting either functional or anatomical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412445622">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0333102412445622">18</xref>). The manifestation of altered function may result in altered gray matter changes in migraine patients or vice versa. The significance of defining concurrent differences may provide specific insights into the unfolding adaptive or maladaptive changes taking place in cortical and other brain regions in migraine subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412445622">19</xref>).</p>
<p>In the above the studies mentioned that cortical anatomical differences were evaluated as a function of the health or disease (with or without aura) and were not correlated with functional differences in these regions or networks. An unanswered question is whether functional and anatomical changes in cortical regions are a function of increased frequency of migraine attacks. In a previous report we described significant correlative functional and morphological differences in subcortical regions in a group of matched episodic migraineurs with low and high frequency attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412445622">19</xref>). Here we further investigate the issue in these patients, focusing on possible cortical differences in function and structure by comparing low frequency (LF) vs. high frequency (HF) episodic migraineurs and whether or not functional-anatomical differences are seen in the same cortical regions.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0333102412445622" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the McLean Hospital’s Institutional Review Board, and it met the criteria of the Helsinki Accord on the Experimentation of Pain in Human Subjects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/helsinki.pdf">http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/helsinki.pdf</ext-link>) and approved informed consent forms were obtained from all subjects.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0333102412445622" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title>
<p>Migraine subjects were selected from screening a cohort of 60 migraine sufferers, separated into two groups of 10, each matched for age, age of migraine onset, and medication type. Subjects included in this study met the episodic migraine criteria as defined by the International Classification for Headache (ICHD-2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ihs-classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/">http://ihs-classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/</ext-link>). Each subject suffered from episodic migraines for at least 3 years and did not experience a migraine 72 hours before the scan and was asymptomatic for 24 hours after the scan. LF subjects experienced 1–2 migraine days per month, while HF patients had 8–14 migraine days per month. Demographic data is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0333102412445622">Table 1</xref>. The migraine attack laterality in the migraine cohorts were as follows: HF (1/10 only right-sided, and the rest experienced migraine attacks on both sides with 5/10 predominantly left-sided, 2/10 predominantly right-sided and 2/10 equally left- and right-sided migraine attacks), and LF (1/10 only right-sided, 1/10 only left-sided and the rest experienced migraine attacks on both sides with 5/10 predominantly right-sided and 3/10 equally left- and right-sided migraine attacks). Each subject’s migraine frequency was consistent for the 12 months preceding the imaging scan. Each subject scored ≤ 25 on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II). Patients were not on any other medications, aside from NSAIDS and triptans (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0333102412445622">20</xref>)). For comparison, morphometric data of a group of healthy controls (HC, 20 subjects (10 male, 10 female), age 41.8 ± 9.9 years) were acquired and analyzed. The healthy control subjects included in the study met an extensive list of exclusion criteria, specifically no pain or headache disorders (not more than two non-migraine, non-cluster type headaches per year).

<sec id="sec4-0333102412445622"><title>Quantitative heat pain threshold testing</title>
<p>Quantitative heat pain threshold testing (QHPTT) was conducted before each scanning session. A 1.6 × 1.6 cm contact thermode was used to deliver stimuli to the hand (TSA-II, Medoc Advanced Medical Systems, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The same QHPTT paradigm was used for all the subjects to determine their pain threshold (THR). From a baseline of 32°C, the temperature increased at a rate of 1°C/s. The subject was instructed to stop the program once he or she began to feel pain. This was repeated three more times. The THR was the average of at least three measurements. QHPTT was performed on the predominant side of migraine attacks. If there was no predominant side the QHPTT was performed on the left side.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0333102412445622"><title>Noxious thermal stimulation</title>
<p>During functional imaging, three blocks of stimulation (30 s baseline/15 s stimulation @ THR + 1, not including the ramp periods) were delivered from a baseline temperature of 32°C using the same probe that was used during QHPTT. The end temperature of the delivered stimulation was individualized for each patient based on his or her individually measured pain threshold temperature performed outside the scanner. All patients were consistently feeling pain at that temperature. The rate of temperature change was 4°C/s. The ramps were modeled in defining the explanatory variables (EVs) for fMRI data analysis. A visual analog scale (VAS) system was used for pain and unpleasantness rating by subjects. Similar to QHPTT, thermal stimulation side was the migraine dominant side. If there was no predominant side the stimulation was delivered to the left hand.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0333102412445622"><title>Functional and structural imaging</title>
<p>All the imaging data were collected using an 8-channel phased array head coil on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio scanner (Erlangen, Germany). In this study, structural data was acquired using a 3D MPRAGE pulse sequence (TR/TE/TI = 2100/2.74/1100 ms, FA = 12°, 128 sagittal slices, res = 1.33 × 1.0 × 1.0 mm<sup>3</sup>). This sequence produced high-resolution T<sub>1</sub>-weighted datasets. Functional data was acquired using a gradient echo (GE) echo planar (EPI) sequence (TE/TR = 30/2500 ms, res = 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 mm<sup>3</sup>, matrix = 64 × 64, 74 volumes, 41 slices).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0333102412445622"><title>Structural analysis</title>
<p>Two types of comparisons were performed: cortical thickness comparisons, which were vertex-based comparisons, and volumetric comparisons, which were based on the volumes obtained for brain structures after segmentation. The following steps were taken using the Freesurfer tools: (i) removal of non-brain tissue using a hybrid watershed/surface deformation procedure; (ii) automated Talairach transformation; (iii) segmentation of the subcortical white matter and deep gray matter volumetric structures; (iv) intensity normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0333102412445622">21</xref>); (v) tessellation of the gray matter/white matter boundary; (vi) automated topology correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0333102412445622">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0333102412445622">23</xref>); (vii) surface deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0333102412445622">24</xref>); and (viii) registration of the subjects’ brains to a common spherical atlas. Statistical surface maps were generated to assess the cortical thickness differences at each vertex for HF vs. LF migraine patients. Surface data for each subject was smoothed with a 10 mm full width at half maximum kernel to improve inter-subject averaging. In order to generate these maps a two-class general linear model was used and age was added to the model as a covariate. The analysis across the entire cortical surface resulted in a statistical surface map that was corrected for multiple comparisons. Cluster-wise correction for multiple comparisons was then performed using a Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 iterations). The statistical surface maps were then overlaid on the averaged inflated brain. Masks were created on the average inflated brain for the cortical regions that showed significant (corrected) thickness differences between the LF and HF migraineurs. This mask was transformed to each healthy control subject’s cortical space individually in order to measure the cortical thickness in that region.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the volumetric data was performed using the SPSS 19.0 statistical package. A univariate analysis of variance for each segmented volume was used to assess the differences between the cohorts (HC, LF and HF). In order to account for the differences in the cranium size an estimate of the total intracranial volume (eTIV) was used as an additional regressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412445622">25</xref>) that was estimated based on a statistical relationship between the TIV computed from a manual segmentation and the Talairach transform. These regressors are necessary for this cross-sectional study because the brain structures scale with the general cranium size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0333102412445622">25</xref>) and also with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0333102412445622">26</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0333102412445622"><title>Functional analysis</title>
<p>fMRI analysis was carried out using FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fmrib.ax.ac.uk/fsl">www.fmrib.ax.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>), version 4.1.3. Quality assurance (QA) of the data was performed using an in-house developed tool to detect the volumes with spikes or uncorrected motion artifacts. The pre-statistical processing for each subject consisted of skull stripping using a brain extraction tool (BET) with bias field correction and neck removal and motion correction. The volumes were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full-width at half-maximum filter, and a 60 s high-pass temporal filter was applied. First-level fMRI analysis of single subject data was performed using fMRI Expert Analysis Tool (FEAT) Version 5.98. The EVs for thermal stimuli were entered using the recorded temperature traces for each subject. Subjects were spatially normalized to the MNI152 brain for group analysis. Registration was performed using FLIRT (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool) following a two-stage process. First a low-resolution image of the whole brain (acquired with similar imaging parameters to the fMRI acquisition separately) was linearly registered to the high-resolution structural MPRAGE image. Then the MPRAGE image was linearly (affine) registered to the standard image (MNI152 average brain). These two transformations were combined, to transform the low-resolution fMRI images (and the statistical images derived from the first-level analyses) straight into standard space, when applied later, during group analysis. Patients with right-sided migraines had their images flipped along the y-axis to correspond with the majority of the patients with left-sided migraine. The flipping of the fMRI data was performed before the stereotactic normalization. Group activation maps were generated by FEAT FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects (FLAME1). Statistical parametric maps were thresholded using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412445622">27</xref>). GMM is a generalized version of false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons in an empirical Bayesian framework. This approach is specially adapted for fMRI thresholding, by being more robust in modeling violations as compared to traditional FDR by adaptively estimating the form and fraction of ‘null’ from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412445622">27</xref>). In this approach, the ‘activation’ and ‘deactivation’ maps are then thresholded at posterior probability <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5. All of the functional results reported in the results section are the results that survived correction for multiple comparisons using GMM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0333102412445622"><title>Functional connectivity analysis</title>
<p>Functional connectivity was measured using a seed correlation based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0333102412445622">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0333102412445622">29</xref>). Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined to test specific hypotheses about the correlation of functional connectivity differences as a function of migraine attacks in the cortical areas that showed morphometric differences between the two cohorts as determined from the structural analysis. All of the seeds were defined anatomically according to the results of the structural analysis. fMRI data processing was carried out using FEAT Version 5.98, as part of FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0333102412445622">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Pre-processing steps were similar to the steps described for functional analysis above. In addition, white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) masks were created for each subject and used for confound generation. All time-courses in the brain were orthogonalized with respect to the eigen time-courses of WM and CSF masks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0333102412445622">31</xref>) and then normalized. The resulting normalized time-courses were entered into a general linear model analysis against the rest of the brain to assess connectivity with the chosen ROI for each subject and then entered into a mixed-effects group analysis (contrast: high frequency – low frequency), FLAME1. The resulting z-statistic maps were thresholded using GMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0333102412445622">27</xref>). All of the functional results reported in the results section are the results that survived correction for multiple comparisons using GMM.</p>

<p>Contrast analysis of the HF vs. LF migraine group in response to the ‘pain threshold + 1°C’ stimuli revealed significant differences in the two groups. HF migraine patients showed increased activation in the bilateral post-central gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412445622">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0333102412445622">Table 3</xref>). Compared to LF, a cluster of thicker cortex was observed in the HF group in a region in the post-central gyrus of the left hemisphere (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.008), which was co-localized with the area that also showed stronger functional activation in the same cohort (in the right hemisphere). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412445622">Figure 1</xref> shows the thickened area in S1 (HF &gt; LF) overlaid on an average brain. Interestingly, measurement of the cortical thickness in the same region in healthy subjects revealed a significantly thicker cortex in HC relative to LF patients (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). A functional connectivity analysis using the MC-corrected post-central gyrus thickened cluster as a seed mask revealed significantly stronger functional connectivity of this post-central area with various areas commonly involved in the processing of pain, as well as in sensory processing areas in HF migraine patients relative to the LF migraine patients such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior insula, thalamus (pulvinar), parahippocampus, hypothalamus, putamen and frontal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412445622">Figure 1</xref>). HF migraine patients also showed lower functional connectivity with the substantia nigra relative to the LF patients.

<sec id="sec17-0333102412445622" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we report on cortical differences in patients who have either low ( &lt;2 days/month) or high (8–14 days/month) frequency migraine attacks. There are no clear-cut phases in episodic migraine but probably a continuum. Determination of the migraine frequency was a crucial point as migraine frequency was the characteristic difference between the groups. Our rationale was that migraine presents a spectrum of attacks from no attacks, to few, to many episodic attacks. The frequency of migraine attacks was chosen prospectively. In our cohort, the average age of onset for the LF group was 21.6 ± 3.2 years. The patients had remained LF migraineurs for an average duration of 21.6 ± 4.3 years. The HF migraine patients had comparable average age of onset (24.2 ± 4.4 years) and average duration (21.2 ± 3.3 years) of the disease confirming the fact that the groups only differed in the frequency of migraine attacks.</p>
<p>Because this was a cross-sectional study we were not able to make inferences about the migraine progression. Instead, we hypothesized that comparing the brain differences in two cohorts of migraine patients that are at two extreme ends of the episodic migraine disease spectrum (very mild vs. very severe), but matched otherwise, will provide new insights into the mechanisms of the migraine disease. Doing such a study is very difficult unless you have a large pool of migraine patients from which you can specifically select patients for each of these two extremes. We screened 60 migraine patients for this study. Thus we were able to carefully select and match subjects for this study.</p>
<p>This provided an opportunity to characterize cortical differences in migraine as a function of the increased number of attacks. Our data show that a number of cortical areas are differentially affected in HF vs. LF migraineurs and there are concurrent structural and functional differences in these cortical areas. Thicker cortex was observed in the post-central gyrus in HF vs. LF migraine patients that also showed stronger response to noxious stimulation in the HF group. Other cortical regions (inferior insula, anterior and posterior mid-cingulate) showed a difference in the volume (HF &lt; LF) that was accompanied by concurrent differential response (HF &lt; LF) to noxious stimulation in the same structures in HF patients. Functional connectivity analysis indicated significant differences between the functional connectivity of the structures that had shown structural differences in HF vs. LF migraineurs with the rest of the brain, specifically with the areas involved in pain processing. These cortical differences parallel subcortical differences previously reported for migraine frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412445622">19</xref>) and are consistent with dynamic multisystem brain changes in the migraine condition that may be exacerbated by increased migraine attacks.</p>
<sec id="sec18-0333102412445622"><title>Increased activation and cortical thickness</title>
<p>In earlier reports, cortical thickening in migraineurs vs. HC has been reported in the somatosensory cortex of migraineurs vs. HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0333102412445622">14</xref>). However, the latter studies did not show a correlation of functional activation in the primary somatosensory cortex as it relates to pain (i.e. evoked activation by noxious stimulation). Here we extend these findings, suggesting that differences in the S1 may relate to the number of migraine attacks and as such may confirm that these differences are a consequence of the disease not the cause of it. Previous reports have noted increased excitability in the somatosensory cortex in migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412445622">9</xref>). In the results presented here, the activation location overlaps with the differences observed in cortical thickness and the region activated correlates to the location on the sensory homunculus represented by the head/face. This localization is verified based on our prior fMRI study on specific localized representations of inputs from the face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0333102412445622">32</xref>). The activations observed in our current study are located in the predefined areas determined in our earlier study. Given that the area of cortical thickness difference is restricted and overlaps with the same region, we interpret the differences as a result of increased afferent (nociceptive) drive to the somatosensory cortex as a result of increased attacks (HF &gt; LF). Cortical thickening may relate to increased afferent input to these regions in a manner analogous to activation-dependent thickening following motor training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0333102412445622">33</xref>) or musical training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0333102412445622">34</xref>). While the specific mechanism is unclear, these changes may include an increased number or even density of neuronal or glial cells in certain parts of the cortex in a similar manner seen in other brain areas reported in a rat model of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412445622">35</xref>). Consistent with our data, in a related report the somatosensory cortex has been reported to become increasingly sensitized in patients with chronic daily headache, which is a complication of episodic headaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0333102412445622">4</xref>).</p>
<p>As noted in the results, functional connectivity with the S1 was noted in other cortical regions including the posterior insula, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, the hippocampus and frontal region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412445622">Figure 1</xref>). Of these the posterior insula is also involved in nociceptive processing of pain intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0333102412445622">36</xref>). While increased cortical excitability in migraine patients is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0333102412445622">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0333102412445622">37</xref>), these results indicate specific differences between the HF and LF groups. We interpret this connectivity as related to nociceptive inputs that may interact with other brain regions directly or indirectly through cortical and subcortical pathways involved in nociceptive drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0333102412445622">13</xref>). However, the issue is more complex in that some areas showed weaker functional connectivity in the HF group. The connectivity between S1 and the substantia nigra is intriguing because repeated pain may drive diminished dopaminergic systems (involved in reward) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0333102412445622">38</xref>).</p>
<p>Although activation differences between the HF and LF groups were observed in the temporal pole (TP) and inferior temporal (IT) lobe, no overlap in gray matter morphology was present. However, significant differences in cortical thickness were present in the inferior temporal gyrus but without any functional correlates. We have previously reported fMRI measures of the temporal lobe in migraine patients vs. HCs in the ictal and interictal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0333102412445622">39</xref>). Increased activation was observed in the anterior temporal pole and notably, activation in the temporal pole was exacerbated during their ictal vs. interictal phase. In another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0333102412445622">40</xref>) we had seen that capsaicin altered noxious stimulus responses in the inferior temporal gyrus. The inferior temporal gyrus is also involved in placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0333102412445622">41</xref>). Here the differences seem to reflect this sensitized state resulting from migraine in the HF group.</p>
<p>While the HF migraineurs showed statistically significant differences with the HC subjects in all of the regions reported in this study that was not the case for the LF migraineurs. Differences between HC and LF migraineurs were only statistically significant for sensory regions (S1 and IT). In HF migraineurs, cortical thickness in these regions is higher relative to LF migraineurs and in LF migraineurs it is lower relative to HC. We interpret this as an initial damage or ‘wear and tear’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0333102412445622">42</xref>) of these regions with the onset of the disease that then is compensated by an adaptive response of the brain to meet the increased demand for sensory processing, as the frequency of migraine attacks increase. These morphological changes may reflect complex dynamic alterations due to neurochemical changes with repeated migraine attacks (and perhaps in the interictal period) (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0333102412445622">43</xref>)). Gray matter changes have been reported to correlate with alterations in synaptic and dendritic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0333102412445622">35</xref>). The underlying notion that migraine alters the brain is consistent with other, more recent reports in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0333102412445622">2</xref>). On the other hand, alterations in neuronal activity can elicit long-lasting changes in the synaptic strength transmission at excitatory synapses and drugs or disease may modify dendritic spine density and thus synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0333102412445622">44</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec19-0333102412445622"><title>Decreased activation and cortical thickness</title>
<p>Unlike the somatosensory cortex, other cortical regions showed lower gray matter in HF vs. LF. in the cingulate and the anterior insula. All of these regions are involved in affective processing of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0333102412445622">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412445622">46</xref>).

In fMRI studies of migraine patients, activation of brain regions in response to noxious stimulation has included the cingulate during the interictal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412445622">49</xref>). Here, further insights into how the region may differ in its response to stimuli show differences between the two groups with HF &lt; LF and associated cortical volumetric differences, noted in the mid-cingulate.</p>
<p>The ACC is involved in descending modulation, and activation of the ACC may facilitate spinal nociception via midbrain modulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0333102412445622">50</xref>). Activity within the ACC has been reported to be correlated with the subjective experience of pain unpleasantness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0333102412445622">51</xref>) but not pain intensity. Also specific manipulation of pain unpleasantness produces significant changes in the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0333102412445622">52</xref>). Our results indicate lower unpleasantness rating along with lower activity of the ACC in the HF group, consistent with the above-described finding. As to the specific differences found in the mid-cingulate that seem to make it more prone to differences observed in the HF group, two findings may bear on the issue. The first is related to plasticity in the nociceptive thalamic-cingulate pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0333102412445622">53</xref>) and the second is the differences in receptor architecture that is observed in the mid-cingulate compared with the anterior and posterior cingulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0333102412445622">54</xref>). These differences may relate to “modifications of cingulate synapses (from repeated migraine attacks) appear to regulate afferent signals that may be important to the transition from acute to chronic pain conditions associated with persistent peripheral noxious stimulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0333102412445622">53</xref>).</p>
<p>Activation observed in response to noxious heat in the anterior insula region has been associated with both acute and chronic pain processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0333102412445622">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0333102412445622">46</xref>). The region is activated in both ictal and interictal migraine imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0333102412445622">49</xref>). The anterior insula is involved in interoception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0333102412445622">55</xref>), a basis for self-awareness, and may be involved in impending stimulus significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0333102412445622">56</xref>). One would expect the regions to be activated with repetitive stimuli, i.e. more migraines. Repetitive stimuli produce repeated challenges so we interpret our result as a potential basis for patients with HF migraine having a blunted response to interoceptive processing of pain, which, from a neurological perspective, may be a consequence of an adaptation process. The awareness of perturbations thus occurs in the pre-ictal migraine and perhaps the interictal migraine state. This view is supported by the connectivity analysis of the insula reported in our results where HF patients show a stronger connectivity with sensory processing regions including the post-central gyrus compared with LF patients. In support of this, behavioral changes in migraine patients include disturbances of body image and physical sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0333102412445622">57</xref>), including alteration of time sense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0333102412445622">58</xref>); are indicative of alteration of self-perception/interoception.</p>
<p>The comorbidity among depression disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0333102412445622">59</xref>), anxiety and migraine has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0333102412445622">60</xref>). For instance there is an increasing risk of depression in patients who have higher frequency headaches as in daily chronic headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0333102412445622">61</xref>). The pathways in these disorders overlap extensively with pathways implicated in the generation, perception and regulation of emotions and affective states. As such the decreased cortical gray matter volume in the cingulate cortex and insular cortex that we report here has also been reported in patients with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0333102412445622">62</xref>) and major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0333102412445622">63</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to determine which regions were modulated relative to the side of stimulation, each functional image was flipped along the y-axis (anterior–posterior axis) before being registered to the standard brain. Thus, we effectively treated voxels in homologous parts of the brain as the same voxel. The use of flipped brains in fMRI analysis is a well-described procedure in clinical pain studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0333102412445622">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0333102412445622">67</xref>). A recent fMRI study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0333102412445622">68</xref>) on the cortical laterality in response to electrical pain stimulation has shown that the somatosensory cortex is activated contralaterally, while the mid/posterior insula, anterior insula and posterior cingulate are activated bilaterally in response to electrical pain stimulation. The same study reports bilateral but right lateralized activation in the anterior cingulate. Therefore for our analysis, flipping of the brain was essential for S1, while flipping should not affect the comparisons for the insula. However, we found a significant difference in the anterior mid-cingulate between cohorts, which was bilateral. In our study the number of subjects that received stimulation on the left side was higher in HF (7 subjects) vs. LF (4 subjects), and the direction of the differences (LF &gt; HF). We therefore performed the analysis without flipping the brains to confirm the difference that we see is not caused by flipping. The results of that analysis are provided in Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0333102412445622">Figure 1</xref>. As it can be seen the same results were obtained without flipping the brain, with subtle differences in the size of the activated area.</p>

<p>Limitations of the present study include the higher use of NSAIDS and triptans in the HF group. However, the similar cortical thickness observed for HC compared with the LF group provides some insights that medications may be a contributory factor. Although both patient cohorts were matched in terms of the history of the medications they had used, in this study we cannot rule out direct triptan-mediated effects on these structures. The issue of the potential influence of triptans as a confounding variable is documented elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412445622">19</xref>). In one region (temporal lobe), no overlap of activation and cortical thickness differences were observed: this could in part be explained by a technical shortcoming in the way the functional data was gathered during imaging, where in some of the subjects, that particular area was out of the field of view of imaging and as such that area was excluded during the group level comparison altogether and the final statistical contrast maps did not include that particular region.</p>
<p>Because Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependant (BOLD) response depends heavily on blood volume, one concern could be that the co-localized associations in cortical thickness and BOLD activation could be explained by co-localized differences in blood volume (between the groups) and not function. However some cortical surface-based functional analysis studies that have used cortical thickness at each vertex as a covariate in the analysis have shown that cortical functional activation comparisons remain the same with or without using cortical thickness as a covariate. In addition independence of the spatial distribution of regional brain atrophy and cerebral blood flow has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0333102412445622">69</xref>). Moreover, our previous studies found no difference in the first peak of the biphasic pain response in the subcortical structures (that also correlated with the measured cognitive responses), suggestive of the fact that the observed difference in BOLD response (that also correlated with the measured cognitive response) was due to the function rather than volume difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0333102412445622">19</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec21-0333102412445622" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our results present evidence for co-localized morphometric and functional cortical differences as a probable brain’s adaptive response to repeated migraine attacks. The results specifically suggest differential response patterns in the sensory vs. affective processing regions in the brain. It seems that the way the brain deals with increased frequency of migraine attacks is to form some sort of defense mechanism by being less affected (reduction in size and activity of the affective processing regions) by the increased sensory input while preparing to deal with this increased sensory input by allocating more ‘resources’ to the job (i.e. by increased cortical thickness and activity).</p>
