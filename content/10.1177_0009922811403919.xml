<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Primary varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection is a highly contagious and very common infection among the pediatric population. Complications are generally mild. Rarely, it can produce serious life-threatening cardiovascular complications such as myocarditis, pericarditis, and pericardial effusion. We report a case of massive pericardial effusion leading to the development of constrictive pericarditis after 5 weeks of VZV infection in an 8-year-old boy. It endangered his life and was managed efficiently by a multimodal therapeutic approach.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>An 8-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with a sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and left-sided chest pain. There was wheeze, and the respiratory rate was 64 per minute. Pulse rate was 152 per minute and regular. Hypotension with wide pulse pressure was recorded (blood pressure 62/40 mm Hg). Clinical examination revealed an ill-defined cardiac apex, muffled heart sounds, engorged pulsatile neck vein, bilateral basal crepitations on the chest, and tender hepatomegaly. The child was in shock. The chest X-ray and echocardiography revealed massive pericardial effusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922811403919">Figure 1</xref>) with right atrial collapse and right ventricular diastolic collapse.</p>

</fig>
<p>An emergency pericardiocentesis was done. About 20 mL of clear pericardial fluid was aspirated. Supportive medical treatment with adequate fluid management, parenteral empirical antibiotics as ampicillin–amikacin, intravenous frusemide, and dobutamine infusion were started.</p>
<p>The child had a history of chicken pox developed 20 days prior to the admission and was managed with supportive medications. But there were no active vesicles except the hyper pigmented lesions over trunk and extremities. There was no history of any joint pain, preexisting renal disease, liver disease, cardiac disease, endocrinal disorders, prolonged drug intake, trauma, surgery, or radiation therapy. Contact family history with tuberculosis was absent.</p>
<p>Hemogram revealed Hb = 12.8 g/dL, leukocyte count = 9400/mm<sup>3</sup>, polymorphonuclear leukocyte = 64%, lymphocyte = 28%, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 44 mm in the first hour. Blood culture report showed no growth. Tuberculin test was negative. Liver function test, renal function test, coagulation profile, and thyroid profile test were normal. Serum for antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, HIV enzylme-linked immunosorbent assay test, and monospot test were also negative. The blood creatine kinase MB level was normal. Anti-VZV IgM antibody in the serum was 1452 IU/mL on the day of admission (cutoff being &gt;275 IU/mL).</p>
<p>Pericardial fluid examination revealed fluid to serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ratio &lt;0.6 (transudate), no organism, and the adenosine deaminase level was 26 U/L. (ADA in tuberculosis is 63-117U/L). Bacterial culture report of pericardial fluid showed no growth. Mycobacterial and fungal cultures were negative. The tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was negative. PCR for VZV was found to be positive. Intravenous acyclovir was started and continued for 7 days. After that oral acyclovir was given for another two weeks.</p>
<p>Repeat echocardiography report after 2 weeks revealed a moderate recollection of pericardial fluid, thickened pericardium, and fibrosis at inferior region suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. As there was no significant improvement in cardiac output, pericardiectomy was performed after 4 weeks of admission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922811403919">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Pericardial biopsy material showed fibrocollagenous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate without epithelioid granuloma or neoplastic changes suggestive of chronic nonspecific pericarditis. The PCR from the biopsy material was positive for VZV. The culture report at the time of surgery showed no growth.</p>
<p>After a full clinical recovery, the patient was followed up for 6 months and was doing well.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chicken pox is a benign self-limiting viral infection in children. Rarely, it can produce severe infection especially in the immunocompromised child and adult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811403919">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811403919">2</xref></sup> Although cardiac complications with VZV infection are very rare, the resulting complications are poten-tially life threatening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811403919">3</xref></sup> Cardiac manifestations may include myocarditis, arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, secondary pericardial effusion, and endocarditis. Viral myocarditis is the most common clinical presentation. Pericarditis and pericardial effusion are usually associated with secondary bacterial infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811403919">3</xref></sup> Virulent strains of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> are usually associated with it. Rarely, it can produce cardiac tamponade and chronic pericardial constriction.</p>
<p>Shefler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811403919">4</xref></sup> have described a case of cardiac tamponade that developed 2 weeks after the onset of varicella exanthema as a consequence of myopericarditis in a 4-month-old infant. Laskey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811403919">5</xref></sup> have reported a case of infective endocarditis by group A beta-hemolytic <italic>Streptococcus</italic> in a 3-year-old child after primary VZV infection. Masood et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811403919">6</xref></sup> have reported a case of cardiac tamponade as a result of secondary bacterial pericarditis after varicella infection in an 8-month-old infant.</p>
<p>Similar to other cardiotrophic viruses (eg, Coxsakie, Epstein–Barr, mumps, and HIV), direct cytopathic and secondary autoimmune effects are responsible for both myocardial and pericardial destruction. But the exact mechanism is unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811403919">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diagnosis of viral pericarditis can be established with the application of PCR techniques in the analyses of pericardial fluid and epicardial biopsies with much higher sensitivity and specificity, in comparison with previously applied techniques of viral isolation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811403919">7</xref></sup> PCR and in situ hybridization techniques can identify minute amounts of viral nucleic acid.</p>
<p>There may be hemorrhagic pericardial effusion as a complication of primary varicella infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811403919">8</xref></sup> Nandeesh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811403919">9</xref></sup> have described a case of hemorrhagic pericarditis with deep vein thrombosis in a 5-year-old child after varicella infection.</p>
<p>As described earlier, secondary bacterial infection is responsible for the development of constrictive pericarditis in most of the cases of varicella infection. VZV-induced constrictive changes are very rare. In our case, possibilities of other cardiotrophic viruses and tuberculosis were ruled out. There was no evidence of any secondary bacterial infection. Still, there was recollection in the pericardium along with constrictive changes. The titer for anti-IgM VZV was high, and the PCR test detected varicella both from the pericardial fluid and the biopsy material. The earliest constrictive changes were detected on echocardiography after 5 weeks of VZV infection.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no case report in available literature where constrictive changes have developed following primary varicella infection in a pediatric population. In conclusion, constrictive pericarditis is a rare and still obscure complication of varicella zoster infection. Physicians should be aware of the potential cardiovascular involvement of VZV infection as the prognosis is not always favorable.</p>
