<p>For too long, research into the relationship between media and nation has stalled, relying on an established canon whose limits have long been acknowledged, or else adding to the weight of arguments between those who see processes of globalization undermining national forms of representation, production and legislation, and their critics. Granted there have been some useful empirical studies undertaken, dealing with particular countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267323112441290">Abu-Lughod, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267323112441290">Madianou, 2005</xref>) or regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267323112441290">Triandafyllidou et al., 2009</xref>) but fresh theoretical insights have been somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>Therefore, to say that Sabina Mihelj’s new book, <italic>Media Nations</italic>, is timely would be something of an understatement. In the introduction, Mihelj outlines her main aims for the book. First, she points to the unfortunate divide between those who study, through textual and genre analysis, representations of the nation, and those who focus on institutional structures, namely socioeconomic and political systems, arguing for a more integrated approach that takes into account questions of culture (and its reproduction) and power. Second, she seeks to provide a framework for conducting comparative and historical analyses of the relationship between media and nation by emphasizing the different trajectories of modernity that have impacted on different parts of the globe. This last point is key as it is argued that these differing paths underpin the emergence of particular forms of national imagination, social systems and processes of inclusion/exclusion. In doing so, there is a clear (and very welcome) attempt to move beyond the dichotomies of national and global, parochial and cosmopolitan, civic and ethnic nationalism that have long dogged analyses of both nationalism and media nations.</p>
<p>To some extent, Chapters 1 and 2 represent a ground-clearing exercise as Mihelj outlines the limitations of current approaches, provides some useful definitions of key terms and indicates her own primary concerns. In the latter case, she offers an insightful analysis of Anderson’s seminal <italic>Imagined Communities</italic>, noting that while arguments concerning processes of imagination have been enthusiastically picked up by scholars in a range of disciplines, Anderson’s related discussion of the wider institutional and socioeconomic shifts which supported such ‘imaginings’ has been somewhat neglected. Put simply, it is argued that we need to understand ‘how nationalism as a particular form of discourse or cultural imagination is tied to the institutional structures of modern media, and to their broader economic, political and social realities’ (p. 3). These sections are clear, authoritative and will, no doubt, be useful for those coming to the topic anew. For those more au fait with the literature, they might represent something of a trawl through some very familiar debates, a point that Mihelj acknowledges (p. 38).</p>
<p>As a result, it is not until Chapter 3 that the book really hits its straps, whereupon an alternative analytical framework for studying the ‘changing nature of mass communication and nationhood’ (p. 44) is discussed, one which directly draws on Eisenstadt’s theory of multiple modernities. This is advanced as a means of avoiding the ahistorical features, and western-centric bias, of many theories of nationalism and media systems. Instead, emphasis is placed on the multiple routes to modernity that different social groups have taken and, in particular, the ‘institutional solutions’ and ‘projections of collective identity’ that emerged as a result (p. 50). Mihelj uses a tripartite model that traces the differing relations between economic, political and cultural spheres in three ideal types of ‘society’: liberal, communist and fascist/fundamentalist. These relations are, in turn, seen to engender particular media systems and forms of national imagination based around the primacy of the market, the state and community/culture, respectively. In other words, liberal societies articulate a reduced role for the state, and regulate the media as a commercial system. Representations of the nation tend therefore to be linked to the production and consumption of goods and services. Under communism, the media becomes an arm of the state and the nation is defined as a community of ‘classless’ workers. The fascist model, based on the organizing principle that the economic and political spheres should serve the interests of a narrowly defined cultural or religious ‘community’, begets a media system designed to exemplify and stimulate cultural integration. Mihelj is careful to acknowledge that most, if not all, real-world examples are likely to feature some elements of each system but suggests that such a model offers a useful starting point for examining the link between social structures, forms of imagination and exclusion, in both comparative and historical terms. Although I found this framework broadly useful, I thought more might have been made of Eisenstadt’s emphasis on the important role that ‘religious cores’ had in underpinning differing programmes of modernity, not only in relation to ‘fundamentalist’ but also liberal societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267323112441290">Spohn, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The final part of Chapter 3 offers a convincing argument with regard to the rise to prominence of neoliberal economic systems across the globe, and the concomitant shift towards a more liberal media model, which tends to represent the nation in terms of consumption and, in the process, excludes the poor. This point is evidenced, in one of the most interesting passages of the book, by looking at three, rather brief, case studies: South Africa, former Yugoslavia and India.</p>
<p>At this point, however, the discussion begins to drift and it’s not so much that the remaining chapters don’t feature any useful insights, they certainly do, but in discussing war and peace reporting, ‘the gendered order of media nations’ and media nations and time, it’s sometimes difficult to see how these chapters evidence, or develop, the analytical framework that has been outlined previously. Moreover, I found the level of analysis in these chapters to be a little uneven. While a historical study of the Chinese national calendar in Chapter 8 is illuminating, the analysis of banal and hot news reporting in the US before and after 9/11 relies on a few op-ed pieces from <italic>The New York Times</italic> and seems rather ‘thin’. As a result, the latter part of the book seems to be quite different in both its tone (it’s rather general compared to the earlier parts, which are very focused) and objectives (which, to me, at least, were unclear). To this end, the final chapter offers a reflection on current approaches to organizing and mediating ‘diversity’, which while again thoughtful and balanced, doesn’t make any attempt to draw together any of the previous discussions or outline a future research agenda. The latter might have been particularly worthwhile in relation to current debates around mediatization/media life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267323112441290">Deuze, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267323112441290">Livingstone, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, there are many ways to approach such a topic, and Mihelj has done an excellent job in synthesizing what is an extremely diverse literature in such a clear and accessible manner. However, I did wonder whether the first (theoretical) part might have been better complemented by a series of extended case studies (say, for argument’s sake, India, Yugoslavia, China, USA and Brazil) that could be used to both interrogate the analytical framework being put forward and develop some of the subsequent discussions around conflict reporting, gender and so on in a more coherent manner.</p>
<p>These thoughts aside, Mihelj should be congratulated for not only challenging some of the most tired clichés around nationalism, globalization and the role of the media but, above all, providing an analytical framework that offers a useful starting point for further research into this topic.</p>
