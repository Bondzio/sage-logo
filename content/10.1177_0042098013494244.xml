<p><italic>Re-visioning Indian Cities</italic> is a timely and useful publication for scholars interested in planning, decentralisation and urban governance reform in contemporary Indian cities. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), a major seven-year urban renewal programme with an investment of more than $20 million, launched by the Ministry of Urban Development of the Government of India on 3 December 2005, is the main subject of the book. Through the experience of implementing this substantial centrally driven programme, wider governance issues such as decentralisation, centre–state, state–city and centre–city relations; city planning-related issues such as slums, housing, transport and urban mobility and the delivery of basic needs such as water supply, sewerage, sanitation and solid waste are discussed. In the aftermath of the 74th Constitution Amendment Act of India enacted in 1992, which sought to empower local governments as institutions of local <italic>self-</italic>government, the experience of implementing the JNURRM is certainly of much interest. This programme aimed at improving the liveability of a total of 65 identified cities out of which 7 are classified as mega cities with a further 28 classified as million plus cities.</p>
<p>The contextual background and the genesis of the programme are discussed in chapter 1; parts of chapter 2 provide an overview of the various components, the coverage and the project sanction process of the JNURRM programme. However, the book starts to acquire the feel of a report from this point onwards until about chapter 4. These chapters paint a picture of the implementation of the programme across various sectors such as urban poverty, transport, housing and basic services and are liberally interspersed with tables of descriptive data on many aspects of the programme. The need for the reproduction of data to the extent present is rather unclear, especially since they are largely sourced from publicly available secondary sources. The book would perhaps have been more succinct had these been interrogated and summarised to highlight the statistics needed for the key claims and arguments made in the book.</p>
<p>Various cross cutting issues in the implementation of JNNURM, are highlighted from chapter 5 onwards. Chapter 6 provides more information on the overarching ‘reforms agenda’, a total of 12 mandatory governance reform initiatives imposed as a condition for the release of funds attached to the programme. These reforms were to be implemented at state and local levels including parastatals such as Water Boards and Development Authorities in charge of specific aspects of urban planning or service delivery. The chapter highlights the ambiguities in the programme and the lack of veracity in reporting leading to significant watering-down of the ambitious urban reform agenda. Reflections into the cause of policy failure and what the Ministry of Urban Development might have done to prevent this are included in chapters 7–12. The author’s ‘insider status’ as a previous Secretary to the government of India and a member of the Technical Advisory Group constituted to advise the national government on the overall progress of the JNNURM programme, followed by close affiliation to the Centre for Policy Research, a major think-tank on policy matters, is apparent in these informed reflections.</p>
<p>The importance of ‘the urban’ in contemporary India and the increasing recognition that the urban now commands in government circles, together with the fast-changing landscape of aspirations and expectations of citizens within a context of rapid urbanisation and rising inequalities are stressed in the book. The derailing of the spirit and intention of the Constitutional Amendment Acts (CAA) in practice in most states of India, and the extremely narrow interpretation of the CAA that has emerged through case law is discussed albeit briefly. The culpable role of state governments in refusing to devolve responsibilities, finances and powers to local governments, while maintaining a significant stake in urban affairs through parastatals is, it is pointed out, the main reason for the lack of progress in building up city governance capacities. As a consequence, city administrations that were already powerful entities even before the advent of JNURRM (such as mega cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore) continue to be the main beneficiaries of the programme, skewing the equitable distribution of funds. Implications of non-representative modes of municipal governance such as industrial townships, business industrial districts and exclusive residential developments that are now emerging at a faster pace throughout the country are also briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Within the overall rather disconcerting general picture, new more positive initiatives that give cause for hope are also cited. These include initiatives for Peer Experience and Reflective Learning (PEARL), service-level benchmarks and award schemes. Also significant is the acknowledgement of ‘the urban’ and ‘the city’ as a complex but significant realm for national policy intervention, a recognition that was not hitherto forthcoming within the Indian context.</p>
<p>
<italic>Re-visioning Indian Cities</italic> is therefore an insider critique of the JNURRM programme, in both its design and implementation. It is a thoughtful and rather discerning book and for a scholar studying Indian issues this would be of interest. The book however does not go out of its way to cater to an audience not already familiar with the Indian situation. For instance, acronyms are numerous (although the list of abbreviations at the start helps in navigation) giving a quality of Indian ‘policy-speak’ to the book. Also, details such as the use of ‘a crore’ and ‘a lakh’ (units in the South Asian system equivalent to 10 million and 100,000 respectively), the use of the Indian rupee alone without more widely recognised currency equivalents and the absence of a map to aid the location of the numerous places and institutions referred to will not be very helpful to readers unfamiliar with the Indian context.</p>
<p>Careful proof reading in the production of the book would also have been welcome. Although not frequent, proof errors do come up more often than expected. Finally, the book makes little effort to engage with either academic thought or modes of explanations and there is little reference to wider theoretical exposition on the issues it raises. Academic books or articles of any kind are rarely cited, the bulk of the citations being either study reports or policy documents. There is therefore hardly any gesture towards academic scholarship. For a practitioner confronted with the complex reality of managing Indian cities, as also for a student of Indian urban realities, it nevertheless offers a valuable and educative insight.</p>
