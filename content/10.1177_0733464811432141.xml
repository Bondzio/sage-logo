<abstract>
<p>The article aims to (a) examine the reasons for nonuse of ADCC, and (b) explore the reasons for use of adult day care centers (ADCCs) among users. The sample includes 819 respondents of whom 417 are users of 13 day care centers and 402 are nonusers, matched by age, gender, and family physician in the southern region of Israel. Data collection includes interviews that used a structured questionnaire. The most frequent reasons for nonuse of ADCCs are accessibility barriers, characteristics of participants and of the ADCCs, “no need for this service,” and personal difficulties. Those who use this service report that it improved their well-being, met their needs, enabled them to establish social relationships, and alleviated their family caregivers’ burden. ADCCs should be more responsive to the needs of various constituencies of frail older adults and be more accessible to those who do not use this type of service.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult day care centers (ADCCs) compose a core, community-based, long-term care service for frail older adults. ADCC play an important role in the community-based long-term care continuum: (a) From the perspective of the frail older person, they help in sustaining and preserving the functioning of older people, allowing them to age in place, and meet some of their long-term care needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0733464811432141">Anetzberger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811432141">Gaugler &amp; Zarit, 2001</xref>), including social and emotional needs that can help alleviate feelings of loneliness, boredom, and solitude, improve quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0733464811432141">Baumgarten, Lebel, Laprise, Leclerc, &amp; Quinn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0733464811432141">Bilotta, Bergamaschini, Spreafico, &amp; Vergani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0733464811432141">Jacob, Abraham, Abraham, &amp; Jacob, 2007</xref>), reduce levels of depression, buffer stress, and increase levels of life satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0733464811432141">Garcia-Martin, Gomez-Jacinto, &amp; Martimportugues-Goyenechea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0733464811432141">Valadez, Lumadue, Gutierrez, &amp; de Vries-Kell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0733464811432141">Williams &amp; Roberts, 1995</xref>); (b) From the perspective of the family caregiver, ADCCs form a kind of respite service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464811432141">Jarrott, Zarit, Berg, &amp; Johansson, 1998</xref>) that helps reduce the family’s burden and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0733464811432141">Gaugler et al., 2003</xref>). They enable family members to lead normal lives, encourage them to assume this responsibility for a longer period, and alleviate care-related stress among caregivers of Alzheimer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0733464811432141">Shacke &amp; Zank, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the important goals that ADCC aim to achieve, a high proportion of frail older people who live in the community do not use them. For example, in Israel only about 7% of those who were entitled to use this type of service under the Long-term Care Insurance law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811432141">Iecovich &amp; Carmel, 2011</xref>) actually used this service. In the United States, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0733464811432141">Travis, Steele, and Long (2001)</xref> found in Oklahoma that only 15% of the older adults who would be expected to use this type of service were participating in its programs, mainly because such programs do not meet their needs. A study conducted among African American older adults with mental health impairments in Washington State found that respite services, including ADCCs, were the least utilized among an array of supportive services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0733464811432141">Li, Edwards, &amp; Morrow-Howell, 2004</xref>). Underuse of ADCCs was also reported in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0733464811432141">Gutman, Milstein, Killam, &amp; Lewis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811432141">Ritchie, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In most cases, the reasons for underutilization were found to be related to lack of awareness, stigma in terms of childcare connotation ascribed to ADCC, clients’ preferences, including a reluctance towards participating in group activities, and clients who considered the days too long and who were too ill to attend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464811432141">Gutman, Milstein, Killam, Lewis, &amp; Hollander, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811432141">Montgomery, Marquis, Schaefer, &amp; Kosloski, 2002</xref>). Other reasons for nonattendance focused on the system, including bureaucratic processes, limited accessibility, activities, and inappropriate transportation and the variety of services that were provided at the ADCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811432141">Ritchie, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0733464811432141">Hong (2004)</xref>, for example, found that the most frequent unmet service need was adult day care.</p>
<p>The major reasons for use were as follows: It enables aging in place; it provides respite service for family caregivers and key features of facilities/services provided also include the following: program components that include health promotion and physical assessment and care, program characteristics in terms of flexibility in meeting clients needs, physical setting that is culturally sensitive, and staff characteristics, in particular their knowledge and skills to address complex needs of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0733464811432141">Gaugler &amp; Zarit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0733464811432141">Ritchie, 2003</xref>); it also provides social activities, increases contact with friends, or enables individuals to make new friends and keep themselves active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0733464811432141">Tse &amp; Howie, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies that examined differences between users and nonusers of ADCCs focused mainly on differences in sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, their health, and their functional and economic status (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0733464811432141">Gutman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811432141">Montgomery et al., 2002</xref>). Surveys conducted in the United States showed that typical day care users were disabled and aged between 75 and 79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0733464811432141">Montgomery et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811432141">Reifler, Henry, &amp; Cox, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464811432141">Weissert, Wan, Livierators, &amp; Katz, 1980</xref>). Most participants were White, non-Hispanic women who lived with their spouses or other relatives. Other studies showed that unmarried women with lower income used ADCC more frequently compared to married men with higher income. Also, health conditions, such as Alzheimer disease, stroke, heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and functional status were connected with utilization of ADCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0733464811432141">Cohen-Mansfield, Lipson, Brenneman, &amp; Pawlson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0733464811432141">Kirwin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0733464811432141">Reifler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0733464811432141">Weissert et al., 1980</xref>). An Israeli study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811432141">Iecovich &amp; Carmel, 2011</xref>) found users of ADCCs were comprised of participants whose group in general had the following demographic characteristics: Participants were younger, were unmarried, were living alone, had less education, were living longer in Israel, were functionally less limited (in instrumental activities of daily living [IADL] and activities of daily living [ADL]), had appraised their health status as better, had a larger family network but seldom met with their family members, and were less likely to have a homecare worker compared to nonusers. However, a study that compared between the characteristics of cognitively impaired participants of American and Swedish ADCCs found that clients’ characteristics were similar, suggesting that ADCCs were a widespread solution to the common problem of supporting disabled older persons, in particular those with mental health impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0733464811432141">Jarrott et al., 1998</xref>). Yet most studies that examined use or underuse of ADCCs were conducted in the United States and they focused mainly on family caregivers whose older family members were cognitively impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0733464811432141">Beisecker, Wright, Chrisman, &amp; Ashworth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0733464811432141">Cohen-Mansfield, Besansky, Watson, &amp; Bernhard, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several models of ADCCs: social, medical, and integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0733464811432141">Dabelko &amp; Zimmerman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0733464811432141">Van Beveren &amp; Hetherington, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0733464811432141">Weissert, 1976</xref>). The medical model includes assessment, care, and rehabilitation, and the social model focuses on socialization and prevention. The third, integrated model, includes two elements from the other two models. In addition, there are ADCCs that serve specific population groups of older persons such as cognitively impaired or physically disabled but cognitively intact. In the United States, for example, 37% of the ADCCs operate according to the social model (20% of them serve cognitively impaired patients), 42% operate according to the integrated model, and only about 21% operate according to the medical model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0733464811432141">Nadash, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0733464811432141">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJ], 2003</xref>). Furthermore, most ADCCs in the United States follow a medical or an integrated model rather than a social model, whereas in Israel the vast majority of ADCCs follow the social model. In order to gain a more global perspective, more research is needed to assess the various reasons for use or nonuse of ADCCs among different groups of consumers in different countries.</p>

<title>Adult Day Care Centers (ADCCs) in Israel</title>
<p>In Israel ADCCs compose a core, community-based service for frail older persons that started to develop in the early 1980s. After the enactment of the Long-Term Care Insurance Law in 1986 that aimed to provide care to functionally disabled older adults and to support their family caregivers, many new ADCCs were established. Today, there are 172 ADCCs that serve approximately 15,500 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0733464811432141">Brodsky, Shnoor, &amp; Be’er, 2011</xref>). Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0733464811432141">Be’er, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0733464811432141">Iecovich &amp; Carmel, 2011</xref>) conducted in Israel found that most ADCCs follow the social model and actually serve for the most part older persons who are moderately frail and who belong to lower socioeconomic status, whereas severely disabled older adults barely use this type of service though it is optional to all frail older persons regardless of their ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Only a very few ADCCs in Israel aim to serve cognitively impaired older persons, compared to 52% of such facilities in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0733464811432141">National Adult Day Services Association [NADSA], 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The core services provided at the ADCC include personal care, social activities, health promotion, meals, recreation, physical activities, laundry, transportation, and personal counseling. However, no health care services are provided in these facilities. Most of the centers operate 5 days a week, 5 to 6 hr a day. They are heterogeneous in their physical size, number of participants, characteristics of the participants, variety of services, auspices, and operators. Expenditures are covered by the long-term care benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0733464811432141">Schmid, 2005</xref>) that enable beneficiaries to replace all home care services with ADCC or have mixed care. Thus, payment using an ADCC, per day, ranges from US$22.50 to US$31.00, approximately, depending on the level of functional dependency of the participant; these fees are covered by the National Insurance Institute. The ADCCs provide transportation and two meals a day (breakfast and lunch) for which the participants copay about US$5 a day. For each participant, an individual care plan is prepared and provided by a multidisciplinary team.</p>
<p>However, due to the paucity of studies that examined these issues from the perspective of the older persons themselves who visit or do not visit in ADCCs, more research is needed to learn about the factors that affect utilization or underutilization of this type of community-based service among physically disabled but cognitively intact older persons. Considering the many types of resources invested in establishing and operating ADCCs, it is important to identify the factors that affect their utilization from the perspective of the users themselves. It is also important to investigate the reasons for underuse of ADCC from the perspective of the relevant potential users, an issue that has been barely examined. Therefore, this study aims to examine the reasons for use and nonuse of ADCCs from the perspective of the target population.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0733464811432141">
<title>Study Design and Ethics</title>
<p>A quasiexperimental design was used to recruit respondents. Participants were recruited from 12 ADCCs in the southern region of Israel that serve altogether about 1,000 registered frail older adults. The study was reviewed by an institutional board and was approved by the ethics committee of the Clalit HMO. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the interviews.</p>
<p>Inclusion criteria were as follows: Age above 60, ability to speak in Hebrew or in Russian (about a third of the respondents were immigrants from the erstwhile USSR, who immigrated to Israel after its collapse in 1989), frail in terms of having difficulties in performing ADL, and members of Clalit Health Service Organization, which is the largest HMO in Israel. In Israel there are four HMOs that operate under the National Health Insurance Law that was enacted in 1994 and provide universal health care services to all its citizens. The Clalit HMO provides health care services to more than half of the population in Israel, and the vast majority of older adults are insured in this organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0733464811432141">Bendelac, 2010</xref>). Only those who met the inclusion criteria and gave their consent to be interviewed were included in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0733464811432141">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample included 417 frail older adult users of ADCCs and 402 nonusers. From a total of 1,000 ADCCs users, 417 accepted to be interviewed, 165 refused to be interviewed, 75 were not members of the Clalit HMO, and the rest of the participants could not be interviewed due to language barriers, cognitive impairments, or general unavailability. In the first stage, a letter was posted to managers of the ADCCs explaining the goals of the study and asking their permission to enable the interviewers to present the research goals to the users of the ADCCs. In the second stage, users of the ADCCs were approached by the interviewers and were asked to volunteer to be interviewed.</p>
<p>The 402 nonusers were recruited through family physicians of the respondents who were asked to prepare lists of patients (nonusers) who had characteristics similar to the users’ in terms of age (same age or up to 5 years difference between user and nonuser), gender, functional status and who were treated by the same family physician, to control for differences between the clinical approaches of the family physicians treating those in the comparison group. In case a nonuser was unavailable or reluctant to participate in the study the physician was asked to provide another name that met the same criteria. Thus, 402 nonusers were interviewed, 111 refused to be interviewed, 65 were unavailable, 91 were unable to be interviewed, and 7 died. For 15 users no matched nonusers were found. Nonusers were sent a prenotification letter explaining to them the goals of the study, asking their consent to be interviewed, assuring them of confidentiality and notifying them that an interviewer would contact them the next week via telephone. A week later, interviewers called the older persons and asked their consent to be interviewed. Once they agreed, appointments were made at the home of the respondents.</p>

<sec id="section6-0733464811432141">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected during the period 2009-2010 through face-to-face interviews that used a structured questionnaire. All interviewers were trained to interview older people and in administering the questionnaire. All respondents underwent a Mini-Mental State (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0733464811432141">Folstein, Folstein, &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>) screening at the beginning of the interview, and only those who were cognitively intact were interviewed. Interviews with users of ADCCs were conducted privately in one of the rooms at the ADCC, to assure confidentiality, and with nonusers at their homes.</p>

<title>Reasons for nonuse</title>
<p>Based on interviews with directors of two ADCCs who were asked to provide reasons for ADCC underuse, a list of 20 items was composed to probe reasons for nonuse. These items were classified into six categories: awareness of the service (three items), accessibility barriers (four items), characteristics of the ADCC user participants (four items) and of the ADCCs (four items), “no need for such a service” (three items), and personal difficulties (three items). Respondents were asked to give dichotomous answers for each item: 1 = <italic>yes</italic> or 0 = <italic>no</italic>. Scores for each category were summed with scores ranging from 0 to 3 or 4 (depending on number of items in each category) and then recoded with 1 = <italic>yes</italic> when answer to at least one of the items in the category was positive and 0 = <italic>no</italic> when all the answers in the category were negative.</p>

<title>Reasons for use</title>
<p>Users of ADCCs were presented with a list of 10 statements pertaining to reasons for visiting the ADCC with dichotomous answers for each item: 1 = <italic>yes</italic> and 0 = <italic>no</italic>. The list of statements were classified into four categories: promotes well-being (four items), provides social benefits (two items), meets needs (two items), and serves as respite for caregivers (two items). Scores for each category were summed with scores ranging from 0 to 2 or 4 (depending on number of items in each category) and were then recoded into 1 = <italic>yes</italic> when the answer to at least one item in the category was positive and 0 = <italic>no</italic> when answers to all items in the category were negative. In addition, the respondents were asked an open-ended question regarding how ADCC was helpful to their family caregivers.</p>

<title>Covariates</title>
<p>The covariate variables included sociodemographics characteristics: age; gender; education (included 7 categories ranging from 1 = <italic>partial elementary school</italic> to 7 = <italic>graduate degree and above</italic>); ethnicity (coded as 1 = <italic>Europe/North America</italic>, 2 = <italic>Asia Africa</italic>, and 3 = <italic>born in Israel</italic>, with new immigrants from the European part of former Soviet Union, like Russia, Ukraine, or Moldova, included in Category 1 and those who came from the Asian part of the former Soviet Union, like Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Tajikistan, included in Category 2); marital status that included four categories: married/lives with a partner, widowed, divorced/separated, or single/never married (coded 1 = <italic>married</italic> and 0 = <italic>unmarried</italic>); living arrangements (coded 1 = <italic>live alone</italic>, 2 = <italic>otherwise</italic>); number of children; number of children living in proximity; household size; and length of time living in Israel.</p>

<sec id="section18-0733464811432141">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>A range of descriptive analyses (percentages, means, and standard deviations) were initially performed to present the characteristics of the respondents and the dependent and independent variables. Also, <italic>t</italic> and chi-square tests were carried out to examine the differences between the users and the nonusers. Distribution of frequencies and crosstabs were used to examine the main reasons for use and nonuse of day care centers and combinations of reasons. To examine which of the independent variables was significantly associated with reasons for use and nonuse and correlations between reasons for nonuse, bivariate analyses were performed, including Pearson correlation coefficient analysis and chi-square tests, depending on the type of variables. To examine the factors that predict each of the categories of reasons for ADCC nonuse, logistic regressions analyses were performed. Data storage and analysis were performed using SPSS package version 17.</p>

<title>Characteristics of ADCCs</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0733464811432141">Table 1</xref> presents several selective characteristics of the ADCCs that were included in the study. Three of the ADCCs were located in a big city, six in small towns, and three in rural areas. All the ADCCs were operated by nonprofit organizations. All the ADCCs were open 5 days a week, 5.5 to 7 hr a day. The variety of services provided in the each of the ADCCs was very similar, taking into account the governmental guidelines that determine types of services that ADCCs should provide to their participants. These include transportation, two meals a day, social and recreational activities, personal care, and several health promotion activities such as physical movement. Nevertheless, ADCCs also provide some extra services such as pedicure, manicure, hairdressing, dentistry, and laundry. Mean number of participants who visited ADCCs every day ranged from 18 to 120.</p>

<title>Participants’ Characteristics</title>
<p>Respondents’ characteristics by ADCC utilization are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0733464811432141">Table 2</xref>. The findings show that the vast majority (about 76%) were women whose average age was about 78 years. No significant differences were found between users and nonusers of ADCCs in their functional status, number of children living in near proximity, and perceived economic status. Nevertheless, significant differences were found between the two groups of respondents in ethnicity, marital status, level of education, number of children, living arrangements, household size, length of stay in Israel, monthly income, and health status (self-rated health and comorbidity). Among those who attended ADCCs there were significantly more widowed persons, more with lower levels of education, more who were born in Asian African countries, more who were living alone with good to moderate levels of self-rated health, compared to their counterparts in the control group who were married, were more highly educated, who lived with spouses or adult children, and were born in European/North American countries but rated their health status as poorer. In addition, users of ADCCs had significantly more children, lived longer in Israel, lived in smaller households, a lower monthly income, and reported less comorbidity compared to their peers in the control group. Among those who attended ADCCs the average duration of visiting the ADCC was 49.17 months (<italic>SD</italic> = 50.35) and the average of weekly visits was 3.83 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.23).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0733464811432141">Table 3</xref> presents the distribution of reasons for nonuse of ADCCs. The findings indicate that the most prevalent reasons for nonuse were personal difficulties, accessibility barriers, characteristics of the ADCCs’ participants and of the service, and “no need for this type of service.” After summing the scores for each category of reasons, the findings indicate that only a negligible proportion was unaware of this type of service. The main reasons for nonuse were “no need for this type of service,” personal difficulties, accessibility barriers, as well as participants’ and ADCCs’ characteristics that were discouraging for the older persons to consider using this type of service. The vast majority (90.2%) of respondents provided four or more reasons for nonuse of ADCCS.</p>

<p>To examine the factors that explain nonuse of ADCCs, logistic regressions were performed for each of the reasons for nonuse, and the findings are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0733464811432141">Table 4</xref>. The equations included the same variables: participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, health and functional status, and economic status. The findings show that for each reason for nonuse a different combination of variables were found to explain the outcome variable. Thus, longer stay in Israel was associated with a 7% increase in the likelihood of awareness, whereas independence in ADL was associated with an 18% decrease in the likelihood of awareness. Being married was associated with a 65% decrease in the likelihood of accessibility difficulties, and lower income was associated with a 31% decrease in the likelihood of accessibility. Morbidity and economic status were associated, respectively, with a 13% and 19% decrease in the likelihood of not attending an ADCC due to participants’ characteristics. Gender and morbidity were associated, respectively, with a 46% and 12% decrease in the likelihood of not attending an ADCC due to its characteristics. Length of stay in Israel was associated with a 2% decrease in the likelihood of nonuse due to personal problems, morbidity was associated with an 18% decrease in the likelihood of personal problems, and functional status (ADL) was associated with a 10% increase in the likelihood of nonuse due to personal problems. All the regression models were found to be significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In brief, the findings show that a multiplicity of reasons caused potential users of ADCCs to avoid using them, including accessibility barriers, factors depending on the social milieu of this service, factors depending on the content of the service, “no need for this type of service,” and personal difficulties that hindered use of service. However, lack of awareness was not a significant deterrent to use of ADCCs, as found in several previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0733464811432141">Shibusawa, Ishikawa, &amp; Maeda, 2001</xref>). This might be because most ADCCs that were examined in this study were located in relatively small towns and rural areas with only one ADCC in each of them. Therefore, residents of these towns may know each other and be more aware and familiar with the services that exist in their localities compared to those who live in bigger cities.</p>
<p>The vast majority of nonusers provided a combination of reasons for nonuse, including accessibility, system, and personal factors, rather than identifying a singular reason. This reflects the multiplicity of factors that play a role in hindering the use of ADCC. However, what almost all nonusers reported as a reason for avoiding use of ADCC—that is, they did not need this type of service and prefer to stay at home—is perhaps due to their perception that the ADCCs do not meet their expectations and are unavailable to them and the negative image of ADCCs among the older adult population; thus, all such impediments deter older adults from using this type of service.</p>
<p>This explanation is further supported by the multivariate analyses that showed that various sociodemographic characteristics of respondents, including their health, functional, and economic status, were connected with reasons for nonuse. This suggests that it might be that the programs offered in ADCCs do not meet the health care needs of frail older adults who do not use this service because they view the ADCC as a “lower-class” service and feel less need for day care as a “social event.” In other words, it might be that the organization and delivery of services of ADCCs in Israel provide social links to those frail older adults who are relatively healthy but have “eroded” social networks. Therefore, those who are frail but have social links and support perceive that visiting an ADCC would not meet their real needs. In addition, the findings indicate that two factors were significant in explaining accessibility barriers: marital status and economic status. This might be because those who are unmarried have more difficulties in getting ready in the morning and wait for transportation, compared to their married counterparts who have spouses who can help them to get ready. Therefore, they may need somebody who can come in the morning and prepare them and accompany them to the transportation. Furthermore, inappropriate transportation for those who are severely disabled may also deter potential users from using this type of service. Regarding people with low economic status, it might be that because they have to choose between ADCC use and receiving homecare services provided under the long-term care insurance law, they may not be in position to pay for home help and, therefore, avoid visiting an ADCC. Morbidity was found to be a salient factor that decreased the likelihood to use ADCCs, due to participants’ and ADCCs’ characteristics as well as personal problems on the part of the participants. This emphasizes the role that morbidity plays in nonattendance of ADCCs; that is, nonusers perceive that due to their morbidity the ADCCs may not meet their needs. However, one should exercise caution in drawing conclusions using these interpretations because these issues were not examined in this study and, therefore, merit further investigation.</p>
<p>Users of ADCCs reported that ADCCs played a significant role in their lives in terms of improving their well-being, enabling them to maintain social relationships, and meeting their needs as well as relieving their family caregivers from the burden of carrying out caregiving tasks. Thus, such user reports suggest that ADCCs indeed meet the various needs of those who opt for using the services provided by them.</p>
<sec id="section23-0733464811432141">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Accessibility to ADCCs’ programs should be promoted and barriers should be addressed to enable frail older adults avail services provided by such programs, who are often isolated in their homes and spend several hours in daytime outdoor activities, especially in light of the growing number of frail older adults who prefer to age in place. Older persons who live alone need help in the morning to help them get ready to go to the ADCC. Those who need home help and cannot afford it should receive this service in addition to visits to ADCCs and not as an alternative. To meet the needs of current nonusers, ADCCs should shift from a social model orientation to a more balanced model that includes health care components to better meet the socialization needs as well as a variety of health problems faced by those who are more disabled and chronically ill. Health promotion activities such as health-monitoring activities and geriatric assessment and counseling, as well as prevention programs such as intake of vaccinations, can better meet the needs of those who prefer to stay at home due to personal problems, including those related to health. This is of paramount importance, given the fact that users of ADCCs derive many benefits from the services provided, which can promote their quality of life in tandem with alleviating caregiver burden.</p>
<p>However, more research is needed to better understand the needs of nonusers and which aspects of ADCCs operation and content should be reconsidered and reformed to be more responsive to various needs of disabled older persons. In addition, it is important to learn the perspective of family caregivers of nonusers about the reasons for nonuse and thus gain further insights into this issue, which has been insufficiently studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0733464811432141">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study; first, generalization of the findings is limited because the sample and the sampling procedure do not guarantee representativeness of both users and nonusers of ADCCs on a national level. This is because the sample was not randomly selected and included only ADCCs in the southern region of Israel. Second, interviews with day care users were conducted at the ADCCs. Although interviews were conducted in privacy, in order to maintain confidentiality, we cannot ignore the fact that, because interviews were conducted at the ADCC, to some extent the responses of the participants may have been positively biased, which is well reflected in the overwhelmingly positive statements they made with regard to the benefits they derived from the ADCCs. The other limitation is the nonrepresentativeness of all ADCCs of Israel, because they operate under social model only, in contrast to ADCCs in other countries that operate under various models. In addition, the questions used in this research are limited in scope. A qualitative design could bring more insights into reasons for nonuse that may not have been identified by researchers when designing the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the study adds to our knowledge in understanding the reasons for use and nonuse from the perspective of the older persons themselves and points to the need for further research in order to understand how ADCCs can be more effective in achieving their goals to promote quality of life of frail older people.</p>
