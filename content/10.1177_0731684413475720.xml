<p>New commercial aircraft programmes have increased the demand for polymer composite primary aircraft structures with a gradual move towards the use of liquid moulding resin transfer technology. This generally requires the use of a woven or stitched form of dry fabric rather than the more traditional methods of pre-impregnation of unidirectional tape. However, woven composites materials are susceptible to transverse impact loading which causes laminas to become delaminated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684413475720">1</xref></sup> Various methods have been developed to improve the impact tolerance including z-pinning, selective interlayers and hybrids, protective layers or resin toughening; one method that is becoming increasingly successful is to reinforce composites with a fibre that connects the layers together running from the upper to lower surface of the laminate. Mouritz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684413475720">2</xref></sup> stated that three-dimensionally (3D) woven composites have higher ballistic damage resistance and impact tolerance than 2D materials, higher tensile strain and strain-to-failure values and also higher interlaminar fracture toughness; this might be beneficial in the design of primary aircraft structures where the limiting design criteria is compression after impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684413475720">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684413475720">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, 3D woven textile reinforced composites allow the optimisation and tailoring of specific material properties into the final component that can provide a reduction in manufacturing cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684413475720">5</xref></sup> However, earlier research measuring the tensile strength and modulus in both the warp and weft direction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413475720">6</xref></sup> showed that where the binder travels through the thickness of the fabric a resin-rich area is created. This work will measure the strain (under tensile loading) at different levels from within this region i.e. a method of strain sensing will be used to measure the strain within the resin pockets created by the binder at different levels within the 3D composite structure. This will provide data to measure the effect of the hypothesised changes in fibre volume fraction caused by the binder. It will also provide data for direct correlation with subsequent works endeavouring to model this type of material. Extrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer (EFPI) sensors were embedded at two levels within a nine-layer 3D woven composite and comparative surface measurements were provided through resistive strain gauging and biaxial extensometry. A fibre optic sensing system was selected as it has been shown that they can be successfully embedded within the carbon fibre reinforced composite (CFRP) structure without causing degradation in the performance of the material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684413475720">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684413475720">8</xref></sup> They have been successfully employed in this strain sensing role within CFRP materials in several studies to measure fatigue strains,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684413475720">9</xref></sup> impact damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684413475720">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684413475720">11</xref></sup> delamination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684413475720">12</xref></sup> flexural strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684413475720">13</xref></sup> and tensile strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684413475720">14</xref></sup> Oliveira et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684413475720">15</xref></sup> outline that EFPI sensors offer a greater level of sensitivity to strain measurement when compared to other fibre optic strain sensing systems such as Bragg grating sensors. Leng<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413475720">16</xref></sup> and Liu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684413475720">17</xref></sup> both outline that EFPI strain sensors are insensitive to temperature change. Leng goes further to explain that this is because the coefficients of thermal expansion of the quartz capillary tube and the optical fibre, used in the construction of the EFPI sensor, are nearly identical, and therefore the sensor will not pick up thermally induced strains as both constituent materials will expand and contract at the same rate. Through correlation with micro-graphical analysis, a link between the variations in mechanical performance and localised variations in fibre volume fraction could be established. The 3D multi-layer reinforcements were manufactured on a textile loom with mechanical modifications to produce preforms with fibres orientated in the warp, weft and through-the-thickness (TTT) directions. Angle Interlock 3D woven composites have previously been shown to provide manufacturing advantages, yet also provide a structure where the advantages of low crimp tows bound together by a binder tow, result in a composite with high performance and reduced sensitivity to interlaminar shear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413475720">18</xref></sup> In this work, it will be shown that a variation in tensile strain of as much as 24% was found from internal measurement compared with the material surface. Through correlation with micro-graphical analysis, a link between the variations in mechanical performance and localised variations in fibre volume fraction could be established.</p>
<p>Also, this paper investigates the damage imparted to the 3D Angle Interlock woven fabric composite by drop weight impact testing using computed tomography (CT). Naik et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684413475720">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684413475720">20</xref></sup> have studied the behaviour of unidirectional and woven fabric laminates under low-velocity impact using a 3D transient finite element code. The in-plane failure behaviour of the composites has been evaluated by means of a failure function based on the Tsai–Hill quadratic failure criterion. They have observed that failure function is lower for woven fabric laminates than for unidirectional and for cross-ply laminates, indicating that woven fabric laminates are more resistant to impact damage. Kim and Sham<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684413475720">21</xref></sup> have discussed the potential advantages of using woven fabrics as opposed to cross-ply unidirectional prepreg tapes from the viewpoint of microstructures/property relationship. They have found that woven-fabric laminates in general exhibit a lower maximum load, a smaller damage area, higher mode II interlaminar fracture toughness and higher residual compression after impact strength than cross-ply laminates. Baucom and Zikry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684413475720">22</xref></sup> have studied the effects of reinforced geometry, including 2D plain-woven, 3D orthogonally woven monolith and biaxially reinforced warp-knit, on damage progression in woven composite panels under repeated drop-weight. The 3D composites had the greatest resistance to penetration and dissipated more total energy than the other systems. Bahei-El Din looked at the impact damage of 3D woven composites penetrated by hemispherical projectiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684413475720">23</xref></sup> and the quasi-static indentation and transverse impact behaviour of 3D orthogonal hybrid woven composite under flat-ended rod was studied by Lv.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684413475720">24</xref></sup> Besides the principle virtues of being non-destructive and of noninvasion, CT allows a large amount of the internal geometry to be determined with a single scan, enabling internal cross-sections to be visualised, and in turn be reconstructed into three-dimensional volumes. The CT technique affords numerous advantages over the conventional approach of parallel dissection followed by image analysis of polished surfaces, as it eliminates tedious sample preparation; CT appears aptly suited to analysis of textile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684413475720">25</xref></sup> and woven composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684413475720">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684413475720">27</xref></sup> due to their microstructures, which are fundamentally 3D. Besides analyzing internal structures and complex architectures, researchers use X-ray radiography and CT to better understand the behaviour and damage of composite materials undergoing fatigue, tensile or impact loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684413475720">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684413475720">29</xref></sup> The ability to detect and accurately measure features down to individual fibre breakages provides a valuable platform for future research.</p>

<p>3D multi-layer woven reinforcements were designed using the X-Sectional design system to provide a representation of the structure, detailing the relative positions of the yarns and also generating the lifting plan to operate a Jacquard-controlled loom. Fabrics were then manufactured on a conventional textile loom with mechanical modifications to allow the addition of z-binder yarns and limit fibre damage; reinforcements with fibres orientated in the warp, weft and TTT directions were produced. The loom used was a DATAWEAVE loom with Jacquard controller incorporating 1152 hooks. A specific weave architecture that consists of long continuous lengths of tows for maximum strength in the 0/90<sup>°</sup> directions and have angle interlock binding configurations in order to suppress delaminations was manufactured (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684413475720">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684413475720">2</xref>). Comparatively, this structure possesses very low levels of crimp in the warp stuffer and weft filler tows. The fabric has four layers of warp and five of weft, while maintaining a 1:1 warp to weft ratio, with the binder running in the warp direction. The details regarding the weave architecture of them has been reported previously by Buchanan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684413475720">16</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684413475720">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>A novel method of sensor integration was developed whereby thin-walled Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing, of dimension 1.02 mm outside diameter and 0.2 mm wall thickness, was woven into the fabric along with selected warp yarns. Once off the loom, the preform was cut into the required dimensions and placed within the processing tooling, the sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684413475720">Figure 2</xref>) were threaded through the PTFE tubing to their pre-determined location within the fabric. In this case the location chosen for interrogation was the resin rich pockets created by the binder (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413475720">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413475720">5</xref>). The distance from the selected binder, visible on the surface of the fabric, to the edge of the preform was measured. The sensor head was then threaded through the PTFE tubing for this distance. This ensured that the sensor head would be embedded in the resin pocket created by the binder. The sensor was then secured from movement with flash tape and the PTFE tubing was drawn out of the fabric leaving the sensor in the desired location. EFPI sensors were embedded between layers 1 and 2, and layers 3 and 4 of the 4 warp layer fabric. This arrangement was selected as these positions would be expected to have a significant difference in <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> and therefore tensile performance. The EFPI sensors were integrated in such a fashion to produce the final test coupons with one embedded EFPI sensor located along the central axis in the warp loading direction beside the targeted binder at the chosen depth/layer within the fabric. Fabrics with embedded EFPI sensors were infused with polymer and processed into composites via a modified VaRTM technique. The modified VaRTM tooling included a layered arrangement of two silicon rubber sealing gaskets to allow for the sensor optical fibres to pass through the tooling cavity wall without the reduction in vacuum integrity. Additional clamping bolts were utilised to ensure no loss of vacuum. To ensure sensor survival during the moulding process and handling post manufacture, the portions of optical fibre lead that exited the material were protected with a piece of thin-walled silicon rubber tubing of internal diameter 1 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm. The operation of an EFPI sensor is based on the multi-reflection Fabry-Perot interference between two reflected mirrors where ‘s’ is the cavity length (distance between two mirrors) and L is the gauge length. The basic sensing principle is that the cavity length ‘s’ changes with the application of mechanical strains. ‘s’ is measured from the modulation in the reflection spectrum by counting the number of fringes over a specified wavelength range.

<p>The EFPI strain sensing system used in this investigation was an “off the shelf” commercially available system sourced from Luna Innovations. The system was a FibrePro2 System which, when coupled with a MUX8 Channel Expansion Module, could monitor and record the response from 8 individual EFPI sensors, simultaneously. The particular sensors used for this investigation were supplied by Luna Innovations and had a 10-mm gauge length with a 1-m optical fibre lead and FC connectors rated up to 200℃. These sensors had a resolution of 1 µɛ or 1 nm and were supplied with a polyimide coating specifically engineered for use with epoxy matrix composites.</p>
<p>Fabrics were infused with the 2-part epoxy resin system of Araldite® LY-564 resin and Aradur® HY-2954 hardener, manufactured by Hunstman. This system is mixed to the ratio of 100 g of resin to 35 g of hardener as per the manufacturer’s instruction. Prior to processing the resin was degassed for 1 h at 30℃ after mixing to the two constituents. Once the tooling temperature has equilibrated at 75℃, resin was injected into the tool cavity until the fabric has been completely infused. The tooling temperature was then ramped to 100℃ and held isothermal for 1 h. The composite was then de-moulded and post-cured at 145℃ for 4 h to achieve a <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of 140℃. Fibre volume fraction (<italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub>) was measured/calculated via the density buoyancy method. The processed 3D woven carbon fibre reinforced plastic (3DWCFRP) for this investigation had a <italic>V</italic><sub>f</sub> 58.67% ± 1.3%, which is comparable to similar materials produced through works by Archer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413475720">6</xref></sup> and Buchanan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413475720">18</xref></sup> Test coupons were cut from the moulded composite plates via high pressure water jet cutting on an OMAX 2626 Jet Machining Centre. Tensile tests were carried out in accordance with BS EN ISO 527-4:1997 on a Zwick Z100 Universal testing machine. To allow for adequate correlation and reliability in fibre optic strain measurement, test coupons with an embedded EFPI sensor were further instrumented with a restive strain gauge bonded to their surface adjacent to the location of the EFPI sensor. The restive strain gauges were sourced from Vishay Precision Group and were of model range 500  UW and had a gauge length of 12.7 mm, grid resistance of 350 Ω and a gauge factor of 1.2. This model of gauge was selected for its similar gauge length to that of the EFPI fibre optic gauge and also its compatibility to mounting to the epoxy matrix surface. Further strain measurement was taken through a biaxial extensometer directly linked to the Zwick Z100 Universal testing machine. Due to the industrial interest of this project it was necessary to examine whether this species of optical fibre is actually suitable for use in composite materials. Initially it was necessary to analyse whether there is any change in mechanical performance as a result of having an optical fibre embedded within the composite structure; a simple comparison of the tensile, flexural and ILSS of coupons with an optical fibre embedded in the mid-plane and coupons without was carried out. In each test conducted there was no consistent trend in the change in the respective performances and in each case the percentage difference when compared to the control material was within the coefficient of variation for each test group. Further samples were tested up to a maximum load of 3 kN with simultaneous strain measurement taken from the embedded EFPI sensor, resistive strain gauge and the biaxial extensometer. Force was recorded through the load cell of the testing machine. The load was converted to stress by dividing by sample cross-sectional area and this was plotted against recorded strain from the above strain measurement techniques. Samples tested were all taken from one preform/composite plate of which one half contained EFPI sensors embedded between warp layers 1 and 2 and the other half containing EFPI sensors embedded between warp layers 3 and 4. The preform/composite was woven/produced in such a way that each coupon would have 1 EFPI sensor embedded along the central axis, running in the warp direction of the weave pattern but located either between layers 1 and 2 or between layers 3 and 4.</p>
<p>Further specimens of the same material were impacted according to ASTM D7136/D163M -05 using an Instron 9200 Series drop weight impact tester. Low velocity impact loads were imparted on the composite specimens using an instrumented drop-weight impact testing machine to evaluate their damage resistance for aircraft structures subject to hail and bird strike during flight and dropped tools during maintenance. This machine allows the variation of impact energy by changing the height and mass of the dropping weight. Specimen of size 100 mm × 150 mm was held in a fixture. The impactor end is fitted with hemispherical instrumented tup (diameter 12.7 mm) that records the transient response of the plate. The machine is fitted with a detector that measures the velocity of the tup along with triggering the data acquisition just before the tup strikes the specimen. The falling weight is guided through two guide columns. A rebound brake is activated to prevent multiple impacts on the specimen. Data acquisition hardware calculates the velocity and energy. Specimens were subjected to four energy levels at 10, 20, 30 and 40 J by keeping the mass constant (13.91 kg) and varying the drop height. CT was then used to observe damage imparted on the impacted specimens. The X-ray images at different angular views were used to calculate a 3D volumetric model of the object. The volume data was then analysed to find the position and size of defects and cracks after impact. The CT scan was conducted using a Phoenix v|tome|x s from GE equipped with a Perkin Elmer flat panel (512 × 512 px, 400 µm pix size). The X-ray tube was operated at 150 kV and 230 µA. The Voxel resolution was 41 µm.</p>

<p>When comparing the loom state fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684413475720">Figure 3</xref>) to the VaRTM manufactured composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684413475720">Figure 4</xref>) for the Angle interlock fabric, the main difference appears to be the change in tow cross-sectional shape in both the warp and weft direction. In general, the warp and weft stuffers remain straight although the weft filler exhibited more crimp in the composite than the warp stuffer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684413475720">Figure 5(a)</xref> shows the 4 warp layers and changing resin-rich regions caused by the binder displacing warp yarns in an angle-interlock composite.

<p>Presented below, Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413475720">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413475720">7</xref>, are stress/strain responses measured by the respective techniques during the tensile testing of a coupon in which the EFPI sensor was embedded in the resin channel between layers 1 and 2 and also a coupon where the EFPI sensor was embedded in the resin channel between layers 3 and 4. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684413475720">Figure 6</xref> illustrates that the strain measurement from between layers 1 and 2 is in close agreement with the strain measurements taken on the surface of the material by the conventional techniques. Conversely, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684413475720">Figure 7</xref> shows the strain measurement taken by an EFPI sensor embedded between layers 3 and 4 to be significantly lower for a given stress applied to test coupon. Once again the conventional surface measurements are in close agreement. Two observations noted here are that the EFPI sensors have returned a measurement of similar accuracy to that of the resistive strain gauges and the biaxial extensometer and also that the signal noise picked up the extensometer measurement due to the small strains being experienced/measured due to the high stiffness of this composite. As shown, the surface measurements of tensile strain are in close agreement with the EFPI measurement taken from between layer 1 and 2, but there is a significant decrease in tensile strain between layers 3 and 4. This is highlighted by the tensile strain measured between layer 1 and 2 being 1.9% larger than the surface measured strains and then additionally the strain measured between layers 3 and 4 is 24% smaller than that at the surface for a given stress applied to test coupon. The surface strain measurements being in close agreement with those presented by Archer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684413475720">6</xref></sup> and Buchanan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684413475720">18</xref></sup> for a similar material. The measurement of varying tensile strain at differing positions within the 3DWCFRP structure demonstrates the anisotropic mechanical nature of the material. Bogdanovich<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684413475720">30</xref></sup> presented data in which internal flexural modulus measurements taken by an embedded EFPI sensor within a 3DWCFRPC were higher than that measured by surface-mounted strain gauges. It was hypothesized in his work that this was due to the EFPI sensor being embedded within a region of higher fibre volume fraction. The research concluded that the value obtained from an embedded EFPI sensor does not represent the ‘effective’ value for the tested 3D composite, but rather represents elastic modulus of a unidirectional warp fibre ‘monocomposite’, which surrounds the sensor. Therefore, the sensor is strained only as much as the surrounding material. They finished by affirming that this was the type of strain measurement anticipated and further proving the possibility to measure strain on a unit cell level. This current investigation has gone further in showing that not only can there be a difference between strain induced on the surface and the strain induced internally within the 3DWCFRPC but there can also be differences in the strain measured at varying locations within a 3DWCFRPC. To explain the strain distribution recorded by this investigation and to investigate any relationship with changes in fibre volume fraction, it was necessary to dissect a sample of the tested coupons and examine the structure of the tested materials through micro-graphical analysis. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413475720">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413475720">9</xref> are a result of this analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684413475720">Figure 8</xref> shows that the EFPI sensor between layers 1 and 2 is embedded within the resin channel at this level and is in an area of localised low fibre volume fraction. Whereas, conversely, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0731684413475720">Figure 9</xref> shows that the EFPI sensor between layers 3 and 4 has been embedded in the resin channel but it is surrounded by both its adjacent warp tow and the binder and is therefore in an area of localised high fibre volume fraction. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0731684413475720">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0731684413475720">11</xref> are micrographs, illustrating the levels at which the EFPI sensors have been embedded within the composite. This links the changing tensile strain to visible variations in fibre volume fraction as the regions in which lower values of tensile strain were measured, between layers 3 and 4, are the regions in which it can be seen to have an increase in fibre volume fraction.

<p>The goal of this investigation was to accurately control the placement of a sensory system that could investigate the anisotropic nature of a 3DWCFRPC. This was achieved and it was possible to attribute changes in tensile strain with changes in fibre volume fraction at different positions within the composite structure showing agreement with original hypotheses that “resin-rich regions” or resin channels are regions of high strain.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684413475720">Table 3</xref> gives the results of dynamic response of the laminates for the four energies tested in this study. In this table are given maximum load and the total energy absorbed in the form of elastic deformation and creation of new surfaces like matrix cracking and delamination. The energy curve for drop-weight impact tests are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0731684413475720">Figure 12</xref>. Depending on the level of energy, drop-weight impact tests usually result in three distinct interaction modes between the composite panel and the impactor. If the energy absorbed by the composite is very little, the impactor bounces back, which is represented by the dip in the Energy time curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731684413475720">31</xref></sup>; this occurs after approximately 4 ms on the 10 J curve and 6 ms on the 20 J curve. If most of the energy of impactor is absorbed by the composite through various modes of damage, no rebound occurs. Finally, in the case of high energy level, perforation can be observed. Rebounding occurred for the 10 and 20 J specimens, but in the case of the higher energies the impactor penetrated the composite and no rebound occurred.

<p>Analysis of the CT micrographs in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0731684413475720">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0731684413475720">20</xref> was used to gain an understanding of internal damage. Also, visual inspection of the physical damage in the material showed increasing damage as the impact energy increased. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684413475720">Figure 13</xref> shows the relationship between deflection, or dent depth, and impact energy. Each energy curve has ascending and descending sections. The slope of the ascending section can be used to determine the impact bending stiffness. This slope is the same for all energies tested. In this graph the curves denoting 10 J and 20 J return towards the origin of the diagram after descending from the peak force, indicating the rebounding of the impactor from the specimen surface after impact. The 20 J specimen did exhibit less rebound than the 10 J specimen, which is indicative of greater damage being sustained by the composite. The area enveloped by the closed curve is the absorbed energy of the composite laminate under the impact. With both 30 J and 40 J, there is no rebounding section. Their forces reach a relatively constant value due to the friction between the impactor and the composite specimens after the occurrence of perforation. The absorbed energy of a perforated composite specimen can be calculated from the area bounded by the associated load–deflection curve and the horizontal axis. After the perforation, as the impact energy continues to increase, the absorbed energy of composite does not increase accordingly. The excessive impact energy is retained in the impactor for post-perforation motion. At higher loads the specimens experience delamination failure due to the combined effect of bending and interlaminar stresses. There are multiple delaminations distributed through the thickness of the specimen, which are indicated by the various drops in the load. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0731684413475720">Figure 13</xref> we can determine that the perforation threshold is between 20 J and 30 J for this material thickness.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0731684413475720">Figure 14</xref> gives the load versus time plots for the four energy values tested. As the impact energy increases, there is increase in the peak load, energy to maximum load, slope of the load-time curve and the total energy. However, the time to peak load and total duration of impact reduces with the increase in the impact energy. Each curve increases (during loading) with time, reaches a maximum value and then decreases (during unloading), and finally remains horizontal, i.e. reaches a constant value. This constant value gives the total energy absorbed permanently by composite specimens at the end of an impact event.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0731684413475720">Figure 15</xref> shows a 3D CT slice taken through the centre of the impact region. It depicts the extent of the impact damage caused by 10 J impact energy. On initial visual inspection the damage looked minor. On further inspection of the CT scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684413475720">Figure 16</xref>) however, it is clear that quite a large amount of internal damage has occurred, especially around the resin-rich areas caused by the warp direction binders. However, the area of the damage is quite limited to several mm from the impact centre. The CT scan shows that there is some delamination on the non-impact face but the visible damage on the impact face is small. Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684413475720">17</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684413475720">18</xref> show a series of slices taken every 2.5 mm in the warp and weft direction on either side of the point of the 20 J impact. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684413475720">Figure 17</xref> shows slices in the warp direction where it can be seen that approximately 12 mm from the centre of impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684413475720">Figure 17(a)</xref>) in the weft direction there is little internal delamination damage, but a disbonding of the first layer of material can be seen splitting away on the non-impact side of the laminate. As the slice is taken closer to the centre of the impact, some delaminations can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684413475720">Figure 17(d)</xref>). At the midpoint of the impact almost half of the plies exhibit fibre breakage at the lower side of the composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0731684413475720">Figure 17(f)</xref>). This is in agreement with the load versus displacement plots which determined that 20 J was close to the perforation threshold of this composite. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684413475720">Figure 18</xref> shows the slices in the weft direction with slices taken every 2.5 mm. It was found that damage did not spread as far from the point of impact in this direction. As the outer plies are running in the weft direction, it is not possible for weft yarn to split from the surface as was observed with the weft yarns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0731684413475720">Figure 16</xref>; this is because the warps are below the outer layers of weft. However, a split across several wefts on the impact side which runs through the first layer of warp yarns before causing a delamination is observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684413475720">Figure 18(a)</xref>). At approximately 10 mm from the centre of impact no damage is observed on the non-impact face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684413475720">Figure 18(b)</xref>). Towards the centre of the impact however, delamination, ply splitting and fragmentation of the tows can be seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0731684413475720">Figure 18(e)</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0731684413475720">Figure 19</xref> shows the 3D CT image of the 20 J impact showing the extent of internal damage. When a visual inspection of the 20 J energy sample was conducted it was clear that this surface damage is quite difficult to see. For the 30 J specimen, the damage was much more evident and the surface damage on the non-impact side appeared to extend 55 mm across the weft direction. An even greater level of penetration can be seen for the 40 J specimen; the total extent of the perforation can be determined by CT as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0731684413475720">Figure 20</xref>, which shows that although penetration has occurred and the weft direction surface stuffers have delaminated, the surrounding structure appears to have little crack internal propagation. In these samples, the weft stuffers were on the outer layers of the composite. It appears that the binder has stopped further splitting/ delamination. The binder has not ruptured and this impedes the spread of delaminations and surface ply splitting from the non-impact site; the amount of spread of delamination damage is therefore reduced.

<p>Also, impact damage was observed using CT. It was found that damage will tend to spread further in the weft direction than the warp direction for these fabrics which possess weft direction yarns in the outer layers. It was observed that the through thickness binder is useful as it will arrest the splitting of surface plies from the laminate. The perforation threshold was determined to be between 20 J and 30 J for this material thickness.</p>
