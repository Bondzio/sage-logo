<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The primary goals of cholesteatoma surgery are disease eradication and achievement of a dry, trouble-free ear. Additional goals include a maintenance-free ear and hearing preservation or restoration. Controversy continues to exist over several aspects regarding treatment options for cholesteatoma. These include (1) surgical approach (intact canal wall [ICW] vs canal wall down [CWD] mastoidectomy), (2) the need for staging, and (3) risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>Recently, new techniques for reversible canal wall down mastoidectomy have been advocated to aid in disease removal during surgery for cholesteatoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813489521"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813489521">3</xref></sup> Proponents of this technique suggest that it provides improved control of recurrent cholesteatoma compared with ICW techniques. However, these techniques require technically complex reconstruction of the posterior external auditory canal wall, adding time and difficulty to the surgery.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to review long-term outcomes of traditional intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for treatment of cholesteatoma and to identify factors that improve outcomes. Specific outcome measures include rates of residual and recurrent disease, the subsequent need for CWD mastoidectomy, subsites involved in the original procedure, and the effect of ongoing eustachian tube dysfunction on outcome measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599813489521" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients who underwent ICW mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty at this institution between 1998 and 2006, which totaled 382. These records were then reviewed to include only those procedures that were performed by the senior author (CS) for cholesteatoma. As this study sought to examine long-term outcomes, any patient with follow-up of less than 2 years was excluded.</p>
<p>Both congenital and acquired cholesteatomas were included. The following data were collected: age, side of procedure, sites of involvement, ossicles present at the conclusion of the case, presence of scutal erosion and reconstruction, whether it was staged, presence and location of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma, subsequent canal wall-down mastoidectomy, presence of postoperative Eustachian tube dysfunction, and length of follow-up. Residual disease was defined as disease present behind an intact tympanic membrane at the second stage procedure. Recurrence is defined as reformation of a cholesteatoma from retraction of the tympanic membrane. Postoperative Eustachian tube dysfunction was determined by the presence of chronic serous otitis media on myringotomy. University of Utah Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this study. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software (version 21.0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813489521" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Three hundred eighty-two patients met initial screening criteria. Fifty-four patients were excluded because the surgery was performed by another surgeon (31) or the ICW mastoidectomy was done for a purpose other than to eradicate cholesteatoma (23). The rationale for including only those procedures performed by the senior author was because of the large variability seen in other surgeons’ techniques, including large variations in technique, staging, and reconstruction. Another 180 patients were excluded because of insufficient follow-up. A total of 148 patients, therefore, met criteria for this study. Eight patients had bilateral procedures, making the total number of operated ears 156. There were 96 male patients and 52 female patients. The average patient age at the initial surgery was 27 (range, 3-77). There were 73 right-sided affected ears and 83 left-sided affected ears. Forty-one cases (26%) were revisions of previous operations performed at outside institutions. The median follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 2.1-14.8).</p>
<p>The following sites were involved by the original cholesteatoma: middle ear 152 (98.1%), epitympanum 130 (83.3%), mastoid 47 (30.1%), sinus tympani 41 (26.3%), Eustachian tube 16 (10.3%), and multiple sites 138 (88.5%).</p>
<p>At the end of the case, the following ossicles were present: malleus + incus + stapes 6 (3.8%), malleus handle + stapes 42 (26.9%), malleus handle + mobile footplate 22 (14.1%), stapes 40 (25.6%), mobile footplate only 44 (28.2%), no mobile ossicular tissue 2 (1.3%).</p>
<p>The majority of the operations (144/156, 92%) were staged, typically 1 year after the original surgery. Of those that were staged, 51 of 144 (35%) had residual cholesteatoma at the second stage. Four ears required more than the typical two-stage procedure for complete disease eradication, and 1 of these patients eventually required a CWD procedure. The most common location of residual disease was in the middle ear (36/51, 71%), followed by the epitympanum (21/51, 41%) and the mastoid (12/51, 24%). Of the middle ear residual disease, the most common subsites identified were the oval window/stapes (13/31, 42%) and sinus tympani (9/31, 29%). Many cases (13/31, 42%) of middle ear recurrence did not have a subsite identified.</p>
<p>Thirteen patients (8%) had recurrence of their cholesteatoma. Of those patients, 6 required a subsequent CWD mastoidectomy. The remainder were able to have a revision ICW procedure for disease control. The median time to recurrence (using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) was 8.2 years (95% CI, 5.1-11.2). Most cases of recurrence (8/13) involved the epitympanum and scutal area. The remaining cases either involved a posterior canal wall defect into the mastoid (3/13) or the mesotympanum (2/13). Almost all of these recurrences (11/13) had documented postoperative Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) in previous clinic notes as indicated by retractions and/or need for tympanostomy tubes. By contrast, only 34 of 143 (24%) of the ears that did not recur had postoperative ETD (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Forty-one ears were revision operations (referred from outside institutions). Of those, 3 (7.3%) had recurrence after their procedure here. In comparison, 115 ears had their first surgery here, of which 10 (8.7%) had later recurrence (<italic>P</italic> = .78).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goals of cholesteatoma surgery are to fully eradicate disease, provide the patient with a safe and dry ear, prevent recurrence, and restore hearing to the extent possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813489521">4</xref></sup> There is ongoing debate in the literature regarding the optimal surgical approach to accomplish these goals. In the CWD technique, the posterior canal wall is removed in order for the surgeon to fully remove the cholesteatoma. With the ICW technique, the posterior canal wall is preserved while the facial recess is drilled out to provide access and visualization into the middle ear. In the third and more recent technique, often called the reconstructed canal wall mastoidectomy (RCW), the posterior canal wall is temporarily removed to improve visualization, then replaced, and the mastoidectomy defect is obliterated. There are certainly advantages and disadvantages of each of these methods, and there are strong advocates among experts for all approaches. Historically, the debate was between ICW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813489521">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813489521">6</xref></sup> and CWD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813489521">8</xref></sup> mastoidectomies. More recently, RCW techniques have been advocated as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref></sup> Here we review these methods in more detail and then add our experience with the traditional ICW approach.</p>
<p>The CWD procedure has the advantage of excellent visualization for disease removal without the visual obstruction of the posterior canal wall. This may lead to lower rates of recidivism. In 1 review of CWD procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref></sup> it was suggested that the low recurrence rate was in part due to the reduction in the middle ear volume and exclusion of the mastoid cavity, which limited the possibility of retraction pocket formation. Rates of recidivism with CWD surgery vary widely and range from 2% to 18%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813489521">9</xref></sup> This low recidivism rate can be long term. In 1 study, the disease-free rate in CWD ears was 91.6% compared to 44.4% in ICW.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813489521">10</xref></sup> This study also showed that the CWD ears had a better long-term disease free rate than ICW ears, even in revision surgeries.</p>
<p>A purported advantage of the CWD procedure is that disease removal and ossicular chain reconstruction can be accomplished in 1 procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813489521">11</xref></sup> The CWD procedure may be advantageous for patients with questionable follow-up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813489521">12</xref></sup> and may represent less of a financial burden on the patient and overall medical system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We approach all patients initially with the intent to perform an ICW mastoidectomy. In some cases, intraoperative findings will dictate conversion to a canal wall down mastoidectomy. These factors can include a small contracted mastoid, with a low tegmen and a forward sigmoid sinus. The resultant cavity in these cases will typically be small and easy to manage. Also, patients with large defects in the scutum may be better managed with a canal wall down procedure. Failure of scutal reconstruction can lead to recurrent cholesteatoma. In addition, some instances of lateral semicircular canal fistula are best treated with exteriorization of the disease by creating a canal wall down cavity and leaving the matrix intact over the fistula.</p>
<p>Nearly all procedures were staged to allow for the formation of a healthy middle ear space. Thick Silastic sheeting is used to line the middle ear space and into the antrum and facial recess. This prevents adhesion formation and results in an aerated middle ear space in the majority of cases (142/150, 95%). It is our experience, along with that of others, that achievement of an aerated middle ear space is necessary for successful hearing reconstruction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813489521">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813489521">14</xref></sup> whether using the CWD or ICW approach. Thus, we believe in staging the majority of cases, regardless of mastoidectomy technique.</p>
<p>The other reason for staging is to remove residual cholesteatoma pearls before they become problematic. We found residual cholesteatoma pearls in 35% of second-stage procedures, with the middle ear being the most common site, indicating that the “second look” procedure is an important part of the ICW mastoidectomy approach for complete disease eradication. This relatively high rate of residual disease in the middle ear also supports the notion that a canal wall down procedure does not eliminate the need for a second look procedure. In the vast majority of the staged cases (47/51, 92%), the residual disease was easily removed, and the hearing reconstruction proceeded as planned. The remaining 4 cases required at least 1 more stage to assure complete disease eradication and middle ear space aeration.</p>
<p>A major disadvantage of the CWD procedure is the increased maintenance often required with a mastoid bowl. These problems include prolonged healing, chronic otorrhea, difficulty in fitting a hearing aid, cerumen and keratin build-up, which may lead to bacterial and fungal infections, water intolerance, cosmetic concerns, and violent caloric-induced vertigo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813489521">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813489521">16</xref></sup> CWD postoperative care typically requires a long-term outpatient commitment from the surgeon and the patient. In 1 study, CWD patients required an average of 13.3 outpatient visits following surgery, with most of them occurring in the first 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813489521">17</xref></sup> Another study showed that CWD surgeries were 1.6 times more likely than ICW to have a complication and almost twice as likely as ICW to have more than 1 complication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813489521">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The ICW approach has the advantage of more rapid and complete healing than CWD ears, and they are less prone to infection after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813489521">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813489521">18</xref></sup> The external auditory canal maintains its natural contour, allowing a normal skin migration and self-cleaning mechanism. The most frequently cited advantage of ICW surgery is improved hearing outcomes compared to CWD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813489521">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813489521">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813489521">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>A frequently quoted disadvantage of ICW surgery is a higher recidivism rate than CWD. Rates in the literature vary widely and range from 11% to 34%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813489521">9</xref></sup> Recidivism combines residual disease and recurrent disease. The higher residual disease rate in ICW surgery is thought to be due to the presence of the intact posterior canal wall obstructing the view of the surgeon and preventing complete removal of disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813489521">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813489521">19</xref></sup> However, as mentioned previously, 71% of our cases of residual disease were found in the middle ear, the visualization of which would not be significantly improved by removing the canal wall.</p>
<p>The other cause of recidivism is recurrence of cholesteatoma, and higher rates in ICW surgery are often published in the literature. The higher recurrence rate seen in ICW cases is thought to be due to the increased tendency to form retraction pockets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813489521">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813489521">20</xref></sup> We routinely perform reconstruction of the scutum with bone paté when there has been erosion with the intent to prevent recurrence in this area. In our series, 13 patients (8%) had recurrence of the cholesteatoma, and 8 of these recurred in the scutal area. We believe that attention in reconstructing this area leads to this low recurrence rate.</p>
<p>The median time to recurrence in our series was 8.2 years (95% CI, 5.1-11.2). This delay in recurrence supports the notion that these patients should be followed for years to detect recurrence in its early stages. Routine follow-up also allows the physician to detect signs of Eustachian tube dysfunction and treat it to potentially prevent recurrence.</p>
<p>Only 6 patients in our series required a subsequent CWD mastoidectomy for disease control. The overwhelming majority (150/156, 96%) avoided the CWD procedure and its accompanying impact on the patient’s quality of life. Even revision cases for recurrent cholesteatoma were most often managed with ICW mastoidectomy. Revision cases did not show increased recurrence rates compared to primary cases.</p>
<p>Canal wall reconstruction (CWR) with mastoid obliteration is a newer technique that combines some features of ICW and CWD mastoidectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813489521"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813489521">3</xref></sup> It involves removing the posterior canal wall for improved visualization followed by replacement and then mastoid obliteration. The epitympanum is obliterated with fascia, bone chips, and/or bone paté to lessen the likelihood of retraction into the epitympanic space. Proposed advantages include improved intraoperative exposure (because the posterior canal wall does not impede visualiation) and reduced recurrence rates (because of obliteration of the epitympanum) while preserving the natural shape of the ear canal in the reconstructed canal. Disadvantages include increased complexity and operative time and a higher wound infection rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref></sup> Our recurrence rate (8%) compares favorably to published rates for CWR techniques (2%-12%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813489521">2</xref></sup> though long-term results for the CWR approach are lacking. Residual rates appear to be lower with CWR (10%-21%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813489521">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813489521">19</xref></sup> though the need for a planned second stage remains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813489521">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813489521">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813489521">19</xref></sup> Importantly, the tympanic membrane can still retract into the middle ear space and obliterate it.</p>
<p>Our review does have some limitations. It is retrospective and does not control for factors that could affect outcomes. A direct comparison of techniques using retrospective reviews is difficult, as those uncontrolled factors may affect the decision of which technique to use. Also, as our goal was to evaluate long-term outcomes, we specifically excluded patients who had less than 2 years of follow-up. Many of these excluded patients came from great distances and so were unable to maintain long-term follow-up. This could potentially have an impact on the outcomes, as we do not know the recidivism rate in these patients. Nevertheless, based on the available data, it appears that the ICW technique produces excellent outcomes, compared to other techniques.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty continues to be an excellent treatment for cholesteatoma. Staging the operation in diseased ears is beneficial to assure removal of residual disease and establish a healthy middle ear space prior to hearing reconstruction. Our long-term results indicate that excellent disease control and functional results can be achieved for the vast majority of patients treated with this approach.</p>
