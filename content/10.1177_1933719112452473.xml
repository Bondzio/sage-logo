<abstract>
<p>A gradient of immunological mediators exists in the fetal membranes from the periplacental zone (PZ) to the rupture zone (RZ) at term delivery (rupture of fetal membranes [ROM]). However, it is unknown if this gradient is different in premature rupture of these tissues (premature rupture of fetal membranes [PROM]). We therefore analyzed leukocyte chemotactic activity and chemokine/cytokine production in fetal membrane zones in ROM and PROM. In ROM, leukocyte chemotactic activity increased from the PZ to the RZ; however, this did not occur in PROM. This was due to consistently elevated leukocyte chemotactic activity in PROM compared to ROM tissues. In the RZ, ROM was characterized by increased T-cell attraction and high levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL-8)/interleukin 8, and PROM by increased granulocyte attraction and high levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and CXCL-10/interferon gamma-induced protein 10. We conclude that normal and premature rupture of fetal membranes differ in regional chemotactic activity and related chemokine/cytokine production, which may represent evidence for differential mechanisms of rupture at term delivery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Normal labor begins at term in the presence of intact fetal membranes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112452473">1</xref>
</sup> If there is no intervention, the fetal membranes remain intact until their spontaneous rupture near the end of the first stage of labor; this is termed spontaneous rupture of fetal membranes (ROM). The physiological mechanisms that normally lead to ROM prior to birth have been documented; however, the sequence of events that start and trigger ROM is currently unknown. Convention suggests ROM is precipitated by the stress of uterine contractions during labor; however, this fails to explain the 10% of term deliveries and 40% of preterm deliveries in which rupture is the initial clinically discernable event preceding any uterine contractions; this is termed premature rupture of fetal membranes (PROM).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112452473">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112452473">3</xref>
</sup> Premature rupture of fetal membranes is a clinical complication which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation (preterm PROM) and is responsible for preterm births. Preterm birth currently accounts for most cases of neonatal morbidity and mortality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112452473">4</xref>

</sup> To decrease preterm birth incidence, we have to understand the signal transduction pathways that are activated in PROM, as well as normal ROM.</p>
<p>Several studies have indicated that the fetal membranes undergo a genetically programmed, biochemically mediated, maturation process near term which is characterized by collagen remodeling and apoptosis.<sup>

</sup> Certain changes are limited to the region of the fetal membranes overlying the cervix referred to as the rupture zone (RZ).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112452473">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112452473">13</xref>
</sup> It has been demonstrated that the RZ is a physically weak area overlying the cervical opening of the uterus that is characterized by expression of specific markers, suggesting that these regional characteristics develop prior to the onset of the contractions of labor and persist until delivery, when the rupture process occurs in this zone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112452473">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112452473">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112452473">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We and others have described parturition as an immunological response that is characterized by the secretion of chemotactic signals to attract infiltrating leukocytes into reproductive tissues.<sup>

</sup> It may be likely that both biochemical and immunological concepts coexist in what is observed during normal ROM.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that during labor the fetal membranes exhibit selective leukocyte chemotactic activity by secretion of specific chemokines, and that a gradient of immunological cells and mediators exists in the fetal membranes from the periplacental zone (PZ) to the rupture site during ROM.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452473">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112452473">23</xref>
</sup> However, it is unknown whether this gradient is created at PROM. We hypothesized that the leukocyte chemotactic activity and chemokine/cytokine production varies between fetal membrane zones and is different in ROM compared to PROM at term delivery.</p>

<title>Participants and Tissue Collection</title>
<p>This study was approved by the institutional review board of the Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia Isidro Espinosa de los Reyes in Mexico city (Register 212250-02181). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to inclusion in the study. Participants were excluded from the study if there was microbiological or clinical evidence of cervicovaginal or intrauterine infection (as described below). Women included in this study were similar in ethnicity (Mexican Mestizo) and parity (primiparous). No participants in this study were administered antibiotics for prolonged rupture of fetal membranes, oxytocin augmentation, or immune-modulating medications.</p>
<p>We collected fetal membranes at term pregnancy (39 ± 1 weeks) from 2 groups of women, ROM and PROM. PROM were patients whose membranes had ruptured spontaneously with loss of amniotic fluid at least 2 hours before the onset of labor (n = 5) and ROM those who had ruptured during labor (n = 6). Labor was defined as cervical dilatation ≥4 cm, contractility of the myometrium ≥3, with contractions of 40 seconds within a 10-minute period. The duration of labor was similar (8-15 hours) between groups. The time elapsed between rupture and delivery for ROM was 2 to 4 hours and for PROM was 9 to 12 hours. To delimit RZ in ROM, we had the help of an obstetrician gynecologist, who used a vaginal mirror to observe the cervical characteristics. If cervical dilatation was present, the obstetrician stained the membranes appearing in the middle of the cervical os with a gauze ball soaked in Gentian violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA). This staining served as a landmark for the true rupture and was confirmed by examination of the fetal membranes after delivery. Samples were excluded if the site marked with Gentian violet did not correspond to the rupture site, suggesting that rupture did not occur spontaneously during labor. Rather, the deliveries were resolved via cesarean section or they underwent manual amniorrhexis. As PROM occurs before labor, the location of the RZ was unknown; we therefore collected fetal membranes with a single rupture site. Fetal membranes in PROM with 2 or more rupture sites most likely underwent manual amniorrhexis and they were discarded.</p>
<p>Immediately after delivery, ROM and PROM tissues (placenta and fetal membranes) were placed into a sterile container and transported to the laboratory. Tissues were received in the afternoon (4-7 <sc>pm</sc>) and they were processed within 30 minutes of delivery. In the laboratory, we carefully separated the fetal membranes from the placenta and washed them with sterile saline solution in sterile conditions (laminar flow hood). Microbiological tests were performed on these tissues and swabs were cultured for 24 hours onto blood agar plates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The absence of bacterial growth was considered as negative for infection. In addition, we performed histological analysis on these tissues. Histological sections from fetal membranes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by 2 microbiologists independently (N.G.-L. and S.H.-S.). All the membranes included in this study were scored as no chorioamnionitis using Redline maternal grading.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>To delimitate the fetal membrane zones, we used 2 long strips of the fetal membranes extending from the RZ to the placental edge and a specimen of the placental chorionic plate for our studies. Each fetal membrane zone was identified according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112452473">Figure 1</xref>. Multiple explants of 1 cm<sup>2</sup> tissue were obtained from each fetal membrane zone: the RZ was labeled with Gentian violet; the middle zone (MZ), halfway between the RZ and the placental edge at least 10 to 12 cm from the RZ; and from the PZ, comprising the 1 to 2 cm of thickened fetal membranes next to the edge of the placenta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112452473">26</xref></sup>

<p>The entire fetal membranes were used and the total number of explants varied between patients (15-30) and depended on the length of the RZ and the distance between the zone and placental edge. Explants were washed carefully and immediately placed in sterile saline solution to eliminate visible blood clots, maintaining the integrity of the membranes. Fetal membranes did not exhibit abnormalities or separation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719112452473">
<title>Fetal Membrane Extracts</title>
<p>Explants from each zone were incubated in 1 mL of DMEM, 1% MEM sodium pyruvate, and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (100 U penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, 0.25 μg amphotericin B/Ml) overnight at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452473">22</xref>
</sup> Fetal calf serum-free conditions were used in all experiments. Next day, all explants were homogenized in their culture media using a Polytron (Brinkmann, NY, USA) and pooled. These were centrifuged at 14 000<italic>g</italic>, filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Corning, PA, USA), and preserved at −70°C until use. We homogenized the tissue in the conditioned medium because the chemokines have high affinity for extracellular matrix. We previously demonstrated that this homogenate has higher chemotactic activity compared to tissue or media alone (unpublished data).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719112452473">
<title>Leukocytes</title>
<p>Peripheral blood samples treated with heparin were collected from laboring women (n = 3). Total leukocytes (mononuclear and polymorphonuclear) were isolated over a Ficoll gradient (Polymorphprep, Axis-Shield, Norway), and they were washed and resuspended in the same fetal calf serum-free media as described for the extracts. Number and viability (90%-95%) of leukocytes were assessed by the trypan blue exclusion assay. Culture reagents were purchased from GIBCO Invitrogen Corporation (NY, USA).</p>

<title>Chemotactic Activity Assay</title>
<p>Chemotactic activity assays were performed using a validated Boyden chamber assay (BY312; Neuro Probe, MD, USA).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112452473">27</xref>
</sup> The lower compartment of the chamber was filled with 1.7 mL of chemotactic (either medium as control or extract from each zone), and the upper compartment with 500 µL of a heterologous leukocyte suspension (500 000 leukocytes). A polycarbonate membrane (5 μm pore size, TMTP01300; Millipore Corporation, MA, USA) was placed between compartments. Chambers were incubated for 90 minutes at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Afterward, the extracts were removed from the lower compartment and centrifuged at 500<italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes at room temperature. This pellet contained attracted leukocytes that were counted by flow cytometry (FC 500; Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) for 300 seconds. Leukocytes attracted by the control were subtracted in all cases. Each independent experiment involved a chemotactic activity assay in triplicate: 5 extracts using the same leukocyte sample. We used at least 3 different leukocyte samples. To determine the phenotype of the attracted leukocytes, these were stained using conjugated monoclonal antibodies: total leukocytes/anti-CD45-Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (PN IM2643), T-cells/anti-CD3-PC7 (6607100), B-cells/anti-CD19-PC5 (PN IM2643), monocytes/anti-CD14-ECD (PN IM2707U), and NK cells/anti-CD56-PE (PN IM2073; Beckman Coulter). Granulocytes were defined as CD45<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>−</sup>CD19<sup>−</sup>CD14<sup>−</sup>CD56<sup>−</sup> cells. In addition, the protein content of each extract was quantified by the Bradford method<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112452473">28</xref>

<p>The IL-1B levels tended to increase from the PZ to the RZ in both ROM and PROM; however, this increase was only significant in PROM (<italic>P</italic> = .008). There were no differences between ROM and PROM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112452473">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, IL-1RA levels were 10-fold greater in ROM than in PROM in all the zones. There were no differences between zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112452473">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In both ROM and PROM, IL-9 levels were greater in the RZ than in the PZ (<italic>P</italic> = .05 and .029). There were no differences between ROM and PROM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1933719112452473">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Human parturition represents an inflammatory response that is characterized by the presence of infiltrated leukocytes and proinflammatory mediators in the gestational tissues at or around the time of parturition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112452473">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112452473">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112452473">29</xref>
</sup> We recently put forward evidence supporting that there is a clear leukocyte infiltration gradient in the fetal membranes that rupture spontaneously, from the PZ to the rupture site.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112452473">26</xref>
</sup> This rupture site is characterized by collagenolysis, remodeling, apoptotic markers, and the expression of specific cytokines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112452473">8</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112452473"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112452473">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112452473">13</xref>

</sup> Here we demonstrated that in normal spontaneous rupture of fetal membranes a gradient of T-cell attraction is created from the PZ to the rupture site. However, in premature rupture of these tissues, this gradient may not exist and PROM was characterized by the high levels of CXCL-10 and GM-CSF in the rupture site and decreased levels of IL-1RA across all zones.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that in normal spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes the leukocyte chemotactic activity increases from the PZ to the rupture site and that this attraction involves T-cells. These data correlate with our previous studies which demonstrate that in ROM, the T-cell infiltration increases in the same fashion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112452473">26</xref>
</sup> T-cells have been localized throughout pregnancy, and it is known that they have involvement in the protection of the fetus from maternal immune attack at the maternal–fetal interface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112452473">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112452473">31</xref>
</sup> Here we demonstrate that they are enriched in the rupture site in ROM, which strengthens the hypothesis that they have a key role during normal labor at term delivery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112452473">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Besides T-cells, the rupture site includes high levels of IL-1B, CXCL-8, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112452473">26</xref>
</sup> and it is characterized by the presence of collagenolysis and apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112452473">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112452473">33</xref>
</sup> Since these mediators and processes converge in time and space, we speculate that all of them are related to each other. One explanation may be that chemokines (ie, CXCL-8) attract maternal leukocytes into the fetal membrane rupture site. Here these leukocytes (ie, T-cells) release cytokines such as IL-1B and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and MMP-9, and all of these mediators are involved in the collagenolysis and apoptosis of these tissues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112452473">33</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112452473"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112452473">35</xref>
</sup> Since MMP-9 has been associated with the regulation of IL-1B concentrations, because it degrades the active form of this IL to its inactive form,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112452473">36</xref>
</sup> we suggest that MMP-9 is also playing a regulatory role in the rupture site of the fetal membranes in ROM.</p>
<p>Our data also show that in normal rupture of fetal membranes the increasing T-cell chemotactic activity in the rupture site correlates with the increase in specific chemokines, including CXCL-8, CCL-3, and CCL-4. Previously, we demonstrated that these chemokines are highly expressed by the fetal membranes during term labor, which promotes leukocyte recruitment into the fetal maternal interface.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112452473">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112452473">23</xref>
</sup> Our findings indicate that these chemokines may also associate with the T-cell attraction in the rupture site in at term delivery. One weakness of this study is that we have not analyzed the phenotype of the attracted T-cells, which would permit to examine potential actions of T-cells.  </p>
<p>Unlike normal rupture, in premature rupture we did not find any difference in leukocyte chemotactic activity among the fetal membrane zones. Nonetheless, our data indicate that in premature rupture, total leukocyte chemotactic activity seems to be greater than in normal rupture, and that most of the attracted leukocytes, especially in the MZ, are granulocytes. It is already known that granulocytes play an important role in the creation of a proinflammatory microenvironment around the fetal membranes during normal term pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1933719112452473">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1933719112452473">38</xref>
</sup>; however, here we demonstrate that PROM fetal membranes are recruiting more granulocytes than ROM fetal membranes. Our data also show that this granulocyte attraction in the rupture site coincides with high levels of CXCL-10 and GM-CSF. The GM-CSF influences granulocyte recruitment into inflammatory sites,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1933719112452473">39</xref>
</sup> and CXCL-10 is expressed and released by granulocytes in an extreme proinflammatory microenvironment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1933719112452473">40</xref>
</sup> We therefore suggest that the elevated levels of these cytokines/chemokines may be involved in the granulocytic infiltration in the rupture site in PROM. These findings require further investigation to elucidate the granulocyte-specific phenotype and function in PROM and preterm PROM.</p>
<p>Since both normal and premature ruptures occur spontaneously, we expected to find similarities in the fetal membrane zones. We observed that in both ROM and PROM, the levels of CCL-3, CCL-4, CCL-5, TNF, IL-1B, and IL-9 were greater in the rupture site than in the extreme PZ. These data give weight to the hypothesis that the spontaneous rupture of the fetal membranes at term delivery occurs as a result of an immunological gradient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112452473">26</xref>
</sup> Further investigation is needed to study the role of these chemokines/cytokines, particularly IL-9, for the first time here described in the rupture site.  </p>
<p>It has been suggested that IL-1RA may regulate inflammation because (1) it can inhibit IL-1B-induced inflammation and labor,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1933719112452473">41</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1933719112452473"/>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1933719112452473"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1933719112452473">44</xref>
</sup> and (2) its reduced production due to a genetic variation of its gene, <italic>IL1RN</italic>, <italic>IL1RA*2</italic> (a penta-allelic 86-base pair tandem repeat-variable number tandem repeat [VNTR] in intron 2), increases the inflammatory response length and severity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1933719112452473">45</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, we observed that in premature rupture of fetal membranes, the IL-1RA secretion is decreased dramatically across all zones. Our finding in Hispanic women without infection coincides with a previous study, which demonstrates in Hispanic infants that the <italic>IL1RA*2</italic> allele is associated with an increased risk of PROM and subsequent spontaneous preterm birth.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1933719112452473">46</xref>
</sup> All these data together suggest that low concentrations of IL-1RA in fetal tissues (ie, fetal membranes) may be a regulatory mechanism that controls the timing of rupture of the fetal membranes. Intriguingly, an early study reports the lack of association between amniotic IL-1RA levels and preterm birth with and without infection,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1933719112452473">47</xref>
</sup> which suggests that in the amniotic cavity there may be a regulatory environment independent of IL-1RA.</p>
<p>Although, it has been reported that fetal gender has an effect on IL-1RA levels in amniotic fluid and neonatal urine concentrations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1933719112452473">48</xref>
</sup> we did not analyze fetal gender and this is a limitation in our study. Now that we know that IL-1RA levels may have a key role in the rupture of the fetal membranes, our current studies are analyzing sex-specific differences.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that normal and premature rupture of fetal membranes differ in regional chemotactic activity and related chemokine/cytokine production, which may represent evidence for differential mechanisms of rupture at term delivery. These findings put forward evidence to understand the signal transduction pathways that are activated in premature rupture of fetal membranes at term delivery. This might be relevant for understanding the rupture of these tissues before term, which is largely responsible for preterm births.  </p>
