<p>The focus towards end-of-life issues within the context of cultural diversity is increasingly evident in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987113491052">Chaturvedi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987113491052">Payne et al., 2005</xref>). Early work by Parkes et al. (1997) raises important issues in relation to ritual, belief systems and the process of acculturation for social groups who live within a dominant culture different to their own. This paper makes an important contribution to that debate through a new understanding and interpretation of the unique perspectives of the Asian community in relation to issues of death and dying. It is particularly important because it asks us to consider the ‘fit’ of the philosophy of palliative care to a worldview which may express the nature of life and death in a different way. The literature would suggest a struggle with the concept of palliative care, the expectation that death should be discussed openly and the challenges to Western perceptions of the autonomous self in a system which values different ways of decision-making.</p>
<p>However, palliative care can offer a perspective beyond the Anglo-centric culture from which it was derived. For example, there is evidence that the philosophy of palliative care in its broadest sense has a place in the language and culture in at least part of the Indian sub-continent. The Kerala model, championed by Dr Suresh Kumar, has transformed the experience of dying for many Indian families, respecting the cultural and religious mores which govern community life by adopting a public health approach using volunteers from within the community to deliver the care. The call for an international public health model for palliative care is supported by the World Health Organization’s strategic vision for palliative care as an approach to care which transcends the predominant cancer agenda, to embrace a wider chronic illness spectrum and a wide cultural diversity in the expression of its practice.</p>
<p>This paper presents a robust example of how good qualitative multi-lingual research is possible. They note many of the challenges that have been seen by other researchers, myself included, in managing the challenge of language and culture in understanding life experience of research participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987113491052">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>). The choice of constructivist Grounded Theory mirrors the reality of cultural diversity based in multiple representations of experience. Most importantly, the findings suggest a tension between the historical and contemporary worlds of the people interviewed. The fact that people choose to remain in a community, may never learn the language of the dominant culture and aspire to connect to their homeland in their final days suggest that the practice of palliative care needs a flexibility of approach to meet diverse hopes and expectations. Clearly, the fact that discussion over matters of life and death was not considered appropriate or not condoned by the children of the respondents is important knowledge for the practitioner. Moreover, in my opinion, the ability to debate what autonomy means for people at end-of-life is core to this research. It challenges us to consider other models of decision-making where the group rather than individual response may be more prevalent. This resonates here in Ireland, where first generation ethnic migration has not as yet resulted in second generational roots being formed and the cultures and practices of the home country remain the predominant support structure from which patients and families derive support. Understanding the relationship between multiculturalism and transitions towards dying is, therefore, a valuable contribution to knowledge for all of us.</p>
