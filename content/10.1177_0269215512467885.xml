<p>Thank you to the hard-working, always helpful reviewers who greatly improve every paper published and who help select the best submissions for the journal (only 20% of all submissions at present).</p>
<p>The editor likes short simple measures, and the revised <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra1-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512442670">Visual Analog Mood Scales</related-article> are just that – usable on anyone even with aphasia and apparently both repeatable and valid. I hope they become widely used. The editor also likes established beliefs to be questioned. The use of <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra2-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512443373">standing frames</related-article> is widely advocated for people with upper motor neurone loss affecting the legs, but does it benefit the patient? Seventeen studies with 540 patients has failed to demonstrate convincing evidence of benefit. It is time to investigate as many commonly used, generally accepted procedures as possible to reduce waste and harm. When we do have evidence, for example for constraint-induced movement therapy then it is good to compare the size of the effect with other effective treatments such as Bimanual therapy after stroke. A <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra3-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512443138">study here</related-article> suggests equivalence but it was underpowered to answer the question fully. Another comparative study compared two interventions of unknown effectiveness – conventional occupational therapy (whatever that might be) and Perfetti’s methods (<related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra4-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512444631">look at the article</related-article>). There was no difference but again the study was underpowered. Pilot studies are useful to allow an estimate of the number of patients needed to answer a question. Sixty patients should confirm whether <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra5-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512445068">interferential light therapy</related-article> with two probes is better than using the conventional approach of one light probe for treating shoulder tendinopathy. The editor is not a great advocate of technologically-based treatments and he is afraid of horses, so a trial on simulated horse-riding may not be his favourite treatment! However a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra6-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512444633">study</related-article> in children with cerebral palsy finds it improves balance but not function (underpowered again, I suspect). Vibration therapy is another treatment looking for a condition to treat, and an <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra7-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512446314">initial study</related-article> suggests it may reduce spasticity – in the short-term. Hopefully some large studies measuring functional outcomes in the long-term will soon be completed. A non-technological treatment – tilting the head forward – was evaluated as a <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra8-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512447085">treatment for idiopathic scoliosis</related-article> in adolescents; they seemed to benefit. Finally there is an <related-article ext-link-type="doi" id="ra9-0269215512467885" related-article-type="article-reference" xlink:href="10.1177/0269215512442669">audit report</related-article> on patient-centred goal-setting in patients after spinal cord injury which obviously does not evaluate the process, but does gives some insight into practice in one setting.</p>
