<abstract>
<p>The dragons mentioned in the title are (a) the failure of HTA methodologists to develop[em dash]and hence practitioners to use—tools for the consideration of equity in economic appraisals of health care technologies; (b) a similar and reinforcing failure to devise and implement processes of decision making that would facilitate the incorporation of equity in HTA. The draconian consequence is that equity is hardly considered at all and certainly does not get the same consideration as efficiency. Some initial suggestions are made as to how these dragons may be slain.</p>

<title>All Effective Treatment Must Be Free</title>
<p>“Here be dragons” may not have actually appeared on any known early map of the world, but it is on the Lenox Globe of 1510 in the New York Public Library, and monsters, giant horned men, and other similarly terrifying beasts were certainly sketched in early maps of the more remote and mostly unexplored regions of the world. One may draw an analogy between such maps and the current state of health technology assessment (HTA). There is a large terrain of well-researched and largely well-understood methods—economic, biostatistical, and epidemiological—on which most researchers are engaged in what is aptly called “normal science”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11426483">1</xref></sup> There are many important research topics, both applied and methodological, that customarily fill the pages of journals such as this and that are also “normal” in the Kuhnian sense of operating within the conventional optimizing paradigm of most cost-effectiveness analysis, as illustrated by Drummond and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11426483">2</xref></sup> Gold and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11426483">3</xref></sup> and many others. I do not intend to dwell here on research falling into this category. Nor do I intend, however, to devalue it by implying that it is somehow unadventurous or merely conventional. On the contrary, HTA is a living example of the intense creativity that is possible within a paradigm, and HTA is not at all normal in respect of the amazing bridging that has taken place across conventional disciplinary (and faculty) lines between clinical, statistical, and philosophical disciplines as well as social sciences, and it seems to me a considerable and highly unusual achievement that there should be so little misunderstanding between these disciplines. Indeed, an eavesdropper on a conversation between its practitioners would be hard pressed to tell from language alone whether a speaker was an epidemiologist, a statistician, a clinician, an ethicist, or an economist. This is what I imagine people may have in mind in making a distinction between multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>Fascinating though such an interdisciplinary story would be, that is not what I want to draw to your attention. My concerns about HTA relate to the fact that, when applied, it inevitably has a political context. It is political both with a large “P” and a small one. The large “P” relates to the political ideology of health services and springs from the notion of a public interest element of health services. This is an interest that can be cast in many languages, for example, in political language, “solidarity”, or in Marxian language, “from each according to their ability, to each according to their need”, or in neoclassical economic language, “public goods” and “caring externalities”. It finds particular expression in the idea, which I think can be first attributed to Archie Cochrane,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11426483">4</xref></sup> that the only health care warranting public financing or public delivery is health care that is demonstrably effective. Cochrane’s slogan, which I have stolen as the sidehead for this section, was “All effective treatment must be free”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11426483">4</xref></sup> It is, of course, perfectly possible to argue that it would be a rather good marketing strategy for any private health insurance agency to claim that the only services it would cover would be those in which one could have confidence that they were truly effective, even cost-effective, for there must be a substantial fraction of any population for whom that would be an attractive bundle to purchase, whether privately or through taxes, because there seems little point, at least from a consumer’s point of view, in having to purchase services of no value. Fascinating though this tack would be, like the interdisciplinary story, I shall set it aside in order to dwell on the small “p” political context. This is the context in which the political creator of the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), Frank Dobson, when asked as Secretary of State for Health whether he thought it would work, said “Probably not, but it’s worth a bloody good try.” Applied HTA is political both in the sense that it inherently embodies value judgments, including ones about equity or fairness, and in the sense that the identification and acceptance of value judgments of any kind require a process within the body politic; one, moreover, that needs to have particular characteristics if it is to lead to acceptable decisions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0272989X11426483">
<title>An Economist’s Angle</title>
<p>I ought to make plain the purpose of HTA and the key questions that it addresses or ought to address. HTA exists to help public decision makers make evidence-informed choices at the level at which formulary, insurance coverage, and clinical guideline decisions are taken so as to advance the public’s health. HTA ought to be seen as an aid to thought, never a substitute for it. It is a tool and, as such, ought to be useful, credible, and fit for purpose. It is not a chisel to be used as a screwdriver or a screwdriver to be used as a chisel. It should reveal what we do not know as well as what we do, what sort of confidence we may have in the available information, and be capable of indicating what other kinds of information would further aid decision makers. It ought to help decision makers integrate different kinds of information and expose the values that ought to underpin all such decisions. Regarding key questions, the main ones are very familiar: does an intervention (or health technology) work? For whom does it work? How well does it work? Relative to what alternatives? At what cost? Is it worthwhile? Can it be introduced (or withdrawn) and used in fair ways? What values are embodied in the answers to the foregoing? And what is the legitimate source of those values?</p>
<p>Even though many other disciplines provide crucial inputs, especially empirical inputs, to answer these questions, it is economics that has provided the overall analytical framework for comparative effectiveness research (CER) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in HTA. Economics has specifically prescribed a broadly utilitarian type of optimization (constrained maximization), although the stipulation of health rather than utility as the maximand is a significant departure from utilitarianism as normally practiced. HTA’s long-standing concern over the way in which this maximand is distributed over a jurisdiction’s population is another departure, such distributional concerns being of sublime indifference to strict utilitarians. Economics has also specified the general character of the evidence required to determine probable cost-effectiveness (clinical, of course, but also other evidence, especially that related to costs, nonclinical outcomes, and outcomes affecting third parties). It is economists who insist on the separate roles of science and social value judgments and who have emphasized that what qualifies one to make judgments about the former rarely also qualifies one to make judgments about the latter. Economics has introduced the HTA world to some of its own vocabulary, which has been quickly understood and absorbed into the conventional practice of HTA: words (and the inevitable acronyms) like incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); “publicness”, in the sense of a benefit whose enjoyment by one person does not diminish enjoyment for another; “opportunity cost”, in the sense of the most highly valued alternative use of the resources undergoing investigation; “social welfare function” (SWF), in the sense of how the satisfied preferences of many individuals are linked or added up; and “externality”, in the sense of the impact on others of one’s behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0272989X11426483">a</xref></sup> Economics has also brought some of its own techniques to the table: quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and other outcome concepts, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) and other experimental methods (many in association with cognitive psychology), time preference, and discounting. Indeed, it would be a challenge to find any method in use today that remains uniquely the property of any one discipline, including economics. A short list of such core disciplines ought to include anthropology, biostatistics, cognitive psychology, decision theory, epidemiology, ethics, ethnography, management, mathematics, political science, public administration, qualitative research, and social policy.</p>
<p>Despite this rich multidisciplinary input, it remains the case that the current guidance, whether from institutions like NICE and the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) or academic textbooks and articles, fails to deal with equity, in the sense of fairness, with anything like adequacy. This brings me to the dragons that I think need slaying, which, like sleeping dogs, have been left to lie but which, if aroused, are capable of more mischief and destruction than any dog.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0272989X11426483">
<title>Two Dragons</title>
<p>The first dragon is equity and, in particular, how one may embody equity considerations into HTA. By equity, I mean interpersonal fairness in the receipt of health care and the distribution of its consequences. Economists have a well-developed corpus of theory, both for describing the characteristics of a first-best allocation of resources to production and the fruits of that production to final consumers. They also have a well-developed set of principles for putting that analysis to work in a second-best world. Complementing those principles is an impressive array of empirical tools. It is all adaptable to the circumstances of the public sector as well as the private. And it has been, moreover, adapted to the circumstances of health care and health.</p>
<p>What economists have never been able satisfactorily to do is develop any analysis of equity of comparable sophistication, comparable applicability, and comparable mutual agreement. Nor, alas, has the vacuum been filled by anyone else, although Johri and Norheim’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11426483">5</xref></sup> review is a useful beginning. The consequence is that the committees that make recommendations about the adoption and funding of new health care interventions, or disinvestment in old ones, do not know how to address matters of equity. Nor do they know how to integrate such considerations into efficiency analyses. Economists are strong on what not to do. Do not identify equity with equality, nor health with welfare, nor need with priority. Do not assume that equity trumps efficiency or that efficiency trumps equity. The list may readily be prolonged. The trouble is that these prohibitions are nearly always what people do tend to ignore. That is not surprising given that economists, along with ethicists and other social analysts, have failed to stipulate what it is that one should do instead. By the same token, the aforesaid failure has, again not surprisingly, left an empirical void that stands in marked contrast to the evidential base that exists for efficiency studies, so that even if we suddenly knew what it is that we should do with respect to equity, we would hardly be able, as a practical matter, to do it. As it happens, I think there is a solution that will banish this dragon to even further reaches of our known landscape, but before revealing this, I must turn to the second dragon.</p>
<p>The second dragon is associated with the first, and unless this dragon is also slain, or at least banished, it will make it mightily difficult to dispose of dragon number one. Dragon number two is our ignorance as to the character of a process that might enable us to integrate equity in HTA. Specifically, the challenge is that we are short of an adequate understanding of the processes necessary for combining different types of evidence, evidence about different kinds of thing (monetary and nonmonetary, qualitative and quantitative), and for articulating concepts that are not themselves evidential (such as equity). It is not merely that processes can have characteristics that appeal in and of themselves, characteristics like transparency, citizen engagement, openness, deliberation, and contestability. It is that characteristics such as these are to be valued for more than their intrinsic merits. They are, in short, necessary for the proper accomplishment of the tasks of HTA, and in particular, they are essential to the major task of merging equity satisfactorily with efficiency.</p>
<p>Philosophy, political science, and social policy all address equity and, in the case of philosophy, have done so for many centuries. Administrative science, the law, and management science have all addressed processes. But none of these disciplines has concerned itself deeply with HTA (with the exception of the subdiscipline of bioethics), and typically, none has made the theory and practice of HTA their daily business. This accounts, I conjecture, for two unfortunate phenomena. The first is that the question whether the methods of HTA ought to be more intimately linked to the processes of real-world decision making has gone unaddressed. The two are treated as essentially unrelated activities. As a consequence, HTA, or at least the conventional practice within HTA of cost-utility analysis, has been described as a “perversion of science as well as of morality”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11426483">6</xref></sup> Powers and Faden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11426483">7</xref></sup> call attention to its “moral flaws”, an unfortunate judgment that hinges on the implausible proposition that those who use HTA methods, and CUA in particular, are moral morons wedded to the uncritical use of a single decision tool. The charge is a triple one: that the tool is a poor one, that it is used uncritically, and that it is the only one they use.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0272989X11426483">b</xref></sup> The other unfortunate phenomenon is that, despite these centuries of study, no one yet has come up with usable tools that would assist decision makers and those who advise them to integrate the two great criteria of efficiency and equity and to devise effective (even cost-effective) processes for doing so.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the way forward is for those of us who are, as it were, HTA “insiders” to grasp the challenges ourselves, perhaps in collaboration with some of the aforesaid colleagues from other disciplines (including the critics), but at any rate not in deferment to them, and set in motion a new research program designed to get to the heart of these matters. That is what I propose to try to boost in the rest of this article.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0272989X11426483">
<title>Process</title>
<p>“Arguably the biggest threat to our public health care system is not our ability to pay for the increasing cost of care, but rather a loss of public confidence.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11426483">8</xref></sup> While this loss of confidence parallels a general scepticism about the adequacy and fairness of public decisions across the board, health care has evidently not escaped it. For many,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X11426483">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11426483">10</xref></sup> the solution is citizen engagement and other processes of more direct democracy. I have much sympathy with sentiments such as these. However, that is not where I want to lay the emphasis here. I want, instead (or, perhaps, as well) to suggest that better processes would be useful not only for re-establishing confidence in general but also for offering ways in which better decisions are likely to result. A better process might be better in the sense that it is more transparent and confidence building on that account. Those are the intrinsic merits of a good process and are embodied in “accountability for reasonableness”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11426483">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11426483">12</xref></sup> But it may also be a better process by virtue of the fact that it embodies more complete evidence, or more deeply investigated evidence, or by its better combining of many elements, some evidential and others not, or through enabling a more complete addressing of equity and of its consideration alongside efficiency. By process, I mean the steps that are taken, and their organization and management, from the earliest inception of an HTA (what technology is to be assessed?) through its further scoping and refinement; selection of comparator technologies, identification of primary and secondary research; critical appraisal of the evidence; stakeholder comment, consultation, and further deliberation; through draft guidance, recommendations, or decisions; appeals; and conclusions, recommendations, and dissemination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0272989X11426483">c</xref></sup></p>
<p>The processes that I particularly have in mind are the possibility of external comment in order that interested parties may see what there is to comment upon; consultation, through which external parties are invited both to engage with decision makers and their advisers and to enter into discussion about whatever aspects of the process may be under way at the time, which includes assumptions, comparators, model building, literature review, and matters to do with the intrinsic process itself; and finally, the most complete form of engagement, deliberation, in which relevant stakeholders actually participate in the decision making itself, although probably excluding the final determination or conclusion of the process, for which responsibility necessarily lies with those appointed to decide.</p>
<p>Some issues requiring resolution would be determined at a high level, such as through the board of an organization, or at a ministerial or even cabinet level. Examples of such issues include specifying the objective (health maximization?), the available budget, the threshold (lintel?) ICER, the discount rate(s) to be used, whether sophisticated programming or simple CEA is to be used, whether multicriteria decision analysis is an approved method, the choice of technologies to evaluate, and the comparators and equity requirements. Occasionally, some of these might be determined at a lower level, which I take to be the level of the decision making agency or advisory committee. These lower level issues would generally include all of the following: testing the concept validity of outcome measures, assessing the quality of the science on a particular subject intervention and its comparators, interpreting and combining both qualitative and quantitative evidence (systematic reviews, other reviews, meta-analyses), linking, if possible, internal and external validity, weighing uncertainty, identifying absent information and deciding what to do in its absence, assessing feasibility and manageable timelines, trading off conflicting desiderata, and finally, making recommendations or issuing guidance through (preferably tried and tested) knowledge translation methods.</p>
<p>A good many technologies do not easily fit into the customary methods of HTA. Consider public health: its complex interventions, diversity of responsibility for the vectors of delivery (communities, schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), heterogeneity of outcomes (better health, but also reductions in teenage pregnancies, reduced crime, reduced fear of crime, etc.), long time horizons (especially when the interventions involve culture change or challenge cherished beliefs), and programmatic character (prevention, screening). Or consider the simplifying assumptions, such as constant returns to scale, nondiminishing marginal value of QALY, or the simple additivity of outcomes, that are so often merely taken for granted rather than tested for their appropriateness. Also consider the character of evidence, especially when one widens the notion of technology beyond pharmaceuticals: the greater dependence on multivariate observational studies and econometrics, the use of cheaper experimental methods than randomized controlled trials, and the kind of evidence required on value questions such as the value to be placed on a unit of outcome or the measurement of changes in equity. Then, too, consider what might be best regarded as a potential by-product of HTA: the possibilities it affords for raising the public understanding of risk and uncertainty, the reasons why one thing rather than another has been chosen, and the enhancement of the general credibility of guidance.</p>
<p>The process has three important aspects. One is to ensure that divergent views are properly represented to minimize the chances that any one particular interest group should unfairly capture the process. Another is to enable the wisdom and experience of other decision makers to be brought to the table. Their judgments, especially about value-laden and possibly controversial issues such as the quality of science or the meaning of equity, may be wiser than those of the “official” participants. A third is that the process itself is a means by which evidence is generated or at least brought before decision makers. Such evidence might relate to matters of feasibility and manageability, where the experience of practical managers among the decision makers may be a useful input; to matters of external validity, where specific knowledge on the environments into which an intervention might be introduced may be essential; or to the appraisal of outcomes, where the fit of the outcome measures used in research studies with the experience of actual patients and their carers can be tested and possible biases identified and adjustments made on account of them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11426483">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11426483">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>I have just listed some issues and asserted some better ways of addressing them. My selection is not evidence based, save in a somewhat experiential and necessarily partial way. Nor is it founded on any well-developed theory of “good” decision making. It is therefore ad hoc. Most of the literature on these topics, such as it is, is assertive rather than analytical, ideological rather than scientific, strong on advocacy but weak on evidence. It is also written by the practitioners of many different disciplines and appears in places that seem very remote from any HTA concern.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0272989X11426483">d</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0272989X11426483">
<title>Equity</title>
<p>Much the same applies, I fear, to the treatment of equity. Of course, equity, in its major sense of distributive justice and fairness, has been a central concern of moral philosophy since the days of classical Greece. Its modern students are well practiced in the business of typology (utilitarian [several varieties], deontological [again, several varieties], theological, consequentialist, etc.), but they have, with a few fine exceptions (such as Daniels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11426483">11</xref></sup> and Daniels and Sabin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11426483">12</xref></sup> on decision processes), been quite extraordinarily bad at providing tools for the use of practical decision makers such as the practitioners and users of HTA.</p>
<p>Even the most elementary tools, such as a typology of characteristic equity issues to form an agenda for discussion at various stages of an HTA process, would be an advance on what we currently have. Such a typology might focus deliberation on such matters as the domains of equity. For example, there are equity issues regarding the use and distribution of health care inputs, the processes that determine who gets what, the evaluation of outcomes, and on the priority that ought to be attached to different diseases or to prevention versus cure. Decision makers need to reflect on the appropriateness of the criteria used in respect of any of these, their inclusiveness, the relative weight to attach to each, and so on. Some red flags are provided in some jurisdictions by statute, as when there is a legal obligation to guard against discrimination by age, gender, disability, other demographics, workplace, education, and institutionalized discrimination. However, not all jurisdictions cover all possible issues, and matters of equitable concern may lie hidden in the depths of an HTA. There are also a number of top-level issues, such as whether there may be some principles on which all would agree as minimal requirements for equity, whether it is possible to enunciate some axiomatic statements that define what an increase in equity might mean and how it might be recognized empirically, and there is always a need to establish the applicability of any such principles in the context in question.</p>
<p>Some of the hidden equity biases that are likely always to need surfacing include “embedded inequity”, through which possible unfairness is built in to concepts (e.g., omitted dimensions of outcome measure that discriminate against those for whom such outcomes are important), or “framing effects” in experimental approaches that bring in social class bias, or unfairness that is inherent in the intervention (e.g., a threat to autonomy through the removal of choice, as with some public health measures). There are also “institutional biases”, inequities resulting from practices in jurisdictional scope (e.g., health consequences not taken into account by some faith-based provider institutions, school boards, or workplace managements), and the degree of concern many jurisdictions have with the distribution of consequences (health or nonhealth). There is also “implicit stereotyping”, the use, often in all innocence, of definitions and concepts that exclude individuals or aspects of health-related welfare that have differential impact on individuals and that make untested assumptions about what does and does not matter to the people for whom the intervention exists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0272989X11426483">e</xref></sup> Particular contexts (e.g., geography) may disadvantage some relative to others. Minimally, surely, one ought to test to see whether any of the following could affect the balance of advantage across different groups: the setting of care (e.g., home or institution), language, education or socio-economic status of clients, religious beliefs, stigma, or multiple deprivations.</p>
<p>Decision makers ought to ask, for example, whether the processes in HTA itself are biased by denying representation to people with a legitimate interest—whether the interests of absentee stakeholders are properly considered, for example, those anonymous individuals for whom services will not be provided as a consequence of implementing the recommendations. Participants in HTA need to be self-aware and self-critical regarding their own procedures. Processes in delivery of the care under evaluation can be prejudicial to technologies for some types of clients (e.g., those of low SES) and can favor those adept at negotiating their way through processes or impose differential burdens on some clients (e.g., wage v. salary earners).</p>
<p>Then, there are special claims such as claims of need (e.g., low initial health status?), of deservingness (e.g., choosing life styles that are hazardous to health?), of history (e.g., past endurance of ill-health, past receipt of the intervention), of desperation (e.g., “last chance”), of unfair innings (lived only a short life span), of nonhealth consequences (other welfare effects), and of willingness to pay (e.g., top-up payments). Sometimes, the beneficiary is identified as a member of a group or even by name as is often the case with spectacular acts of medical, or other, rescue. Ought cases of extreme need be given special favor?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X11426483">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0272989X11426483">16</xref></sup> What weight ought to be given to such claims either in general or in the context of a specific HTA? What weights actually are given?<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0272989X11426483">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X11426483">19</xref></sup> Cumulative effects may escape proper attention, for example, cumulative past disadvantages or effects that might be relevant in assessing benefit or cost or their distribution across patients and other affected groups.</p>
<p>The point of these examples is that in the process of discussion and deliberation about a technology decision, all of these hidden problems need to be deliberately surfaced because ignoring them (being unaware of their existence, or aware but doing nothing about them) leads to a bad decision. My suggestions are merely illustrative and are certainly not exhaustive. But who better to complete the list, maintain it through casuistry and careful recording of the reasons for decisions, and synthesize and consolidate it over time than those involved in the process of HTA? Through such casuistry, may we not build up case-based precedents to help decision makers achieve consistency across interventions and over time, perhaps, eventually create a systematic ethics of HTA?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0272989X11426483">
<title>Deliberation</title>
<p>For slaying of both my dragons, HTA requires, I conjecture, deliberation, with an emphasis on process, from scoping a topic through evidence generation and synthesis to delivering guidance; consultation with legitimate stakeholders (usually also a source of evidence); and facilitated discussion. These are all weak points in the current state of HTA, and they are all Cinderella research topics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11426483">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11426483">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X11426483">20</xref></sup> with multidisciplinary concerns.</p>
<p>I believe the ultimate product and measure of success would be the increase in confidence of participants, stakeholders, and the public. This would be achieved by their understanding of the processes and knowledge that the best evidence was used, that the appropriate “experts”, lay and professional, had contributed, that all relevant evidence had been searched and considered, that all relevant stakeholders had their say and been heard, that key concepts (e.g., outcomes) had been tested for construct validity, that all relevant costs and benefits had been weighed and included in calculations, that fair comparisons had been made (both between interventions and between individuals), that all relevant conceptual and empirical biases had been eliminated, and that the main risks had been assessed and undue risks not taken. I suppose, taken as a group, such outcomes might constitute evidence of a “good” process.</p>
<p>To realize this ultimate product, however, HTA would be wise to broaden its horizons, turning away from what is largely just an algorithm to find ways to take seriously the myriad value and ethical issues, which currently still have the unfortunate appearance of afterthoughts tacked onto, but essentially excluded from, the core decision logic, and to develop an empirical program to rival, mutatis mutandis, that of CEA and CER. After all, nonmonetary values, although less easily measured perhaps than monetary ones, are still subject to empirical estimation, and the values that individuals actually cherish ought, at the least, to inform decision makers’ values. This is not merely a matter of expanding the algorithm but also, as I have tried to show, a matter of developing suitable processes that generate information through the participation of stakeholders while also facilitating the thoughtful assessment of what is known, combining it with revealed values, and producing multiple solutions to problems that are not uniquely soluble, like those on which there are deep divisions of principle in the community. To participate both in such processes and in the accompanying research program must surely be one of the more exciting prospects confronting today’s HTAers.</p>
