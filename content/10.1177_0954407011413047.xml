<abstract>
<p>Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been widely used in city buses or taxis because of its relatively low price and great abundance. Most of the CNG engines externally mix the natural gas with the intake air and utilize a lean-burn strategy to achieve low nitrogen oxide (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) emissions and high fuel economy. However, the well-examined external mixing of gas fuel with the intake air will result in a volumetric efficiency loss at high engine loads and may cause backfire when the natural gas is enriched with hydrogen. Also, the lean-burn technique may not sufficiently satisfy increasingly restricted future legislation. In this paper, the use of the stoichiometric equivalence ratio with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was investigated experimentally on a direct-injection spark ignition engine fuelled with hydrogen–natural-gas blends. Attention is focused on the advantages of combining EGR with hydrogen enrichment. The results show that hydrogen enrichment increases the brake mean effective pressure, which dramatically deteriorates under high-level EGR. Optimal efficiencies are achieved with an EGR rate of 5–10 per cent; the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions can be decreased by about 80 per cent with 25 per cent EGR dilution, but the combustion variation increases simultaneously. With hydrogen enrichment, the combustion variation can be controlled under 5 per cent, while the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, hydrocarbon, and carbon monoxide emissions are kept at a low level. Worse EGR tolerance was exhibited for the late-injection-timing case.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>With increasing concern about fossil fuel shortage and environmental protection, more and more attention has been shifted to the utilization of alternative fuels. Natural gas has been widely used in city buses or taxis because of its relatively lower price and greater abundance than oil. Natural gas has a price advantage of more than 3 to 1 over oil on an equivalent unit energy basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011413047">1</xref>]. A recent report by the energy consultants Nextant estimated that global unconventional gas resources may amount to 3.3 × 10<sup>16</sup> ft<sup>3</sup>, or about five times the amount of proven reserves at the end of 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407011413047">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407011413047">2</xref>]. Natural gas also results in significantly lower carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emission than fossil fuel does. Studies have showed that a natural-gas optimized engine vehicle can achieve a 30 per cent lower CO<sub>2</sub> emission than a gasoline version does, while the emission remains in compliance with Euro-4 as well as super-ultra-low-emissions vehicle emission limits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011413047">3</xref>]. Hydrogen, with the properties of a very fast burning velocity, a low ignition energy, and a small quenching distance, can significantly decrease emissions and improve the combustion quality when mixed with compressed natural gas (CNG). It is reported that a 20 per cent hydrogen mix by volume with CNG (also called Hythane®) can reduce by over 50 per cent the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) after calibration compared with the those of a pure CNG baseline engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407011413047">4</xref>]. In fact, more benefits could be achieved by application of a hydrogen–compressed-natural-gas (HCNG) engine combined with a lean-burn strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407011413047">5</xref>]. The lean-burn strategy is an effective approach for simultaneously improving the engine efficiency and decreasing the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. With the addition of hydrogen to natural gas, the lean-burn limit can be extended and hence the efficiency increased and the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions reduced. Karim <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407011413047">6</xref>] investigated the combustion characteristics and knock regions with different percentage equivalence ratios of hydrogen to methane and different spark timings. Blarigan and Keller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407011413047">7</xref>] conducted an experimental study and used a KIVA model to investigate the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions and efficiency for different methane-to-hydrogen ratios (100 vol % methane–0 vol % hydrogen, 70 vol % methane–30 vol % hydrogen, and 0 vol % methane–100 vol % hydrogen). Bauer and Forest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407011413047">8</xref>] experimentally studied the effect of hydrogen on the engine performance and emissions on a single-cylinder cooperative fuel research HCNG engine at speeds of 700 r/min and 900 r/min, with full load and part-loads. Ma <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011413047">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407011413047">10</xref>] conducted a series of studies on a six-cylinder turbocharged heavy engine fuelled with hydrogen–natural-gas blends. They investigated the engine performances, emissions, and combustion characteristics with lean-burn operation. However, the engines cannot always run very lean even if a high excess air ratio and low NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions are possible. In real city-road cycles, such as the city bus or taxi drive cycles, most cycles are transient conditions, and the actual fuel–air mixture is richer than expected in order to achieve better drivability, especially under acceleration and high-load conditions. The response time and accuracy of the air-to-fuel ratio control system may also result in less lean combustion. Therefore, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> formation can be very high if the actual air-to-fuel ratio becomes nearly 1.1–1.2 where the peak of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> generation mostly occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407011413047">11</xref>]. Another way to achieve low NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions and high efficiency is exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with a stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio. Similar to the excess air dilution of the lean-burn strategy, EGR employs the exhaust gas to dilute the inlet charge and leads to a decrease in the in-cylinder temperature. Dimopoulos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407011413047">3</xref>] using design-of-experiments algorithms investigated the effects of the EGR rate, the ignition timing, and the hydrogen fraction on the thermal efficiency and the engine-out emissions in a state-of-the-art passenger car fuelled with a hydrogen–natural-gas mixture. They demonstrated that, after optimization, the optimal combination of the EGR rate, spark advance, and hydrogen fraction can significantly improve the combustion behaviour and engine efficiency with considerably lower NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions while the hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions show little variations. Ibrahim and Bari [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407011413047">12</xref>] conducted an experimental study on a natural-gas engine with EGR dilution. They found that, when an EGR dilution strategy was employed, an appropriate increase in the compression ratio can greatly improve the engine performance and efficiency. Conte and Boulouchos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011413047">13</xref>] carried out an experimental investigation on a hydrogen-enhanced gasoline direct-injection engine. They reported that, with a small amount of hydrogen injection into the intake port, a high EGR rate can be achieved and the indicated efficiency increases with the addition of hydrogen and EGR operation.</p>
<p>The concept of CNG direct injection (DI) has raised much attention in the past few decades. Huang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407011413047">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407011413047">16</xref>] conducted experimental studies on combustion characteristics and emissions using a rapid-compression machine and revealed the importance of the injection timing on stratified charge combustion. Acroumanis <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407011413047">17</xref>] performed an experimental investigation on a four-cylinder natural-gas direct-injection spark ignition (DISI) optical engine. They reported that, compared with the low-pressure natural-gas port injection case, the DI concept offered many benefits such as an increased power output, lower NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions, and better fuel consumption. The studies referred to above are helpful to understand the characteristics of natural-gas DISI combustion. However, all these experiments were conducted with lean-burn operation. Previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407011413047">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407011413047">19</xref>] mainly introduced EGR operations to port injection or carburetted HCNG engines, and the external mixing of HCNG with air decreases the volumetric efficiency while resulting in the probability of backfire at high engine loads. There have been few reports in the literature where HCNG DI combustion was combined with EGR operation. Hence, the present paper aims to examine the effect of EGR on the performance and emissions of CNG DISI combustion for various fractions of hydrogen enrichment.</p>

<title>2 Experimental Set-Up and Procedure</title>
<p>The test engine was converted from a single-cylinder DI diesel engine. The specifications of the engine are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954407011413047">Table 1</xref>, and a schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407011413047">Fig. 1</xref>. The injector used in this experiment is a modified version from a gasoline DI engine made by the manufacturer Hitachi Co. To increase the flowrate of natural-gas application, the swirler near the tip of nozzle was removed. The injection pressure was regulated at 8 MPa, since the gas velocity from the injector nozzle is kept at a constant value of the sonic velocity owing to the condition of choke during fuel injection; thus the amount of injected fuel is determined by the injection duration. A pump was used to introduce the exhaust gas into the intake pipe through the intercooler and EGR valve. Different EGR rates can be obtained by adjusting the EGR valve. An ECM EGR5230 analyser was used to measure the EGR rate, and the measurement has a resolution of 0.5 per cent. A free-programmed engine control system was used for engine operation control. The injection timing, injection duration, and ignition timing were controlled by the electronic control unit and can be adjusted in the experiment. A Horiba MEXA-554JA analyser was used to measure the exhaust HC, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub> levels with accuracies of 12 ppm for HC, 0.06 per cent for CO, and 0.5 per cent for CO<sub>2</sub>. A Horiba MEXA-720 analyser was used to measure the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration with an accuracy of 30 ppm.</p>

<p>Hydrogen of 99.995 per cent purity was used, and the constitution of the natural gas was as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954407011413047">Table 2</xref>. Some thermal and chemical properties of the natural gas and hydrogen are compared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954407011413047">Table 3</xref>. As can be seen, the laminar burning velocity of hydrogen is much faster than that of natural gas. Thus, the addition of hydrogen to natural gas can be helpful to increase the flame propagation speed and to improve the combustion process, especially under the ultra-lean-burn and high-EGR operation. Meanwhile, the quenching distance of hydrogen is one third of that of natural gas, and this will help to reduce the unburned HC in the crevice volume. Different fractions of the hydrogen–methane mixture were prepared in advance in the fuel tank. It is estimated that an 18 per cent volume fraction of hydrogen corresponds to a 2 per cent mass fraction of hydrogen in the fuel mixture.</p>

<p>In this study, the engine speed was fixed at 1200 r/min, and the engine load was operated at wide-open-throttle (WOT) condition. Two fuel injection timings were selected: early injection timing (θ<sub>inj</sub> = 300° CA BTDC) and late injection timing (θ<sub>inj</sub> = 170° CA BTDC). A Horiba 700λ instrument was used to measure the excess air ratio λ with an accuracy of 5 per cent, and a stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio was selected. The volumetric percentages of hydrogen in the hydrogen–methane blends are 0 per cent, 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent, and 40 per cent respectively. For each hydrogen–methane blend, the EGR rate was varied in range from 0 per cent to 25 per cent in steps of 5 per cent. Ignition timings of the minimum spark advance for best torque (MBT) were chosen in the experiment and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407011413047">Fig. 2</xref>.</p>

<title>3 Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen enrichments is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011413047">Fig. 3</xref>. The results show that the BMEP decreases with increase in the EGR dilution for all hydrogen–methane mixtures. When more EGR is introduced, less air and fuel enter the cylinder, i.e. less energy is introduced into the in-cylinder combustion. Also, the flame propagation speed is decreased by the EGR dilution. These effects result in a decrease in the BMEP with increasing EGR rate. It should be noted that, in comparison with the early-injection case (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407011413047">Fig. 3(a)</xref>), the maximum BMEP for the late-injection case is higher at low EGR rates; this is because of the higher volumetric efficiency when the fuel injection timing is retarded. However, the BMEP dramatically decreases with further increase in the EGR rate. The deterioration in the combustion with high EGR dilution is responsible for this phenomenon; this can be confirmed by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011413047">Fig. 9</xref> (shown later), which demonstrates that the coefficient of variation in the indicated mean effective pressure (COV<sub>IMEP</sub>) for the late-injection case is much higher than that for the early-injection case, suggesting a poor combustion stability at higher EGR rates. For a specific EGR rate, the BMEP shows a non-monotonic trend with increase in the hydrogen enrichment. When the EGR rate is below 15 per cent, the increase in the hydrogen fraction decreases the BMEP; when the EGR rate is above 15 per cent, the BMEP tends to increase with further increase in the hydrogen fraction. The influence of the addition of hydrogen on the BMEP can be explained from two viewpoints. First, the increase in the hydrogen fraction will reduce the volumetric heat value of the hydrogen–methane blends, and the heat transfer to the cylinder wall will also increase. These factors lead to a decrease in the engine power, and this can be verified from previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407011413047">9</xref>]. Second, on the other hand, the addition of hydrogen will increase the flame propagation speed and improve the combustion stability. Since the deterioration of combustion at low EGR rates is not as serious as that at high EGR rates, the effects of volumetric heat reduction and heat transfer to wall, which result from the addition of hydrogen, seem to be dominant and consequently decrease the BMEP. With a further increase in the EGR rate, the combustion stability will deteriorate and the gain from combustion improvement is more pronounced than the power loss from heat value reduction and heat transfer to wall. Therefore, when the EGR dilution is at a relatively low level and does not cause the combustion process to deteriorate severely, the addition of hydrogen to natural gas will decrease the engine power output. When the EGR dilution is extended to a specific level at which the combustion quality become poor, the addition of hydrogen will increase the engine power.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011413047">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the brake thermal efficiency versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen fractions. The optimal efficiencies are achieved at around 5–15 per cent EGR for both injection timings. Since the throttle is wide open in this experiment, the pumping work versus the EGR rate remains essentially unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011413047">20</xref>]. Therefore, the improvement in the brake thermal efficiency when the EGR increased from 0 per cent to a specific value probably arises for the following reasons. First, the heat loss to cylinder walls is reduced because of the decreased burned gas temperature with EGR dilution. Second, the EGR gases may contain some free radicals which are produced during the combustion process, and the free radicals can promote the pre-ignition reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954407011413047">21</xref>]. As the EGR rate is continually increased, the high EGR dilution will result in a worsening of the combustion quality and thus will decrease the brake thermal efficiency. This is especially obvious with pure natural-gas fuel. The brake thermal efficiency for the late fuel injection timing is slightly higher than that for the early fuel injection timing when the EGR dilution is below 5 per cent. As the EGR rate becomes in excess of 10 per cent, the brake thermal efficiency for late fuel injection timing decreases much more quickly than that for early fuel injection timing. As mentioned before, the dramatic decrease in the BMEP at high EGR rates for the late-fuel-injection case leads to a fast decrease in the brake thermal efficiency. When the EGR rate is below 10 per cent, the brake thermal efficiency slightly decreases with an increase in the hydrogen fraction. When the EGR rate is above 10 per cent, the brake thermal efficiency shows an increasing trend with an increase in the hydrogen fraction. When the EGR dilution is at a low level, the addition of hydrogen will increase the combustion temperature owing to the fast flame propagation speed and will enhance the heat transfer to cylinder wall. This is detrimental to the brake thermal efficiency because more heat will be transferred to the coolant. It seems that, at low EGR levels, the loss in efficiency due to an increase in the heat transfer is larger than the gain in the efficiency due to an increase in the burning velocity. When the EGR is increased to a high level, the combustion process becomes slow and unstable. The addition of hydrogen will promote the burning velocity and improve the combustion stability. Then, the gain in the efficiency due to the increase in the burning velocity is larger than the loss in efficiency due to the increase in the heat transfer, and hence the brake thermal efficiency increases with increase in the hydrogen fraction.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011413047">Figure 5</xref> shows the brake specific NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen fractions. As expected, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration decreases with increasing EGR rate for both early injection timing and late injection timing. The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration is strongly related to the combustion temperature. EGR dilution decreases the combustion temperature and thus reduces the generation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. Also, with increasing EGR rate, the amount of fresh air entering the cylinder will decrease, and so the decreased oxygen in the cylinder can limit the formation of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. At a specific EGR rate, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration increases with increase in the hydrogen fraction. The increasing trend is more obvious at low EGR rates. With increasing hydrogen fraction, the increase in the burning velocity and the fast heat release will increase the combustion temperature and thus promote NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> formation. At high EGR rates, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration is at a very low level and slightly increases with increase in the hydrogen fraction. This also suggests the important role of EGR in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emission control.</p>

<p>On the basis of the results from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407011413047">Figs 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954407011413047">5</xref>, it seems that, at a low EGR rate, the addition of hydrogen does not improve the brake thermal efficiency but increases the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions. For clarification, the brake thermal efficiency versus the brake specific NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration at different EGR rates is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407011413047">Fig. 6</xref>. As can be seen, the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions can be greatly reduced with increasing EGR while achieving a relatively high brake thermal efficiency by the addition of hydrogen. Therefore, it can be concluded that combining the addition of hydrogen with EGR is an effective approach for realizing high-efficiency low-emission combustion.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011413047">Figure 7</xref> shows the brake specific HC concentration versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen fractions. For both fuel injection timings, when the EGR rate is less than 10 per cent, the HC concentration increases slowly with increase in the EGR rate. When the EGR rate is more than 10 per cent, the HC concentration significantly increases with increasing EGR. This phenomenon can be explained from the mechanism of HC generation and oxidization. When the EGR rate increases to a relatively low level, the combustion temperature and the wall temperature decrease owing to the dilution of EGR, and thus the HC formation resulting from the wall quenching layer will increase. Meanwhile, the reduction in the amount of oxygen in the intake charge and the decreased in-cylinder gas temperature due to the increase in the EGR are both unfavourable for HC oxidization. As can also be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407011413047">Fig. 7</xref>, when the EGR rate is below a specific value, the HC concentrations for both fuel injection timings are almost the same; however, as the EGR rate is increased, the HC is significantly increased for the late-injection case. The HC concentration increases to 1.9 g/kW h at 25 per cent EGR for late injection timing, while the HC concentration is 0.9 g/kW h at 25 per cent EGR for early injection timing. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011413047">Fig. 9</xref> shows, when the EGR rate is above 20 per cent, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> of the late injection timing is much larger than that of the early injection timing. This suggests that the combustion is more unstable in comparison with the late-injection-timing case. Therefore, the HC concentration greatly increases because of the partial combustion or misfire when the combustion stability becomes poor. At a specific EGR rate, the HC concentration decreases with increase in the hydrogen fraction. For spark ignition engines, the main source of HC emission results from the top-land crevice volume with the narrow entrance into which the flame cannot penetrate. When the cylinder pressure decreases at the end of combustion, the unburned mixture, which is forced into the crevices during the compression process, is released into combustion chamber and oxidized by the post-flame. The increased hydrogen fraction increases the burning rate and the combustion temperature, which is beneficial to HC post-flame oxidization. Meanwhile, the addition of hydrogen improves the combustion stability and reduces the unburned HC during incomplete combustion or misfire. This is obvious especially in the high-EGR condition. Furthermore, partial replacement of natural gas by hydrogen also decreases the carbon fraction in the fuel mixture. All these contributors decrease the HC emission with increase in the hydrogen fraction.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011413047">Figure 8</xref> gives the brake specific CO concentration versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen fractions. The CO concentration shows slight variations with increase in the EGR. It is reasonable because the CO emissions from internal combustion engines are primarily controlled by the fuel-to-air equivalence ratio and have little relationship with the EGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011413047">20</xref>]. As is also shown from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407011413047">Fig. 8</xref>, the CO concentration for late injection timing is much higher than that for early injection timing. This observation is probably related to the air–fuel mixture distribution in the cylinder. For late injection timing, the air–fuel mixture near the spark plug is relatively richer than the stoichiometric mixture, while the air–fuel mixture for early injection timing is stoichiometric and more homogeneous. The local rich area near the spark plug may produce much more CO emissions for the late-injection-timing case. At a specific EGR rate, the CO concentration decreases with increase in the hydrogen fraction. The carbon-to-hydrogen ratio of fuel blends decreases with increasing hydrogen fraction, resulting in a decrease in the carbon-related emission including CO emission. The oxidization of CO is also promoted because of the increased combustion temperature due to the addition of hydrogen.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011413047">Figure 9</xref> demonstrates the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> versus the EGR rate for different hydrogen fractions. As the EGR rate is increased, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> simultaneously increases for both fuel injection timings. As is known, the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) is an indicator of the engine torque, and the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> represents the cyclic variation in the engine torque. EGR decreases the flame propagation speed and lengthens the combustion process. When the combustion process becomes slower, the cyclic variations in the flame development duration and rapid flame duration both increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011413047">20</xref>]. For MBT ignition timings, the burning process is mainly centred at about 10° CA after top dead centre (ATDC). The high cyclic variation in the combustion duration indicates that most of the cycles occur modestly retarded or over advanced with respect to the optimum position (10° CA ATDC) and this will lead to significant cyclic torque variations. At high EGR rates, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> for late injection timing is much higher than that for early injection timing. For late injection timing, the mixture near the spark gap is ideally stoichiometric or slightly richer; therefore stable combustion is possible with a much higher level of EGR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954407011413047">22</xref>]. However, the discrepancy is observed and similar results concerning the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> were also obtained and have been reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407011413047">13</xref>]. Since the test engine is not a state-of-the-art engine and was modified from an original diesel–gasoline engine, much optimization work with respect to some parameters such as the combustion chamber shape, the number and arrangement of nozzle holes, and the swirl intensity is still required, especially for the late-fuel-injection mode. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407011413047">Fig. 9</xref> shows, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> for the late-injection case is acceptable (below 5 per cent) at low EGR rates. When the EGR rate exceeds 10 per cent, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> markedly increases with increase in the EGR rate. In contrast, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> for early injection timing shows little variation on increase in the EGR, except that the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> is slightly above 5 per cent at 25 per cent EGR. The variations in the turbulent velocity fluctuations near the spark plug for late injection timing may be responsible for this phenomenon. The variation in the velocity contributes in a major way to the variation in the initial motion of the flame centre as it grows from the kernel established by the spark and to the variation in the initial growth rate of flame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954407011413047">20</xref>]; the variation in the velocity can also affect the rapid burning duration. As discussed above, the variation in the combustion durations, including the flame development duration and the rapid combustion duration, will lead to a large variation in the cyclic torque. For both injection timings, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> decreases with increasing hydrogen fraction. The increased burning velocity due to the addition of hydrogen can decrease the variation in the combustion durations and thus can decrease the COV<sub>IMEP</sub>. It should be noted that the decrease in the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> on the addition of hydrogen is much more obvious for the late-injection-timing case. This is helpful to maintain a relatively stable torque output especially at high EGR rates.</p>

<title>4 Conclusions</title>
<p>The presented experimental study aims to examine the effect of the EGR on the performance and emissions of CNG DISI combustion with various fractions of hydrogen enrichment. The results from the experiments can be summarized as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-0954407011413047" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The BMEP decreases with increase in the EGR rate. When the EGR rate is more than 15 per cent, increasing the hydrogen fraction of the fuel improves the combustion and increases the BMEP. The optimal brake thermal efficiency is achieved at an EGR rate of 5–10 per cent for all the HCNG blends. When the EGR rate is less than 10 per cent, the brake thermal efficiency slightly decreases with increasing hydrogen fraction. When the EGR rate is more than 10 per cent, the brake thermal efficiency shows an increasing trend with increase in the hydrogen fraction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentration decreases with increasing EGR rate and increases with increasing hydrogen fraction. About 80 per cent of the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions can be reduced with 25 per cent EGR dilution, but the combustion variation increases simultaneously. With an adequate addition of hydrogen, the combustion variation can be controlled to under 5 per cent while the NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, HC, and CO emissions are kept low.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The COV<sub>IMEP</sub> increases with increasing EGR and decreases with increasing hydrogen fraction. At high EGR rates, the COV<sub>IMEP</sub> for late injection timing increases much more quickly than that for early injection timing with increasing EGR, suggesting a worse EGR tolerance for the late-injection case. This is probably related to the in-cylinder mixture distribution condition for the late-injection operation.</p></list-item>
