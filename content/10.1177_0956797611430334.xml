<abstract>
<p>It has often been argued that compassion is fundamental to morality. Yet people often suppress compassion for self-interested reasons. We provide evidence that suppressing compassion is not cost free, as it creates dissonance between a person’s moral identity and his or her moral principles. We instructed separate groups of participants to regulate their compassion, regulate their feelings of distress, or freely experience emotions toward compassion-inducing images. Participants then reported how central morality was to their identities and how much they believed that moral rules should always be followed. Participants who regulated compassion—but not those who regulated distress or experienced emotions—showed a dissonance-based trade-off. If they reported higher levels of moral identity, they had a greater belief that moral rules could be broken. If they maintained their belief that moral rules should always be followed, they sacrificed their moral identity. Regulating compassion thus has a cost of its own: It forces trade-offs within a person’s moral self-concept.</p>

<p>Imagine walking down the street and passing a homeless person who asks you for spare change. If you let yourself feel compassion for this person’s plight, you might provide assistance. But if you want to avoid financial costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611430334">Shaw, Batson, &amp; Todd, 1994</xref>) or interacting with the person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611430334">Harris &amp; Fiske, 2006</xref>), you might suppress your compassion and keep walking. From the perspective of self-interest, suppressing compassion in this scenario seems to provide benefits without entailing any costs. We propose that regulating compassion might bring an unexpected cost of its own by changing how people think about their moral identity.</p>
<p>Compassion—which is derived from the Latin for “to suffer with”—has been defined as “the feeling that arises in witnessing another’s suffering and that motivates a subsequent desire to help” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611430334">Goetz, Keltner, &amp; Simon-Thomas, 2010</xref>, p. 351). This emotion has also been called sympathy and empathic concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611430334">Batson, 2011</xref>). Compassion may have evolved as a caretaking response toward people in need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611430334">Oveis, Horberg, &amp; Keltner, 2010</xref>), and it can motivate prosocial behavior even when such behavior is at odds with self-interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611430334">Batson, 2011</xref>). For instance, people induced to feel compassion will try to ease another person’s suffering, even if they can escape the situation without helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611430334">Batson, Duncan, Ackerman, Buckley, &amp; Birch, 1981</xref>). Compassion can also increase feelings of closeness with other people who are weak and vulnerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611430334">Oveis et al., 2010</xref>), increase forgiveness of transgressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611430334">Condon &amp; DeSteno, 2010</xref>), and uphold patterns of cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611430334">Singer &amp; Steinbeis, 2009</xref>). Given that compassion is elicited by appraisals of undeserved harm, it has been proposed as an emotional cornerstone of moral judgment and moral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611430334">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite recognizing its moral significance, people often suppress their feelings of compassion for others. One common justification for this behavior is that experiencing compassion indiscriminately might lead to exploitation and exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611430334">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, previous research has shown that as the number of victims in a crisis grows, people ironically feel less compassion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611430334">Slovic, 2007</xref>). In previous research, we found that this effect was driven by efforts to regulate compassion in order to avoid financial and psychological costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611430334">Cameron &amp; Payne, 2011</xref>). The current experiment was designed to expand on this finding by examining how regulating compassion changes people’s moral self-concept.</p>
<p>Although people generally perceive themselves as moral and ethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611430334">Epley &amp; Dunning, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611430334">Paulhus &amp; John, 1998</xref>), they often violate moral norms in everyday life. When such violations are consciously recognized, they can create cognitive dissonance within people’s moral self-concept. Cognitive dissonance is a conflict among behavior, attitudes, and beliefs that leads to aversive arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611430334">Cooper &amp; Fazio, 1984</xref>). People can relieve this tension by altering their behavior, attitudes, or beliefs until they are once again consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611430334">Elliot &amp; Devine, 1994</xref>). For instance, people might act morally to compensate for prior immorality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611430334">Sachdeva, Iliev, &amp; Medin, 2009</xref>). But if it is impossible to change or reconstrue behavior, people might change their attitudes or beliefs about morality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611430334">Shu, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that regulating compassion would create dissonance among moral behavior, moral attitudes, and moral beliefs. When people suppress compassion for someone who is suffering, they cannot consistently claim to care about being moral and to believe that moral rules should always be followed. This inconsistency could be resolved in two ways. First, people could change how much they value being moral. Some people value morality as central to their identities, and individual differences in this moral identity predict moral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611430334">Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002</xref>). If, after suppressing compassion, people continued to believe that moral rules should always be followed, their behavior would force them to conclude that morality is less central to their identities than they previously believed (e.g., they may reason, “I believe that moral rules should always be followed, but I place less value on being a moral person”).</p>
<p>Second, people could alter their beliefs about moral behavior. Whereas some people believe that moral rules must be followed absolutely, others believe that moral rules can be applied more flexibly, on the basis of self-interest (a doctrine known as <italic>moral flexibility</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611430334">Forsyth, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611430334">Schlenker, 2008</xref>). Moral flexibility is associated with immoral behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611430334">Shu, Gino, &amp; Bazerman, 2011</xref>). If, after suppressing compassion, people continued to care about being moral, their behavior might lead them to conclude that moral rules can be violated when convenient (e.g., They may say, “I value being a moral person, but I do not always need to follow moral rules in order to be moral”).</p>
<p>In the experiment reported here, we instructed people to regulate their compassion, regulate their feelings of distress, or freely experience emotions toward compassion-inducing images. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611430334">Batson’s (2011)</xref> research, we distinguished compassion from distress, a self-focused negative reaction to suffering that often precludes prosocial behavior. Accordingly, we instructed people to regulate “sympathy” or “distress.” The terms “compassion” and “sympathy” are seen as synonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611430334">Batson, Fultz, &amp; Schoenrade, 1987</xref>), and we ensured that our participants made this connection by including “compassionate” in the definition of sympathy that we provided to them. We predicted that regulating compassion would create cognitive dissonance that could be resolved either by reducing moral identity or increasing moral flexibility. Typically, higher moral identity is associated with lower moral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611430334">McFerran, Aquino, &amp; Duffy, 2010</xref>). We predicted that people who regulate their compassion would show a distinctly different pattern, in which higher moral identity is associated with greater moral flexibility. By contrast, we predicted that people who regulated distress or freely experienced emotions would not be forced into such dissonance-based trade-offs.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred and one students (72 female, 29 male) from the University of North Carolina participated for course credit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0956797611430334">
<title>Design</title>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to one of three emotion-regulation conditions. In the regulate-compassion condition, participants received the following instructions (emphasis in original):</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We are about to show you some emotional images. While you are viewing the images, <italic>try not to feel</italic> one specific kind of emotion: <italic>sympathy</italic>. Sympathy is a warm, compassionate, and tender response toward others who are suffering. If you notice yourself feeling any sympathy, do your best to eliminate this emotion. Pay careful attention to the images, but please try to think about what you are seeing in such a way that you don’t feel any sympathy at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the regulate-distress condition, participants received a different set of instructions (emphasis in original):</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We are about to show you some emotional images. While you are viewing the images, <italic>try not to feel</italic> one specific kind of emotion: <italic>distress</italic>. Distress is an upset, troubled, and disturbed response toward others who are suffering. If you notice yourself feeling any distress, do your best to eliminate this emotion. Pay careful attention to the images, but please try to think about what you are seeing in such a way that you don’t feel any distress at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Finally, participants in the experience-emotions condition were told the following (emphasis in original):</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We are about to show you some emotional images. While you are viewing the images, please <italic>let yourself experience whatever emotions come to you</italic>. In other words, as you see the images, let yourself feel your emotions without trying to get rid of them. Pay careful attention, and please try to think about what you are seeing in such a way that you experience whatever emotions come to you.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Participants then viewed 15 compassion-inducing images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611430334">Oveis et al., 2010</xref>). Each image appeared for 4 s. The images depicted babies, homeless individuals, and victims of war and famine. Once all images had been displayed, participants were told that the task was complete, which cued them to stop regulating their emotions.</p>
<p>Participants then completed the 5-item Internalization subscale of the Self-Importance of Moral Identity scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611430334">Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002</xref>), which measures the degree to which people view morality as central to their identities. Participants were told to visualize someone who embodies nine characteristics—caring, compassionate, fair, friendly, generous, hardworking, helpful, honest, and kind—and then to rate how much they wanted to be like this person (e.g., “I strongly desire to have these characteristics”; α = .78 in the present study). Participants then completed a measure of moral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611430334">Shu et al., 2011</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797611430334">1</xref></sup> which included items reflecting the belief that moral rules can be violated when expedient (e.g., “Cheating is appropriate behavior because no one gets hurt,” “Sometimes getting ahead of the curve is more important than adhering to rules”; α = .70 in the present study).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We predicted that participants in the regulate-compassion condition would show either lower levels of moral identity or higher levels of moral flexibility than participants in the other two conditions. Although these variables showed a nonsignificant negative correlation in the regulate-distress condition (<italic>r</italic> = −.13, <italic>p</italic> = .50) and the experience-emotions condition (<italic>r</italic> = −.26, <italic>p</italic> = .13), they were positively correlated in the regulate-compassion condition (<italic>r</italic> = .36, <italic>p</italic> = .03); this finding suggests that regulating compassion created a conflict between moral identity and moral inflexibility. To examine this trade-off more systematically, we conducted two analyses of variance (ANOVAs) that varied whether moral identity or moral flexibility was the dependent variable or the moderating covariate. These were not mutually exclusive inferential analyses, but instead were separate ways of representing the trade-off implied by the correlational analysis.</p>
<p>In the first ANOVA, we examined the influence of condition (regulate compassion, regulate distress, experience emotions) on moral identity. We included moral flexibility as a covariate and tested its interaction with condition. There was a significant effect of condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 95) = 6.06, <italic>p</italic> = .003, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .11, but not of moral flexibility, <italic>F</italic>(1, 95) = 0.47, <italic>p</italic> = .50, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .01. The interaction between condition and moral flexibility was significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 95) = 4.90, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .09. Simple effects of regulating compassion were tested at one standard deviation above and below the mean of moral flexibility. Among participants high in moral flexibility, those in the regulate-compassion condition did not have lower mean ratings of moral identity than participants in the regulate-distress condition (<italic>p</italic> = .99) or the experience-emotions condition (<italic>p</italic> = .49; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611430334">Fig. 1a</xref>), and mean ratings in the latter two conditions did not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .67). But among participants low in moral flexibility, those in the regulate-compassion condition had lower mean ratings of moral identity compared with participants in the regulate-distress condition (<italic>p</italic> = .01) and the experience- emotions condition (<italic>p</italic> = .01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611430334">Fig. 1a</xref>). Mean ratings in these latter two conditions did not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .99). Thus, in the regulate-compassion condition, participants who reported lower levels of moral flexibility also reported lower levels of moral identity.</p>

<p>In the second ANOVA, we examined the influence of condition on moral flexibility. We included moral identity as a covariate and tested its interaction with condition. There was a marginally significant effect of condition, <italic>F</italic>(2, 95) = 2.94, <italic>p</italic> = .06, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .06, but not of moral identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 95) = 0.55, <italic>p</italic> = .46, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .01. The interaction between condition and moral identity was significant, <italic>F</italic>(2, 95) = 3.18, <italic>p</italic> = .05, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .06. Simple effects of regulating compassion were tested at one standard deviation above and below the mean of moral identity. Among participants low in moral identity, those in the regulate-compassion condition did not report different levels of moral flexibility than those in the regulate-distress condition (<italic>p</italic> = .71) or the experience-emotions condition (<italic>p</italic> = .72), and the latter two conditions did not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .99; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611430334">Fig. 1b</xref>). Among participants high in moral identity, those in the regulate-compassion condition had marginally higher levels of moral flexibility than those in the experience- emotions condition (<italic>p</italic> = .08), but not compared with those in the regulate-distress condition (<italic>p</italic> = .37; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611430334">Fig. 1b</xref>). Mean ratings in the latter two conditions did not differ significantly (<italic>p</italic> = .93). Thus, in the regulate-compassion condition, participants who reported higher levels of moral identity also reported greater moral flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797611430334">2</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many scholars have argued that compassion plays a central role in moral judgment and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611430334">Batson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611430334">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>), yet there are several situations in which people strive to avoid feeling compassion for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611430334">Cameron &amp; Payne, 2011</xref>). Although regulating compassion might appear to be cost free, the results of the study reported here suggest that regulating compassion entails costs to people’s moral self-concept. People cannot get away with stifling their compassion toward others, as it risks compromising their moral identities on the one hand or their moral principles on the other.</p>
<p>We theorized that regulating compassion would create an inconsistency between caring about morality (moral identity) and believing that moral rules should always be followed (moral inflexibility). Although higher moral identity is usually associated with lower moral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611430334">McFerran et al., 2010</xref>), asking participants to regulate their feelings of compassion resulted in higher moral identity being associated with greater moral flexibility. Consistent with research on dissonance reduction, our findings suggest that participants who regulate their compassion either devalue being moral or relax their beliefs about moral rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611430334">Shu et al., 2012</xref>). If compassion regulators retain high levels of moral identity, their moral flexibility increases. If they retain high levels of moral inflexibility, their moral identity decreases. Although many researchers have speculated that avoiding moral emotions can alter people’s moral self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611430334">Monin, Pizarro, &amp; Beer, 2007</xref>), our results are the first to demonstrate such effects. They are also the first to demonstrate that instructing people to regulate a specific discrete emotion can carry important downstream consequences.</p>
<p>Our research shows that compassion carries unique moral significance. Compassion has been deemed a “moral barometer” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611430334">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>, p. 366) because it attunes people to harm violations and informs them that they value the welfare of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611430334">Batson, Turk, Shaw, &amp; Klein, 1995</xref>). Suppressing compassion in particular appears to undermine moral identity and moral principles, which could influence moral judgments and moral behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611430334">Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611430334">Schlenker, 2008</xref>). Suppressing compassion might disrupt intrapersonal coordination among moral identity, moral judgment, and moral behavior. Although our research focused on the short-term dynamics of suppressing compassion, chronic compassion regulation might compromise moral sensibilities more fundamentally over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611430334">Kelman, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>The philosopher David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611430334">Hume (1777/1960)</xref> once described the sensible knave, a person who asked why people should heed their moral sentiments when those sentiments clash with self-interest. Regulating compassion is often seen as motivated by self-interest, as when people keep money for themselves rather than donate it, or turn their attention to something pleasant rather than focusing on the needs of someone less fortunate. Yet our research suggests that regulating compassion might actually work <italic>against</italic> self-interest by forcing trade-offs within the individual’s moral self-concept. Regulating compassion leads to a dilemma between sacrificing moral identity on the one hand and sacrificing moral principle on the other. If it is in people’s self-interest to feel compassion, then perhaps the sensible knave’s question is less sensible than it seems.</p>

<p>We conducted identical analyses comparing only the regulate-compassion and experience-emotions conditions. First, participants in the regulate-compassion condition showed less moral identity than those in the experience-emotions condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 9.02, <italic>p</italic> = .004, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .12, and we found an interaction between regulating compassion and moral flexibility, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 7.64, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .11. Regulating compassion reduced moral identity at one standard deviation below the mean of moral flexibility (<italic>p</italic> = .01) but not at one standard deviation above the mean (<italic>p</italic> = .24). Second, participants in the regulate-compassion condition showed greater moral flexibility than those in the experience-emotions condition, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 5.92, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .08, and we found an interaction between regulating compassion and moral identity, <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 6.52, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .09. Regulating compassion increased moral flexibility at one standard deviation above the mean of moral identity (<italic>p</italic> = .02) but not at one standard deviation below the mean (<italic>p</italic> = .30). These analyses comparing the regulate-compassion and experience-emotions conditions support the same conclusions as the primary analyses did.</p>
