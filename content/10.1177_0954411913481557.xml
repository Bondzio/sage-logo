<abstract>
<p>While total knee arthroplasty is useful for treating osteoarthritis of the knee, the success of this treatment depends on effective rehabilitation. The goal of this study was to develop an assistive device for post–total knee arthroplasty patients for walking rehabilitation and for shortening the hospitalization period. We developed a brace electronic assist system termed the knee assistive instrument for walking rehabilitation (KAI-R) to illustrate the need for training during postoperative rehabilitation. Sixteen osteoarthritis patients (1 male and 15 females; average age 68.9 years) who underwent total knee arthroplasty were analyzed before operation and 2–4 weeks after operation, and 25 healthy individuals (14 males and 11 females; average age 26.2 years) formed the control group. Based on the pre- and postoperative data on peak knee flexion angle, foot height, and walking velocity, we developed the KAI-R, which consists of an assistive mechanism for the knee joint, a hip joint support system, and a foot pressure sensor system and is driven by a CPU board that generates the walking pattern. We then tested the walking gait in seven healthy volunteers with and without KAI-R assistance. KAI-R increased the peak flexion angle of the knee and foot height in all seven volunteers; their range of motion of the knee joint was increased. However, KAI-R also decreased the walking velocity of subjects, which was explained by reaction delay and slightly compromised physical balance, which was caused by wearing the KAI-R. KAI-R is useful for gait improvement. In future studies, KAI-R will be investigated in a clinical trial for its ability for walking rehabilitation in post–total knee arthroplasty patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common type of arthritis or degenerative joint disease. The disease most commonly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals, but it sometimes occurs in younger people as a result of injury or overuse. Patients affected by knee OA suffer from pain and loss of function. Age and obesity are important risk factors for OA; therefore, its prevalence is rising rapidly in the United States, Japan, and so on, due to both increased life expectancy and the growing obesity epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411913481557">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411913481557">2</xref></sup> The main symptoms of knee OA are knee pain and diminished knee function (range of motion (RoM) and muscle strength), which may affect the ability to undertake physical activity. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a frequently performed and effective procedure that relieves knee pain and improves the functional status of patients with end-stage knee OA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411913481557">3</xref></sup> Most people who undergo TKA show marked improvements in knee function and experience reduced pain as compared with their preoperative condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411913481557">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411913481557">5</xref></sup> The recovery of functional ability varies with patients; nevertheless, many patients experience significant improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411913481557">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411913481557">7</xref></sup> A residual limitation in patients’ functional performance has become an important focus of postoperative care. The primary concern of surgery candidates remains the time required for recovery and whether they can completely recover normal motion range and strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411913481557">8</xref></sup> Although patients have improved gait speed, cadence, and stride length after the operation, they cannot often match the gait characteristics of age-matched healthy individuals, even several years after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954411913481557">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most OA patients do not recover normal knee functions after TKA because abnormal preoperative gait patterns tend to be retained after surgery, even if severe gonalgia is eliminated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954411913481557">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954411913481557">11</xref></sup> Coutts et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913481557">12</xref></sup> were the first to introduce the use of a continuous passive motion (CPM) device for recovery therapy immediately after TKA surgery. The CPM device has been widely used as an adjunct to physiotherapy (PT) after TKA for the past 25 years with many published studies recommending CPM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913481557">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913481557"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913481557"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913481557">15</xref></sup> We have developed a new wearable walking-type CPM device for postsurgery walking rehabilitation, termed “knee assistive instrument for walking rehabilitation (KAI-R).” Some of the other robotic lower extremity rehabilitation devices have been developed, but those take up a large amount of space or mounting is complicated compared to the KAI-R.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954411913481557">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954411913481557"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954411913481557">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Cable assisting devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954411913481557">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954411913481557">20</xref></sup> for rehabilitation have been developed using a concept that is different from that of the robotic devices. An advantage of this method is that it can correspond to various types of rehabilitation by replacing the end effector. However, this method also uses equipment bulkier than the KAI-R. Furthermore, it cannot correct the gait. The design for KAI-R is different from that of any assistive device reported so far.</p>
<p>We have developed and designed a new control system, based on the results of our previous studies. The gait cycle is divided into eight periods: initial foot contact, loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance, pre-swing, early swing, mid-swing and late swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913481557">Figure 1</xref>). For each period, the control system operates the motor of the KAI-R in order to support the knee joint flexion/extension.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to determine the problems encountered in walking by post-TKA patients in order to improve the control pattern of KAI-R and to verify whether the control system is useful for improving gait. For this purpose, we compared walking parameters in healthy subjects and pre- and post-TKA patients and examined change in gait of subjects with attached KAI-R. KAI-R is still in its development stages. Since the safety of using this device in elderly subjects has not yet been proven, we conducted this study on young healthy adults as a preliminary analysis.</p>

<title>Monitoring the gait pattern before and after TKA</title>
<p>In general, visual evaluation is based on data obtained by ascertaining the body’s motion two-dimensionally, along the <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> axes. In this study, we have defined that <italic>X</italic>-<italic>Y</italic> plane is equal to the sagittal plane of the subject, <italic>X</italic>-axis is horizontal, and <italic>Y</italic>-axis is vertical. As a minimum requirement, the observer must evaluate the stride length and step time as well as motion at the pelvis, hip, knee, and the ankle–foot joint during the gait cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954411913481557">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The kinematic parameters used to evaluate gait progress after TKA are time–distance and joint angle measurements. Their diagnostic value has been greatly enhanced by the analysis of progress based on each patient’s initial status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954411913481557">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954411913481557"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954411913481557">24</xref></sup> However, few studies documented the progress of patients over a period of at least 1 month after TKA surgery. In this study, the kinetic parameters of gait were monitored in 16 patients before and at the time of discharge or just before the patient was transferred, that is, 2–4 weeks after they underwent TKA (1 male and 15 female patients, age range: 58–84 years, average age: 68.9 years). In addition, we measured the same parameters in 25 young healthy volunteers (14 male and 11 female subjects, age range: 20–34 years, average age: 26.2 years) who served as the control group. We could not find age-matched controls because it was difficult to find healthy age-matched controls in the same age group as the patients. These subjects were used to acquire preliminary data to design the KAI-R. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants before the study, and the ethical committee of Kofu Medical Hospital approved this study.</p>
<p>Two light-reflecting markers were attached to the lateral surfaces of the subject’s thighs (distal 5 cm of the greater trochanter and proximal 5 cm of the lateral epicondyle), two on the lateral surfaces of their lower legs (distal 5 cm of the head of fibula and proximal 5 cm of the lateral malleolus), and two on the lateral surfaces of their feet (on little toe and heel). The subjects performed free walking in front of a high-speed camera for a distance of 6 m and repeated the movement three times. The photographs were captured by a data acquisition system (PLXLOGGER-PL1; ShinanoKenshi Co. Ltd, Japan), and specialized analysis software (Move Tr32(2D) version 5.20; Library, Japan) was used to analyze the data in a computer (HP Compaq nx6120) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954411913481557">Figure 2</xref>). For calibration, we placed a marker at the distance of 1 m on the subjects walking path. We corrected the photographs using this marker and analyzed at 60 Hz. We calculated the knee joint angle using the relative position of the markers that were placed on the thigh and leg; furthermore, we used the foot markers for foot height, walking velocity, and stride length.</p>

<title>Design of a KAI-R</title>
<p>An assistive robot has been developed on the basis of the results of analysis for cadence, stride length, and knee and hip joint flexion angles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954411913481557">25</xref></sup> This robot is equipped with a mechanism to assist the motion involved in knee flexion, a hip joint support mechanism, a shoe with foot sensor to detect walking status, and braces.

<p>The foot pressure sensor employs conductive rubber whose resistance changes with pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954411913481557">26</xref></sup> This sensor can detect the state of heel contact with surfaces. The contact pressure is detected as voltage, and when the detected voltage exceeds the specified threshold, the foot is registered as having left the ground. This threshold can be adjusted freely according to the state of the patient’s recovery or rehabilitation goals. The hip potentiometer converts the hip rotation into a voltage in a manner similar to the foot sensor. When the detected voltage increases to above the specified threshold, the potentiometer confirms that the hip joint has rotated to the configured angle. The total weight of the KAI-R is 10.2 kg. The weight of one half of the device from the thigh up to the foot is 3.1 kg, while the part of the trunk weighs 4.0 kg.</p>
<sec id="section5-0954411913481557">
<title>Knee joint assisting mechanism</title>
<p>In general, the knee joint rotates from 0° to 130° while walking on flat and sloping surfaces. During middle range flexion, the knee joint rotates by gliding back to the bone contact region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913481557">Figure 4(a)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954411913481557">27</xref></sup> The motion that occurs at the center of the bone is defined as the “roll-back” motion. When the knee joint of KAI-R uses a uniaxial gear system, the KAI-R got dislocated from the correct position. Therefore, we proposed the design of a knee motion assist mechanism using grooved cams and one noncircular gear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913481557">Figure 4(b)</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954411913481557">28</xref></sup> This gear–cam system is capable of reproducing the roll-back motion, even though it is composed of a small number of parts (only four parts). This shape was designed by our previous studies using subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954411913481557">29</xref></sup> We briefly describe below the method of design in the following text. In different subjects, we had set up a marker on the outside of the lower limbs, and then we recorded the movement of the knee joint using a high-speed camera. To analyze the image, we have elucidated the direction and distance of the roll-back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954411913481557">Figure 4(c)</xref>). Through this study, we found out that the roll-back motion occurs between 20° and 100°. At other angles, the knee joint rotates without gliding. We designed the grooved cams and one noncircular gear to this locus. By a signal from the control system which will be described later, the motor moved the driving gear of the gear–cam system. KAI-R can be used to bend the knee joint of subjects smoothly, imitating the roll-back motion.</p>

<caption>
<p>(a) Knee joint rotation. In general, the knee joint rotates within 0°–130° when walking on flat and sloping surfaces. During middle range flexion, the knee joint rotates with gliding toward the back, with the femur and tibia in contact. For example, when the position of tibia is at point 1, imaginary rotation center is at the position of point 1 in femur. As the tibia bends, imaginary rotation center moves. (b) The prototype knee motion assist device. This device consists of two grooved cams and one noncircular gear. The noncircular gear profile is generated using two circular curves and an arbitrary curve. The presence of a grooved cam at the center conforms to the imaginary rotation center on the leg side. In general, the rotation center of the noncircular gear is almost fixed; however, in this case, the rotation center of this gear moves along this groove. Then, the other grooved cam and a noncircular gear drive the leg with a roll-back motion. (c) Relationship between the knee joint rotation angle and the displacement or the imaginary rotation center.</p>

<title>Hip joint support mechanism</title>
<p>To eliminate the influence of mechanism weight, we developed the hip joint support mechanism. A suspension brace linked up with the waist belt and a hip central coordination mechanism corresponded to the center of the hip joint. For smooth fitting, we used detachable magnet ball joints that could be suspended in the joint mechanism. The femoral length adjustment mechanism was able to regulate the length of the device according to the height of the subjects. In addition, the spherical structure of the joint could adapt to flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation, adduction, and abduction in six directions in the human hip joint. The angle detection forks across the neck of the ball joint only in the direction of flexion and extension. So, internal rotation, external rotation, adduction, and abduction of the hip joint are eliminated. The angle detection fork moves the potentiometer via spur gears. With this mechanism, only flexion and extension of the hip joint are transmitted to the potentiometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954411913481557">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>The KAI-R control system was designed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954411913481557">Figure 7</xref>. We input a state of heel contact and a hip joint rotation angle using potentiometers in order to easily adjust the sensitivity and the foot height.</p>

<p>Control system. To adjust the sensitivity and the foot height easily, the state of heel contact and hip joint rotation angle can be monitored using potentiometers. In this control system, we used a foot sensor to detect the walking status and control the operation. Using these signal timings, a CPU unit commands the motor driver using the pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. It is driven by a DC motor attached with the knee joint.</p>

<p>In this control system, we used a foot sensor to detect the walking status and control the knee assist operation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913481557">Figure 1</xref>, when the heel comes into contact with the floor at initial foot contact during a gait cycle, a foot sensor starts to monitor the heel status. When the heel leaves the ground, the motor immediately starts flexing the knee joint. At termination of the early swing phase, a hip joint movement occurs to aid the knee joint to raise the leg to the required height. Then, the motor drives the knee joint to extend until the end of the late swing phase. The KAI-R action flowchart for the right foot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954411913481557">Figure 8</xref>. Initially, the motor speed is changed to the maximum limit D<sub>0p</sub>, which holds position in the direction of knee flexion. This limit is the motor speed that reduces the influence of friction loss in this actuator. This value is measured in the forward or reverse direction. When the knee is flexed to the required angle, the motor speed is changed to the maximum speed D<sub>1</sub> with constant increment in the velocity (D<sub>1</sub>; a forward maximum rotational speed of this motor). D<sub>1</sub> is maintained for the required duration and is then reduced to zero with constant velocity decrement. The magnitude and duration of D<sub>1</sub> affect the maximum knee flexion angle and gait cycle, and the increment and decrement of the speeds affect the knee flexion velocity. The flexion of the patient’s hip joint was detected using an encoder in order to guide the patients to adopt a regular walking gait. An extension motion is initiated after the knee joint moves up to the required height. Therefore, the hip joint angle is detected, so that when it flexes to the required angle, the knee extension assist can be terminated.</p>

When the heel leaves the ground, the motor starts to flex the knee joint immediately, and when the section early swing is terminated, it results in a hip joint motion to help the knee joint move up to the required height. Then, the motor drives extension of the knee joint until the section late swing is terminated.</p>

<p>In addition, extension is similar to flexion except for the direction of rotation. When the knee joint is extended to the required angle, the motor speed is changed to the maximum speed D<sub>2</sub> (D<sub>2</sub>, a reverse maximum rotational speed of this motor). Also, the concept of velocity increment or decrement is the same as that in the case of flexion.</p>

<title>Verification of the usefulness of the prototype system</title>
<p>We tested the KAI-R prototype developed on the basis of our proposed design and control. The prototype system was tested on seven healthy volunteers whose ages ranged from 21 to 33 years. We have not performed the initial testing on the elderly because this population is at risk for falls, and the safety of using this device is yet to be proven; we have therefore tested this device on young people in this study.</p>
<p>Two markers were attached on the lateral surfaces of their thighs, two on the lateral surfaces of their lower legs, and two on the lateral surfaces of their feet. The walking movement of the post-TKA patient was similar to static walking. First, the subjects were asked to perform static walking along a straight path (static walking is the manner of walking during which the center of gravity shifts between the right and left foot with each step taken. This ensures the body is balanced on one foot before another step is taken forward) for 6 m, and this task was repeated three times. Then, the subjects wore the KAI-R device and completed the same 6-m walking task three times. We used a high-speed camera to photograph patients walking with and without the KAI-R system. All gait parameters were analyzed using the computer analysis system described in the section “Monitoring the gait pattern before and after TKA.”</p>

<title>Monitoring the gait pattern before and after TKA</title>
<p>We measured the peak knee flexion, foot height, walking velocity, and stride length of all healthy subjects, as well as all OA patients before and after TKA. Data analysis showed that the peak knee flexion (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913481557">Figure 9(a)</xref>), foot height (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954411913481557">Figure 9(b)</xref>), and walking velocity (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411913481557">Figure 10(a)</xref>) of OA patients were lower than those in the healthy subjects before and after surgery.

All together, these data suggest that (1) the hip joint always flexes after the knee flexion (data not shown); (2) heel or toe of one side off the ground represents the beginning of the gait; and (3) when the hip or knee flexion angle is increased, a lower limb can be raised higher. Based on these results, we designed our walking assistive device.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is suggested that both peak knee flexion and foot height can be increased by using KAI-R, which is very important for not only increasing knee motion but also preventing patients from falling. On the other hand, the slightly decreased walking velocity with KAI-R may be due to reaction delay and nonconformity of physical balance adjustment as a result of wearing the walking assist system.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Knee OA results in painful and unstable knee joints. Knee replacement surgery is a useful approach for treating this condition. CPM is a mechanical method that ensures that the knee performs regular movement. The movement is passive, that is, the subject’s knee is moved by the machine through a preset RoM. Milne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913481557">14</xref></sup> reported that CPM combined with PT may offer beneficial results as compared to PT alone in the short-term rehabilitation following TKA. Currently, however, the usefulness of CPM is still under debate. Many independent studies recommend using CPM for rehabilitation after TKA;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954411913481557">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954411913481557"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954411913481557"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954411913481557">15</xref></sup> however, there are others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0954411913481557">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954411913481557"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0954411913481557">32</xref></sup> that found little value in CPM. Moreover, knee OA patients suffer from impaired walking for many years, and it is observed that these patients find it very difficult to regain normal walking status. Therefore, we developed a CPM device for walking assistance, namely, KAI-R, with the main objective of providing valid functional exercise and ensuring that the subjects learn to walk after the surgery.</p>
<p>After Winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0954411913481557">33</xref></sup> first reported that the knee naturally begins to flex before toe-off, other researchers began to employ this finding as a control system. Irby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0954411913481557">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0954411913481557">35</xref></sup> devised an electromechanical joint control device with a wrap spring clutch. This device restrained knee joint flexion at heel strike through the stance phase of the gait and also permitted free knee flexion during the gait swing phase. Yakimovich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0954411913481557">36</xref></sup> developed a knee–ankle–foot orthosis that allows free knee motion during swing and other non–weight-bearing activities and inhibits knee flexion while allowing knee extension during weight bearing. Based on the previous studies, we developed and designed a new control system. At the start of the terminal stance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913481557">Figure 1</xref>), when the heel leaves the ground before toe-off, it is considered the first step of walking, and the motor is initiated to assist knee joint flexion. In addition, when the heel strikes the ground, body balance must be regulated to adapt to the change in the center of gravity, and at this time, any outside intervention may affect the body’s stability. Therefore, we selected the end of terminal stance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411913481557">Figure 1</xref>), that is, as soon as the heel lifted off the ground, as the point when KAI-R induces flexion of the knee joint. This would effectively prevent knees from locking and also ensure that a more natural walking gait is achieved.</p>
<p>McMillan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0954411913481557">37</xref></sup> reported fewer extraneous pelvic movements and increased smoothness of pelvic movement on both sides when walking with a stance-control knee–ankle–foot orthosis (SCKAFO). Irby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0954411913481557">38</xref></sup> observed a reduction in the maximum pelvic obliquity in subjects who had used SCKAFO only for a short period of time and an overall reduction in the pelvic obliquity RoM when walking with SCKAFO assistance. While Irby et al. measured the frontal plane hip motion, no improvement was reported with SCKAFO use. Yakimovich et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0954411913481557">39</xref></sup> reported only small improvements in the hip and pelvis, and the changes did not occur consistently among their subjects. It is easier to use the device when the weight load on the waist is lighter than the weight load on the limb. In order to reduce the weight on the waist, we have developed a waist band with a hip joint support mechanism. The spherical structure of the joint could adapt to flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation, adduction, and abduction in six directions of the human hip joint. In addition, a potentiometer was used to detect flexion or extension of the hip joint. For rehabilitating the subjects (patients) to achieve normal walking gait, we measured the hip angle to control knee extension, which would not start until hip flexion reached a predetermined angle, to raise the knee in an upward direction before extension occurred. In the future, we will investigate improvement of pelvic motion with our KAI-R system.</p>
<p>Static walking is widely used as a robotic concept in the field. In our study, we noted that the regular as well as KAI-R-assisted (static) walking velocity of post-TKA patients was very slow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411913481557">Figure 10(b)</xref>). Our preliminary findings show that the walking velocity, stride length, and knee joint flexion angles of subjects are similar to that of post-TKA patients if they perform static walking (data not shown). Therefore, we instructed the subjects to perform static walking. According to our results, all the seven subjects achieved improvement of peak knee flexion and foot height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913481557">Figure 12(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954411913481557">(b)</xref>) when walking with the KAI-R compared to without it. KAI-R may also be useful for preventing falls. On the other hand, although the seven subjects successfully imitated the static walk, with walking velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411913481557">Figure 13(b)</xref>) almost the same as that of post-TKA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954411913481557">Figure 10(b)</xref>), the reduction in the walking velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954411913481557">Figure 13(b)</xref>) observed in individuals walking with KAI-R assistance has not improved to our expectations. In order to understand the reasons for this, in the future, we need to improve the measurement method.</p>
<p>Our research has some disadvantages. Modern gait analyses rely on three interdependent disciplines: visual observation, quantitative measurement, and biomechanical analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0954411913481557">40</xref></sup> However, our gait analysis consisted of only visual observation and quantitative measurement. We will apply biomechanical analysis and electromyography studies in our future investigations. In addition, not all the OA patients were able to walk (both before and after operation) normally with heel strike and heel off the ground; therefore, our control system requires further improvement, such as inclusion of a heel and knee joint combination control in the stance phase, in order to reduce the chances of concussion when the heel comes into contact with the ground and in order to achieve better control. The limitations of this study include a significant difference of age between the two groups; also, the subjects were not gender and anthropometrically matched. Furthermore, we did not conduct a survey to find out the subject’s opinion about the device.</p>
<p>In future, after we finish developing a lighter KAI-R and verify its safety, the subsequent trial will be conducted on well-matched groups of subjects and would include a survey regarding subject’s opinions to confirm our findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have developed a new wearable walking-type CPM device for postsurgery walking rehabilitation, named KAI-R based on the pre- and postoperative data from post-TKA patients. From the findings obtained after testing it on healthy young volunteers, we think that KAI-R may be useful for gait improvement. Future clinical studies will be required to evaluate its usefulness for rehabilitation in patients who have undergone TKA.</p>
