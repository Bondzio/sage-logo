<p>This edited volume emerged as a collective written response to the Virginia Tech shootings of April 16, 2007. As a reflection on that tragic day and the various ways that the Virginia Tech community responded to this crisis, the book’s contributors explore how collaboration can promote adaptive and transformative resilience in light of crisis or traumatic change. The contributors do so in a way that is broadly inclusive by incorporating cases that differ dramatically in terms of geography, temporality, process, and participation. While the breadth does allow for an exciting read, the introduction to an entirely new case in each chapter, which is generally on a different subject, often on a new continent, and always with a slightly different understanding of collaborative resilience can be somewhat dizzying for the intrepid reader. Nevertheless, the individual cases are fascinating in their own right and help shed light on the various ways in which the resilience concept is being used in the planning and natural resources fields.</p>
<p>
<italic>Collaborative Resilience</italic> is broadly framed as an exercise exploring the tension that exists between planning and natural resource scholarship. Its editor, Bruce Evan Goldstein, suggests that this tension is inherently productive; it informs “communicative resilience,” which he argues “is not the intersection between these two fields but rather a product of their differences” (p. 360). Tensions regarding each field’s assumptions about practice, theory, and methodology are a common theme throughout the book and are discussed extensively in the first three chapters.</p>
<p>To say that this book is ambitious is an understatement; it makes three important contributions. First, it strives to advance resilience theory for planners and natural resource scholars by investigating the idea of “communicative resilience.” Though it is slightly confusing to see Goldstein and other contributors use collaborative and communicative resilience interchangeably without a meaningful explanation for doing so, the notion that collective or collaborative solutions can be helpful in resolving “wicked” (chap. 8) and other problems is a salient point that is evident throughout. Such contributions are particularly evident in the first section of the book, which includes rich discussions of climate change resilient communities (chap. 6), <italic>slow</italic>practices and social-ecological embeddedness (chap. 5), and the adoption of whole farm plans to prevent disease outbreaks (chap. 3).</p>
<p>Second, it explores the relatively straightforward idea that inclusive efforts and collaborative processes may lead to increased community resilience by fostering trust and empathy, and by cultivating symbiotic relationships. The majority of the book’s chapters support this idea, but Kaufman’s (chap. 4) discussion of the limits to individual cognition in times of crisis and Zellner et al.’s (chap. 3) analysis of collaborative efforts in a Chicago homelessness initiative are particularly poignant contributions to this effect.</p>
<p>Third, and perhaps most importantly, the book dabbles with an interesting counterpoint to the aforementioned presumption that inclusion inherently increases community resilience. A small number of the chapters put forth the argument that, in the pursuit of collaborative resilience, it is precisely the exclusion of certain stakeholders that may lead to increased community resilience. The “shadow network” that emerged in response to a forestry crisis in Northern Ontario (chap. 13) excludes corporate provincial authorities by design. Similarly, the Fire Learning Network that Goldstein and Butler describe (chap. 14) is actively geared toward fire managers rather than land management agencies, the latter of which they argue has contributed to a long-standing rigidity trap (p. 339). Though it is not a central theme of the book, the exclusion argument is briefly acknowledged in the concluding chapter when Goldstein suggests that such an approach might also be relevant in other cases where collaborators are mobilizing to enact change in “durable institutions that are dysfunctional and inequitable” (p. 370).</p>
<p>The fact that community resilience is so context-specific and so difficult to define is a shortcoming that the contributors to this book readily acknowledge. Arthur et al. (chap. 11) use the concept of adaptive comanagement to remind us that many words, including resilience, are in peril of becoming what Cornwall (2007) has called a buzzword and fuzzword. Other resilience scholars have similarly grappled with the potential fuzziness of the word resilience (Pendall, Foster, and Cowell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412212449451">2010</xref>), which is a problem that is still not overtly resolved in this book.</p>
<p>One thing that the authors do quite well on the whole is to solidify the increasingly accepted notion, at least in the eyes of many planning scholars (Christopherson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412212449451">2010</xref>; Simmie and Martin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412212449451">2010</xref>), that resilience is not simply bouncing back to a prechallenge state. To its credit, the book furthers the idea that adaptive resilience is instead the capacity to anticipate, respond to, and <italic>learn from</italic> crisis, which is a sentiment that largely resonates throughout most of the chapters. Among the more interesting discussions of adaptive resilience is Randolph’s (chap. 6) discussion of creating climate change resilient communities. As Randolph rightly points out, “Resilience focused on bouncing back to the status quo may actually impede necessary adaptation to climate change” (p. 130). Instead, his research suggests, like many others in this volume, that resilience scholars and practitioners ought to be more concerned with building social capacity to prepare for (and cope with) change, rather than falling into the disaster-relief-rebuild-disaster (D-R-R-D) trap (p. 133). A key contribution of this book is that it urges us to look beyond early definitions of resilience in order to consider the other ways of resilience, where collaboration is emphasized and alternative framings are uncovered.</p>
