<p>The development of immunizations is considered 1 of the 10 great accomplishments of public health<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059840513494578">1</xref>
</sup> in the first decade of the 21st century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513494578"><italic>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly</italic>, 2011</xref>). School nurses are inextricably associated with the substantial declines in vaccine-preventable diseases, and five of the original research articles in this issue provide evidence of the actual and potential school nursing contributions.</p>
<p>Since 2000, there have been declines in diagnosed cases and hospitalizations as well as in morbidity related to vaccine-preventable diseases. For those of us who have been practicing in school nursing and public health for years, we have seen recommended vaccines increase to 17 targeted diseases in the United States including tetanus, diphtheria, cellular pertussis, as well as rotavirus, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate, herpes zoster, pneumococcal conjugate, and human papilloma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840513494578"><italic>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly</italic>, 2011</xref>). Economists have demonstrated that vaccination of every birth cohort in the United States prevents nearly 42,000 deaths, 20 million cases of disease and saves approximately US$14 billion in direct costs and US$69 billion in societal costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840513494578">Zhou, 2011</xref>). Mortality from varicella has declined by 97% from 0.65/million population (1990–1994) to 0.02/million population (2005–2007). Average age-adjusted mortality (deaths per million population) from hepatitis A also declined significantly, from 0.38 in the prevaccine period (1990–1995) to 0.26 during 2000–2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840513494578">Marin, Meissner, &amp; Seward, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>With the advent of immunization registries across the country, data are available to evaluate immunization levels. Immunization information systems (IIS) are bound by the same confidentiality policies as health information systems, are population based, and record immunization information that is provided by providers in specific regions. The advantage of an IIS system is that it provides immunization histories to providers to guide client vaccinations. Further, IIS serves to inform surveillance and immunization programs at the population level thus guiding public health action that can ultimately reduce vaccine-preventable disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Despite the advances in immunizations and immunization tracking systems aimed at minimizing disease, many parents seek personal exemptions for their children. One study revealed that parents are concerned about immunization safety and their right to determine what immunizations, if any, their children will receive. Parents also were not convinced that immunizations prevent disease. Many parents claim service delivery issues are difficult to deal with, consequently the personal exemption is a method to avoid those difficulties. Other parents are still concerned about the relationship of immunizations and chronic disease such as autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Parents are concerned about overwhelming their child’s immune system with multiple immunizations given at once or the risk of adverse side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840513494578">Luthy, Beckstrand, Callister, &amp; Cahoon, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Washington State personal exemptions rank among the highest in the country. An evaluation study revealed that immunization rates were better than school records indicated when those records were compared against the state IIS. Immunization rates were further improved when school-based immunization clinics were implemented. Health department staff recommended strategies to open IIS information to school authorities and to address the widespread use of personal exemptions for convenience safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840513494578">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In most of the articles addressing issues related to immunizations, the role of the school nurse is evident. While historically, school nurses have managed surveillance of the school population’s immunization status, new collaborations are being developed to address system problems that are a barrier to maintaining adequate herd immunity. Health departments across the country have partnered with school districts to improve immunization rates. The IIS provide data that can empower school nurses to have accurate assessments that can inform subsequent strategies for improvement. School nurses can partner with health departments and other sources to eliminate personal exemptions related to convenience. What power! Demands on school nursing time are enormous, but the decline in the burden of communicable disease is paramount.</p>
<p>Why am I still interested in publishing articles about immunizations? Because the need is so great and there is not one answer to addressing the problem. I recently attended a town hall meeting in my community to discuss immunizations. A pediatrician representing a large group practice presented epidemiologic information about the prevalence of pertussis and the concern for herd immunity of other immunization-preventable diseases. He presented the information on immunization safety and talked about the report that proved the study linking immunizations to autism as fraud. Another pediatrician presented his view that parents have the ultimate right to determine what health care interventions their children receive. When asked about his own children, he reported that he does not have them immunized. When a person asked if any of his children had pertussis, he responded that his 7-year-old daughter did and that he thought it was good for her system to fight the disease. I asked him how much school his child missed. His answer was shocking. He said that she missed 8 weeks because of the secondary pneumonia that she developed.</p>
<p>The pediatric community supports immunization programs, but dissidents within and outside of the health care community pose great challenges for school nurses. The plethora of articles published in <italic>The Journal of School Nursing</italic> can serve as a base for school nurses to develop strategies to enhance immunization rates and seize the power they have to inform the school community about the ethics of mass immunizations through every channel of communication. Further, collaboration opportunities abound, and with the synergistic efforts of primary care providers, health departments and school nurses, school children can be protected.</p>
