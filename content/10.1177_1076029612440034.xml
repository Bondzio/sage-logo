<abstract>
<p>Contrary to well-recognized bleeding diathesis in chronic liver disease, thrombotic events can occur in these patients due to reduction or loss of synthesis of anticoagulant proteins. Forty-seven consecutive patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) were investigated for activity of protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and factor V Leiden mutation. Forty-two (89.4%) patients had low levels of at least 1 while 33 (70.2%) patients were deficient for all anticoagulant proteins studied. Forty-six (97.9%) patients were negative for factor V Leiden mutation. The deficiencies were more marked in hepatitis C virus–positive patients and patients with model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score &gt;15. Six (12.8%) patients had portal vein thrombosis (PVT), and all had diminished protein S activity. In conclusions, deficiency of anticoagulant proteins occur in early phase of chronic liver disease. The severity of deficiency is proportional to the severity of liver disease. Despite the high prevalence of hypercoagulability, the incidence of PVT is low. Further studies with larger cohort of patients are needed to support these conclusions and to study other associated factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The regulation of blood coagulation is dependent on a complex interplay between procoagulant, anticoagulant, and fibrinolytic proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029612440034">1</xref>

Hence, hepatic insufficiency is not only accompanied by numerous changes in the hemostatic system secondary to reduction in protein synthesis but also due to dysfunction in clearance of activated hemostatic proteins and protein inhibitor complexes from the circulation. The resulting clinical state (bleeding or thrombosis) will be determined by type of complex hemostatic mechanisms which predominates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029612440034">1</xref>

<p>The aims of this study were (1) to examine the prevalence and degree of deficiency of anticoagulant proteins in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), (2) to determine the correlation between the degree of deficiency and severity of liver disease, and (3) to examine the impact of anticoagulant protein deficiency on the prevalence of PVT.</p>

<sec id="section2-1076029612440034" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>In this study, we retrospectively examined 47 patients with ESLD that underwent hypercoagulable workup at our institution between January 2010 and December 2010. The institutional review board approved the study.</p>
<p>Clinical data points coded for analysis included baseline demographics, etiology of liver disease, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. Only 1 patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis and none had pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>Routine comprehensive metabolic and hematological parameters included PT/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time. The hypercoagulation workup consisted of activity of protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and factor V Leiden mutation. Routine imaging included color Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen to exclude HCC and PVT.</p>
<sec id="section3-1076029612440034">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise specified. Comparisons were made using chi-square tests for categorical variables. Unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the means. SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Illinois) statistical software was used for analysis and differences were considered significant when <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hypercoagulability plays an important role in many aspects of acute and chronic liver disease. An average patient with liver failure may remain in hemostatic balance despite prolonged routine coagulation tests. Since both procoagulant and anticoagulant are affected in liver disease, the abnormalities of latter are not well reflected in the current routine coagulation testing, and their potential role remains underrecognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029612440034">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076029612440034"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076029612440034">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Proteins C and S are vitamin K-dependent proteins, while antithrombin is a nonvitamin K-dependent glycoprotein synthesized mainly by hepatocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1076029612440034">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1076029612440034">13</xref></sup> During acute or chronic liver disease, their concentrations decrease concomitantly with the other coagulation factors, mainly due to reduced synthesis. In the present cohort, 70.2% patients were deficient for all anticoagulant proteins. Protein C was the most common and severely affected anticoagulant protein. Tripodi et al reported the similar conclusions that the hypercoagulability in patients with cirrhosis is due to the increased levels of factor VIII and decreased levels of protein C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1076029612440034">14</xref></sup> Surprisingly, more than 70% of our patients with deficient anticoagulant proteins had MELD score ≤15 and INR &lt;1.5. This is in contrast to earlier reports suggesting the deficiency of anticoagulant proteins as an indicator of advanced liver disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076029612440034">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1076029612440034"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1076029612440034">3</xref></sup> In addition, it is certain that the remaining 27% patients with MELD &gt;15 also have had these deficiencies during early stages of liver disease. We agree that the levels of both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins decline as liver disease progresses. But the preliminary results of our study indicate that the decline in plasma activity of anticoagulant proteins actually occurs much earlier and constitute an early disturbance of the coagulation system in patients with chronic liver disease.</p>
<p>Consistent with the current prevalence of HCV infection in the United States, 73% patients with deficient anticoagulant proteins in our study had HCV-related ESLD. Interestingly, in patients with chronic hepatitis C, concomitant reduction in plasma levels of antithrombin, protein C, and/or protein S has been consistently associated with more severe fibrosis stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1076029612440034">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1076029612440034">11</xref></sup> It may be prudent to comment that ongoing necroinflammatory activity inherent to HCV may further contribute to more severe deficiency of anticoagulant proteins in the patients with HCV compared with non-HCV patients.</p>
<p>It is known that the incidence of thrombotic events increases with the increase in severity of cirrhosis, being less than 1% in patients with compensated cirrhosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1076029612440034">15</xref></sup> but ranges from 8% to 25% in candidates for liver transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1076029612440034">16</xref></sup> In the present study, despite a deficiency of natural anticoagulant proteins in 70.2% patients, the overall prevalence of PVT was 12.8%. This verified the fact that thrombosis in liver disease is multifactorial, which include poor flow, vasculopathy associated with a chronic inflammatory state, and the reduced synthesis of the natural anticoagulant proteins. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor concentration decreases in advanced liver disease, and this may also contribute to PVT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1076029612440034">17</xref></sup> Unexplainably, all patients with PVT had a deficiency of protein S, while 66.6% patients were deficient for all 3 anticoagulant proteins. In addition, 66.6% of the patients with PVT had MELD score ≤15. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein S activity have been associated with venous and less commonly arterial thromboses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1076029612440034">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1076029612440034">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This initial study is retrospective and entails certain limitations including small sample size and lack of randomization, necessitating validation of findings with a larger patient population using prospective methodology. The next step would be to follow anticoagulant protein levels in patients after liver transplantation. The findings of the present study also led us to consider whether we should routinely investigate the activity of anticoagulant proteins in patients with chronic liver disease as an early sign of decompensation. However, until more data are available, PT represents the best answer.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Based on the findings of present study, we consider that deficiency of anticoagulant proteins occur in early phase of chronic liver disease, even before prolongation of PT. The severity of deficiency was proportional to the severity of liver disease. Patients with HCV-related ESLD had greater deficiency of anticoagulant proteins, probably due to ongoing necroinflammatory process. Despite a high prevalence of deficiency of anticoagulant proteins, PVT was found only in 12.8% patients. Activity of protein S was deficient in all patients with PVT. Further studies with larger cohort of patients are needed to support these conclusions.</p>
