<abstract>
<p>It is an important hypothesis of terror management theory that death thoughts are suppressed immediately following a mortality salience treatment but that, after a short delay during which suppression ceases, death thoughts become more accessible. Although there is much indirect empirical support for this idea, there are few direct tests. Our goal was to test this hypothesis with simple experiments. Thus, after mortality was made salient, death thought accessibility was measured immediately or after a delay. The results contradicted the prediction that death thought accessibility should be higher in the delay condition than in the no delay condition.</p>

<p>According to terror management theory (TMT), humans are in a unique position because they are the only animals that are aware of their own mortality. The pairing of an instinctive desire for continued life coupled with the awareness of the inevitability of death creates the potential for paralyzing terror (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611432938">Becker, 1973</xref>; Greenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611432938">1990</xref>; Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Lyons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1948550611432938">1989</xref>). People deal with this potential for terror by developing and maintaining a cultural worldview and self-esteem.</p>
<p>According to TMT, reminders of one’s own mortality are threatening and require defense. When people are reminded of their mortality, they simply suppress death thoughts. However, the suppression of death thoughts is presumed to demand resources, and consequently death-related thoughts cannot be suppressed for very long (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611432938">Arndt, Greenberg, &amp; Cook, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611432938">Arndt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Simon, 1997b</xref>). Rather, subsequent to a short delay, after which death thoughts can no longer be suppressed, death thoughts rebound or become more accessible (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Arndt, Simon, Pyszczynski, &amp; Solomon, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, &amp; Breus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611432938">Pyszczynski, Greenberg &amp; Solomon, 1999</xref>). At this point, TMT posits that people deal with the heightened awareness of death by relying on the dual-component cultural anxiety buffer, which consists of a cultural worldview and self-esteem. In other words, people defend against the rebound of death thoughts by asserting the superiority of their worldview over an alternative worldview or by bolstering their self-esteem (Greenberg et al., 1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Solomon &amp; Pyszczynski, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>TMT researchers have accumulated an impressive array of data over the last couple of decades in support of many of these assumptions and conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611432938">Burke, Martens, &amp; Faucher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611432938">Landau et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1948550611432938">Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Arndt, &amp; Schimel, 2004</xref>). In a typical experiment, participants are exposed to a mortality salience (MS) treatment where they think about their own death or the concept of one’s mortality is made salient. After a delay, when the accessibility of death thoughts is presumed to have rebounded, participants are given a chance to assert the superiority of their worldview or to employ some other defense. For example, Greenberg et al. (1990) found that when MS was followed by a delay, there was an increase in prejudice, nationalism, and intergroup bias.</p>
<p>Following this early work, it has been speculated that TMT can account for a wide range of interpersonal and intergroup behavior such as stereotyping and prejudice (Schimel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611432938">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1948550611432938">Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pyszczynski, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, TMT appears to help explain ageism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611432938">Martens, Goldenberg, &amp; Greenberg, 2005</xref>), belief in a just world, preference for behavioral consistency, reliance on representative heuristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611432938">Landau, et al., 2004a</xref>), preference for cognitive consistency (Friedman &amp; Arndt, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611432938">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1948550611432938">Jonas, Greenberg, &amp; Frey, 2003</xref>), allegiance to charismatic leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611432938">Landau, et al., 2004b</xref>), affiliation with one’s in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611432938">Castano, Yzerbyt, Paladino, &amp; Sacchi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1948550611432938">Wiseman &amp; Koole, 2003</xref>), disgust for human creatureliness (including dislike for breastfeeding mothers, sex divorced of love, and dust mites or vermin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611432938">Burris &amp; Rempel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611432938">Cox, Goldenberg, Arndt, &amp; Pyszczynski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611432938">Goldenberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611432938">Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, McCoy, Greenberg, &amp; Solomon, 1999</xref>), and a host of other phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611432938">Arndt, Cook, Goldenberg, &amp; Cox, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611432938">Goldenberg et al., 2006</xref>). Also impressive, the expression of these types of defenses has been demonstrated to decrease death thought accessibility (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Arndt, Schimel, Pyszczynski, &amp; Solomon, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>The Crucial Death Thought Suppression and Rebound Hypothesis</title>
<p>Given the many research successes that are due to TMT, it is not surprising that TMT is now one of the dominant theories in social psychology. But these successes depend, to a large extent, on the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis. This hypothesis was not part of the original theory. It was added to account for the empirical fact that the majority of TMT effects occur only when there is a delay between MS and the opportunity to respond defensively; when there is no delay, TMT effects are attenuated or eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611432938">Arndt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611432938">Arndt, Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611432938">Greenberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611432938">Greenberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611432938">Greenberg et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Simon, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Chatel, 1992</xref>; see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1948550611432938">Pyszczynski et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis, the attenuation of TMT effects when there is no delay occurs because immediately following MS death thoughts are suppressed, and defense against one’s worldview or self-esteem is not necessary. It is only after a delay, when death thoughts have rebounded to become accessible, and people have to deal with them, that there is a reason to be defensive against potential threats.</p>
<p>The main focus of the present research is the prediction regarding the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis. Following MS, death thoughts should not be accessible because they are suppressed. After a delay, death thoughts rebound and become accessible. In short, after mortality is made salient, <italic>death thoughts should be more accessible following a delay than immediately</italic>.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, there is only one direct test of this precise hypothesis (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611432938">Arndt et al., 1997a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611432938">1997b</xref> for indirect tests). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611432938">Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and Breus (1994)</xref> included MS conditions in which participants were distracted (delay) or not (no delay) before completing a death thought accessibility measure. Consistent with the hypothesis, death thoughts were more accessible in the former than in the latter condition. Although we have no criticism of this comparison, we note that there were only 12 participants in each condition, and so this single study is not definitive. Given the literature indicating that cognitive accessibility tends to decrease, rather than increase, with time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611432938">Altmann &amp; Gray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611432938">Anderson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611432938">Barrouillet, Bemardin, Portrat, Vergauwe, &amp; Camos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611432938">Brown, Neath, &amp; Chater, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611432938">Burgess &amp; Hitch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611432938">Collins &amp; Loftus, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611432938">Cowan &amp; AuBuchon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611432938">Cowan, Morey, Chen, Gilchrist &amp; Saults, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550611432938">Fischler &amp; Goodman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611432938">Graesser, Woll, Kowalski, &amp; Smith, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611432938">Grossberg &amp; Stone, 1986</xref>; Grossberg &amp; Pearson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611432938">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611432938">Higgins, Bargh, &amp; Lombardi, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1948550611432938">Ratcliff, &amp; McKoon, 1988</xref>; Srull &amp; Wyer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1948550611432938">1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1948550611432938">1980</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1948550611432938">Zeigarnik, 1967</xref> for an exception), skepticism is warranted.</p>
<p>In a series of experiments, we test the competing concept accessibility hypothesis by examining death thought accessibility following a delay or no delay. According to the death thought suppression and rebound assumption, death thoughts should be more accessible when there is a delay than when there is no delay. However, based on the literature cited above, we believe that death thoughts should be more accessible in no delay than in delay conditions.</p>

<sec id="section4-1948550611432938">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-nine (22 female) students from a southwestern university participated in exchange for partial course credit. Participants were 18 to 36 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 20, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.10).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1948550611432938">
<title>Materials and procedure</title>
<p>Participants received the standard MS essay questions that consist of two open-ended questions, “Please briefly describe the thoughts and emotions that the thought of your own death arouses in you.” And “Jot down, as specifically as you can, what you think will happen to you as you physically die and once you are physically dead.” Participants then received the standard PANAS-X delay (the 60-item positive and negative affect schedule; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1948550611432938">Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1998</xref>) or no delay, and completed a death thought accessibility measure consisting of 26 word fragments, 7 of which can be completed with a death-related or neutral word; for example, GRA _ E, COFF_ _ completed as grave and coffin or grape and coffee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611432938">Greenberg, et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1948550611432938">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>An independent samples <italic>t</italic> test was used to examine death word fragment completion by condition. Participants who received a delay between MS and the death thought accessibility measure completed fewer death word fragments (<italic>M</italic> = 1.60, <italic>SD</italic> = .99) than individuals who did not receive a delay (<italic>M</italic> = 2.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20), <italic>t</italic>(37) = 2.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, <italic>d</italic> = 0.67. In other words, following MS, participants who performed the delay task completed word fragments with fewer death-related words than did participants who completed the word fragments immediately. This finding is precisely the reverse of what the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis of TMT predicts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1948550611432938">
<title>Experiment 2</title>
<p>Possibly, the findings from Experiment 1 are anomalous, depend on the particular dependent measure used, or are the result of an insufficiently engaging delay task. To address all of these issues, we performed a conceptual replication with a large number of participants, a different dependent measure, and a more engaging and long lasting delay task.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-1948550611432938">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two hundred and seventy-seven (182 female) students from a southwestern university participated in exchange for partial course credit. Participants were 18 to 54 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 20, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.33).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1948550611432938">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were directed to take part in an online study from our departmental research participation system. After they consented to participate, an instructions page informed them that they would participate in two or three separate studies that focused on narrative style, word generation, and/or opinion. All participants completed the MS open-ended question prompts. Following a delay or no delay the dependent measure of word creation was administered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1948550611432938">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Participants in the delay condition read a New York Times Magazine “Design and Style” article regarding concept hotels and answered four open-ended and multiple choice questions about the article. The article had approximately 530 words. The dependent measure was touted to be similar to Bongo or Scrabble. The following letters were presented (C O B U R E S A T K I L D H P L M G V) and the participants were asked to spell five words using only the letters displayed.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1948550611432938">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Two raters, blind to condition, counted the number of death words that were created and achieved a high degree of inter-rater reliability (α = .93). Words only loosely related to death were not included in our count (e.g., rest, cold). The most common death words created from the letters were “kill” and “tomb.” An independent samples <italic>t</italic> test showed that death word creation was greater in the no delay (<italic>M</italic> = 0.30, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.64) than in the delay (<italic>M</italic> = 0.17, <italic>SD </italic>= 0.37) condition, <italic>t</italic>(275) = 2.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04, <italic>d</italic> = 0.25.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1948550611432938">
<title>Experiment 3</title>
<p>One could argue that in Experiments 1 and 2, the MS condition did not activate death thoughts. As a safeguard against this possibility, we included a dental pain salience (DPS) control condition in Experiment 3. According to TMT, death thought accessibility should be greatest in the MS delay condition. However, we expected that death thought accessibility would be greater in the MS no delay condition than in the other three conditions.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty (83 female) students, from a southwestern university participated in exchange for partial course credit. Participants were 18 to 36 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 20, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.02).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1948550611432938">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As in Experiment 2, participants completed the study online and were directed to the survey link via our online research participation system. The consent form stated that participants would take part in two to three separate studies regarding narrative style, opinions, and word generation. Once the participants agreed to participate they were randomly assigned to the MS or DPS condition and within these conditions they randomly received a delay or did not receive a delay. The final task was the word-creation dependent measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1948550611432938">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>The DPS open-ended question prompts were similar to the MS prompts except the word “death” was replaced by “dental pain.” Those in the delay condition read and answered questions about the same NY Times “Design and Style” magazine article as those in Experiment 2. Finally, the same dependent measure (the word creation task) as was used in Experiment 2 was used in Experiment 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1948550611432938">
<title>Results</title>
<p>As in Experiment 2, two raters who were blind to condition counted the number of death words created (α = .98). A planned contrast showed that the number of death words created in the MS no delay condition (<italic>M</italic> = 0.94, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.21) was greater than the number of death words created in the other three conditions (MS delay: <italic>M</italic> = 0.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.67; DPS delay: <italic>M</italic> = 0.56, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.73; DPS no delay: <italic>M</italic> = 0.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.67), <italic>t</italic>(116) = −2.02, <italic>p </italic>= .045, <italic>d </italic>= 0.38.</p>

<sec id="section19-1948550611432938">
<title>Experiment 4</title>
<p>In Experiments 1–3, we used implicit death thought accessibility measures. However, it could be argued that they were not sufficiently implicit, though the word fragment completion task used in Study 1 has been used previously in TMT literature. To address this possibility, we used a lexical decision task where faster reaction times were taken as evidence for greater death thought accessibility. In line with Studies 1–3 and concept accessibility, we predicted that reaction times for death words would be faster immediately following MS than after a delay.</p>

First, they were asked to complete the two open-ended MS questions by typing their responses on the computer. Then, those in the delay condition completed the 60-item PANAS-X using the keyboard to indicate their responses. Those in the no delay condition proceeded directly to the lexical decision task. Participants were asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether a string of letters was a word or nonword by pressing the “f ” or “j” keys. The response keys were counterbalanced across participants so that the f key corresponded to a word or a nonword. Upon completion of the task, participants were probed for suspicion, however, no participant guessed the relationship between the tasks.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>The lexical decision task included 39 trials with 13 death words, 13 neutral words, and 13 nonwords. Nonwords were drawn from the English Lexicon Project website (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550611432938">Balota et al., 2007</xref>) and were five to eight letters in length (matching the death and neutral word-type word length). Neutral words included words such as truck, pillow, slippers, and forest, whereas death words included words such as death, funeral, skull, deceased, and coffin.</p>

<sec id="section24-1948550611432938">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Response times were averaged across the 13 trials for death words, neutral words, and nonwords. Descriptive statistics on the average death and neutral word RTs indicated that the data were only slightly skewed (−0.39 and −0.36, respectively) and therefore we did not perform RT transformations. Our main prediction, that response times to death words would be faster in the no delay (<italic>M </italic>= 818.70, <italic>SD </italic>= 170.49) compared to the delay condition (<italic>M </italic>= 893.17, <italic>SD </italic>= 156.13), was supported, <italic>t</italic>(78) = −2.04, <italic>p </italic>= .045, <italic>d </italic>= 0.46.</p>
<p>An additional way to test our hypothesis is to see whether participants were faster to respond to death words than neutral words in the two conditions. Given that MS primes death thoughts, participants should be faster to respond to death words than neutral words. According to the death thought suppression and rebound assumption, death thoughts rebound when there is a delay and so the difference should be greater in the delay than in the no delay condition. In contrast, our reasoning suggests that the difference will be greater in the no delay than in the delay condition. To test these predictions, we entered the difference between average RTs for death and neutral words as the dependent variable. Supporting our prediction, participants were faster to respond to death words than neutral words in the no delay (<italic>M</italic> = −30.04, <italic>SD </italic>= 116.14) compared to the delay condition (<italic>M </italic>= 28.08, <italic>SD </italic>= 143.34), <italic>t</italic>(78) = −1.99, <italic>p </italic>= .050, <italic>d </italic>= 0.45. The means show that, contrary to TMT, participants were faster to respond to neutral words than death words in the delay condition.</p>

<title>Experiment 5</title>
<p>In Experiments 1–4, we used implicit measures of death thought accessibility. However, one might argue that an explicit measure of death thought accessibility is a more valid measure of the construct. As in Experiment 3, we used a DPS control condition. Further, we included no delay, short delay, and long delay conditions to safeguard against the possibility that our previous delay tasks were too short. If MS makes death thoughts accessible immediately, then death thought accessibility should be higher in the MS no delay cell than in the other five cells.</p>

<p>Participants were told that we were interested in conscious and unconscious processes and personality. They were randomly assigned to a MS or DPS condition and within these conditions they received no delay, a short delay, or a long delay. In the MS and DPS conditions, participants were asked to respond to the standard open-ended question prompts regarding their thoughts and feelings about death or dental pain. In the short delay conditions, participants read an article regarding fall garden cover crops that was 264 words and then answered three multiple choice questions regarding their interest in gardening and vegetable produce. Individuals in the long delay conditions read an extended version of the same article (843 words) and answered the same questions about their interest in gardening. Subsequent to no delay, a short delay, or a long delay, participants in each condition were asked to monitor their thoughts using a large grid sheet. The experimenter read the following script: “Now, for the next three minutes, please monitor your stream of consciousness. On this piece of paper I’d like for you to indicate the number of times you think about death. Indicate each time the thought of death comes to your mind by marking an X in one of the boxes. In other words, at the end of this experiment, we will know the number of times a death thought entered your mind by examining the number of Xs printed on the sheet.” Following completion of the grid, participants were debriefed and thanked for their participation.</p>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611432938">Wegner, Schneider, Carter, and White (1987</xref>) performed important research on thought suppression. They showed that when people are told not to think about a white bear, they were able to suppress these thoughts immediately but there was a strong rebound effect, just as TMT suggests should happen with death thoughts following a MS manipulation. Thus, in the present study, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611432938">Wegner et al.

If MS causes death thought suppression and rebound, as is predicted by TMT, then there should be no differences in death thought accessibility across the three conditions. However, if MS does not induce death thought suppression, then death thoughts should be more numerous in the death thought suppression condition compared to the MS conditions.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>To explore death thought rebound effects, we performed a planned comparison pitting the death thought suppression condition against both of the MS conditions. In contradiction to the death thought suppression and rebound assumption, there were more death thoughts in the death thought suppression condition (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>Death thought suppression</sub> = 45.5, <italic>SD</italic> = 46.1) than in either of the MS conditions (<italic>M</italic>
<sub>Delay</sub> = 25.58, <italic>SD </italic>= 23.08 and <italic>M</italic>
<sub>PANAS</sub> = 22.28, <italic>SD </italic>= 29.99), <italic>t</italic>(91) = 2.87, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.60.</p>

<sec id="section35-1948550611432938">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Our experiments were simple. Following MS, death thoughts were measured immediately or after a delay. According to the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis, death thoughts should be more accessible in delay than in no delay conditions. In contrast, we made the reverse prediction that death thoughts would be more accessible in the no delay than in the delay conditions. The data from all six experiments supported the latter prediction at the expense of the former one.</p>
<p>The present findings disconfirm the death thought suppression and rebound assumption with both implicit and explicit measures, and with different time delays. We emphasize that the problem was not a lack of statistically significant findings but rather that the findings were statistically significant in the <italic>wrong</italic> direction for the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis. Consequently, the data cannot be dismissed on the basis of insufficiently strong manipulations, insufficiently sensitive measures, insufficient sample sizes, or any of the other usual ways of dismissing inconvenient findings. We also emphasize that we used similar delays to those used in traditional TMT studies and so an argument that the delays we used were of the wrong time lengths begs the question of why the lengths are sufficient to obtain typical TMT effects.</p>
<p>However, we wish to be up front about an important limitation. Given that the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis is wrong, this leaves no explanation for why typical TMT effects happen when there is a delay after MS but not when there is no delay. Obviously, the present experiments are insufficient to support an explanation even if we had proposed one.</p>
<p>An additional limitation is that the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis is not necessary for all TMT experiments. For example, the effects of implicit MS manipulations do not depend on a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611432938">Arndt, Cook, &amp; Routledge, 2004</xref>) and so it is possible to argue that the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis only applies to experiments using an explicit MS manipulation. As another example of research that does not depend on the death thought suppression and rebound assumption, researchers have shown that when participants engage in worldview defenses, they have fewer accessible death thoughts following MS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1948550611432938">Vaes, Heflick, &amp; Goldenberg, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Philosophers and historians of science have shown that negative evidence is as important as positive evidence. There are many cases in the history of science where negative evidence overturned important theories and thereby left room for the proposal of better theories by future researchers. We see the present work as following that tradition. Despite its limitations, the present research definitively refutes the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis. This could mean that TMT is wrong too. Alternatively, it could mean that TMT researchers will need to find an alternative hypothesis with which to replace the death thought suppression and rebound hypothesis, at least for experiments that make use of it. A third alternative is that TMT researchers could restrict their experimental paradigms to only those for which the death thought suppression and rebound assumption is not necessary. There is no way to predict which, if any, of these pathways researchers will traverse, but it is sure to be interesting.</p>

<p>In the Wegner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1948550611432938">1987</xref>) original research, participants were asked to monitor their thoughts and report their stream of consciousness verbally in a microphone. In addition, they were asked to ring a bell each time the thought of a white bear entered their mind. The researchers indicated that effects replicated when using verbalizations or bell ringing alone. Thus, we wished to simplify the original procedures by asking participants to report thoughts using Xs on a grid in place of bell ringing.</p>
