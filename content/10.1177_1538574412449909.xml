<abstract>
<p>We report an unusual and distinct case of innumerable bilateral pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) in a 42-year-old patient presenting with significant right-to-left shunt resulting in severe dyspnea and with a history of stroke due to paradoxical embolization related to his PAVM. Because it was impossible to treat all his PAVMs, our aim was to treat those with a feeding artery measuring 3 mm or more in diameter, aiming to improve the patient’s dyspnea and decrease the risk of paradoxical embolization. We safely and successfully embolized 8 of the patient’s PAVMs, using a single Amplatzer vascular plug for each PAVM. The procedure did not result in significant improvement of the patient’s symptoms. In similar cases with innumerable PAVMs, the expectations of symptom relief should be lowered and the patient should be informed that treatment will only offer protection from paradoxical embolization. To our knowledge, there are no similar cases previously described in the literature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Congenital pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a vascular anomaly representing a direct communication between a pulmonary artery and a pulmonary vein with an intervening thin-walled aneurysmal sac or dilated tortuous vascular channels. They occur either as isolated entities or more commonly, in up to 87% of cases, in association with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Rendu-Osler-Weber disease. The PAVMs result in right-to-left shunt that may lead to dyspnea, fatigue, cyanosis and eventually chronic respiratory and cardiac failure, and also serious systemic emboli. Embolization using coils of different design and delivery methods including retrievable coils as well as Amplatzer vascular plugs (AVPs) is the standard method of treatment in the majority of cases. In this report, we present an unusual and distinct case of innumerable bilateral PAVMs, resulting in severe dyspnea, in which treatment of all PAVMs was not possible. The patient was managed by percutaneous embolization of PAVMs that had a feeding artery measuring 3 mm or more in diameter using AVP. The aim was to relief the patient’s symptoms and offer protection from potential paradoxical embolization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1538574412449909">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 42-year-old male patient with a history of HHT diagnosed at the age of 8 was referred for the evaluation and treatment of multiple PAVMs. The patient had severe dyspnea for which he was placed on outpatient oxygen therapy. His oxygen saturation was 96% at rest on 4 L oxygen and arterial blood gases showed severe hypoxemia with a pH of 7.46, P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 52 mm Hg, and P<sc>co</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 37 mm Hg. Pulmonary function tests showed severe diffusion impairment. The patient also had other systemic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) at presentation, including oropharyngeal, nasal, conjunctival, and cerebral AVMs. The patient had a history of paradoxical embolization including history of stroke at the age of 25 and an embolic left renal abscess treated by percutaneous drainage and antibiotics at the age of 34. The patient was evaluated with a chest computed tomography (CT) scan at an outside hospital which showed multiple innumerable bilateral PAVMs.</p>
<p>Given the severity of the patient’s dyspnea at rest and the history of systemic embolization, it was decided that selective embolization of PAVMs that had a feeding artery measuring 3 mm or more in diameter would give the patient better protection from further complications related to systemic embolization. However, as there were numerous shunts with feeding arteries less than 3 mm in diameter, we were uncertain if embolization would definitely improve the patient’s severe dyspnea and low oxygen saturation. The plan was thoroughly discussed with the patient and informed written consents were obtained according to protocol. The procedure was performed under conscious sedation. After gaining access into the common femoral vein, bilateral selective pulmonary angiograms were obtained using a 5F angled pigtail catheter (AP2; Cook, Bloomington, Indiana). The pulmonary angiogram demonstrated innumerable PAVMs of different sizes; these appeared to be numerous and larger in the right lower and middle lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412449909">Figure 1</xref>). There were 8 PAVMs that had a feeding artery measuring 3 mm or more in diameter, located in the right lung. All these were classified as simple PAVMs with single feeding arteries, according to classification by White et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412449909">1</xref>
</sup> Multiple PAVMs were also noted in the left lung, predominantly in the lower lobe; however, there were fewer and smaller as compared to the right, and none of them had a feeding artery equal to or larger than 3 mm in size.</p>

<p>The angled pigtail catheter was replaced by a 7F guiding sheath (Shuttle), which was placed in the right main pulmonary artery, and a 6F-angled guide catheter (Envoy, Cordis, Miami, Florida) was then introduced into the sheath. A 5F vertebral catheter (Cook) was then introduced through the guiding catheter and used together with a glide wire (Terumo medical corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to catheterize the segmental branch of the segmental artery feeding the target PAVM. The glide wire was then exchanged for a stiff Amplatz guide wire (Cook), and the guiding catheter was then advanced as distal as possible into the feeding artery over the 5F vertebral catheter. The vertebral catheter was then removed and angiogram was done through the guiding catheter to confirm satisfactory location and the angioarchitecture of the PAVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412449909">Figure 2A</xref>). The feeding artery was embolized using a single AVP (AGA Medical, Golden Valley, Minnesota), which was introduced through the 6F guiding catheter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412449909">Figure 2B</xref> and C). Postembolization angiography was performed until total occlusion of the PAVM was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538574412449909">Figure 3</xref>). The diameter of the AVP was chosen to be 30% to 50% larger than the diameter of the feeding artery, according to the manufacturer recommendation. The AVP was placed as distal as possible in the feeding artery near the aneurysm sac. This technique was used to embolize 8 segmental feeding arteries supplying the right lung PAVMs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574412449909">Table 1</xref> shows the embolized segmental feeding arteries, the size of the AVP used, and the occlusion time of each AVP.</p>

<p>Embolization of the PAVMs was performed on 3 sessions, with a week interval between sessions, to avoid potential complications from a high contrast load. During the second session, the patient developed a single episode of cough and mild hemoptysis (10-15 cc blood tinged sputum) and his oxygen saturation decreased to 89% from a previous stable value of 96% on 4 L of oxygen. At that time, the catheter was withdrawn into the right main pulmonary artery and a right pulmonary arteriogram was performed to rule out pulmonary artery perforation and bleeding from catheter manipulation. There was no evidence of contrast extravasation to suggest active bleeding and the previously embolized AVMs were completely occluded. After few minutes, the patient’s saturation returned to baseline and there were no further episodes of hemoptysis. </p>
<p>The patient tolerated these procedures well. Patient was discharged home after each procedure. The oxygen remained unchanged at the end of the procedures being 96% at 4 L of oxygen. Follow-up chest CT 6 months after treatment revealed persistent occlusion of the feeding arteries and nonvisualization of the aneurysm sacs of the embolized PAVMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538574412449909">Figure 4</xref>). The patient’s oxygen saturation remained unchanged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The PAVMs are abnormal direct communications between the pulmonary arteries and veins without intervening capillary bed. There is usually an intervening aneurysmal sac or tangle of dilated tortuous vascular channels. White et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412449909">1</xref>
</sup> classified the angioarchitecture of PAVMs into simple and complex. The simple malformation has been recognized to have one segmental arterial supply. Complex PAVMs are defined as having 2 or more different segmental arteries supplying the malformation. These infrequent anomalies can be single or multiple.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412449909">1</xref>

</sup> Although the majority of the patients with congenital PAVMs remain asymptomatic in early childhood, symptoms and serious complications may occur in adulthood necessitating some type of intervention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412449909">4</xref>

</sup> The most frequent and serious complications are neurologic events related to paradoxical embolization.<sup>

</sup> The risk of neurologic complications seems to increase in cases with a feeding artery diameter greater than 3 mm and in patients with HHT and multiple PAVMs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412449909">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412449909">6</xref>
</sup> Therefore, treatment of multiple PAVMs with feeding vessels 3 mm or larger has been recommended to prevent paradoxical embolization that might occur during the lifetimes of these patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412449909">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412449909">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our patient showed bilateral innumerable simple PAVMs and had a prior diagnosis of HHT. Our patient also had a history of stroke likely due to paradoxical embolus from the deep veins of his legs or pelvis or due to embolization of a thrombus formed in situ within one of the PAVMs. For these reasons, we decided to embolize the PAVMs that were 3 mm or larger in order to give the patient better protection from further complications related to systemic embolization.</p>
<p>In the last decade, percutaneous interventional treatment has become the mainstay for most patients with PAVMs. Its advantages are that it is less invasive, can be easily repeated, and a variety of disposable items are available for embolization. Significant improvements have occurred in catheter techniques, making interventional management simpler and safer.<sup>

</sup> Several studies demonstrated excellent short- and long-term result of embolotherapy with a variety of devices avoiding surgical intervention or resection of lung tissue.<sup>

</sup> In large feeding arteries, multiple coils may be required to create a nest of coil density to prevent recanalization of the vessel.<sup>

</sup> The reported risk of paradoxical coil embolization ranges from 2% to 4%.<sup>

</sup> In some cases, it may be quite difficult to safely place coils, especially when the communication is large and has a high degree of flow, and in these cases, detachable coils would have to be used to ensure stability before releasing the coils. It is also very common that numerous coils are required to achieve stasis even in simple and moderate size PAVMs adding substantial cost, time, and risk to the procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574412449909">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574412449909">17</xref>

</p>
<p>The AVP has been safely used in the percutaneous treatment of PAVMs. The design of the device, advantages, disadvantages, as well as the technique of deployment have been previously described.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574412449909">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574412449909"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412449909">20</xref>
</sup> We were able to safely and successfully embolize a total of 8 PAVMs in the right lung using AVP with diameters ranging from 4 to 8 mm. We achieved total occlusion of each of the embolized PAVMs using only one AVP deployed in each feeding artery. Total occlusion was achieved in only 2 to 5 minutes. We calculated the occlusion time (time needed to achieve complete occlusion of PAVM after AVP deployment) by recording the time interval between AVP deployment and the follow-up angiogram that demonstrated complete occlusion of the PAVM. In our experience, the short occlusion time achieved using AVP and the need to place only one AVP to completely occlude the target PAVM offers a great advantage over coils in which 2 to 3 coils need to be deployed to occlude an average size PAVM, leading to prolonged occlusion time. Prolongation of the occlusion time increases the risk of showering tiny emboli into the systemic circulation, which might lead to devastating complications.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574412449909">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The second session of embolization was complicated by minor hemoptysis and slight drop of oxygen saturation. We initially suspected perforation of the feeding artery from catheter manipulation, but this was excluded by performing an angiogram that showed no evidence of contrast extravasation. As the patient’s symptoms and oxygen saturation improved, we were more inclined to believe that his symptoms were the result of a small pulmonary infarct as a result of occluding peripheral vessels along with the PAVM arterial feeder. This was self-limiting and the final outcome was improvement over baseline.  </p>
<p>In conclusion, when a similar case of innumerable PAVMs is encountered, the expectations to improve the patient’s symptoms should be lowered, and the patient should be informed that the treatment is expected to only offer him protection from paradoxical embolization. This protection can be achieved by embolization of PAVMs with feeding arteries of 3 mm or more in diameter. The AVP is a time saving, effective, and low-risk device that can be used in these cases.</p>
