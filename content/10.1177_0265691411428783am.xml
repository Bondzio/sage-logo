<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783am"><title>Oliver Lubrich, ed., <italic>Travels in the Reich, 1933–1945: Foreign Authors Report from Germany</italic>, University of Chicago Press: Chicago IL, 2010; vii + 379 pp.; 9780226496290, $30.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>For all the research into life in Germany under the Nazi regime, there remains a striking lack of attention granted to sources emanating from foreign observers. Angela Schwarz’s monograph on the written responses of British visitors to the Third Reich, published almost 20 years ago, remains an isolated example of historians engaging closely with documents of this type. This is all the more surprising given the wealth of such sources: the international controversy surrounding Hitler’s government, not least in its earliest phases, had drawn curious foreign observers to Germany from across the political spectrum. In the 1930s, not least in Britain, a whole sub-genre emerged of the ‘man on the spot’ who had gone to ‘see for himself’. Such documents hold particular interest for shedding as much light on the assumptions of the visitors, and on their own societies, as they do on the Germany of the time.</p>
<p>Lubrich’s documentary collection gathers together 52 such extracts by 35 different authors, divided into two sections: the first covering the pre-war years, the second beginning with the outbreak of war and concluding with the collapse of the regime in May 1945. While most have already been published in some form, the extracts by Samuel Beckett and John F. Kennedy are made available to the general reader for the first time. Many of the excerpts capture well the complexity of reactions to the regime. Martha Dodd, daughter of the US ambassador, finds herself crying ‘Heil Hitler’, swept along with the excitement of the crowd; shortly afterwards, her enthusiasm is shattered as her party witnesses the public humiliation of a woman accused of ‘race defilement’ (47). Annemarie Schwarzenbach’s letter to Klaus Mann is at once poignant testimony to the feeling of powerlessness felt by German intellectuals at the victory of Nazism, while also hinting at some of the reasons for that failure, with its smug assertion that ‘any halfway intellectually oriented person, if European at least, naturally belongs to the opposition’ (38).</p>
<p>The success of source editions depends on two criteria: the selection of the documents, and their contextualization. Here, there is a suspicion that many of the authors have been chosen more for their renown than for the light they shed on Nazi society. Virginia Woolf journeying through Germany with her marmoset, and Kennedy gallivanting across the country as a young Harvard student, are momentarily diverting, but tell us little about either the Third Reich or the opinions of the authors; Albert Camus is represented in a piece of precisely nine lines. Other selections tend towards the predictable: it is hard to believe that many with an interest in Weimar and Nazi Germany will not already be familiar with Christopher Isherwood and William Shirer. None of the writers analysed by Schwarz feature here, nor is her work referenced, while some authors are accorded three separate excerpts.</p>
<p>The extracts overwhelmingly deal with life in Berlin, with other regions of Germany underrepresented. Furthermore, given that Lubrich himself notes that ‘the system of terror and persecution of the Jews’ were among the aspects of the Third Reich that foreign authors considered ‘noteworthy’ (2), it is all the more remarkable how little precisely these aspects figure in the book. In contrast, two different extracts describe the same November 1943 air raid on Berlin. This absence is especially glaring in the section on the pre-war years, as it fails to reflect that – contrary to Lubrich’s assertions (7) – travellers’ curiosity often stemmed precisely from their political engagement; many went specifically to find out if there was truth in the stories in their domestic media about atrocities in Germany. Visitors flocked to visit the concentration camps for exactly this purpose: Dachau alone was a port of call for Christopher Sidgwick, <italic>Daily Telegraph</italic> journalist George Gedye, and the British Legion, to name but a few – all of whom published their thoughts. The only discussion of the camps of any length in Lubrich’s book, in contrast, comes in a self-pitying monologue by an SS guard employed at Mauthausen (292).</p>
<p>Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, extracted twice here, also visited a camp. The example of Hedin raises the second issue: the lack of sufficient contextualization. A Nazi sympathizer, Hedin published <italic>Germany and World Peace</italic> in 1937; a contemporary review in the <italic>Manchester Guardian</italic> blasted it as a work of crude propaganda for the Third Reich, not least on the basis of his laudatory account of Sachsenburg concentration camp. Hedin later presented himself, with some success, as an opponent of Nazism. Yet the reader of the book under review learns nothing of all this. Instead, the extracts reproduced here, from a later book published in 1949, describe meetings with Hitler and Göring. The former sees Hedin attempt to distance himself from a man he met on four separate occasions; that this might have been part of a wider strategy of dissociating himself, post-war, from inopportune connections with the Third Reich, likewise passes without comment. This is symptomatic of a general trend in the book, with Shirer’s Germanophobic views, for example, not placed in their wider context of similar sentiments held by his contemporary Anglo-Saxons, not least Allied policy-makers.</p>
<p>Lubrich includes a helpful guide to further reading on each author, although the inclusion of an index would have rendered the book more user-friendly. It is to be hoped that this collection will spur readers to seek out the original books, and others of the same type, and ultimately stimulate further research into this still neglected aspect of the Third Reich.</p>
