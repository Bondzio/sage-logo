<p>The second edition of <italic>TA Today </italic>is a welcome update of an excellent book. Originally published in 1987, the book has served extremely well for both new learners in transactional analysis and experienced transactional analysts.</p>
<p>The new edition continues the structural pattern of the first, with clear explanations of transactional analysis concepts illustrated with exercises that the learner is encouraged to do in order to bring the concepts into real experience. The book covers the TA 101 syllabus, including revisions from 2008.</p>
<p>In honor of the international nature of transactional analysis now, the examples used in this edition are selected so as to be recognizable to people wherever they live.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with the first edition of <italic>TA Today </italic>will appreciate that the authors have listed the changes they have made in this new volume. These include updates of role-play illustrations as well as the incorporation of significant shifts in perspective on some aspects of transactional analysis theory.</p>
<p>I personally regret the omission of the miniscript, justified by the fact that its originator, Taibi Kahler, is no longer teaching it. I continue to find the miniscript useful both in helping clients to understand and in bringing forth important aspects of their life scripts and related patterns. I do appreciate the writing Stewart and Joines provide about process scripts and drivers.</p>
<p>New sections of the book include an introduction to personality adaptations and a section on the relational approach to transactional analysis. In addition, the section on educational and organizational TA has been enriched with input from experienced practitioners in those fields. Also rewritten, and extended, is the section on the history of transactional analysis.</p>
<p>Together with updated appendices, notes and references, glossary, and bibliography, this edition will doubtless serve all of us well for the next 25 years—as did the previous edition for the past quarter century. Many thanks to Ian Stewart and Vann Joines for their contribution.</p>
