<abstract>
<p>This paper reviews the diverse literatures on negative experiences of home at the domestic scale and sets out an agenda to further ‘critical geographies of home’. Tying into broader debates in critical geography on the delineations between the ‘mapping’ of exclusionary landscapes versus the ‘doing’ of something to transform them, the paper finds that the line between these two modes should not always be dichotomously drawn. Now is the time that the burgeoning interest in, and catalogue of research on, home is capitalized upon by pushing towards a critical geography that simultaneously illuminates and catalyses the addressing of domestic injustice.</p>

<title>I Introduction: Geographical histories of home</title>
<p>Once cast as a uniform space of safety and familiarity, the home is now established as a far more problematic entity across the social sciences. Building on the work of humanistic geographers writing in the 1970s and 1980s, the home was hailed in the geographical canon as a site of authenticity and experience, provisioning a sense of place and belonging in an increasingly alienating world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132511418708">Moore, 2000</xref>). With this, the modern home:<disp-quote>
<p>became constructed not only as a line separating the inside from the outside (a house), but also as the epitome, the spatial inscription of the idea of individual freedom, a place liberated from fear and anxiety, a place supposedly untouched by social, political and natural processes, a place enjoying an autonomous and independent existence: a <italic>home</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132511418708">Kaika, 2004</xref>: 266, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote>Couched within an era when place attachments were considered largely affirmative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132511418708">Manzo, 2003</xref>), academic work appeared to ‘exaggerate the emotional nobility of the home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132511418708">Ehrenreich and English, 1978</xref>: 10). As one of the most idealized sites of human existence, the home became a, if not the, metaphor for experiences of joy and protection that conspired to produce a normative association between home and positivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132511418708">Guiliani and Feldman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132511418708">Moore, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0309132511418708">Short, 2006</xref>). Such deterministic associations between home and comfort led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0309132511418708">David Sibley (1995</xref>: 93) to bemoan the ‘benign’ approach taken by studies of domestic environments in a world which was actually replete with tension and conflict.</p>
<p>This ‘house as haven’ thesis was subject to fervent critique in the 1990s, with interdisciplinary calls for a ‘gloomier tale’ to be told in light of the ‘upbeat’ literature on home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0309132511418708">Porteous, 1995</xref>: 152). Most critics took exception to, and focused their arguments on, one or more of the binary oppositions (inside/outside, male/female, work/home, public/private, safe/unsafe) underpinning a once purely optimistic notion of home. Pursued through case studies that highlighted disparities between ideals and lived realities of home (a key example here being the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132511418708">1999</xref> edited collection <italic>Ideal Homes?</italic> by Tony Chapman and Jenny Hockey), understandings of home space were increasingly brought under scrutiny. This was particularly evident in feminist analyses that emphasized the domestic not as an individual and homogenously experienced unit of harmony, but as a potential site of struggle and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132511418708">Badgett and Folbre, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0309132511418708">Olwig, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0309132511418708">Young, 1997</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0309132511418708">1</xref>
</sup> The domestic was instead reconceptualized as a continuous process of negotiations, contracts, renegotiations and exchanges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132511418708">Folbre, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132511418708">Harris, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309132511418708">Lawson, 1998</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309132511418708">2</xref>
</sup> This recognition of potential conflict between the agency expressed by individuals and by the household permeated disciplinary boundaries, with anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132511418708">Daniel Miller (2001</xref>: 4) pointing out how the private had become viewed as ‘a turbulent sea of constant negotiation rather than simply some haven for the self’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0309132511418708">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What has followed in the past 10 years is a further strengthening of the domestic as characterized by contrasting connotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132511418708">Blunt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511418708">Blunt and Dowling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132511418708">Blunt and Varley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132511418708">Domosh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132511418708">Duncan and Lambert, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0309132511418708">Varley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0309132511418708">Young, 1997</xref>). Summarized by Nicole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132511418708">Schröder (2006)</xref>:<disp-quote>
<p>It makes much more sense to view home as a site of and for ambiguity since its protective functions are interconnected with its limiting characteristics. Feelings of solidarity, safety, and protection are often achieved by severe acts of exclusion and regulation, which are in turn oppressive. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132511418708">Schröder, 2006</xref>: 33)</p>
</disp-quote>The symbolic use of home to enlist a sense of belonging, rootedness, memory and nostalgia has been complicated then by the role of negative and ambivalent feelings to home. Lynne Manzo (2003) argues accordingly that these mixed feelings are vital research foci if eulogized experiences of home are not to be perpetuated. Indeed, as Jeanne Moore (2000: 213) has argued, we ‘need to focus on the ways in which home disappoints, aggravates, neglects, confines and contradicts as much as it inspires and comforts us’.</p>

<title>II Towards ‘critical’ geographies of home</title>
<p>Responding to the growth of ambiguous and contradictory analyses of home, Alison Blunt and Robyn Dowling (2006) proposed the term ‘critical geographies of home’ in their seminal book <italic>Home</italic>. Here three cross-cutting components to a critical geography of home were drawn: ‘home as simultaneously material and imaginative; the nexus between home, power and identity; and home as multi-scalar’ (p. 22). The first component – the ‘material and imaginative’ – evokes home not only as a physical location in which people reside but also as an imaginative and metaphorical space of emotion and belonging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132511418708">Al-Ali and Koser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511418708">Blunt and Dowling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0309132511418708">Rapport and Dawson, 1998</xref>). The second – ‘home, power and identity’ – ties into debates concerning the domestic as a locus of personality, belonging and meaning to which people are differently positioned, and differentially experience according to age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and class. Finally, the third – ‘multi-scalar’ – emphasizes the porosity of home as the personal relations it plays host to transect public and political worlds. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132511418708">Doreen Massey (1992</xref>: 14) elaborates that the identity of home derives ‘precisely from the fact that it had always in one way or another been open; constructed out of movement, communication, social relations which always stretched beyond it’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0309132511418708">4</xref>
</sup> Taken together, Blunt and Dowling (2006: 22) propose a ‘critical geography of home’ which moves beyond a binary of exclusionary or idealized space to show the ambiguity of this ‘<italic>spatialized</italic>’ and ‘<italic>politicized</italic>’ space (emphasis in original).</p>
<p>Taking this as a point of departure, this paper evaluates and prospectively calls for work that furthers ‘critical geographies of home’. The paper questions where research in geography goes from here in terms of (re)visioning a more complex and fluid understanding of the home which emerges from deliberate or unintentional disruptions to home places and sentiments at different scales and times. Considering in more depth what the ‘critical’ in ‘critical geographies of home’ implies, and how as researchers we ‘do’ this geography, I take my lead from the insightful review of <italic>Home</italic> by Cathrine Brun (2008: 565) who sets out a challenge, that ‘we should perhaps ask what our responsibilities as researchers in doing critical geographies of home are?’ With critical geographies of home requiring much fuller elucidation, this paper tackles negative experiences of home on two main grounds.</p>
<p>First, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511418708">Blunt and Dowling (2006)</xref> argue, there is a politics to home. In fact, the term ‘critical geographies of home’ was initially developed to understand the politics of home reflected in events occurring at the time of writing <italic>Home</italic>, from Hurricane Katrina and the Indian Ocean tsunami, to the domestication of the war on terror in the United States. In this sense, the home is a vital space for understanding the micro-geographies of social and spatial uncertainty which influence, and are influenced by, wider structural forces of unhomeliness, alienation, and homelessness. While the home has been constructed as a radical political space in itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132511418708">hooks, 1994</xref>), it is nevertheless a vulnerable crucible to wider political processes. Focusing on these processes remains of the utmost importance, especially in light of some scholars’ belief that it is still far too easy to fall into an idealized visioning of home. As John Rennie Short (2006) has voiced in respect to feminist concerns:<disp-quote>
<p>it is no accident, I feel, that in recent years the home has been seen as a sanctuary just at a time when domestic tensions are increasing. We are losing our sense of the fairness of the polity but hanging on to the notion of a domestic harmony. The image of a serene home life haunts our collective and individual imaginations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0309132511418708">Short, 2006</xref>: x)</p>
</disp-quote>With ‘the fairness of the polity’ far from assured, critical geographers have an obligation to document and respond to the experiences of those living on the margins of home (as normatively defined) in both Global North and Global South. Second, then, pursuing a critical geography of home is important on the grounds that domestic exclusions and inequalities are being derived and exercised at multiple scales with differential impacts. Towards the end of the 1980s as critical geography began to emerge, alertness to multiple and overlapping geographies through which oppression and domination are produced became more widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132511418708">Blomley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132511418708">Hubbard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132511418708">Longhurst, 2002</xref>). The subfield thus responded by examining how such sociospatial processes came to influence social exclusion. In turn, pursuing a ‘critical geography of home’ means questioning how people are differentially placed to negotiate these contrasting experiences. As Gunhild Setten (2008) asks:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I find that ‘doing’ home and feeling at home can usefully be thought of as some kind of balancing act: between private and public, domestic and civic, alienation and belonging, local and global, material and imaginative, and so on. This, of course, begs the question of what determines our abilities to achieve a balance that represents home to us. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132511418708">Setten, 2008</xref>: 558–559)</p>
</disp-quote>While it is clear that a person’s ability to control domestic space and exclude others is contingent on a range of social coordinates, a critical geography makes a clear commitment to conceptual pluralism by facilitating a better ‘understanding of people’s identities and subjectivities as complex rather than as made up of different and distinct components’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132511418708">Longhurst, 2002</xref>: 546).</p>
<p>This paper argues that although pursuing a ‘critical geography of home’ can be justified on these grounds, greater consideration needs to be paid to what difference uncovering negative experiences of home has. This query chimes with debates more broadly in ‘critical’ human geography, namely that scholars in their prioritization of empirical production and theoretical sophistication have failed to offer imaginative or practical guidelines for ‘doing’ something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132511418708">Cloke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132511418708">Pain, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132511418708">Rob Kitchin and Phil Hubbard (1999</xref>: 195) were among the first to highlight this deficiency: ‘it appears that many social and cultural geographers are happy to survey (and ‘map’) the exclusionary landscape, but rarely do much to change that landscape apart from the occasional nod to planning and policy recommendations’. Such criticism has been the catalyst in part for the growing number of activist geographers whose emphasis on participatory action-research seeks to struggle for a better world (a commitment I turn to later).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0309132511418708">5</xref>
</sup> Such potential criticism is something I am also increasingly aware of in the context of my own research concerning the historical and contemporary realities of gender inequalities and domestic life in Cambodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2007</xref> in general, 2008 on domestic violence, 2011a on migrant homes, 2011b on housework) and Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2011c</xref>, on home-related proverbs).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0309132511418708">6</xref>
</sup> Even though the research was prefaced by the need for feminist academics who are based in western institutions to ‘produce research agendas that do not merely address what is theoretically exciting or trendy here, but also what is considered politically imperative by the communities we work with or are committed to over <italic>there</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309132511418708">Nagar, 2002</xref>: 184, emphasis in original), I question whether this is really enough to claim my work ‘critical’. Again, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132511418708">Brun (2008</xref>: 566), ‘what consequences would taking those responsibilities into consideration have for pushing the ideas of critical geographies of home further?’</p>
<p>The remainder of the paper considers this question in more depth. It does so in two parts: the first considers how ‘extreme’ and ‘everyday’ domestic disruptions have been ‘mapped’, and the second highlights where geographers and other social scientists have sought to ‘do’ something about the exclusions identified. While I utilize this dualistic structure as a heuristic device to organize the analysis that follows, note should (and will) be given to the blurring <italic>between</italic> these two modes shaping the development of critical geographies of home.</p>

<title>III ‘Mapping’ critical geographies of home</title>
<p>Geographers have been particularly active in their surveying of mutations to idealized versions of home which emerge from sudden, gradual or routine exigencies of daily life. This section is divided into two interconnected sections which both explore what has (not) been ‘mapped’: ‘extreme’ and ‘everyday’ geographies of home. John Porteous and Sandra Smith (2001: 21) originally used the prefix ‘extreme’ in connection to the neologism ‘domicide’ (the deliberate destruction of home) which is ‘generally infrequent, massive, abnormal’ and involves ‘major, planned operations that occur rather sporadically in time but often affect large areas and change the lives of considerable numbers of people’. The other prefix ‘everyday’ was harnessed to make reference to domestic discontinuities that occur ‘continuously all over the world’ and which come about from the ‘mundane operation of the world’s political economy’ (p. 106). In this paper, I treat these prefixes loosely, as a continuum, and in an interdependent manner, moving (back and forth) from acute circumstances of material domestic loss to disruptions of home emerging out of the operations of daily life and life course transitions. I demonstrate at a range of levels how critical geographies of home have been championed and neglected by research that illuminates home as simultaneously material and imaginative, as a locus of power and identity, and as manifest across scales.</p>
<sec id="section4-0309132511418708">
<title>1 Extreme geographies of home</title>
<p>Geographers have been actively involved in rendering visible large-scale disruptions to home via the indiscriminate wrath of natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132511418708">Azmi and Lund, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511418708">Blunt and Dowling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132511418708">Brun and Lund, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132511418708">Clark, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132511418708">Hyndman, 2011</xref>) to the planned destruction of home by powerful agents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132511418708">Blunt and Dowling, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0309132511418708">Windsor and McVey, 2005</xref>). Central to this task has been a concern to show how the intimate and personal spaces of home – and their loss – are closely bound up with, rather than separate from, wider power relations. The two clearest expressions of this are, first, the entangled relationships between home and poly-scalar politics and, second, experiences of homelessness.</p>
<p>The first of these emanates from the subfields of geopolitics, migration and refugee studies and attends to the political contours of power flowing through the home. Access or denial to home is dictated by larger political realities, rendering its recesses the ‘sites for history’s most intricate invasions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132511418708">Bhabha, 1994</xref>: 13). Examples of such intimate incursions and their links to material and metaphorical meanings of home have been examined in both historical and contemporary analyses. In a historical remit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132511418708">Alison Blunt (2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132511418708">2000b</xref>) has shown the symbolic and strategic significance of representing British women and homes under threat during the Indian ‘mutiny’ of 1857–1858 in Lucknow. Its female survivors were evident in newspaper accounts, parliamentary debates and visual images only through their absence. Once rescued and living in a place of imperial and domestic security, however, these women could once again embody the health of the imperialist nation (see broader debates on the theme of home, nation and empire in Chapter 4 of <italic>Home</italic>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0309132511418708">7</xref>
</sup> Meanwhile in a contemporary remit, work on ‘urbicide’ has shown how attacks on the domestic foundations of the city are central to warfare: first, through physical damage to homes; second, via the dehousing of residents; and, third, by causing death and injuries in homes and civilian air raid shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132511418708">Hewitt, 2009</xref>). As Kenneth Hewitt (2009: 362/342, emphasis in original) elaborates, domestic destruction is a strategic goal – raid planning is ‘<italic>designed</italic>’ to exploit the most vulnerable areas of housing where density and risk of fire damage is greatest, so much so that ‘domestic space is almost always “ground zero” in the bombing of settlements’.</p>
<p>As these two examples suggest, mappings of the domestic landscape have paid close attention to empirical contexts where the imaginative as well as physical significance of home has been central to the rationale behind its defilement. Here, the aim is often ‘loss of security and ownership; restrictions on freedom; partial loss of identity; and a radical re-centering from place, family and community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0309132511418708">Porteous and Smith, 2001</xref>: 63). Research in Bosnia-Herzegovina, one of the most documented cases of a ‘house war’ during the 1990s, has revealed how ‘the politics of home played a central role, instrumentally as well as ideologically, to cause mass flight and make irreversible the effects of ethnic cleansing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132511418708">Stefansson, 2004</xref>: 2). Through alteration to names of Bosnian localities, occupations of homes by the ethnic national group, and the setting fire of homes, many homes literally ceased to exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132511418708">Jansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132511418708">ÓTuathail and Dahlman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132511418708">Povrzanovic Frykman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Such direct attacks on home by national actors links theoretically to work by Arjun Appadurai (1996) who illuminates the rationale behind the destructions of place sentimentalities:<disp-quote>
<p>The work of producing localities, in the sense that localities are life-worlds constituted by relatively stable associations, relatively known and shared histories, and collectively traversed and legible spaces and places, is often at odds with the projects of the nation state. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132511418708">Appadurai, 1996</xref>: 42)</p>
</disp-quote>The destruction of personalized attachments to family may be considered necessary, for instance, for the creation of subjects loyal exclusively to the nation state. Tainted by associations to pre-revolutionary times, homes, and even entire villages, were physically demolished in Cambodia to make way for communal buildings and working teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2007</xref>). For the Khmer Rouge (1975–1979), shared histories of family life could not be afforded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2011a</xref>). As political geographer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0309132511418708">James Tyner (2008</xref>: 119) meticulously details through his archival research on the regime, Cambodia needed to be ‘killed’, to cease to exist both literally and symbolically, for Democratic Kampuchea to be built. Hence, in Cambodia the restructuring of society was much like that for Soviet society, based on ‘the profound reconfiguration of domestic relations, the individual, the home and daily life as a part of a larger, highly contested and demiurgic process of social reform’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132511418708">Buchli, 2004</xref>: 210; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132511418708">Fehérváry, 2002</xref>, on attempts to reconstruct ‘normal’ domestic life in Hungary).</p>
<p>As the examples of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cambodia attest, and as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132511418708">Robert Bevan (2006</xref>: 8) avows, forms of cultural cleansing with domestic architecture as its medium arguably warrant greater exploration in a wider range of national and local settings. In this pursuit, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132511418708">Chris Harker (2009)</xref> has argued through his work on Palestinian homes, and in a critique of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0309132511418708">Porteous and Smith (2001)</xref>, that there is a tendency to romanticize time-space by not fully qualifying or defining exactly what sort of home is being destroyed. Qualifying what home is being lost calls for further work on ‘extreme’ but also ‘everyday’ dimensions of home in two particular respects.</p>
<p>First, while the material articulation of domestic loss (or movement) has been the focus of considerable research, mainly with migrants and refugees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132511418708">Burrell, 2008</xref>; Datta, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0309132511418708">Salih, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0309132511418708">Tolia-Kelly, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0309132511418708">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0309132511418708">Tuan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0309132511418708">Walsh, 2006</xref>), neglected multisensory understandings of this process are becoming of heightened scholarly interest. Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0309132511418708">Yi-Fu Tuan (1977</xref>: 144) who argued over 30 years ago that ‘enchanted images of the past are evoked not so much by the entire building, which can only be seen, as by its components and furnishings, which can be touched and smelled’, the importance of touch and smell to memories of, and nostalgia towards, the home destroyed remains an area which critical geographers should advance. Despite the fact that such sensory geographies of daily life have been habitually suppressed within many geographical discourses, they are nevertheless materially significant. In concordance, research is slowly emerging which questions the everyday importance of touch as a home-making practice, albeit with an emphasis on the present (Carey-Ann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309132511418708">Morrison, 2010</xref>; see also review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132511418708">Deborah Dixon and Elizabeth Straughan, 2010</xref>). Like touch, smell has received limited attention to date (see paper under review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132511418708">Hilary Geoghagen, 2011</xref>, which makes the wider case for studying ‘olfactive geographies’).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0309132511418708">8</xref>
</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0309132511418708">Elia Petridou (2001</xref>: 94) has shown that, despite this lacuna, for Greek students sensory perceptions of their London homes do not contribute to identification: ‘the “English” home is imagined as the epitome of social alienation brought about by the penetration of ready-made food into the domestic sphere’. Although possible to conjure up such aromas through the cooking of national food in destination homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132511418708">Duruz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132511418708">Law, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132511418708">Longhurst et al., 2009</xref>), the lack of smell is compared negatively to the intensity of odours in Greece that are believed unobtainable in student homes. In this sense, qualifying the home lost requires looking beyond its material form to consider its multifaceted sensory qualities.</p>
<p>Second, defining exactly what sort of home is being destroyed, or indeed (re)built, needs to be understood more fully in respect to the tracing of temporalities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132511418708">Stef Jansen and Staffan Löfving (2009</xref>: 15) contend that for those whose lives are characterized by migration and violence ‘the home that has been lost has not simply been left behind in another place. Rather … it has also been left behind in another time and is therefore often experienced as a previous home, irrevocably lost both spatially and temporally’. The relevance of such multiple temporalities has been recently highlighted through research on Georgian internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Abkhazia and their notions of home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132511418708">Kabachnik et al., 2010</xref>). It is argued that the IDPs experience a ‘double displacement’ both spatially and temporally: ‘in a sense IDPs have become homeless; not in terms of not having a room with four walls … but in that they do not see their homes as being in the present’ (p. 317). It should be noted that this potential sense of lacking in the present is by no means limited to such ‘extreme’ situations, but also to ‘normal’ changes in residence that occur with life course transitions (as I later elaborate). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132511418708">Liz Kenyon (1999</xref>: 94) has demonstrated how for those students in the UK who leave their parental home to go to university, neither this nor their term-time residence is viewed as ‘acceptable’ as prospective long-term homes: ‘the future home (although still merely an imagined next step) was already perceived by students as a home which would provide for all their developing adult needs’. In turn, such research transgresses the purported fixity of home by bringing to light homes that are not even guaranteed to develop, yet still fuel growing dissatisfaction with past and present homes. In both the variant cases of Georgian IDPs and UK students, then, the house is envisaged to varying extents ‘as a project or as an aspiration, an ardent ambition rather than a universally available and securely defined space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132511418708">Schröder, 2006</xref>: 44–45).</p>
<p>The significance of home as an ‘ardent ambition’ links well to the second main area of research which has coalesced on the mapping of ‘extreme’ geographies of home: homelessness. Homelessness arguably represents a major landscape of exclusion highlighted by geographers and other social scientists that again has temporal meaning to those affected. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132511418708">Kim Dovey (1985</xref>: 49, emphasis in original) elaborates that ‘rather than focusing on the “loss” of home in home-lessness’ scholars should ponder ‘how homelessness <italic>continues</italic> to be very powerfully shaped by the embodied effects of traumatic homes of the past’ (see, for example, Catherine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0309132511418708">Robinson’s 2005</xref> research on young people’s experiences of homelessness in an inner-Sydney suburb where brutal past homes continue to ‘haunt’). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132511418708">Leanne Rivlin and Susan Moore (2001)</xref> also show how people’s experiences do not necessarily evolve in a linear fashion from becoming homeless, being homeless, to moving on from homelessness. Attempting to remedy a simplistic view of homeless people who, once rehoused, are assumed to be resettled and at home, they show how homeless people also negotiate a changing and developing understanding of, and relationship to, home. Indeed, homeless people often ‘distinguish between the absence of “real home” (ironically meaning a failure to experience home in an ideal sense) and the lack of something which can be called home for them (meaning lack of abode)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0309132511418708">Somerville, 1992</xref>: 531).</p>
<p>The wealth of insights provided by geographers on homelessness holds the potential to be more fully integrated into emerging analyses of recent global economic crises, including house repossession resulting from debt over-reach in much of the western world. The literature on the meanings and materialities of such domestic loss is sparse (see rare examples by Sarah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132511418708">Nettleton, 2001</xref>, on children’s experiences of repossession; and the excellent magazine article by Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0309132511418708">Reyes, 2008</xref>, on the ‘bleak houses’ of the recent mortgage crisis). Moreover, research emerging mainly from housing studies tends to focus on more technical mechanisms of loss such as compulsory auction proceedings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0309132511418708">Potter and Drevermann, 1988</xref>). This is consistent with Kim Dovey’s (1985: 48) criticism of homelessness research, that ‘despite the fact that trauma and family conflict are acknowledged as key factors in initial exits from home, the focus of responses to homelessness remains on “structural issues” and grief and trauma are never examined seriously as key structuring principles of homelessness’. Expanding this limited literature should involve belatedly connecting home to important issues at the ‘hard edge of the economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0309132511418708">Smith, 2008</xref>: 567). Susan J. Smith, a key proponent of this path, argues that while the materiality of domestic architecture and the objects that bind today’s experiences of home matters, analyses must consider the ‘flows of credit and cash which crystallize into (and increasingly seep out of) these structures’ (p. 567). To date, few studies have emerged, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132511418708">Andrew Gorman-Murray’s (2010)</xref> paper on Sydney men’s rescaling of domestic belonging as a result of the global economic crisis being one notable exception.</p>

<title>2 Everyday geographies of home</title>
<p>The home is a powerful location for, and arbiter of, life course transitions that are both dynamic and flow across time. Geographers have accordingly made valiant moves to map the domestic as a major site of life events as well as everyday practices that can be simultaneously rewarding but also constraining for its diversely positioned inhabitants. As Leeke Reinders and Marco Van der Land (2008) argue:<disp-quote>
<p>disruptions in the physical or social environment seem to hit those with few means the hardest. Because of restricted means and few alternative options, for some social groups such as elderly people, low-income households, home often means a fixed geographically delineated place. Displacement or changes in the social and physical environment have most impact on them, as they cannot move, while others can and do. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0309132511418708">Reinders and Van der Land, 2008</xref>: 8)</p>
</disp-quote>With reference to disability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132511418708">Rob Imrie (2004)</xref> has concentrated on the unsuitability of people’s homes with the onset and development of bodily impairment which makes ideal domestic habitation always conditional and contingent. The difficulty of meeting people’s needs is also reflected in the growing literature that plots transitions to old age and which emphasizes that because of restricted physical means and few alternative options home becomes an increasingly delineated place. Considering these situations in more depth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132511418708">Christine Milligan (2000</xref>: 54; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132511418708">2003</xref>) elucidates that even when care is administered within old people’s own homes, the ‘blurring of public and private space can mark a change in the meaning and experience of home where carers and cared-for experience an increased dislocation from the home-space’ as living rooms take on features of the hospital ward and health professionals and care-workers move in and out, governed by time constraints (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132511418708">Dyck et al., 2005</xref>, on the home as the site of long-term care; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132511418708">Bhatti, 2006</xref>, on the garden as a means to recreate home in later life). Equally, in urban Mexico, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0309132511418708">Ann Varley and Maribel Blasco (2000)</xref> show how the home does not automatically function as a space of familiarity and comfort for retired men. Alienated within a territory viewed as feminine and divorced from a breadwinning identity, men’s unhappiness is rooted in a lack of privacy from family members.</p>
<p>Taking such home-transitions one step further, research has demonstrated how moving into an institution for the elderly or infirm is accompanied by feelings of loss or even banishment with such homes bearing none of the characteristics of a private home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132511418708">Fairhurst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132511418708">Hockey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0309132511418708">Parr et al., 2003</xref>). Denial of home, rather than exclusion felt within it, takes precedence as, even though one’s image of home remains, control over its manifestation may become compromised and even lost. Of note here is the research of anthropologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132511418708">Fiona Parrott (2005)</xref> which movingly brings into view the refusal of patients residing in a medium secure psychiatric unit to decorate their walls. With bareness a signification of home, it is illustrated that the strong temporal connections made between home-making and permanence makes this practice only suitable as a subject for future contemplation. Here then it could be argued that the unit’s patients are themselves ‘doing’ a critical geography of home by tactically resisting and denying themselves to submit to a supposed and ever-present home-making urge. This contemporary research is also complemented by new unpublished historical research on the design, decoration and furnishing of 19th-century residential institutional spaces, questioning to what extent inmates were able to achieve privacy and feel ‘at home’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132511418708">Hamlett et al., 2010</xref>).<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Such acts or experiences of severance between homes links into mounting theoretical interest surrounding the events and processes via which a home is demoted to a mere house through divestment. In other words, while place can acquire deep meaning through ‘the steady accretion of sentiment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0309132511418708">Tuan, 1977</xref>: 33), why and how does the dis-accretion of sentiment occur? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132511418708">Jean Sébastien Marcoux (2001)</xref> has examined the divestment rituals performed by elderly people in Montreal (Canada) moving from a home into care, a process that is called <italic>casser maison</italic> (literally ‘breaking the house’). In instances such as these, it is argued that what follows within residential homes are attempts to mask evidence of deterritorialization and death which otherwise in a ‘literal sense would be profoundly disruptive in that, as visible manifestations of human mortality, their presence within that setting transgresses the boundaries through which life and death are customarily kept apart’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132511418708">Hockey, 1999</xref>: 118). On death, other research has considered the social meanings associated with the passing on of houses via inheritance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132511418708">Janet Finch and Lynn Hayes (1994)</xref> outline how ‘the process of clearing out the home involves a further dismantling of one’s relationship with the deceased, who “lives on” in the home which they have created until the home is broken up’ (p. 431). Developing conceptual insights by geographers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132511418708">Nicky Gregson (2007</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132511418708">Gregson et al., 2007</xref>) should encourage more explicit mapping of divestment and accumulation in line with the cautionary words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309132511418708">Daniel Miller and Fiona Parrott (2009</xref>: 510) that ‘there is no single sequence of distribution and divestment about which we can generalize, but a complex pattern of accumulation, sorting, and divestment that utilizes objects to help create a long-term, processual relationship to the loss’.</p>
<p>A key domestic disruption that has so far been largely ignored in the geographies of home and divestment literature (along with repossession as aforementioned) is marital breakdown and divorce (as a phenomenon that is seeing successive annual increases in the UK, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132511418708">Anthony, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2011b</xref>, in Cambodia). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132511418708">James McLean (2008</xref>: 564) urges further work on critical geographies of multiple homes that have been ‘fragmented, fractured, and flung across space by divorce’ including work on children whose material and imaginary home occupy (at least) two sites (parental/caregiver homes) and each with a unique set of sociospatial relations of power and identity. Equally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0309132511418708">John Watkins and Amy Hosier (2005</xref>: 202) suggest that ‘divorce may result in a move back to the early-life influence sphere in young adulthood, or more generally independence, with remarriage causing yet another transition to codependent influence, but with a new spouse’s sense of home to negotiate’. Given then that homes ‘always involve encounters between those who stay, those who arrive and those who leave’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132511418708">Ahmed, 1999</xref>: 340), marital breakdown and resultant moves are an important dimension of understanding these increasingly normative journeys which households and individuals experience. Exemplifying this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0309132511418708">Figure 1</xref>, my own research in Cambodia powerfully illustrates the significance that separation and divorce has for women’s home lives in rural areas.</p>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0309132511418708">10</xref>
</sup> Sitting looking over an empty field, she spoke of the marital home loaded onto a lorry by her husband and driven away. Now alone, and fearful of rape on account of her diminished status, Kalliyan’s new wooden house was strategically positioned nearer to her parents’ to symbolize renewed membership of a family unit. With other women in the study forced to watch their homes being loaded onto a lorry, taken away by their husbands, and left with a patch only of bare land, the research dramatically highlights the importance of mapping home not only in its presence, but also in its absence. This project, along with previous work on domestic violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132511418708">Brickell, 2008</xref>) shows how such disruptions are thought to surface from the ‘normal’ (<italic>tomodah</italic>) business of everyday life. In proverbial terms, the home in Cambodia is not one traditionally constructed as timelessly harmonious but one in which domestic life is presented as conflictual. The commonly used proverb in interviews, ‘plates in a basket will rattle’, inplies that family members, like plates, often collide with each other in the home. Indeed, this conception of the household relates to one of the most serious and perhaps alarming aspects of marital breakdown, and domestic violence, in Cambodia – the culture of impunity and tacit acceptance surrounding it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0309132511418708">UNIFEM et al., 2004</xref>: 13).</p>
<p>In thinking about other work produced more widely on domestic violence, it is not so much the discourse of normalcy that is the subject of concern, but its invisibility. Research has emphasized how ‘the ideological scripting of home as intimate and safe makes violence against women difficult to see’ with women often tolerating violence so as not to signal a deep failure or collapse of home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0309132511418708">Price, 2002</xref>: 40). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132511418708">Paula Meth (2003)</xref> has shown, however, how this invisibility is manifest quite differently for homeless women who, she argues, are overlooked in analyses given the assumption that domestic violence is connected to formal material home spaces. Furthermore, while women may feel ‘homeless at home’, domestic violence can ultimately lead to homelessness in an objective sense as they escape (or are ejected) from their violent homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0309132511418708">Wardhaugh, 1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0309132511418708">Warrington, 2001</xref>, on refuges as non-homes of security). Ultimately, the diverse work showcased on the ‘mapping’ of critical geographies of home has signposted the powerful influence that the ideological choreographing of home has by different actors, be they scholars, planners, policy-makers or others. Such variant scripting has a significant bearing not only on what transgressions to home and its inhabitant(s) are identified, but also to which injustices are responded to. More than this, though, it is the improved understanding of these negative expressions of home that are <italic>in themselves</italic> ‘critical’ to the ‘doing’ of a critical geography of home.</p>

<title>IV ‘Doing’ critical geographies of home</title>
<p>This second part of the paper more directly considers the nature of geographers’ engagement in the ‘doing’ of a critical geography of home. In Rachel Pain’s (2003) paper on action-oriented research, she highlights three overlapping modes to approach a critical social geography through activist, participatory and policy research. Rather than take each mode in turn, I highlight two main characteristics of critical geography research on home that connects to this suite of praxis. I go on to show, however, that while the emphasis of action-oriented research tends to err on the making public of domestic injustices with a view to being able to do something about them, with respect to home ‘doing’ can be understood through a third characteristic. Namely, ‘doing’ could be seen to rest, in part, on the personal attempts made by academics to enact or reflect upon change in the space of their own intimate lives.</p>
<p>The first characteristic of current work on the ‘doing’ of a critical geography of home is that the ‘private’ injustice being focused upon tends to be relatively ‘public’. Homelessness, for example, is a forefront issue in the sharpening of interest in activism as an explicit strategy and outcome of research (see, for example, Paul <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132511418708">Chatterton, 2002</xref>, on his squatting of derelict buildings in Newcastle city centre as a ‘brief intervention’). In fact, this visibility was what first propelled Paul Cloke (2002: 588) to study homelessness: ‘when I came to Bristol from Lampeter in 1992, I encountered on-street homelessness for the first time in my everyday life, and it was these sites/sights of homelessness which gave grounded expression to the politics and ethics of resisting injustice’. Work on this issue has accordingly highlighted the possibility for, if not active experience of, feeding people’s experiences of homelessness into town planning, councils, public and private businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132511418708">Doyle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0309132511418708">Robinson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0309132511418708">Veness, 1993</xref>), through the use of creative methods such as auto-photography to ‘map’ the ‘hidden’ spaces that that do not typically feature in public (or academic) imaginations of the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132511418708">Johnsen et al., 2008</xref>). In this way, we can see how ‘mapping’ and ‘doing’ are again integral to one another.</p>
<p>A second related characteristic of ‘doing’ a critical geography of home has been to challenge the exclusionary processes identified through ‘mapping’ the domestic by bringing these <italic>into</italic> the public realm. Here so-called ‘private’ issues are deterritorialized, rendering them public(ized) and thus (strategically) disruptive of the public/private divide. Exemplary of this move, Geraldine Pratt has developed a long-standing relationship with domestic workers in Vancouver spanning back to the early 1990s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0309132511418708">Pratt, 2004</xref>). She argues that ‘our commitment should be one of opening doors for communication’ by ‘creating trouble’ and ‘making visible boundary constructions and the production of difference’ so as to be politically productive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0309132511418708">Pratt, 1999</xref>: 164). To this end, through collaboration with the Philippine Women Center of BC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132511418708">Caleb Johnston and Geraldine Pratt (2010)</xref> took conventional research materials and turned them into a performance installation using the testimonies of familial separation by Filipino mothers and their children. Stimulating interest around an important social issue, at the same time as evoking an emotional visceral response from audience members, this innovative approach demonstrates how novel pathways could be furthered by scholars of home who are keen to consider the transformative potential of their research in order to lobby for change (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132511418708">Blunt et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The power of performance in the remaking of public space as one where ‘private’ issues can become visible and contestable is aptly demonstrated by Richa Nagar’s (2000) research with a grassroots feminist theatre in Chitrakoot, India. As Nagar reflects, the theatre performances represented spatialized acts in which women, many of whom had suffered violence against them, ‘literally <italic>moved</italic> the discourse on these subjects – first, from the privacy of women’s homes to the spaces of the organization, and later, from the organization to the male-dominated public spaces of the community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0309132511418708">Nagar, 2000</xref>: 359, emphasis in original). In this way, methodological approaches which bring out people’s private lives into public require continued and complex consideration given the ethics, sensitivities and potential consequences of doing so.</p>
<p>While research has highlighted the significance of ‘stories’ produced through intensive interviewing for avoiding the disembodied voice of the researched, the two preceding examples of theatre show how this method does not constitute the only type of knowledge that may promote political change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132511418708">Hubbard, 1999</xref>). With research regarded more ‘critical’ when it creates knowledges produced by (rather than about) marginalized groups, my own research in Hue, Central Vietnam, sought to use participatory video (PV) to allow community members to document, and reflect upon, their domestic lives.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0309132511418708">11</xref>
</sup> Notwithstanding critiques that such engagements are deluded in thinking that they circumvent power or enable empowerment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132511418708">Kesby, 2007</xref>, for review of this debate), I tried to collaboratively generate knowledge and informed action through two PV workshops (including body mapping, storyboarding and the filming of role plays) which equipped participants with the skills and confidence to video an annual event held by the commune’s Women’s Union. The ‘Happy Family’ competition involves women competing in the cooking of nutritious food and flower arranging, both viewed as important components of home-making (men are usually only judges and audience members). Stemming from previous research which engaged with the Women’s Union, the project was devised jointly and chose to publicly include men as participants with women for one of the first times in the commune’s history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309132511418708">Figure 2</xref>).<sup>

<p>Explained at the start of the paper, I have become increasingly self-critical of my own home-oriented research. In this specific project it remains to be seen – and indeed surveyed – what implications (if any) the research and other interventions will have for the future strategies used by the Women’s Union to encourage greater male participation in family life. Certainly, however, the project at this initial stage indicates the importance for future research on home that aims to be ‘critical’ to account for the multilayered coordinates of control and translation that operate. In the case of the Hue study, a complex flow of power dynamics was initiated that warrants further interrogation. This included bringing out participants’ ‘private’ lives into the semi-public workshops; publicizing them further through the very public event day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0309132511418708">Figure 2</xref>); privatizing these experiences again through the final editing process in the home of the Women’s Union leader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0309132511418708">Figure 3</xref>); and finally screening the film to the commune and wider academic and policy communities in years to come. Put otherwise, ‘doing’ critical geographies of home also demands careful ‘mapping’.</p>
<p>The third and final characteristic to note concerning the ‘doing’ of a critical geography of home is that such public politicization of domestic issues can and should be complemented by academics’ efforts to transform or at least make sense of their own negative or challenging experiences of home(s). Two examples in the literature resonate deeply here. First, via an ‘interlude’ about her unconformist mother, Iris Young (1997) painfully recounts how her mother’s dream of a suburban existence turned into a nightmare. Giving up a high-flying career to become a stay-at-home mother in 1958, Young describes how as a child she was ‘mortified’ by the ‘weirdness’ of her mother, ‘sitting in her chair reading and writing, instead of cooking cleaning and mending like a real mom’ (p. 145). When Young’s mother died, however, over 20 years later, the author rethought her mother’s refusal to do housework as passive resistance to the stifling world of suburban morality she had become subsumed within, and harshly judged by, after her husband’s death when she was accused of child neglect based almost solely on evidence of drinking and a messy house. Yet despite Young experiencing repeated bouts of time in care as a consequence, the author powerfully brings to the fore the tensions and ambiguities that feminists contend with between romanticizing home and rejecting it as an ideal.</p>
<p>The need to be wary of rejecting home despite its potential for damage chimes with the second example of autobiographical work which traces Ann Varley’s (2008) emotions and coping strategies associated with her father’s dementia. The research heart-wrenchingly documents Varley’s anguish at her father’s repeated pleas to return home from his specialist one, leaving the author feeling overwhelmed by a sense of loss and betrayal further accentuated when the time came to sell his home. As Varley eludicates:<disp-quote>
<p>Having seen how being at home helped my father sustain his narrative of self, and how not being able to go home now causes him and some other residents of his care home such distress, I can no longer read denunciations of the dysfunctional home without feeling a chill of unease. We are none of us autonomous at home, but there may come a time in our lives when we too desperately wish we <italic>were</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0309132511418708">Varley, 2008</xref>: 61, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote>Here, then, Varley shows how bravely ‘doing’ the emotional work of charting out her response to her father’s dementia is an important component of furthering critical geographies of home in which ‘mapping’ and ‘doing’ are mutually constitutive of one another. Indeed, this work illustrates in another way, and at the most personally touching of levels, how Varley’s identification and understanding of the tensions between home as an exclusionary versus idealized space informed her search for the best means possible to protect her father given his insistence to return ‘home’. Just as ‘mapping’ and ‘doing’ should not be presented in a strictly delineated fashion, then, it becomes evident here that clear-cut distinctions between either positive or negative manifestations of home in people’s individual lives cannot be drawn.</p>

<title>V Concluding thoughts: Towards ‘critical’ geographies of home … again</title>
<p>This paper’s primary purpose has been to appraise the state of play concerning the ‘mapping’ and ‘doing’ of critical geographies of home and to question what difference uncovering negative experiences of home has. It has revealed both empirical avenues for further inquiry, such as repossession and divorce, and theoretical paths from the sensory to temporal that are equally deserving of greater attention. More profoundly, though, the paper has shown how the scholarly modes of ‘mapping’ and ‘doing’ cannot be always separated but should be viewed in a mutually constitutive manner. First, while critical geographers must arguably devote more energy to moving beyond the pursuit of empirical production and theoretical sophistication, the paper indicates that ‘mapping’ remains an important prerequisite for ‘doing’ if interventions or otherwise are to be appropriately tailored and actioned, <italic>especially</italic> when dealing with the intricacies and politics of domestic life. Second, the review suggests that the mounting professional onus on academics to directly ‘get out there’ and ‘do’ something (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132511418708">Castree, 1999</xref>) to challenge negative expressions of home needs to be balanced against their bringing to light of affected people’s own forays into the politicization and publicization of domestic issues. This could be furthered, I argue, by future work which examines campaigns about domestic issues such as homelessness and domestic violence at a range of (non-)organizational scales but which also provides ‘real’ life insight into academic engagements with, and contributions to, these endeavours. Third, and finally, this paper shows that, in line with feminist approaches, the ‘doing’ of a critical geography of home can also extend itself to self-reflection by scholars themselves on how their own home histories, experiences and actions shape, and are shaped by, the domestic worlds and issues that they choose to research.</p>
<p>Our responsibilities as critical geographers of home then (to respond to Brun’s question at the start) are through innovative and collaborative research methods, to support, report and even become participants in spatial acts of resistance that have the potential to spark positive change in people’s home(less) lives. It is these challenges to ingrained exclusionary practices and hegemonic discourses of home that have the capacity to rally further understanding of how social change at the domestic level comes about at differing levels of permanency and adequacy. Now is the time that the burgeoning interest in, and catalogue of research on, home is capitalized upon by pushing towards a critical geography of home that simultaneously illuminates and catalyzes the addressing of domestic injustice.</p>

<p>This onus on change-making is also becoming more politically (and financially) important in view of the ‘impact’ agenda encircling UK academia at the current time with it remaining up to geographers and other social scientists alike to demonstrate the importance that comes from studying the presupposed ‘soft’ spaces of home. While some critical geographers have welcomed a focus on impact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0309132511418708">Pain et al. (2011</xref>: 185) anxiously note that its success is likely to be viewed through the narrow purview of ‘hard’ economic imperatives that address the needs of elite beneficiaries in business and government. Clearly, then, there is a potentially dangerous slippage between the meaning of ‘impact’ increasingly shaping Higher Education in the UK (such as the Research Excellence Framework) and the work of critical geographers trying to address ingrained social injustices.</p>
