<abstract>
<p>This article seeks to clarify the place of policy studies in education in the meta-field that it terms LAMPS. It is argued that this canon of work has undervalued the merits of a humanistic approach and in doing so has tended to minimize the part played by people. To illustrate what might be possible, it reports on aspects of a longitudinal study, the first of its kind, that set out to examine, evaluate and categorize to what extent, and how, permanent secretaries influence policy. Based on recorded interviews with those who held this office at the DES between 1976 and 2002 and others (senior cabinet members, secretaries of state, junior ministers, special advisers) it argues that while the role of such senior civil servants can be described as ‘meta-political’ they do nevertheless influence policy in significant ways. As such it suggests that their praxis may be located on a continuum of ‘centrism’, five forms of which are identified. From this standpoint, much of the text represents a search for the architect/s of the Education Reform Act 1988 and in doing so focuses on the thinking and contribution of Sir David Hancock – its ‘principal project manager’.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The invitation to contribute to the 40th anniversary of <italic>Educational Management Administration &amp; Leadership </italic>(<italic>EMAL</italic>) offers a welcome chance to reflect on the meta-field of research and practice that we have termed generically as ‘LAMPS’ – and its constituent fields of study of ‘leadership, administration and management<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741143212451170">1</xref>
</sup> in education’ and of ‘policy in education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2007a</xref>). In what follows we will focus on policy which, if its importance is widely acknowledged by management field members, is nevertheless missing from the name of the journal and society. In doing so we will propose that the study of policy, like management, has undervalued the merits of the humanistic domain in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212451170">Gunter and Ribbins, 2002</xref>) and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2008</xref>) in particular and in doing so minimizes the part played by people. To illustrate the possibilities of an alternative approach, one putting history and people centre stage, we will draw on our field studies of policy makers in education in the UK. Our publications have to date concentrated mainly on politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451170">2004</xref>) but having studied the careers of permanent secretaries as depicted by themselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>) this article is the first to report on these investigations. As such it will examine a role which, while widely regarded as important, has, with a few important exceptions (for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212451170">Barberis, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212451170">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451170">Rhodes, 2005</xref>) been the subject of very little individual, let alone longitudinal, empirical research. In doing so it will consider aspects of Sir David Hancock’s thinking about and contribution to the Education Reform Act 1988. To make sense of the role of the permanent secretary and to enable critical examination of the notion of civil service ’impartiality’ in supporting policy initiatives through successive, often incompatible, political administrations, an explanatory framework predicated on the concepts of consensus and ’centrism’ will be proposed.</p>

<title>Locating ‘LAMPS’ – Towards a Humanistic Dimension?</title>
<sec id="section3-1741143212451170">
<title>LAMPS: One Field or Two?</title>
<p>What is LAMPS? Its origins, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212451170">Hughes (1985</xref>: 3), are to be found in the ‘first sustained attempt to develop an explicit theory’ of educational administration in the USA in the 1950s. He notes, as does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212451170">Glatter (1980</xref>: 26), it was much later that the field developed in the UK. His use of ‘field’ rather than ‘form’ or ‘discipline‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212451170">Gunter and Fitzgerald, 2008</xref>: 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212451170">Hirst, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2007a</xref>: 354), as a conceptualization of the study of educational administration, is widely shared (353).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741143212451170">2</xref>
</sup> However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212451170">Baron (1980</xref>: 11) has argued, such a generally held view is compatible with ‘very ill-defined (field) boundaries’ and, he might have added, much turbulence. Since he made this prophetic judgement, the field has experienced ‘terrain creep’: as seen by the addition of ’management’ and later ‘leadership’ to the name of its journal and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Gunter, 2002</xref>: 361). How, then, do these concepts relate to each other? We believe that they should be regarded as distinct, if related and complementary, subfields of ‘management’. What then of policy?<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741143212451170">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>On this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212451170">Glatter (1987</xref>: 9) has long argued ‘against the attempt to create two separate and distinct fields of study of educational policy and management on the ground that such a dichotomy is unjustifiable conceptually and empirically’. He (1987: 10) warns that one consequence of such a split was that educational management risked becoming ‘a narrow technical activity divorced from values and purpose’. A decade later Fitz (1999: 313), in a review of <italic>Education Management &amp; Administration (EMAL</italic>’s previous title) between 1986–1997, while broadly accepting the substance of Glatter’s critique, nevertheless stresses that ‘fields are composed of positions, objectively related to each other, and occupants who have vested interests in maintaining the boundaries of their own field’. Thus if there is reason to believe that a split between the studies of policy and management may be undesirable, there is little doubt the two fields are viewed by their core memberships as separate. If a few contribute extensively to both fields and some cross over from time to time, LAMPS is in effect divided into two epistemic communities, each with its vested interests, ways of working, core memberships, positions, networks, journals, typical career routes and dispositions,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741143212451170">4</xref>
</sup> between whom collaboration and contact is limited, sporadic and sometimes unsatisfactory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741143212451170">5</xref>
</sup> In describing the damaging consequences of the split Fitz and Glatter focus on what it has meant for management. But our reading of LAMPS suggests that policy has not escaped unscathed – if the former has over-stressed issues on ‘how to do’ and ‘what works’ the latter has focused too much on ‘what should be done’ and ‘how far this is being achieved’ and in doing so has tended to ignore the people expected to achieve the doing and how they are to go about this. If things are to improve, if the study of management has to change, so too must the study of educational policy. But what change is necessary and how might it be achieved?</p>

<title>A Case for a Humanistic Perspective</title>
<p>In tackling this issue, Helen Gunter and Peter Ribbins have sought to describe and understand how knowledge is produced, what is produced, who produces it, why they produce it, where it is produced and what makes that which is produced authoritative. A full statement of their approach is beyond the scope of this article and is in any case summarized, referencing key texts, elsewhere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2007a</xref>: 359–362). Arguing for inclusivity, eight knowledge provinces are identified several of which are given too little attention in the literature of either field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2007a</xref>: 361). What makes a knowledge province distinctive is what is being asserted as constituting the truth underpinning the intention behind an activity or action. For the purposes of this article, we make a special claim for humanistic studies: a province in which policy studies are arguably more deficient than is the management field. The humanistic, and it is within this province that like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212451170">Samier (2006</xref>) we locate history in general and biography in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212451170">English, 2006</xref>),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741143212451170">6</xref>
</sup> is primarily concerned with the subjective construction of experience through an agent’s location in the world, and how the agent engages, over time, with the structures that seek to determine and shape action.</p>
<p>Since the late 1970s we have been involved in such research, notably in studying the careers of those involved in LAMPS in education. Much of this has focused on schools and their leaders and in doing so used approaches informed by ethnographic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212451170">Best et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212451170">Gronn and Ribbins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212451170">Ribbins, 2007b</xref>) and biographic, essentially interview based, ideas and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212451170">Marland and Ribbins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212451170">Pascal and Ribbins, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212451170">Rayner and Ribbins, 1999</xref>). In tandem with these latter studies, we have sought to explore the life and work of those involved in management and policy in education at a national level (chancellors of the exchequer, home secretaries, secretaries of state, junior ministers, political advisers and permanent secretaries) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 1997</xref>: 4–6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 9, 49). A key aspect of this project was a series of repeat tape-recorded interviews, conducted between November 1997 and July 2002, with all the permanent secretaries who held this office at the Department of Education<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741143212451170">7</xref>
</sup> between 1976 and 2002 (James Hamilton, David Hancock, John Caines, Geoffrey Holland, Tim Lankester and Michael Bichard).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741143212451170">8</xref>
</sup> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of such an unbroken succession in any major spending department in which permanent secretaries are identified by name and to whom comments tape-recorded during interview are attributed. This enables insight into the role as they see it which is both uniquely personal and historical.</p>
<p>In conducting the research on which our studies of national policymaking and makers has been based, we have adopted an <italic>interpretive </italic>approach of the kind advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451170">Rhodes (2005</xref>) in his ground-breaking examination of the daily life of ministers and top civil servants. More ambitiously, he argues for ethnographically orientated enquiry in this field and seeks to illustrate its possibilities in a report of his study of ‘three middle ranking service ministries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1741143212451170">Rhodes, 2005</xref>: 5). Although relatively modest in scale, this study of those at the top of British Government reveals that it is possible to throw light on aspects of their praxis that could not be achieved using other methods. More such studies, preferably in greater depth, difficult though they would be to negotiate and undertake, would be invaluable; as would be research into British politics that is more theoretically informed than a good deal of what is currently available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1741143212451170">Smith, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Meta-politics, Consensus, Centrism and the Praxis of Permanent Secretaries</title>
<sec id="section6-1741143212451170">
<title>What Can We Learn from the Literature?</title>
<p>What, then, can be learnt from the literature about practice and theory on the role of the permanent secretary? In truth, not very much. Thus while much has been written about politicians (and by politicians), including accounts of the lives of quite minor figures, little has been published on even major permanent secretaries. Given this the literature germane to this article falls into three main categories.</p>
<p>First there is a large body of work on educational policy although little of this has dealt with the role of civil servants. As a recent colourful and compelling contribution from the educational establishment on policy under New Labour and its Tory predecessors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212451170">Bangs et al., 2011</xref>) shows, this is still true. Based on interviews with 37 ‘actors’, it tells ‘the story of reinventing schools and reforming teaching’ as told by its architects, prophets and critics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212451170">Bangs et al., 2011</xref>: vii). Thus while civil servants are listed under the category of architects, only one who would be classified as ‘career administrative level’ was interviewed (Sandy Adamson) and of the seven permanent secretaries who held this office at the DES over the years covered by this study, only David Bell is mentioned; and even this referred to things that he said as chief inspector. For good or ill, we believe that this seriously underestimates the role permanent secretaries played in making educational policy during this period. As such we argue below that David Hancock played an important role in shaping and implementing the Reform Act 1988 and that James Hamilton has a strong case for being regarded as the grandfather of the national curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Second there is a far smaller corpus of work that relates to the role of civil servants with, as far as we could discover, no contemporary biographies and few recent publications dealing specifically with permanent secretaries. In addition, for reasons discussed later, we have found two authors helpful; both former senior civil servants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451170">Nairne, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212451170">Plowden, 1985</xref>). Sadly, none of these texts says much relating to the DES. Finally, there is a background literature of which the most important aspect for our purposes were political biographies that can provide useful insights into the working of Whitehall and occasionally into the activities of permanent secretaries.</p>
<p>David Bell, the current permanent secretary at the DES, describes himself as ‘the Secretary of State’s principal, non-political policy adviser’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451170">Clarke, 2010</xref>: 1). Given this his ‘role, and that of all civil servants, is to implement the policies of the elected government. Although it was disappointing for civil servants to see their work abandoned (by a new administration) they need to keep to the civil service values of political impartiality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212451170">Clarke, 2010</xref>: 2). How successful the civil service has been in achieving this last is much contested. Elevation to permanent secretary in the Whitehall bureaucracy represents the apotheosis of a career within the British higher civil service – ‘the elite of the elite’ is Barberis’ (1996: xv) apt description. It is unsurprising to find that given such perceived elitism those who have held this role have had critics from all parts of the political spectrum. Thus the Thatcherite reforms of the 1980s and 1990s can be seen as pursued by those from the right eager to push back the frontiers of the state who were inclined to see permanent secretaries and other senior civil servants as the over-bureaucratized agency of an over-powerful government imposing a monolithic and statist regime on the country. However, prior to this the fiercest political critique came from left-wing politicians such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212451170">Richard Crossman (1975)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212451170">Barbara Castle (1973)</xref>. Among other things it was argued that permanent secretaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212451170">Benn, 1979</xref>) had imposed their own agenda on government, thus thwarting socialist policies. In accounting for this, it was claimed the social and educational background of permanent secretaries had rendered them elitist by nature and inclination and therefore inherently right-wing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741143212451170">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Applied to those who have held office at the DES since 1976, such observations only partially fit the facts. Thus while five did go to public schools and Oxbridge (Hancock, Caines, Holland, Lankester, Normington), three attended state schools and Red Brick universities (Hamilton, Bichard, Bell<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741143212451170">10</xref>
</sup>). Regarding those he studied, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt (2004</xref>: 2) suggests that they, or indeed other senior DES civil servants, have ‘seldom, if ever, been accused of boasting right-wing credentials’. Rather, ‘if there is a tendency among (them) to an innate conservatism then this has little to do with party preferences and everything to do with the fact that senior officials tend to resist too much change, preferring to maintain policy continuity, stability and sustainability despite reshuffles and changes in government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>One way of making sense of this, having regard to Bell’s claim about the need for the civil servant to abide by the value of ‘political impartiality’, would be to locate the work of the permanent secretary in terms of the concept of ‘meta-politics’. This can be defined as activities which are clearly linked to the work of the politician but which is not political activity. If, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212451170">King (1981)</xref> persuasively argues, the business of the career politician is located in the domain of politics that of the senior official is not located in that domain given he or she is not a politician. Even so, senior officials, while not operating as politicians, do deal with policy, in at least two main ways. First, as a result of the advice they give to ministers. Second, in drafting the legislation that flows from a policy determination for the approval of ministers. In advising their secretary of state the permanent secretary operates alongside the stratum populated by politicians (the political stratum); but in as much as they are not themselves politicians they may be located in a related but distinct stratum – the meta-political. As such their work within this stratum can be described as that of the meta-politics of bureaucratic neutrality. Furthermore both strata, political and meta-political, can, we contend, be depicted as characterized by a greater or lesser degree of attachment to one or other of two main forms of consensus. Within this broad context, we would suggest that the praxis of permanent secretaries, or the policy environment within which they operate, may be located on a continuum of centrism, five forms of which are identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt (2004</xref>) and used in his study to analyse and interpret the generic and individual performance of the permanent sectaries that he studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143212451170">
<title>Consensus and Centrism</title>
<p>Since the late 1950s it is possible to discern three main phases in the evolving story of the place of consensus in the policy praxis of ministers and officials. The first phase, from the 1950s to 1970s, was distinguished by a broad national and local policy consensus on education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212451170">Kogan, 1971</xref>: 29–30), and its bureaucratic expression at the DES we term <italic>proto-centrism. </italic>The second phase saw a breakdown of this consensus as a consequence of the growing influence of the political ideology of the later Thatcher years. The third phase reached its zenith in the Blair administrations after 1997. In this there is a form of consensus in terms of middle-ground positions shared by elected politicians and the permanent Whitehall hierarchy. This enabled politicians to avoid accusations of political extremism and civil servants to maintain a policy equilibrium that ministerial reshuffles or general elections would not destabilize. In this, if the political consensus on education policy of phase one is a distant memory, a new post-consensus consensualism of centrism represents a contemporary reality.</p>
<p>While the <italic>proto-centrism </italic>of the Boyle/Crossland years continues to have a vestigial manifestation, in more recent times the new centrism, while not unrelated to this earlier form of consensualism, has emerged. This, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt (2004</xref>: 294–314) argues, can be seen as taking one of four forms. In outline, <italic>pragma-centrism </italic>is characterized by a ‘common sense’ approach to policy that demonstrates its practicability and is suggestive of its acceptability to the majority of the electorate who will recognize its reasonableness. The drive for stable policy environment or policy equilibrium in which policy is less likely to be overturned following a Cabinet reshuffle or a new political administration is characterized as <italic>retro-centrism</italic>. Civil service reactions to policy options perceived to be ideological in nature, or an expression by civil servants of an alternative ideology are characterized as <italic>ideo-centrism. </italic>The centrism of the Blair administration is categorized as <italic>meta-centrism </italic>in that both socialist ideology and consensual <italic>proto-centrism </italic>appear to have been transcended by the new common policy ground of the <italic>via-media</italic>, the <italic>milieu </italic>within which civil service ‘impartiality’ and ministerial political will are most likely to coalesce. Finally <italic>meta-centrist </italic>policies tend to make the relationship between minister and civil servant relatively controversy free: as such it might be described as the ideology of non-ideology.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the views of two distinguished former senior civil servants (Patrick Nairne and William Plowden) offer insights which can be related to some of the theoretical concepts set out above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451170">Nairne (1990</xref>: 1), reflecting on a period in which ‘the political objective of rolling back the frontiers of the state (had) … contributed to lower morale in the service as a whole, to resignations by some of the most able civil servants, and to an occasional sense of alienation from ministers …’, nevertheless maintained ‘ministers can look to men and women who are professionals in the business of government and politically neutral in its discharge’. As such they (civil servants) can ‘provide an invaluable commodity – the continuity of administration to balance the discontinuity of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451170">Nairne, 1990</xref>: 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212451170">Plowden (1985</xref>: 394) is sceptical: ‘I do not believe thoughtful individuals, with their own established practices and values, can, in fact, support with equal enthusiasm governments with totally dissimilar ideologies’. That is to say there may be a good deal more <italic>ideo-centrism </italic>in Whitehall than Nairne supposes. As such Plowden questions the merits of a system in which while political administrations may change radically as a result of a general election, the civil service from ‘top to bottom’ remains largely the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212451170">Nairne, 1990</xref>: 2). Rather he (1985: 395) believes politicians should be free to carry out their policies and be judged accordingly, unobstructed by unaccountable permanent officials acting according to ‘some private conception of the national interest’ – one tending to be informed by a commitment to policy continuity (a corollary of <italic>pragma-centrism</italic>) and/or equilibrium (a corollary of <italic>retro-centrism</italic>). Given this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212451170">Plowden (1985</xref>: 413) concludes: ‘any government seriously interested in comprehensively improving its own processes, may well need to put into key positions people who share their views about the kind of changes needed. They must also neutralize people who do not. This may mean moving, demoting or prematurely retiring … those incapable of accepting or adjusting to the new approach’. Such a view is reminiscent of the approach Blunkett and Bichard took in restructuring the Department as, in their terms, they sought to make it more ‘outward looking’ during the first Labour administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 257–294). On the basis of his relatively atypical, in civil service terms, career history, Bichard has been described as ‘an un-mandarin like mandarin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 257). In contrast Hancock’s civil service career was close to the paradigm traditional case and so he has been labelled ‘the mandarin’s mandarin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 112).<sup>

</sup> Drawing on the ideas examined above, we now turn to a discussion of the shaping and making of the Education Reform Act 1988.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143212451170">
<title>Seeking the Architect of the 1988 Act</title>
<p>Three pieces of legislation are widely regarded as having fundamentally shaped the nature and structure of education in the UK over the last 100 years – the Acts of 1918, 1944 and 1988. What is contested, notably with regard to 1988, is who should be given such credit as might be appropriate. While these themes received a good deal of debate in the literature, they generated surprisingly few articles in <italic>EMAL </italic>in the years immediately before or after the passing of the Act. It is not that it has been ignored in the pages of the journal, but rather most of what has been written has had to do with the implications and outcomes of various aspects of its provision. That is to say with its legacy, a theme that was the subject of a special edition on its 20th anniversary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1741143212451170">Strain and Simkins, 2008</xref>). An article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451170">Ball and Troyna (1989)</xref> is a partial exception to this rule. Thus while it examines critically the history and ideology of the Act in order to understand what the author’s see as its threat to anti-racist initiatives, it also attempts to explore the role of key political actors including Callaghan and Thatcher to its generation and in doing so describes Kenneth Baker as its ‘architect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212451170">Ball and Troyna, 1989</xref>: 23). Was he? Who else might legitimately be regarded as such?</p>
<p>Any credible list of candidates must indeed include Baker, Secretary of State at the time. He certainly thought so, and Mark Carlisle, John MacGregor and Gillian Shephard appear inclined to acknowledge his priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 1997</xref>: 36–42). Some senior colleagues, including the prime minister and chancellor, seem less sure. Thus while Thatcher, in explaining Joseph’s departure, felt ‘What I needed was ministers who could fight battles in the media as well as in Whitehall … a first class communicator like Ken Baker was now needed at Education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451170">Thatcher, 1993</xref>: 562, 563) she was by no means happy with what was put in place. There is reason to believe she had doubted Baker‘s reliability. As Angela Rumbold, Minister of State at the time and one of the many ‘minders’ Thatcher put in place to watch over Baker (I was ‘put there to make quite sure that he [Baker] didn‘t go completely native’), recalls; ‘neither she (Thatcher) nor he (Lawson) really trusted Kenneth. They thought he was really a sort of Pinko in disguise’ (Ribbins and Sherratt, 2004: 729). Thatcher’s judgement on Baker’s legacy, particularly on the national curriculum and its testing, if rather less colourfully expressed, gives credence to this view: ‘Ken Baker paid too much attention to the DES, the HMI and progressive educational theorists in his appointments and early decisions; and once the bureaucratic momentum had begun it was difficult to stop’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451170">Thatcher, 1993</xref>: 597). If Thatcher, initially at least, had high hopes when she appointed Baker, it is clear from his memoirs and later conversations with one of the authors that Lawson never expected a substantial or worthwhile initiative to come from either department officials or Baker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451170">Lawson, 1993</xref>: 606).</p>
<p>What of the claims of other candidates – some more plausible than others? Thus in the debate on the second reading of the Bill in December 1987, Derek Fatchett identified the philosopher Roger Scruton as ‘the architect of the thinking that underpins much of the Bill …’ (Hansard Volume 123 cc771–868,  13). More persuasive is the case for two prime ministers (Jim Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher) and one chancellor (Nigel Lawson). Questioned on this, Lawson responded that ‘catalyst is more accurate than architect, because it was not precisely my building which was erected, but if it hadn’t been for me there would have been no building at all’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 2004</xref>: 731). What all the politicians acknowledge is the role of advisers in supporting such major policy initiatives. These are of two main types – political (or ‘special’) and civil service. Examples of the former relevant to the 1988 Act were Bernard Donoughue (for Callaghan), Brian Griffiths (for Thatcher) and, to a lesser degree, Tony Kerpel (for Baker). Examples of the latter include senior civil servants below the rank of permanent secretary. Lawson, for example, is generous about John Anson, an Under Secretary at the Treasury, whom he identifies as the author of the influential policy paper setting out his (Lawson) ideas on education as Chancellor on what had to be done to reform education. While Baker is less effusive on the role of his senior officials one, Nick Stuart, came to be ‘credited by many as the architect of the 1988 education reforms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451170">Curtis, 2009</xref>: 3). Taxed on this, Stuart agrees people did indeed say this, but stresses that ‘I say I was clerk of the works’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212451170">Curtis, 2009</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>What of the principal subject of our paper, the permanent secretary? With regard to the 1988 Act, the contributions of three are noted in our research. The first was James Hamilton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1741143212451170">Ribbins and Sherratt, 2012</xref>). The second was Peter Middleton, at the time at the Treasury. He was identified by Lawson as one of the group including John MacGregor, Chief Secretary, whom he enlisted to progress his ideas on educational reform. In this, perhaps Middleton’s principal contribution was to suggest to Lawson that John Anson ‘should be brought in’. What then of the third, David Hancock?</p>

<title>Sir David Hancock and the 1988 Act</title>

<title>Hancock and His Initial Views on the DES</title>
<p>Hancock was educated at Whitgift school and Balliol, Oxford, where he took a first in philosophy, politics and economics (PPE). For him, national service was a positive experience:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I had a troop of young men from Birmingham who were quite unlike anybody I had ever met before. They impressed me because they were so good at their jobs in the tanks. Some of the drivers were inspired, but they couldn’t string two sentences together. It showed me how someone with an academic, scholarly background could misjudge his fellow men.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1741143212451170">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>On graduating he was offered a post at Oxford, but preferred the civil service. After two years at the Board of Trade, he was transferred to the Treasury. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451170">Lawson (1993</xref>: 20) describes him as ‘a particularly able Treasury official’, and claims that at the time of the imminent retirement of Douglas Wass, the permanent secretary, he was a serious candidate to succeed him suggesting that he ‘would almost certainly have won a treasury vote’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451170">Lawson, 1993</xref>: 267). For reasons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212451170">Sherratt (2004</xref>: 116–119) explains, his candidature was blocked personally by Margaret Thatcher. Offered the post of second permanent secretary at the Treasury, Hancock declined, and opted instead for the DES: ‘I think it was Robert Armstrong who decided that the DES was the place for me. That was because there was no natural successor’. This concerned him ‘because there were some very able people at the DES but the Department didn’t quite mesh in with Whitehall … that was the reason why so many permanent secretaries were bought in from other departments’.</p>
<p>This was not a view widely shared by senior politicians. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451170">Baker (1993</xref>: 166) ‘Moving from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Education and Science at the time was like moving from the manager’s job at Arsenal to Charlton. You crossed the River Thames and dropped down two divisions’. What did Baker think of the permanent secretary he inherited from Keith Joseph? His biography makes only three references to Hancock of which the one substantial entry describes him as ‘the nominal Head of Department’ who deferred on school matters to a powerful deputy secretary (Walter Ulrich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451170">Baker, 1993</xref>: 166–167). Later he came to make a far more appreciative view of the merits of his senior official, rating him as ‘a class act … I suppose he got Education as a consolation prize but he made it an infinitely more interesting job than had he been permanent secretary of the Treasury because when he was there we changed everything in education … (He was) undoubtedly a premier division permanent secretary’ and ‘the status of the Department improved enormously in his time’. What did Hancock think of the DES?</p>
<p>Hancock described the DES culture as unlike anything he had experienced previously:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The Treasury will happily interfere in anything, given half a chance. The DES seemed determined to interfere in nothing and I found this difficult to get used to. I felt they were terribly passive and urged them to take a more active role.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>He found it frustrating that DES officials appeared non-committal on important policy issues. Citing science policy, the Department, behaved:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>like a post office. They never had views of their own about anything. I found this very odd. I expected officials to appraise the advice the Department was receiving and make its own recommendations to the minister. I remember making some great scientists extremely cross by making it clear that I expected to give the Secretary of State independent advice and not simply pass on what they said. This is what the Treasury does the whole time. The DES tended not to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In addition, he saw the DES as a department working with people outside, essentially through the local authorities. It did not expect to implement policy itself, its policies were disposed towards guidance rather than direction. This was about to change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1741143212451170">
<title>Hancock’s Views on the Need for Reform in Education</title>
<p>This happened in part as a result of internal developments in the department, notably Sir Keith Joseph’s passionate concern for the need to raise standards in schools and a growing belief that although the government should not legislate for the curriculum, it ought, unlike all governments since the 1940s, ‘to have views about such things and ought not to be totally passive’. However, a more significant factor shaping the climate in which educational policy was to be determined was a growing radicalism at the centre of government leading to a re-configuration within a framework of control which was to subsume decision making at national, local and institutional levels. This changing context meant that ‘the traditional balance of autonomy, power and accountability in education (was) being redefined’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212451170">Ranson 1980</xref>: 3) and this was to be sharp-focused in the 1988 Act.</p>
<p>On the broader issue, Hancock wrote to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451170">Lawson (1993</xref>: 20) in 1979 (while still at the Treasury) describing the government as the most radical since the War – ‘radical in the sense of making a break with what has gone immediately before’. Asked if radical was a term that he would also apply to the education reforms of the government, he replied ‘With Baker, yes, but not before.’ Pressed on specifically which elements of Conservative education policy he would classify as such his response suggests that he regarded some aspects as more than radical:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>The National Curriculum was <italic>revolutionary</italic> without the slightest doubt. Delegating budgets to schools was new but it wasn’t revolutionary. The National Curriculum was revolutionary because up until then the apparatus of the State had not been used to determine the curriculum. (Emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Baker, himself, regarded the 1988 Act as on an equivalent standing with Butler’s Act of 1944 and as ‘the biggest single measure of social reform which was undertaken during the Thatcher years’ (Ribbins and Sherratt, 1997: 115). Without questioning its significance, Hancock’s judgement is rather more modest describing it as the most important <italic>educational </italic>reform of the Thatcher years. As such, for him, ‘the four things that were fundamental changes were the National Curriculum, creating the polytechnics as autonomous institutions, delegation of budgets and grant maintained schools – these were radical changes’. With the possible exception of the grant maintained policy, it is likely that Hancock empathized with these developments.</p>
<p>On a personal level, Hancock was particularly ‘strongly in favour’ of the introduction of a National Curriculum and so in what follows we will focus on this aspect of the Act:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Firstly, I couldn’t see any way of improving performance unless performance could be objectively measured. Secondly, the evidence of endless HMI reports was that the curriculum in some schools was arbitrary and truncated … most primary schools didn’t teach Science at all before the National Curriculum. Technology … was seriously neglected by most schools even though well taught by a few. Pupils chose subjects for very arbitrary reasons … The first fundamental principle of the 1988 Act was that all children should be taught a broad and balanced curriculum, the second was that their performance should be assessed and measured.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While Baker clearly came to support the idea of a National Curriculum it has been suggested that this had for some time been an established policy agenda among civil servants at the DES. Stuart Sexton, special adviser to Mark Carlisle and Keith Joseph between 1979–1989, claims that ‘Civil servants had tried out the idea of a national curriculum on both Shirley Williams and on Mark Carlisle, but they wouldn’t hear of it.’ While they had more success with Keith Joseph, even he was no supporter of an <italic>imposed </italic>national curriculum and indeed was the only Tory peer to vote against the National Curriculum proposals in the House of Lords. A national curriculum, Sexton postulated, would give officials direct control of schools and thus a rationale for intervention at all levels. Hancock contests such claims arguing that to say ‘officials advocated a national curriculum because they wanted direct control of schools is quite wrong’: rather they wanted it because ‘it would mean that all children would be taught a broad and balanced curriculum and their performance would be assessed and measured’. Furthermore, while affirming the idea of state intervention in curriculum content was anathema to Joseph, he denies Sexton’s assertion that the ‘the same civil servants who had failed to sell their idea to previous Secretaries of State then sold Baker their plan for a national curriculum to solve the problem of poor standards’ by stressing ‘Baker wanted a national curriculum’ and describing how this came about.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1741143212451170">
<title>Hancock’s Role in the Making of the Reform Act 1988</title>
<p>Prior to the 1987 election, the Conservative Party commissioned research on public attitudes finding, for the first time, that discontent with schools was a primary concern. From this, Hancock recounts that Baker decided the answer was a national curriculum which he then announced ‘without telling any of us in his usual typical fashion’, and it then went into the Manifesto. When the Conservatives were returned they ‘had a mandate for doing it … We then had to draft the Bill and it was extremely hard work. Baker was very, very good about going through the detail … making sure he approved of every single line of it. We used to go through the draft line by line at endless meetings’. In his turn, Baker also recalls how he and Hancock collaborated:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We worked very closely together. I must have seen him once, twice or even three times every day … David always made quite sure that the Department was totally behind everything that I was doing. That is a very good thing for a Secretary of State to know … Not all the Department was in favour of the National Curriculum but I think probably the majority were. David had a big role in bringing the Department to back it, and in particular in giving resources to those parts of the Department which we had to sort of invent to get the National Curriculum up and running. David made sure the administrative back-up was there.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The depiction of Baker pouring over the minutiae of the Bill is a far cry from the view of him as taking a very broad brush approach, leaving others to slave over the detail that both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1741143212451170">Thatcher (1993</xref>: 589) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212451170">Lawson (1993</xref>: 606) portray. As an example of Baker’s attention to detail, Hancock cites his dispatching of HMI to investigate the organization of the German state curriculum. On returning, HMI stressed that the German curriculum was supported because the authorities had painstakingly consulted the public. So when Baker produced his Bill, this was drawn up in terms of an elaborate consultation process. As Hancock notes: ‘That’s something which appears to have passed unnoticed by quite a lot of people. It didn’t prescribe the National Curriculum in detail – it set up a procedure for consulting over it.’ Ironically, this resulted in overburdening schools through ‘trying to pour a quart into a pint pot’. As such the National Curriculum was anything but a broad brush policy which meant Baker found himself having to take on the Prime Minister ‘to persuade her to allow him to implement a policy to which he was personally committed’. For her part Thatcher was not enthusiastic about this aspect of his agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212451170">Baker, 1993</xref>: 194–197) hankering instead for a restrictive national curriculum with paper and pencil tests. Hancock agrees, believing that she wanted the National Curriculum confined to maths, English and science. For his part, Baker was determined to resist this because, in part, of evidence from HMI that teachers tended to teach for the test. Thus if he confined legislation to these three subjects, others would be neglected. Baker is a historian and, according to Hancock, really did believe in the humanities as a whole. The Act was therefore drawn up in terms of three core subjects – maths, English and science – and the other foundation subjects. But as Hancock explains:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>If you read it carefully you will see that there is no substantive difference between the three core subjects and the other foundation subjects. The distinction was his way of getting a broad curriculum past the PM. He caused me endless amusement. The whole Department supported him on the broad and balanced curriculum … he managed it brilliantly. He got his way.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Insofar as Hancock expresses reservations on Baker, these focus on what he saw as the latter’s rather grudging appreciation of his officials (notably Eric Bolton, Senior Chief Inspector; Walter Ulrich, Deputy Secretary for Schools; Jenny Bacon, Under Secretary for Curriculum Policy) and the contribution they made to the Act. Bolton and Ulrich are each referred to only twice in <italic>The Turbulent Years</italic>, and Bacon is not mentioned. As Hancock puts it: ‘I’ve never seen briefing of higher quality than the briefing that ministers got for the debates when the Bill went through the House. The Baker/Lawson idea that the DES was a second-rate department I think is completely wrong.’ Yet in discussions with the authors Baker was more fulsome in his praise than he is in print about the Department and especially about his Permanent Secretary:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought it [the briefing] was exceptionally good. I think the preparation by the Department of the Bill was exceptionally high calibre stuff. It was a very complicated Bill, obviously, very controversial in lots of ways and he (Hancock) made my life a lot easier. Jenny Bacon was good. Very thorough.</p>
<p>He (Hancock) led the Department at a very difficult time when there was an enormous turmoil going on. Because quite apart from the Education Reform Bill and the consequences of that, which were immense, there were all sorts of crises like the teachers’ strike … coupled with various pay rounds which were very awkward, troublesome and difficult to handle. David Hancock kept the Department very steady throughout all that turmoil. And during his time, there was no-back biting against me … I think David was very committed to the great changes in education that we were bringing in. That was my feeling; he was personally committed and felt that the reforms were right, the right things to be done. He wasn’t just appeasing me … We soldiered on together …</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article has examined from a UK perspective the field of study termed LAMPS describing it as two separate but related fields – ‘Management‘ and ‘Policy’. In it we argue that <italic>both </italic>fields undervalue the merits of the humanistic domain and so have been inclined to minimize the part played by people. To illustrate the possibilities of an approach which brings history and people centre stage we draw on research into policymakers in which we have been engaged. To date our publications have focused on politicians but having studied the praxis of recent DES permanent secretaries as they and others have understood their role in the function of government, this article is the first of its kind to examine analytically the hitherto somewhat impenetrable, and consequently relatively under-researched, realm of the Whitehall mandarin. It focuses on aspects of Sir David Hancock’s thinking about, and contribution to, the Education Reform Act 1988. To make sense of the role of senior civil servants, a model is outlined based on notions of ‘centrism’. Applying this to Hancock in terms of his interest and involvement in key aspects of the Act would suggest: (1) on the National Curriculum, given a strong interest, involvement and commitment, his role can be defined as entrepreneurial and as such <italic>pragma-centrist</italic>; (2) on the Local Management of Schools, which he favoured strongly, his involvement was a mix of <italic>pragma-centrist </italic>and <italic>retro-centrist</italic>; and (3) on Grant Maintained Schools, upon which he had little to say, appeared to have no strong personal involvement, but doubted the merits of, his perspective might be seen as <italic>retro-centrist</italic>. How, then, might his overall role be labelled? We suggest ‘principal project manager’. In conclusion, we hope we have said enough to encourage others to study the place of senior civil servants in the making of educational policy and in doing so use an approach that is, at least in part, humanistic.</p>

<p>The Department and its senior minister have had many titles. To avoid confusion we will use the terms ’DES’ and ’Secretary of State (for Education)’.</p>

<p>Bichard and Bell are atypical in other ways; neither was a career civil servant, both having enjoyed successful careers elsewhere. Bell is unusual for two further reasons. Only he had a substantial career as an educationalist (primary school headteacher, chief education officer). He is the first permanent secretary since William Pile to have been promoted from within the DES (from chief inspector).</p>

<p>An unusual background does not necessarily entail a commitment to the views advocated by Plowden and enacted by Bichard. Bell, for example, has had an even more atypical career history than Bichard but this has not prevented him from expressing commitment to a classic conception of the role of permanent secretary.</p>
