<body>
<p>Similar to our predecessors and those before them for the past decade, our editorial team has assumed leadership of the <italic>Journal of Teacher Education</italic> (<italic>JTE</italic>) in times of extreme criticism of educational research and of both preservice and inservice teacher education. Critics from within like Arthur Levine proclaim that “everything is broken” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487111424891">Levine, 2011</xref>), that there is little research into what kind of training produces successful teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487111424891">Levine, 2011</xref>), and that schools of education lack both rigor and relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487111424891">Levine, 2006</xref>). Headlines from <italic>The New York Times</italic> proclaim “Training of Teachers is Flawed . . . ” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487111424891">Lewin, 2011</xref>) or “Teacher Training Termed Mediocre” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487111424891">Medina, 2009</xref>). One article features anecdotal evidence in support of an alternative teacher education program while citing an economist who claims “no research he can think of has shown a teacher-training program to boost student achievement. So why invest in training when, as he told me recently, ‘you could be throwing your money away’?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487111424891">Green, 2010</xref>). Educational research, and particularly research in teacher education, clearly is in crisis. The refrains of “no conclusive evidence” and “little research exists . . . ” are all too common in our handbooks and research reports (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487111424891">Cochran-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111424891">Wilson, Floden, &amp; Ferrini-Mundy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This criticism influenced our vision for the journal as <italic>JTE</italic> is in a unique position to shape how teacher education, and more specifically how research in teacher education, is viewed both within and outside the profession. The journal has a well-deserved reputation of publishing quality scholarship in teacher education, with a standing of 18 out of 177 education and education research journals based on impact in the field of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487111424891">Thompson Reuters, 2011</xref>). Our challenge is to build on this foundation with the ultimate goal of publishing quality research that points the way to excellent teacher education practice and constructive policies. If we make progress in attaining this critical goal, we would also make great strides toward establishing teacher education as a distinct field with knowledge, histories, research methodologies, and practices that are recognized and recognizable. Reaching the goal requires a balance of a range of content and topics; diversity of voices represented by teacher education researchers, practitioners, and policy makers; attention to both preservice and inservice teacher education; and sensitivity to providing an outlet for beginning authors as well as for those who have a long history of publishing in teacher education.</p>
<p>We hope to bring together the three dimensions of teacher education—practice, policy, and research—in challenging and productive ways so that considerations of issues or challenges in teacher education are enriched by careful attention from these multiple frames of reference. Our audience consists largely of teacher education practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in national and international contexts. For teacher education practitioners who do not do research, or for teacher education researchers who do not engage in the practice of teacher education, the connections may sometimes be weak. When teacher education researchers are also practitioners, the connection between research and practice may be strong but may lack a policy perspective. Policy makers, however, may lack a concrete grounding in the everyday realities of practice. We need all three perspectives to address the complex problems facing teacher education today. <italic>JTE</italic> provides a forum to highlight relationships among all three perspectives.</p>
<p>We are particularly aware of the power of policy as the bridge that links research and practice in teacher education. Although we are separate and independent from our parent organization, the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education (AACTE), in our ability to manage the direction and focus of the content of the journal through the use of the double-blind, peer-review process and our selection of themes and special issues, we recognize the power of collaborating with AACTE in matters related to policy. The Guest Editorial by AACTE President Sharon Robinson in our first issue (Volume 62:5) represents what we hope will be the inauguration of a forum for discussion of policy implications related to research in teacher education.</p>
<p>Putting our rhetoric into reality is challenging. The sheer number of manuscripts—more than 700 per year—is overwhelming even for a relatively large editorial team with diverse expertise and interests. However, our immersion in the recent work being done in the field has provided insights into the important questions that can and should be addressed by research; the issues that lend themselves to discussion of values, historical precedent, or related bodies of research; and the barriers to achieving our goal of publishing quality scholarship recognized both within and outside the field. We have also become more cognizant of the existing strengths that we can build on to accomplish the goal. The following sections provide a glimpse at the conversations we are having in this area that we plan to expand in future editorials and through your participation in theme issues, special issues, and contributions to open-topic issues over the next few years.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022487111424891">
<title>The Problem of Identity in Teacher Education Research</title>
<p>Much of the criticism of teacher education focuses on the overall lack of rigor and relevance of research studies, which fail to provide the knowledge base needed to address issues of policy and practice. Although this criticism is often directed toward research on teaching, research on teacher education is considered to be even much less advanced—an “orphan” of mainstream research on teaching and research on higher education which has developed in isolation from its “parents” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487111424891">Grossman &amp; McDonald, 2008</xref>, p. 185). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487111424891">Ball and Forzani (2007)</xref> suggest that the low status of education research causes education faculty to emulate work in other social science domains. Therefore, many studies focus on phenomena merely related to education and not on the multiple interactions “inside” education which constitute the instructional dynamic that is the defining and unique feature of education and thus of education research. Drawing from research in organizational behavior, they propose two tests for the potential contribution of studies in education research: the education centrality test and the core competence test. If we reframe this for teacher education research, the centrality test asks how much you would know about teacher education if you learned everything there was to know about the topic of study. The core competence test asks whether the topic of the study is one which teacher education researchers have unique knowledge that researchers in related sciences would be unlikely to have. We have found that so many of the manuscripts we receive are about teaching or about teachers or use preservice teacher education students or inservice teachers as the sample—but they are not about teacher education. A nod may be given to implications for teacher education in a few perfunctory sentences at the end, but the complex considerations about the applicability of the findings for the instructional dynamics of teacher education contexts is missing and left to the reader to supply. Even when the topic is clearly the purview of teacher education, such as comparing different trajectories toward certification, many studies fail the teacher education centrality and core competence tests. Studies that merely label programs and ignore the range of features and their interactions with students and contexts do not contribute significantly to our understanding of the various pathways in teacher education. Our upcoming theme issue in Volume 63:3 addresses the need to go beyond the teacher certification program debate and to examine the more complex issue of the nature and quality of features that contribute to program outcomes. Similarly, studies conducted by economists without considering the instructional dynamics of teacher education may be valuable to other economists but may not sufficiently unpack the complexity of the phenomena so that the study is useful for teacher educators. We hope that our theme issue for Volume 63:5, which examines the complexity of assessment and accountability in teacher education, will deepen the conversation around this topic beyond a mere “accounting” approach.</p>
<p>The tendency to appropriate, sometimes inappropriately, the methods and questions of other fields and domains due to the low standing of teacher education research has resulted in an identity crisis that undermines the value of teacher education and our status as researchers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487111424891">Labaree (2008)</xref> cites identity problems stemming from the transformation of teacher education from normal schools to colleges and universities early in the 20th century. The struggle then, as now, was between relevance, tied to the professional mission of teacher education, and rigor, tied to the academic mission of universities. As faculty in teacher education opted to emulate their academically oriented colleagues in other departments to gain academic credibility within the university, they lost relevance and risked extinction. If teacher education research can be done in other disciplines at the university, do we need researchers in the school of education? However, if we view teacher education research as an endeavor requiring specialized knowledge and skills to bridge theory and practice, we have a responsibility for nurturing existing researchers in this area and building capacity in others to expand the knowledge base in teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487111424891">Ball &amp; Forzani, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have discussed the tension between rigor and relevance in our editorial meetings, we have gained insights into our own tensions as editors of a journal dedicated to teacher education research. We bemoan the fact that many content-area education researchers, researchers who engage in teacher education in their own universities, almost exclusively submit their research that could potentially benefit teacher education to specialized content journals—journals that may or may not be read by teacher educators. Clearly, faculty who walk in two university worlds—for example, both science education and teacher education—have choices to make about their identities as researchers. Could we benefit from encouraging content-area education researchers to frame their work from the “inside” teacher education perspective discussed previously and viewing the <italic>JTE</italic> as an outlet for that work?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0022487111424891">
<title>Building a Strong Teacher Education Research Structure</title>
<p>Although the problem of identity may impact the status and relevance of teacher education research, issues related to the structure of the knowledge base depict a more compelling problem. As we considered the criticisms of the rigor of teacher education research, found both within and outside the field of teacher education, we concluded that rigor, although definitely a problem, was not the only problem—perhaps not even the most serious problem. Numerous reports and articles have documented the weaknesses and provided direction for improvement of educational research in general and teacher education research in particular (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487111424891">Cochran-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487111424891">Feuer, Towne, &amp; Shavelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111424891">Kaestle, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487111424891">Lin, Wang, Klecka, O’Dell, &amp; Spalding, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487111424891">Moss et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487111424891">National Research Council, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487111424891">Wilson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487111424891">Zeichner, 2005</xref>). While we receive a large number of weak research manuscripts, we also receive many strong ones that reflect the focus on rigor emphasized in these publications. Nevertheless, in a recent response to the National Center for Teacher Quality (NCTQ) report of the status of teacher education programs, the president of the National Council for Accreditation in Teacher Education (NCATE) acknowledges the “fact that the knowledge-base from research on best practices in preparing teachers is not as robust as in some other professions such as medicine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487111424891">Cibulka, 2011</xref>). Yet the body of medical research he invokes has been heavily criticized for flawed studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487111424891">Freedman, 2010</xref>) but does not suffer the “awful reputation of educational research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487111424891">Kaestle, 1993</xref>). Flawed educational research, similar to flawed medical research, is more often than not either exposed or ignored by editors, reviewers, and scholars who scrutinize the work. If this is the case, why do we lack the robust body of research needed to respond to reports like the NCTQ?</p>
<p>In teacher education, our problem is with designing and building the structure to represent a strong knowledge base. As we discussed this dilemma over time, we began to refer to it as “the problem with the bricks.” If we think of our knowledge base as a structure consisting of individual bricks—studies that researchers contribute—we need to attend to both the quality and positioning of the bricks. The construction task is twofold. First, we must manufacture the bricks, that is, sound studies with rigorous methods that pass the teacher education centrality and core competence tests and address important questions in teacher education. Second, we must connect the bricks into a well-designed structure that frames research, practice, and policy. In this early period of our editorial work, we have seen isolated piles of bricks but the mortar—the substance that creates connections among those bricks so that a coherent whole emerges—is frequently missing. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487111424891">Poincare (1905)</xref> puts it, “Science is built up of facts as a house is of stones, but a collection of facts is no more a science than a pile of stones is a house.” (p. 141). Although part of the problem may be due to the nature of teacher education as a low-consensus field in relation to research goals and methods, the lack of connections in many areas cannot be attributed totally to our diversity. In our year of work with the journal, we have found that many studies appear to be convenience research—research that presents itself in connection with a course, or a program, or an inservice session faculty are involved in—with little prior thought as to how the study fits into the larger knowledge base and what questions to ask of the situation that build on previous theory and research. Other studies could be labeled bandwagon research—studies on topics that are deemed publishable because they have been accepted in the various teacher education journals and conferences—but without in-depth consideration of how yet another study on this topic contributes to our understanding of the phenomenon. As the authors of various reviews of research in teacher education have most likely concluded, trying to put those bricks together in a meaningful way without a coherent blueprint to guide construction is a daunting task. As editors, we would urge authors not only to pay attention to the methodological rigor of the study but also to provide more reflection and discussion on how the findings can be situated within the knowledge base on teacher education.</p>

<title>Highlights of the Current Issue</title>
<p>The topic areas of the articles that have appeared in <italic>JTE</italic> over the years are typically broad and represent diverse orientations toward preservice and inservice teacher education as well as diverse methodologies for studying them. The five articles in this issue follow that pattern and exemplify varied genres, topics, and methodologies. Each article represents an individual “brick” in the structure we described in the previous section—one that is carefully constructed and situated within the larger body of teacher education research and theory. Two of the articles provide theoretical/conceptual approaches to issues in teacher education, two employ quantitative methods, and one uses qualitative case study. The topics are varied as well and include research and perspectives on alternative certification, teaching performance assessment, critical feminist body pedagogy, and readiness of preservice candidates for family–school partnerships.</p>
<p>The first article examines the paradox that surrounds Teach for America’s (TFA) success at placing high-quality college graduates in low-status teaching jobs. Adam Maier examines existing explanations of TFA’s success at recruiting and carefully constructs the argument based on credentialism theory that the combination of targeting noneducation majors from prestigious universities; maintaining selectivity; and providing abundant resources, networking structures, and access to more prestigious career paths creates a unique credential for participants. However, the nature of the credential makes it difficult to generalize TFA’s approach to staffing urban schools to other programs and ultimately may be of limited value to teacher education. His careful consideration of research and theory to explain the phenomena provides an example of the complexity of thought needed in the field.</p>
<p>Also addressing issues in alternative certification, the study by Ayana Kee begins to move in the direction we have advocated for our upcoming theme issue in that it examines the role of preparation program features, and not just program types, for beginning teacher outcomes. The study also contributes to our understanding of this area through its use of a statistical method that ameliorates the effects of participant selection bias inherent in most studies of alternative and traditional programs. The recognition that the impact of particular preparation programs depends on the interaction of teacher characteristics, program features, and the setting in which the beginning teacher is located is another example of consideration of complexity in teacher education.</p>
<p>The third article by Judith Sandholtz and Lauren Shea focuses on an area of intense interest by both practitioners and policy makers—the use of performance assessments of teacher candidates. The study examines the extent to which university supervisors who have had prolonged contact with teacher candidates and trained raters conducting the assessment of the capstone teaching event agree on scores. The discussion surrounding the finding that supervisors’ and scorers’ ratings did not always correspond and that supervisors were unable to predict high and low scorers provides a number of directions for future research on performance assessment. The discussion also underscores the need to fully understand the intended and unintended consequences of policy decisions.</p>
<p>The article by Hilary Hughes-Decatur and Stephanie Jones serves to remind us that the curriculum of teacher education is not restricted to content knowledge and acquisition of pedagogical expertise—and that teachers have influence far beyond students’ performance on standardized tests. The authors advocate for the notion that “bodies are pedagogy” and that critical feminist body pedagogy can enable teacher education students to become more comfortable with their own bodies and ultimately help future young children also feel comfortable with their bodies.</p>
<p>The final article in this issue by Joan Walker and Benjamin Dotger explores the use of text-based case studies and videos of simulated parent–teacher conferences to determine teacher candidates’ readiness to interact with families about their students. The study stands out in two ways. First, the authors contribute to our knowledge about family–school communication through development of a “gold-standard” definition that can be used in other studies. Second, Walker and Dotger provide a detailed description of the materials development and content validation in the study that strengthens the rigor of the research.</p>
<p>We hope that the articles in the first issue of Volume 63 stimulate your thinking about the specific topics discussed and also about their place in the overall knowledge base in teacher education. The quality and placement of the “bricks” within this knowledge base will remain a major emphasis during our term as editors and we invite you to participate in our efforts to increase understanding of all aspects of preservice and inservice teacher education. The discussions provided by contributors to this issue provide a number of promising directions for further study, and we encourage you to continue the conversations they have initiated. We look forward to receiving your best manuscripts as well as your ideas directed toward improvement of teacher education research in general and of the <italic>JTE</italic> specifically.</p>
