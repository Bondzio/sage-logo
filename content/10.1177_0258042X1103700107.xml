<p>This book written by Vineet Nayar, President, HCL Technologies, one of the top five IT Services firms based out of India. He had 20 years of experience in HCL and was the CEO of Comnet, an intra-preneurial venture operating within HCL. The journey that was led by Vinnet in transforming the services firm from competing on price in the lower end to a solution provider that delivered superb customer value is presented by him in a very simple and absorbing style. By 2009, HCL had totally changed its business model, tripled its annual revenues and was ranked as India’s best employer by Hewitt. He had introduced a very unique management culture called Employees First, Customers Second (EFCS).</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, the author describes the difficulty of making a realistic account of a company’s current standing especially when it is growing at a healthy pace of 30 per cent per year. All firms have clarity about where they are going but not much is known where exactly they stand today. Looking oneself in the mirror and diagnosing what is not shining is an important starting point. This process the author calls Mirror, Mirror. The process of self assessment, introspection and frank dialogue was carried out by the new CEO in large groups in the first two weeks of assuming the role of the president. He carried out town hall meetings in various locations and listened to the voice of employees and their preparedness to transform the firm. The author has categorized employees into three groups, transformers, lost souls and fence sitters. Transformers are suffocated by the complacency of the firm and want changes for the better. The lost souls are the ones who have lot of negative energy and see no improvement in the situation, but they see themselves as realists and truth teller. The largest group is that of fence sitters who watched the tussle between the transformers and lost souls. The task of the leader is to identify the transformers and make them spread the process. In a service dominated knowledge sector, frontline employees play a critical role in delivering value to customers. In fact large part of the value is created by them. The author refers to the interface between employees and customers as the value zone and believes in the power of employees first and customers second approach.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2 titled Trust through Transparency, the author delineates the role of informal communication; get together, town hall meetings in developing blue prints to reach the envisioned future. How can HCL technologies play the role of partners rather than one of the suppliers? The collaboration with the top 100 managers helped the firm develop a strategy to compete against global leaders like IBM, Accenture and EDS.</p>
<p>The Employees First, Customers Second approach hinges on transparency, positive energy and passion of employees. Transparency helps to ensure that all the stake holders have a deep and personal commitment to the objectives of the organization. The Gen-Y members of the workforce believe in transparency and sharing of the reality with all. Here the author explains how sharing of financial data extensively within and across groups improves their trust in top management.</p>
<p>The opening up of an online forum, (Ux1) where any employee could raise any question with the leadership team helped in fostering the cultures of open conversation. Though in initial days lot of suppressed emotions came out in the open, it helped in having open and honest conversation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, the author describes how his team built an inverted organizational pyramid. The transfer of value zone from the R&amp;D centers and manufacturing to the frontline employees calls for a shift of emphasis. He raised the question of making the boss accountable to the value zone. It was done by categorizing positions into three types: the enabling function, the managerial chain and the influencers. The Smart Service Desk (SSD) was set up to allow anyone in the organization to lodge a complaint or make a suggestion by opening a ticket online. A manager has to respond to the ticket within a specific timeline to the satisfaction of the employee who opened the ticket. This effectively puts the managers in the service of frontline employees. On an average about 30,000 tickets per month were getting opened and resolved. The author describes this as a victory for honesty, transparency and openness. In the next phase instead of resolving the issues rose, an attempt was made to determine the root causes of the frequent problems and to find ways to fix them.</p>
<p>A comprehensive 360 degree performance review system which was in place was made more inclusive with everyone on board from the span of influence. It encouraged employees to give feedback to their managers and see the reviews were made public. When the CEO posted his 360 degree appraisal on the intranet, it encouraged others managers to do the same. By carefully implementing an instrument called happy feet, the traditional hierarchy was weakened and the people who worked outside the line of control was recognized and rewarded. It helped in redefining important zones based on spans of influence rather than zones of control. Thus 360 degree survey was used as a developmental tool rather than one of evaluation.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4, instead of the conventional reviewing and finalization of the business plan by the corporate office, how the entire process was turned upside down with a decentralized process one is presented here. The author uses a metaphor of the starfish and the spider, the centralized companies function like the eight legged spiders. When its head is cut off it is dead, but cut off arm of a starfish it will grow a new one. Unlike spiders, starfish are decentralized. When he asked top 100 managers to make video recording of their plans and post them on online portal which could be reviewed by other managers, it brought superior formulation and communication of ideas. With the comments and suggestions received from others, the plans become more specific and accurate. Here the author concludes how passionate responsible employees can transform their professional and personal lives. Thus the EFCS principle not only released a massive amount of energy from the employees but helped their customers derive higher levels of value.</p>
<p>In the 5th and final Chapter the author talks about the relevance of EFCS model in recessionary times or when the situation gets tough. When the employees are engaged to find answers to tackle recession and downturn, they feel included and conceive of innovative initiatives to create more excitement in the customer interface.</p>
<p>The Employees First, Customers Second concept helped in breaking down the barrier between personal and professional lives making their work more meaningful. When employees are empowered and trusted they become more accountable and contribute to value zone thus enhancing customers’ satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is a great hands on book with lots of implementation tactics for inverting the organizational pyramid. The guidelines organizational pyramid making the employees energized for a cause worth pursuing and delivering superior values to customers.</p>
