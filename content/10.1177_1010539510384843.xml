<abstract>
<p>A mixed-methods approach study was conducted at an ambulatory HIV health care facility in Sydney during 2007/2008. A quantitative self-administered structured questionnaire survey (phase 1) was conducted to assess client satisfaction levels, followed by qualitative semistructured interviews (phase 2) to investigate reasons for satisfaction/dissatisfaction and unmet needs. The mean overall satisfaction score of the 166 respondents in phase 1 was high (86 out of 100). Participants were most satisfied with the “knowledge” and “attitudes” of health care providers (HCP) and “maintenance of confidentiality.” They were least satisfied with “waiting time before consultation.” “Knowledge of HCP” and “rapport, care, and trust towards HCP” emerged as most important aspects of satisfaction. The broad range of HCP and services provided at one location was particularly appreciated. Health care service evaluation by assessing client satisfaction using mixed methods provided valuable insight into health care service quality. It can be applied to a broader range of health care services.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Patient satisfaction studies for evaluating health care services are viewed as the ultimate validation of the quality of care provided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510384843">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510384843">2</xref></sup> The information obtained from patients helps health care providers (HCPs) identify potential areas of improvement, such as program planning, patient education, and follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510384843">3</xref></sup> Patient satisfaction levels can be used as indicators of health care quality because patients with higher satisfaction are more likely to cooperate and have a high level of continuity with their HCP, which often results in improved clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510384843">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510384843">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patient satisfaction research in ambulatory HIV health care facilities is particularly relevant from the point of view of public health services quality, for several reasons. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the natural course of HIV/AIDS, and consequently, people with HIV/AIDS are living longer and receive HIV health care services over a longer period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510384843">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510384843">8</xref></sup> In addition, the chronic nature of HIV has resulted in more of these people being managed in outpatient settings, which uses more ambulatory HIV health care services than inpatient services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510384843">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510384843">10</xref></sup> Albion Street Centre (ASC) in Sydney, the largest HIV ambulatory health care center in Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510384843">11</xref></sup> recorded a 68% increase in the number of clients from 1996 to 2007,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510384843">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510384843">13</xref></sup> and New South Wales Health reported a 35% decline in use of HIV inpatient services from 1996 to 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384843">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, with high rates of comorbidities and complications, people living with HIV/AIDs (PLWHA) usually require services (such as psychological and nutritional counseling) at ambulatory HIV health care facilities as well as medical services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384843">7</xref></sup> The broad range of health care professionals involved and the range of services provided through ambulatory HIV health care facilities warrant targeted patient satisfaction evaluations to monitor the quality of health care provided by these services.</p>
<p>There are some gaps in the current HIV patient satisfaction research literature. In particular, few patient satisfaction surveys have been conducted in ambulatory HIV health care settings because of confidentiality constraints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510384843">14</xref></sup> Also, the majority of existing patient satisfaction surveys have only assessed overall satisfaction levels and paid little attention to satisfaction of specific aspects, whereas other researchers, for example Donabedian,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539510384843">15</xref></sup> have viewed satisfaction determinants as multidimensional. In addition, no published study has investigated the relationship between HIV patient characteristics and their satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>The aims of this study were to evaluate service quality through assessing client satisfaction level and to identify specific sources of dissatisfaction or unmet needs in order to improve client satisfaction and quality of health care provided in ASC. The word “client” is used in this study instead of “patient” because HIV-negative clients were also included.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1010539510384843" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study was conducted in 2 phases, using quantitative and qualitative mixed-methods approaches. The findings of the quantitative self-administered structured questionnaire survey in phase 1 provided an overall picture of client satisfaction levels. The qualitative semistructured interviews in phase 2 enabled specific sources of satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) and unmet needs to be investigated in greater depth. Respondents/participants were adult clients receiving HIV or sexual health services at the ASC in Sydney. A detailed description of the methodology used is available in a separate publication,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539510384843">16</xref></sup> which demonstrated the advantages of using mixed-methods over using quantitative surveys only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510384843">17</xref></sup> or qualitative interviews only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510384843">18</xref></sup> Ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney and the South Eastern Sydney &amp; Illawara Area Health Service, New South Wales.</p>
<sec id="section3-1010539510384843">
<title>Phase 1: The Quantitative Survey</title>
<p>The questionnaire—ASC Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (ASC-CSQ)—was constructed for this survey based on an extensive literature review, particularly on Ware’s 6 dimensions of measuring patient satisfaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510384843">19</xref></sup> Draft versions were developed collaboratively by the centre staff and were piloted with 11 centre clients. The final questionnaire consists of basic demographic questions, questions on satisfaction, including 6 overall aspects (location, physical environment, and maintenance of confidentiality) and 10 individual aspects (concerning clients’ experiences during consultations), and questions on their importance. The satisfaction and importance questions were rated on a 5-point Likert scale for each category of centre staff that clients had consulted in the past 6 months. The categories include receptionists and HCPs (doctors, nurses, pharmacists, psychologists, and nutritionists). To minimise selection bias, the field researcher was stationed in the waiting area in July 2007 and invited every client to take part. The self-administered questionnaires were collected in a central collection box at the reception.</p>
<p>The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, SPSS Inc, Chicago IL) for Windows 13.0 was used to analyse the quantitative survey data. For each aspect surveyed, the “mean satisfaction score,” the “percentage of satisfied respondents,” and the “importance score” were calculated. An overall ASC-CSQ satisfaction score for each respondent was calculated by combining each of their mean satisfaction scores using a formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539510384843">20</xref></sup> One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the differences between mean satisfaction scores in client groups with different demographic characteristics. Content analysis was used to analyse responses to the 2 open-ended questions about suggestions for service improvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539510384843">
<title>Phase 2: The Qualitative Interviews</title>
<p>The qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted between April and May 2008. An interview guide was developed, which was partly based on the findings from phase 1. A pilot study was conducted with 4 centre clients. The guide covered satisfaction and dissatisfaction with HCP and service received and needs for HIV health care services. The field researcher invited all clients in the waiting area to participate by handing them a Participation Information Statement and explaining verbally the purpose of the study. Each interview was audiorecorded and conducted in a private room after the participants finished their consultations. The researcher stopped conducting interviews when “saturation point” was reached, that is, no new information emerged from the interviews. Participants also completed a short demographic questionnaire at the end of the interview. The interviews took about 45 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>To elicit the most relevant information, the researcher collected and analysed the qualitative data concurrently.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384843">21</xref></sup> After each interview, the audiorecording of the interviews was transcribed, and content analysis was conducted to identify confirmatory and emergent aspects.</p>

<title>Client Characteristics</title>
<p>Among 234 people approached, 166 respondents agreed to participate in phase 1 (response rate 71%). For phase 2, 22 participants were interviewed, none of whom participated in phase 1. Collectively, the sample group represented 5% of all clients attending the centre in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510384843">13</xref></sup> Combining respondents/participants from both the survey and the interviews, the majority were male (93%), Australian (57%), homosexual (76%), HIV positive (70%), and with “unprotected intercourse” as the main risk of HIV infection (81%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539510384843">Table 1</xref>). The ages of the combined respondents/participants ranged from 21 to 71 years (mean 41.6 years).</p>

<p>The overall ASC-CSQ satisfaction scores ranged from 30 to 100 (mean = 84). The satisfaction levels for each center staff category were analysed individually. Whereas the mean overall satisfaction level of HCP categories was 82%, the satisfaction was highest for “nurses” (86%), followed by “psychologists” (84%), “doctors” (83%), “pharmacists” (83%), “receptionists” (80%), and “nutritionists” (77%). The mean importance scores (maximum 5.00) rated by the respondents were “knowledge of HCP” (4.75), “attitude of HCP” (4.69), “HCP understood clients’ needs” (4.65), “advice given during consultation” (4.62), and “included clients’ decision in treatment” (4.62). The correlation coefficient of the mean satisfaction scores and the mean importance scores was 0.747 (<italic>P</italic> = .021), indicating that the aspects respondents perceived to be more important were those with higher satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>The satisfaction levels among respondents with different characteristics were analysed. Respondents who were HIV negative were more satisfied overall compared with those who had been HIV positive for 21 to 25 years (<italic>P</italic> = .026) but not for those who had been HIV positive for 20 years or less. The following groups of clients were also found to be more satisfied: those who were employed (<italic>P</italic> = .049), had been centre clients for shorter periods (less than 5 years; <italic>P</italic> = .004), visited the centre less frequently (quarterly or less; <italic>P</italic> = .023), and did not possess health care cards (<italic>P</italic> = .033). No significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05) in satisfaction levels were found for respondents by geographic origin, gender, age, sexual orientation, or number of services received at the center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1010539510384843">
<title>Phase 2: The Qualitative Interviews</title>
<p>In general, participants were highly satisfied with the services and their HCPs, which is congruent with the quantitative results. All participants were satisfied with the attitudes of their HCPs. They described them as “friendly,” “caring,” and “helpful.” Half of the participants were satisfied with the availability of HCPs, whereas the other half reported that availability was acceptable, suggesting that these participants might have lower expectations about the availability of HCPs.</p>
<p>Half of the participants found the “waiting time on arrival” to be acceptable (mean waiting time 15-20 minutes). Analysis of their comments revealed that waiting was considered the norm in all health care facilities, particularly when the consultation services were free; a longer waiting time was seen as an indication of longer consultation time with the HCP.</p>
<p>Only a small minority of participants expressed concerns about the physical environment of the center, such as the small size of the waiting area and the old design of the building. Other participants considered that the center maintained a reasonably good environment and felt the small size of the center offered them more privacy compared with hospitals. One third of the participants mentioned that free tea and coffee had previously been available in the waiting area and hoped it would be reintroduced.</p>
<p>Generally, participants were satisfied with the information provided through pamphlets and magazines in the waiting areas and described them as “comprehensive,” “informative,” and “well-displayed.” The heterosexual participants, however, noted that most information only targeted homosexuals and would prefer more information or services specifically for heterosexuals.</p>
<p>During the interviews, “rapport, care, trust, and continuity”; “confidentiality/privacy”; “level of expectation”; and “broad range of HCP and services provided” were issues not specifically raised by the interviewer but were raised by participants and considered important. Participants generally viewed their HCPs as lifetime companions and worked to establish a personal relationship with them. Good rapport was the main reason for staying with the same HCP.</p>
<p>“Trust and continuity” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510384843">Table 3</xref>, quote 1) are outcomes of “rapport and care.” The participants emphasised that when trust disappeared, an emotional distance developed between them and their HCP, irrespective of how technically professional the HCP was. Continuity in receiving services with the same HCP occurs if there is trust. Some participants said that they would follow their HCP if he/she moved elsewhere.</p>

<p>Participants revealed that they preferred to have consultations at the centre rather than at the GP’s or hospitals because they felt less stigmatised when receiving health care at an HIV specialist clinic (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510384843">Table 3</xref>, quotes 2-4). Participants also appreciated the multidisciplinary services at the centre, which enabled them to receive a range of HIV-related services at one venue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510384843">Table 3</xref>, quote 5).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in Australia and internationally to examine client satisfaction in an HIV ambulatory health care service using a rigorous 2-phase, quantitative and qualitative mixed-methods approach. This approach enabled us to determine the level of client satisfaction and to explore the reasons behind both clients’ satisfaction and areas where they were less satisfied. There were no significant major areas of unmet need identified. We found that clients were generally satisfied with the services they received at the centre. The demographic distributions of the sample groups were similar in both phases and comparable with the demographic distributions of clients at the centre and the PLWHA population in NSW,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384843">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510384843">13</xref></sup> suggesting that the sample groups were representative and not biased toward PLWHA with certain characteristics.</p>
<p>The vast majority of clients in both phases were satisfied across all aspects assessed. In particular, “knowledge of HCP” and “relationship with HCP” were found to be the 2 most important determinants of client satisfaction. This is consistent with the findings of patient satisfaction studies both in HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510384843">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510384843">22</xref></sup> and non-HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510384843">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510384843">24</xref></sup> settings, suggesting that clients of health care services value the specialist knowledge of their HCPs and the relationship they have with them. Our study also highlights the importance of evaluating the whole range of services and HCPs, not just doctors and nurses because in HIV health care, clients tend to access multiple services other than medical treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510384843">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510384843">25</xref></sup> “Maintenance of confidentiality/privacy” also echoed previous research that it is fundamentally important in an HIV health care service<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510384843">26</xref></sup> because clients revealed that they would stop attending the centre if confidentiality could not be maintained.</p>
<p>In addition, we demonstrated statistically significant differences in overall satisfaction levels among client groups with different characteristics. Clients who were HIV negative, currently employed, or visited the centre less frequently were more satisfied with the services they received and with their HCPs. This is the first study in an Australian ambulatory HIV health care centre in which satisfaction levels among client groups with different characteristics have been analysed.</p>
<p>As found in other patient satisfaction studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510384843">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510384843">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539510384843">28</xref></sup> clients were less satisfied with “waiting time on arrival” in this study. There have been suggestions in the literature to improve waiting time, such as extending the consultation time to counteract the negative effects of waiting time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539510384843">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510384843">30</xref></sup> and reducing the “perceived” waiting time by improving the physical environment of the facility, such as the waiting area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510384843">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510384843">33</xref></sup> The effectiveness of these measures, however, is yet to be determined.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The public health significance of the study is several fold. First, it provides evidence that PLWHA and those who are at risk are receiving quality health care service at the largest public ambulatory HIV clinic in Australia and are not being neglected because of the stigma often attached to their condition. Second, the study allows us to identify factors that clients value most, thereby contributing to their satisfaction, and also those aspects that clients found less satisfactory, thereby highlighting areas for improvement. Third, the use of a mixed-methods approach proved to be a useful tool to evaluate the quality of the overall health care service and service provided by each type of HCP in ASC and will allow comparisons of service quality improvement over time. This approach can be readily adopted by other HIV ambulatory care centres for service quality comparison between centres, not only in Australia and New Zealand but also those in other countries, for setting the benchmark of best practice in HIV ambulatory health care. More important, the mixed-methods approach when used to assess client satisfaction in research on service quality has the potential to be adopted by other ambulatory or specialised health care services, particularly in chronic diseases care, such as diabetes. One of the important future research questions is whether higher client satisfaction level will translate into better health outcomes, which is pivotal in the field of public health.</p>
