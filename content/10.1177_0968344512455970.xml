<abstract>
<p>The framework of casualty care during the Anglo-Dutch Wars has been found severely wanting by historians of naval medicine. This judgement is grounded on the fact that naval hospitals were constructed eventually in the 1750s, and because the hospitalization of sick and hurt mariners conforms better to a Weberian model of state and military modernization. This article argues that the measures for casualty care erected during the Dutch wars adhered to an early modern model of state formation. The framework of care extended the scope and social depth of politically involved people. It failed because the carers were consistently underfunded, not because locally based care was inherently unworkable or insufficiently bureaucratic and centralized.</p>

<p>During the Second Anglo-Dutch War a mariner named John Pinkie was impressed into the Royal Navy while staying at Dartmouth, Devon. The war did not go well for him. Several months after the end of the hostilities, he was at Exeter suffering from severely injured feet. An Exeter justice of the peace ordered the injured man back to his last place of residence. The journey to Dartmouth took 11 days, with the mariner carried overland by barrow. When Pinkie arrived at Dartmouth in November 1667 he was dumped at the door of a local constable. On account of his ‘gangrained’ feet and malnourishment, the coastal community took pity on him. The ministrations of competent surgeons preserved Pinkie’s life, although at the cost of both his feet below the ankles and ‘at least £30’. Dartmouth Corporation subsequently petitioned the Devon bench to be compensated for its care of Pinkie. Such an action would be, they averred, ‘an Incouragement unto us to Extend our Charity upon the like Occasion’. The petition was denied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968344512455970">1</xref></sup> As often happened during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, it was not local indifference but the state’s unwillingness or inability to pay that undermined the Royal Navy’s system of casualty care and the men it was supposed to help.</p>
<p>Despite their significance for the history of naval warfare, the Anglo-Dutch Wars do not get much attention in early modern studies. These conflicts (1652–4; 1665–7; 1672–4) were the first major oceanic wars fought between fleets of heavy-gunned, purpose-built warships, involving very large numbers of mariners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968344512455970">2</xref></sup> The naval historian Jan Glete has argued that the Anglo-Dutch Wars were the decisive turning point in the global advance of the north-west Atlantic polities capable of building and maintaining large state-controlled standing navies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968344512455970">3</xref></sup> Yet most scholarship about the role of armed forces and warfare in the process of building Britain’s state, and its ascent to great power status, has focused on either the mid-seventeenth-century civil wars or England’s wars with France after the Glorious Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968344512455970">4</xref></sup> Debates within this literature, partly a reaction to the military revolution thesis, centre on the degree to which a state’s ability to extract resources was more important for its rise or decline than contingent factors such as political or military personalities; whether borrowing or taxation was the decisive factor in paying for Britain’s army and navy; and, if fiscal innovations were the key, whether those undertaken in the 1640s or the 1690s ultimately made the biggest difference for the emergence of Britain’s powerful ‘fiscal-military’ state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968344512455970">5</xref></sup> However, the role of medical care in the success or failure of early modern and eighteenth-century armed forces is beginning to attract more scholarly attention. For some historians, the early modern period witnessed improvements in the survival rates of wounded soldiers, thanks in part to advances in medical techniques, as well as developments in the provision of short- and long-term care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968344512455970">6</xref></sup> Recently, the British state’s concern for the health of its servicemen has been put forward as an important factor in its success during the Seven Years’ War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968344512455970">7</xref></sup> For others, the medical provisions that European states afforded their armed forces during the long eighteenth century are barely worth mentioning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968344512455970">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Anglo-Dutch Wars have long been viewed by historians as important for the development of naval medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968344512455970">9</xref></sup> For the latter phase of the first war, and for the duration of the second and third, quartering and medical care of injured and sick servicemen onshore were the responsibility of a temporary naval commission of between four and six men, variously called the commission for sick and wounded (or hurt) seamen and prisoners of war. A similar body was created during the Nine Years War and finally became a quasi-permanent agency in the early eighteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968344512455970">10</xref></sup> During these conflicts the commissions for the sick and hurt attempted to marshal private resources in the service of the national interest, much as the Tudor and early Stuart navies depended on the aid of privateers for waging war at sea.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968344512455970">11</xref></sup> Thousands of injured and diseased servicemen were set ashore at designated coastal communities in the south and east of the country. The men, the majority of whom were classed as sick, were quartered and cared for at local houses. They were looked after by nurses and treated by resident or specially appointed medical professionals (surgeons, physicians, and apothecaries) until they were well enough to rejoin their ships, were discharged as unfit, deserted, or were sent up to London for further treatment at a hospital.</p>
<p>For the most part, historians of English naval medicine have been critical of the framework of primary casualty care overseen by the commissions for the sick and hurt. The ‘private contract system’ of shore-based naval medical care, as the framework is called, arguably fell far short of meeting the navy’s requirements, while fostering corruption, waste, desertion, delinquency, dissolution, and drunkenness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968344512455970">12</xref></sup> The decentralized, ad hoc approach to the sick and wounded is taken to be at odds with the trend within national armed forces from the middle of the seventeenth century towards centralization, rationalization, and uniformity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968344512455970">13</xref></sup> The framework is seen as being bound to fail because it relied primarily on civilians in coastal communities instead of medical professionals employed at purpose-built hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968344512455970">14</xref></sup> Further evidence for this judgement is provided by the periodic denunciations of the framework by officials – including commissioners or their medical assistants – and ultimately by the construction of permanent naval hospitals at Portsmouth and Plymouth in the 1750s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968344512455970">15</xref></sup> Although it is implicit in the literature, it is clear that the underlying reason that the hospitalization of the sick and hurt is deemed the superior mode of casualty care is because it conforms to a Weberian model of the modernization of the armed forces, itself part of a broader historical march towards the professional, bureaucratic, rationalistic, centralized, and uniform modern state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968344512455970">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The framework of care and the people whose homes, businesses, and labour made up its material and physical base deserve to be examined as more than a waypoint in the eventual triumph of monumental naval hospitals, run by professional medical men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968344512455970">17</xref></sup> This article reassesses the framework of casualty care overseen by the commissions for the sick and hurt during the Anglo-Dutch Wars as a way of shedding light on the ‘domestic face’ of an early-modern fiscal-military state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968344512455970">18</xref></sup> Using hitherto underused sources from the papers of several Restoration-era commissioners, along with material from the state papers, the Admiralty and Pepys collections, and printed correspondence, this article provides a local perspective on, and assessment of, the work of the commissions for the sick and hurt, and the broader framework of casualty care during the Dutch wars. Such an analysis is timely – the mid-Stuart commissions for the sick and hurt and the framework of primary casualty care during the three Dutch wars have not received sustained treatment for over fifty years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0968344512455970">19</xref></sup> It aims to show how coastal communities and state officials in late Stuart England tried to make the private contract system of casualty care work, and to rethink why it ultimately became unworkable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968344512455970">20</xref></sup> I argue that contemporaries understood its problems to be economic and not structural: problems to do with the state’s tardy or insufficient reimbursement, not local arrangements for administration, produced the most notable grievances from the carers. It is also important to reconceptualize the private contract system’s place in the state-formation process. Contemporaries erected and implemented the framework using fundamental, familiar, and tested principles of state-building that increased the number of politically involved agents at the local level. Greenwich Hospital, begun in 1696, does not figure in this analysis because it was constructed to house maimed and otherwise unserviceable seamen, not to provide immediate post-combat cure or care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968344512455970">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Warfare and wartime medicine both reflect and shape contemporary social forces and political institutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968344512455970">22</xref></sup> The English state’s approach to casualty care during the Dutch wars and after paralleled its approach to local governance: it relied on the participation of large numbers of more or less willing individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968344512455970">23</xref></sup> People in the nation’s ports were generally amenable to receive and care for sick and hurt servicemen provided the state kept its promise to compensate them. The framework of casualty care in coastal communities was based on an economy of trust: local people extended care on credit to servicemen while expecting the state to honour its promises to compensate them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968344512455970">24</xref></sup> The effort to settle the arrears for quarters that built up during the second and third Dutch wars show that important elements within the Restoration regime recognized that satisfying the debt of care was both a political and a military necessity. A desire both to uphold the honour of the king’s service and to ensure the future availability of carers for his servants at sea motivated the regime’s efforts to satisfy the debt for quartering the sick and hurt in coastal communities. England’s emerging fiscal-military state cared about local carers as part of its concern for the health and welfare of servicemen. Too often, however, the state was very slow in keeping its promises, or was not in a position to fulfil them. When His Majesty’s service did not honour its debts, coastal communities resisted and clamoured, even as they and their servicemen suffered.</p>
<p>The framework was not inherently unworkable for being decentralized and reliant on local women instead of naval surgeons working in monumental hospitals. It failed, but it did so because resident carers (and their creditors) were not adequately compensated by the state for their labours and lodgings. Yet, the willingness of coastal communities to extend care on credit to sick and wounded servicemen, albeit at times under heavy pressure from the regime, was the backbone of welfare provision during a crucial phase of England’s rise to great power status. The fact that the private contract system of casualty care remained in place largely throughout the Nine Years and Spanish Succession wars means that it was an important, if imperfect and often overlooked, aspect of the formation of Britain’s fiscal-military state.</p>

<title>I. The Framework of Local Casualty Care</title>
<p>Primary casualty care onshore during the Anglo-Dutch Wars was a state-supervised, privately run venture. For this article I am drawing upon Michael Braddick’s functionalist definition of the state as a territorially bounded and coordinated network of agents wielding political power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0968344512455970">25</xref></sup> My focus is primarily on the executive agencies that determined and executed naval policy, including the welfare of servicemen. At the beginning, however, the central state’s role was minimal. During the initial season of combat in the first Dutch war (1652), the Rump’s Council of State simply expected the governors of port towns that received sick and hurt men, primarily in Hampshire and East Anglia, subsequently compensated by the Commonwealth, to make their own arrangements for accommodating casualties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968344512455970">26</xref></sup> As the second year of fighting approached, however, it was clear to naval commanders that this method was not advancing the regime’s interest. In Captain Francis Willoughby’s judgement, the State Navy’s extreme laissez-faire approach to casualty care was not adequately relieving the many sick and hurt set ashore. This situation, in turn, was making recruitment difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968344512455970">27</xref></sup> A supervisory role for the Commonwealth in casualty care thus emerged primarily out of the navy’s desire to improve the welfare of sick and hurt seamen (and soldier-sailors) onshore, thereby maintaining a healthy supply of mariners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968344512455970">28</xref></sup> The navy board proposed the creation of a three-man committee to liaise with officials in the ports to find quarters for sick and hurt men, and to hire surgeons, physicians, and apothecaries to provide medical care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968344512455970">29</xref></sup> The first commission for supervising the relief of sick and wounded sailors, along with widows and orphans, was appointed by the Council of State in late September 1653. Although it was disbanded with the return of peace the next year, the commission’s creation set the precedent for state oversight of local casualty care arrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968344512455970">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two more commissions were set up by the Privy Council at the outbreak of hostilities with the Dutch in 1664 and 1672.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968344512455970">31</xref></sup> Unlike the Commonwealth’s commission, authority in these subsequent agencies was vested in individual members responsible for particular regions, rather than in the commission as a whole.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968344512455970">32</xref></sup> In the case of the second commission, John Evelyn had oversight for Kent and Sussex, and Sir Thomas Clifford for Devon and Cornwall; Bullen Reymes had authority in Dorset and Hampshire, and William Doyley looked after Norfolk and Suffolk.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968344512455970">33</xref></sup> As with the first commission, however, the chief duties of its officers were to supervise the provision of quarters and care of sick and wounded men set ashore. In addition, they were charged with oversight of prisoners of war and relieving the widows of deceased mariners. Taking care of hurt and sick servicemen included the power to put them into existing hospitals, or elsewhere on the least expensive terms; to ensure a surgeon or a physician attended the men; and to employ deputies at the ports to keep account of the men under care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0968344512455970">34</xref></sup> The commissioners or their agents were to discharge the cost of quartering sick and wounded men either directly to so-called quarterers, or to local officials. The rate for quartering sick and hurt men was set at 7<italic>s</italic>. per man per week.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0968344512455970">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The privy councils of Charles II, like their republican predecessor, expected coastal communities to receive and provide primary care for sick and hurt servicemen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0968344512455970">36</xref></sup> Local officials at designated reception ports were required to assist in relief efforts, primarily by helping the commissioners or their agents to secure ‘good Quarters and Billeting of all sick and wounded’ put ashore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0968344512455970">37</xref></sup> In January 1665 Bullen Reymes wrote to the constables of Fareham demanding a list of houses, rooms, and beds ‘fit to receive and lodge sick and wounded men’. He also informed them that their assistance in caring for the men would be required by surgeons and clerks of the commission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0968344512455970">38</xref></sup> In practice, at the best of times fit quarters meant alehouses, inns, and the homes of such people as were willing to provide shelter and food for hurt and sick men. At the worst of times any building was made to suffice. On 26 September 1665, for example, 350 men were brought up to Gravesend, which forced the commission’s agents to put 300 of them in one building, probably a barn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0968344512455970">39</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-0968344512455970">
<title>II. The Scope of Casualty Care in Coastal Communities</title>
<p>The diffusion of casualty care in coastal communities was an echo of the expansion of the Tudor and early Stuart states. Rather than creating multiple institutions to execute policy and uphold the law, the regimes of Henry VIII, Elizabeth, and James I struck commissions, and increased the number of offices through which political power was wielded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0968344512455970">40</xref></sup> The active participation of increasing numbers of upstanding propertied men in governance enabled the system to work successfully, at least until 1640.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0968344512455970">41</xref></sup> The key to active participation was the mutual benefit that office-holding provided: office holders’ honour, credit, and status within their locality were enhanced in exchange for upholding the crown’s authority. The framework of casualty care during the Dutch wars dramatically increased the level of local people actively involved and interested in the developing fiscal-military state. Large numbers of people acted as temporary carers of servicemen during these conflicts, particularly those most prone to make money from nursing the sick – widows. Their labour and the credit they extended to the state formed the backbone of naval medicine during this period. While I am not suggesting that a carer was recognized by contemporaries as holding an office comparable to a constable or county magistrate, caring for sick and hurt men was a social role that placed an individual in a relationship with the state that relied on assumptions of mutual benefit and effective performance not dissimilar to those underlying the office of justice of the peace.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0968344512455970">42</xref></sup> If nothing else, carers gained a role in the emerging fiscal-military state that they did not possess prior to taking in a sick or wounded sailor. In return for exercising a duty of care they could expect compensation from the crown. The fact that they clamoured when payment was late or non-existent shows that they had a stake in the state’s success.</p>
<p>Forming an idea of exactly which and how many people provided care is crucial to understanding the framework of casualty care during the Dutch wars. The burden of care placed on designated reception centres for sick and hurt sailors was indeed heavy. In August 1653 some 600 sick and wounded were dispatched from the fleet to Yarmouth. In May 1665 Ipswich was hosting around 1100 men. During one 24 hour period in June 1673 the town of Rochester received about 200 sick mariners.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0968344512455970">43</xref></sup> The scale of caring at the local level, however, has so far been overlooked. Thanks to the efforts of the commissioners’ local clerks to keep account of the cost of quarters, we can begin to get a sense of the social breadth of casualty care in coastal communities during the Dutch wars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0968344512455970">44</xref></sup> The local clerks employed by the commissioners for the sick and hurt maintained registers of men put ashore on account of illness or injury. The registers listed the man’s name, his ship, quality (sailor or soldier), medical condition, the date he was set ashore, the place of billeting (a landlord’s or individual’s name), the number of days in care, where the man was sent when he was released from care, and the costs of quartering, medical cure, conduct or travel money, and, if necessary, funeral expenses. For the purposes of this article, I have analysed one register in the Evelyn papers from the second Dutch war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0968344512455970">45</xref></sup> The most significant aspects of such registers are their entries for place of quartering and number of days in care. These records indicate how many people were involved in sheltering and feeding sick and hurt servicemen, and how long they hosted their charges.</p>
<p>Naturally, the figures recorded in the register must be treated with caution, if for no other reason than that their accuracy was called into doubt by contemporaries sent to check them against the ships’ certificates issued to men put ashore for illness or injury.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0968344512455970">46</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the register is a window into the burden of local casualty care. For reasons of space I focused on the experience of Gravesend during two months. A serious outbreak of the plague in the autumn of 1666 meant it was a very bad time for civilian as well as naval health in England. Even so, the record of quartering at Gravesend provides significant insight into the heavy demands placed on local resources by the framework of casualty care.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0968344512455970">47</xref></sup> It does not indicate whether or not the sick and hurt men listed as quartered with a particular person were necessarily lodged in the same dwelling, or indeed in any dwelling at all. It is possible that the biggest care-providers arranged for temporary accommodation for their charges – in tents, barns, or rooms in neighbouring parishes. It is also possible that they simply packed in as many hurt or sick servicemen as could fit into their establishments.</p>
<p>There was a substantial increase in the burden of care and the number of carers at Gravesend between February 1665 and October 1666 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0968344512455970">Table 1</xref>). The spread of the plague through the fleet was undoubtedly primarily responsible for the marked increase in sick seamen accommodated at Gravesend, although the conclusion of the fighting season and onset of cooler weather was also certainly a factor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0968344512455970">48</xref></sup> According to Hearne Thurston’s register, Gravesend received 51 sick or hurt sailors during February.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0968344512455970">49</xref></sup> The clerk listed 19 people, including 3 widows, who gave shelter to servicemen; 7 individuals hosted 4 or more men over the course of the month. Significantly, at the end of September, commissioner John Evelyn told Samuel Pepys that the town was ‘full’ of sick men. Another agent for the commission, Edward Smith, estimated that there were 800 men in total quartered in the town over October 1666. If true, that figure represents roughly 70 per cent of its native population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0968344512455970">50</xref></sup> During October the town took in 350 men, almost a sevenfold increase over February 1665. The register indicates that there was a fourfold rise between the two months in the total number of carers at Gravesend. Thurston listed 78 people quartering sick and hurt men, including 24 widows. Some 40 individuals hosted 4 or more men over the course of the month. Of the top eight accommodation providers, one lodged 17 men, three lodged 15, and two accommodated 11.</p>

<p>A further significant element of the Gravesend register concerns the gender of the carers during the two months: there was an eightfold increase in the number of widows lodging sick and hurt men. The number of single women providing care for sick and hurt had therefore doubled in relation to the overall increase of total carers. The reason for the huge increase in the proportion of single women is not clear, and further research on similar registers for other coastal communities will confirm whether or not it was exceptional. It is probable that the increasing reliance on widows as carers reflected a combination of official bullying directed at a relatively powerless, and generally poorer, segment of the community and individual initiative. It is clear that female nurses complained to the state not about the fact of having to care more, but that their care was unrewarded. In other words, they were willing to assume the role of carer on the understanding that the state would honour its debt. In fact, honouring the debt of care was something the state was extremely slow to do during and after the Dutch wars.</p>

<title>III. The Debt for Care</title>
<p>The private contract system of care during the Dutch wars did not run into problems from a dearth of willing carers or from official ineptitude, but from a lack of money. Arrears of pay for quarters were a recurring and chronic issue during the period. The size of the arrears was hardly insignificant: for example, the commission for the sick and hurt was reportedly £9000 in debt in February 1666.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0968344512455970">51</xref></sup> Carers, local officials, and the agents of the commission all agreed that the state was woefully slow in settling accounts for quartering and feeding hurt and sick servicemen. In 1653 the bailiffs of Ipswich, Aldeburgh, Southwold, and Dunwich complained to the navy about not yet being paid. Over 20 years later, the town of Southwold petitioned the Privy Council concerning the £1700 still owed ‘for the entertainment of sick and wounded seamen and soldiers’ during the third Dutch war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0968344512455970">52</xref></sup> In mid-August 1665 Commissioner Bullen Reymes declared that his debt for quarters and care for both sick and hurt servicemen and prisoners of war was over £1000, yet since June he had not got ‘a farding of the King’s money’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0968344512455970">53</xref></sup> Similar frustrations were expressed during the third Dutch war. Samuel Pepys’s brother-in-law Balthasar St Michael was very disturbed by his owing the ‘poor nurses’ of Deal £100 by May 1673. That same month, the complaints of the quarterers in Dover, evidently bursting with sick and maimed men, was ‘soe extreame’ that the agent feared he could no longer pacify the people but with a speedy supply of money.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0968344512455970">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The framework of casualty care broke down, with potentially grievous consequences for the welfare of hurt and sick servicemen, when coastal communities felt sufficiently aggrieved by the state’s delay in honouring its debt of care. They would either make extra demands on the state or simply refuse to extend care to the sick and hurt. During the first Dutch war generals George Monck and William Penn were afraid that unpaid arrears could lead Suffolk towns to take a pay first, quarter later approach. In January 1665 the people of Deal were reluctant to take in sick mariners without assurances that they would be paid for quarters quickly. The parishes next to Erith refused to receive any hurt and sick men, despite that town being full, because they were not included in the council’s warrant for quartering. This refusal can probably be explained partly by a fear that payment could be delayed a long while.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0968344512455970">55</xref></sup> By the autumn of 1665 Evelyn was reporting that the mayor of Rochester had confirmed that the landlords of his town had sworn to evict their sick and hurt lodgers unless they saw money very soon. Some of them, the mayor also indicated, were making unfavourable comparisons between the monarchy’s handling of casualty care with the Commonwealth’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0968344512455970">56</xref></sup> Resistance to quartering in Kent was more marked in the third Dutch war. The agent at Margate claimed that he had to break open the door of one alehouse keeper who refused to admit another sick man unless the agent ‘would pay the ould quarter furst’. The landlords of Gravesend on three occasions threatened to turn sick sailors out onto the streets unless they were paid for quartering in seven days.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0968344512455970">57</xref></sup> The same threats were made to the commission’s agent at Faversham, which Evelyn feared might blossom into a ‘universall defection and absolute refusal’ to quarter casualties unless money was made available to settle the ‘vast arrears for sick and wounded’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0968344512455970">58</xref></sup> At the same time the agent at Deal reported that nurses and servicemen were both suffering from arrears of pay. ‘They and their sick seamen lie in the streets,’ he told Evelyn, ‘an epitome of the town’s general lamentation.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0968344512455970">59</xref></sup> Nonetheless, Evelyn was prepared to force the reluctant residents of Deal to quarter more men until Pepys dissuaded him for the sake of his personal safety and the honour of the king’s service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0968344512455970">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reluctance and outright resistance to receiving large numbers of sick and hurt men is surely understandable, not only for the burden it placed on local resources, and the delays in payment, but also for the threat quartering diseased people posed to the health of their hosts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0968344512455970">61</xref></sup> However, blatant resistance to care, such as that demonstrated in Margate and Chatham, was nonetheless an exceptional response to the strain that sick and hurt men put on local communities and their credit networks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0968344512455970">62</xref></sup> On the whole the English state could count on individuals within coastal communities to take up the role of care- provider for the sick and hurt during the Dutch wars. The high degree of compliance and even willingness to care for servicemen suggests that the framework of casualty care was workable from the view of local people. The case of the parishes adjacent to Erith – which would not quarter men without a warrant – points to a concern over the legality of the framework and not the fact of having to take in large numbers of casualties or the sick. The perception of legitimacy was always a crucial variable in civilian-military relations, of which the state was well aware.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0968344512455970">63</xref></sup> On at least two occasions during the third Dutch war the Privy Council addressed this concern by issuing additional warrants of assistance to communities in Kent: Margate in May and Greenwich/Deptford in September 1673.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0968344512455970">64</xref></sup> Yet with compliance, and perhaps even with a dose of compassion, came popular clamour over the heavy burden of caring for the fevered and wounded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0968344512455970">
<title>IV. Dealing with the Clamourers</title>
<p>Lack of adequate funding for casualty care fostered protest. Residents of coastal communities could and did clamour when, in their eyes, the state failed to uphold its obligation under the economy of care. People received the sick and hurt in the belief that the state would honour its debts. When local people perceived an imbalance or injustice within the economy of care, they asserted their moral right to protest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0968344512455970">65</xref></sup> The heated cries of local people against the commission’s agents sprang from the sums of money they were owed, the time it took for carers to be paid, and the pressure that quartering placed on local credit networks. In the early part of the second war Reymes wrote to Evelyn that recently his home had been surrounded by a ‘pest of skolds’ demanding their money for quartering sick and hurt men. This demonstration of ‘20 or thirty of the sharpest-tongued women’ evidently stemmed from a rumour that Reymes was preparing to leave Portsmouth without settling his debts. The women were convinced that the ‘Good King’ had sent Reymes enough to pay them, but that he was keeping most of it back.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0968344512455970">66</xref></sup> In the autumn of 1672 Evelyn was very concerned that a lack of steady money to discharge the ‘great Arrears owing’ (about £3000) to communities in Kent with ‘neere 3000 sick creatures dispers’d amongst them’ would produce troublesome clamours.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0968344512455970">67</xref></sup> By March 1673 the arrears for quartering in Kent and Sussex were so high (about £9000), that Evelyn’s agents were ‘no longer able to support the clamour and threats’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0968344512455970">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Carers also clamoured when the commission for the sick and hurt’s local agents failed to uphold what they perceived as the moral authority of their offices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0968344512455970">69</xref></sup> The two agents in Kent who reported the greatest incidences of clamour during the third war, Robert Birstall at Gravesend and Balthasar St Michael at Deal, were also accused of cheating the nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0968344512455970">70</xref></sup> The nurses of Deal petitioned Evelyn twice (September 1673 and 1674) to investigate their allegations that St Michael was withholding the funds owed to them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0968344512455970">71</xref></sup> They accused St Michael of paying them 5<italic>s</italic>. 4<italic>d</italic>. per man per week, instead of the 7<italic>s</italic>. per week allowed by the king. The ‘smallness of the pay’ was ruining financially the nurses who were required to extend their credit in order to care for sick and hurt men. More importantly, the nurses pointed out that St Michael’s embezzlement was fatally undermining the framework of casualty care. It would ‘deterre others that would willingly provide for such persons did they not think themselves abused by him’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0968344512455970">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>The nurses of Deal and other coastal communities were proclaiming at a high volume that the framework of casualty care functioned only if the state honoured the debt of care it incurred in coastal communities. It is significant that, in his plan for a permanent infirmary for sick and hurt mariners drawn up in 1666, Evelyn listed among its benefits the total cure of ‘the altogether intollerable clamor and difficulties of rude and ungratefull people; their Landlords and Nurses, raysed by their poverty upon the least obstruction of constant and weekly payes’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0968344512455970">73</xref></sup> Read against the grain, Evelyn’s plan implies that constant and regular payments would have stopped all complaints. Indeed, Robert Birstall claimed that his regular weekly payments to carers to buy food for their lodgers shut the mouths of their otherwise ‘very clamorous and impatient demands for due payment’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0968344512455970">74</xref></sup> Yet his small disbursements evidently did not go far enough for some of Gravesend’s nurses. Their credit, he reported, had been so extended in caring for sick and hurt men that they lost their goods and even their homes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0968344512455970">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another sign that the lack of funding made the framework of coastal casualty care unworkable is evident from the fact that its demands forced some jurisdictions to make a difficult choice between the long-term relief of disabled veterans and the short-term care of sick and hurt mariners. Prior to the outbreak of the Dutch wars, coastal communities were already responsible for providing long-term relief in the form of pensions to wounded civil war veterans. Thanks to the Cavalier Parliament’s sense of obligation to maimed royalist veterans, parishes could be obliged to pay 2<italic>s</italic>. 6<italic>d</italic>. per week towards the county pension scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0968344512455970">76</xref></sup> The expectation of caring for sick and hurt sailors made the burden of war-related relief far more onerous. In some cases the requirement to support both wounded civil war veterans and Dutch war casualties compelled county communities to reduce the number of ‘king’s pensioners’ on the county roll. Gravesend, which bore a heavy burden of casualty care in both the second and third Dutch wars, sought and was granted an exemption from the county pension scheme by the East Kent bench.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0968344512455970">77</xref></sup> Clearly that particular bench believed it was unjust for the state to expect coastal communities both to shelter its sick during a naval war and provide ongoing relief to disabled civil war veterans. On the other hand, the Devon bench’s refusal to compensate Dartmouth for looking after John Pinkie suggests it reached the opposite conclusion. Preliminary research also suggests that disabled Dutch war veterans were encouraged to re-enlist as cooks or to seek alms places at cathedrals with royal foundations because they had a more difficult time securing county pensions than had wounded civil war veterans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0968344512455970">78</xref></sup> It would not be surprising if this were an unintended legacy of the underfunding of the framework of casualty care in Devon, Hampshire, and Kent during the wars.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0968344512455970">
<title>V. Treasurer Danby and the Coastal Carers</title>
<p>Certain high-ranking officers in the state were increasingly concerned about the mounting debt for care, and its implications for the future health of the navy, during the latter phases of the third Dutch war. Lord Treasurer Danby in particular took significant steps to meet the state’s debt in the aftermath of the third Dutch war, a period when financial retrenchment was the treasurer’s top priority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0968344512455970">79</xref></sup> However, since the solutions were ad hoc and retroactive they did not address the fundamental issue of adequate and timely funding during the conflict. In August 1673 the Admiralty lords strongly recommended that money for sick and hurt arrears be paid both to bolster the morale of servicemen who might soon find themselves needing the state’s support and for the encouragement ‘of those housekeepers and others upon whose credit His Majesty’s Service must in a great measure inevitably depend for the entertainment of them’. Unless steps were taken the carers could not acquire the credit they required to carry on providing care for sick and wounded men.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0968344512455970">80</xref></sup> In a joint letter submitted to the Treasury in early 1674 the commissioners for the sick and hurt expressed their dismay that only £1000 had been set aside to pay for sick and hurt quarters, when the total amount owing was closer to £20,000. Such a minuscule sum would, they argued, simply enrage the people of the ports, with an ‘evil consequence whereof cannot be sufficiently forseen’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0968344512455970">81</xref></sup> In July 1675 Danby ordered a full account of all the monies still owing for quarters in Kent, probably as a prerequisite for settling the debt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0968344512455970">82</xref></sup> In 1676 he sent Richard Gibson to visit the ports where men were quartered during the last Dutch war to determine exactly how much remained unpaid for quarters, accommodation, and cure of sick and hurt seamen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0968344512455970">83</xref></sup> Danby later put Gibson in charge of paying off the remaining debt for care, and over the next two years he issued several orders to pay it down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0968344512455970">84</xref></sup> Indeed, towards the very end of his tenure as lord treasurer, Danby ordered £600 imprested towards arrears for sick and wounded quarters, adding ‘not to make any failure or delay, it being of greatest consequence to His Majesty’s Service’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0968344512455970">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the efforts of one relatively enthusiastic high official were not enough to redeem fully the framework of casualty care, or to stop the clamour over unpaid bills for quartering hurt and sick sailors. The debt of care remained after Danby was forced out of office. Faversham’s inhabitants claimed they were still owed £900 in May 1679. Two months later their request was seconded by the navy commission, which argued that settling the debt speedily would ‘be of advantage to the King’s service’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0968344512455970">86</xref></sup> That autumn the towns of Rochester, Chatham, Milton, and Strood stated they were still short over £5200.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0968344512455970">87</xref></sup> The towns of Gosport and Portsmouth petitioned King James II for the cost of sick and hurt quarters in May 1685, ‘the only debt remaining unpaid for service of like nature’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0968344512455970">88</xref></sup> The order to pay Portsmouth its arrears of £718 13<italic>s</italic>. 7<italic>d</italic>. was sent over to the Treasury in December 1686. It had taken 13 years for the state to fulfil its undertaking to the carers of Portsmouth, and their creditors, for looking after sick and hurt servicemen during the Dutch wars.</p>

<title>VI. Conclusion</title>
<p>Locally based carers, adequate compensation and occasional clamour were the pillars of the private contract system of casualty care developed during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. The framework remained essentially unchanged throughout the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. By way of contrast, Spain had constructed two permanent naval hospitals by 1680 (Cádiz and Cartagena), and the French also appear to have had two in place five years later (Toulon and Brest).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0968344512455970">89</xref></sup> Although small hospitals were built in Portsmouth and Plymouth towards the end of seventeenth century, the majority of onshore casualty care continued to be performed by local private carers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0968344512455970">90</xref></sup> Thus, instead of centrally managed, professionally run permanent institutions, the English state relied on community-based carers for the welfare of its sick and hurt seamen until the end of the War of the Austrian Succession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0968344512455970">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>The history of casualty care, and indeed of naval medicine during and after the Anglo-Dutch Wars, is not, however, simply a story of medical progress delayed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0968344512455970">92</xref></sup> The endurance of the private contract framework which emerged during the Dutch wars can be explained in part by the fact that it echoed earlier and relatively successful approaches to local governance and state formation. Put simply, rather than relying on a small cadre of bureaucratic professionals, the English state involved a broad swathe of local people in the welfare of sick and hurt servicemen. Sufficient numbers of people in coastal communities were willing to care on credit for the navy’s hurt and sick. They assumed the role of carer with an expectation of timely and sufficient compensation from the state. Care in the community at the command of the king’s commissions for the sick and hurt is an apt descriptor of casualty care as it emerged during and endured after the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Ideally, the framework of casualty care in coastal communities would have developed into a mutually beneficial partnership between the public providers of protection and the private sellers of care. The protestations from local people during the second and third Dutch wars stemmed not so much from the fact that the state placed an inordinately heavy burden of care on ports such as Deal and parishes such as Gravesend, as from the fact that it was slow in supplying carers and quarterers with money, or that its agents were cheating carers out of their due.</p>
<p>The framework of community-based casualty care that emerged in the course of the Anglo-Dutch Wars was not inherently inadequate or unworkable, but it was consistently underfunded and overstretched. That, and not the absence of permanent hospitals, was the true weakness of community-based naval medicine during the Dutch wars. Unquestionably, the English state placed a heavy burden of care on the civilians of coastal communities during the Anglo-Dutch Wars. The task of sheltering, provisioning, and curing injured and sick sailors was itself the cause of much misery and suffering for nurses and servicemen. The state’s reliance on people’s willingness to care on credit led to the ruin of some poor families. However, the fact that resistance and refusal were rare indicates that the framework did work relatively well in some places. Moreover, it suggests that communities understood that profits could be made selling care to an inchoate fiscal-military state. The problem of arrears was recognized as the framework’s undoing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0968344512455970">93</xref></sup> Reporting to Treasurer Danby in 1676, Richard Gibson noted that arrears contracted a ‘prejudice to His Majesty’s Service, which … maybe found attends with very ill effects to his service upon any future occasion’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0968344512455970">94</xref></sup> In other words, the state needed to care more about the carers in coastal communities if it hoped to maintain a navy that was fit to contend for maritime supremacy. Where and when this did not happen, the carers demonstrated vehemently and noisily, and might even cast out the sick and hurt onto the streets.</p>
<p>The framework of local casualty care also needs to be recognized as part of the broader story of the development of a fiscal-military state. While the emergence of a large standing navy of warships during the three Anglo-Dutch wars might not have fundamentally affected the constitution of the English state, the framework of casualty care gave significant numbers of people along the country’s coasts a new interest in the state’s ability to manage its resources and pay its bills.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0968344512455970">95</xref></sup> Coastal communities willingly sold care to the state, as the nurses of Deal reminded Evelyn in 1674, so long as their bills were paid on time. Unfortunately for the carers the mid-Stuart English navy, although expanding and modernizing, was constantly broke. This was particularly the case towards the end of the third Dutch war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0968344512455970">96</xref></sup> However, delaying or deferring payment to civilian carers of sick or wounded men was a step better than persuading or coercing local populations to assume the whole cost, as had happened in parts of France during the Thirty Years War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0968344512455970">97</xref></sup> All the same, in the clamour of the coastal communities during the Dutch wars, we hear the anger of women and men who were willing to offer care and shelter to the fevered and the maimed when called upon, but were disappointed by England’s emerging fiscal-military state.</p>
