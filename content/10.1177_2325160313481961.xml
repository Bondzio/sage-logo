<p>Diabetic neuropathies do not have to limit people with diabetes from enjoying a good quality of life. Whether they are experiencing pain or working on minimizing or eliminating it, multiple treatment options are available to help them in their efforts. People with diabetes can ask their health care team to direct them to someone qualified to help them with their needs. To help your patients with diabetic neuropathy it is good to have a network of appropriate referral services. This network should include providers to help treat the neuropathy and its underlying causes, as well as assisting the patient with coping with the pain and possible limitations in activities of daily living and mobility such as the following: podiatrists, neurologists, pain management programs, exercise physiologists, smoking cessation programs, mental health professionals, weight management programs support groups and places where the patient can buy supplies such as diabetic shoes, socks, and other products for good foot care.</p>
<p>Effective management is based on recognizing the particular manifestation and underlying pathogenesis of the particular form of diabetic neuropathy. Treatment modalities are very individualized at all care levels to ultimately improve the quality of life for the person with diabetes.</p>
