<abstract>
<p>In 2007-2008, approximately 42% of community college students who were eligible to receive Pell grant funding did not file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Using data from the Beginning Postsecondary Student Study, this study examined the relationship between FAFSA filing status and persistence from the fall to spring semesters among first-year community college students. Results indicate that when controlling for other relevant predictors of persistence, filing a FAFSA was associated with higher odds of within-year persistence among all students and was particularly strong for the restricted sample of students enrolled part time. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the national completion agenda and recent calls to improve the utilization of financial aid among community college students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The underutilization of financial aid has been identified as a formidable barrier to access, persistence, and degree attainment among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112469251">Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance [ACSFA], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112469251">Institute for College Access &amp; Success, 2009</xref>). Every year thousands of community college students who are eligible for federal financial aid in the form of grants, loans, or work-study monies do not even file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), essentially leaving money for college on the table (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112469251">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552112469251">King, 2006</xref>). For example, during the 2007-2008 academic year, 42% of community college students who were eligible to receive federal Pell-grant funding did not file a FAFSA, and many of these students would have qualified for a full Pell grant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The FAFSA has been labeled as a critical gatekeeper to most financial aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112469251">Bettinger, Long, Oreopoulos, &amp; Sanbonmatsu, 2009</xref>) because in addition to the federal government, most states and postsecondary institutions use the FAFSA to make decisions about the disbursement of need-based aid. Community college students are often ideal recipients of need-based financial aid given that “forty percent of community college students have such low incomes that they have no resources to pay for a college education” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0091552112469251">Institute for College Access &amp; Success, 2009</xref>, p. 1). Therefore, not filing a FAFSA and missing out on grant aid that could help lower the total cost of attending college can have dire consequences for community college students. For example, a lack of financial resources may force these students to attend on a part-time basis or work more hours each week to be able to afford college. Among community college students, part-time enrollment and working more hours per week are associated with poorer persistence and graduation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Several reports have found that compared to students attending 4-year postsecondary institutions, community college students are significantly less likely to file a FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112469251">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552112469251">King, 2006</xref>). In general, students who are from lower income backgrounds, who are 24 or older, who are independent of their parents, and who attend college on a part-time basis (characteristics that describe much of the community college student population) are less likely to apply for financial aid, even when they are eligible for Pell grants. In addition to identifying the characteristics of students that do not file a FAFSA, it is important to understand how FAFSA filing status (i.e., filed or not filed) affects key student outcomes like persistence and attainment. Research has found that filing a FAFSA is associated with higher within-year persistence rates among lower income students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0091552112469251">Novak &amp; McKinney, 2011</xref>). However, limited attention has been given to the relationship between filing a FAFSA and the ability of community college students to remain enrolled in higher education.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between filing a FAFSA and within-year persistence among community college students. Of particular interest was whether failure to file a FAFSA resulted in poorer persistence rates among this student population during their first year of enrollment. The relationship between FAFSA filing and persistence among part-time students was also of interest because so many of these students who are eligible for need-based aid do not file a FAFSA. Two related research questions guided this study:</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>This review examines two themes related to FAFSA filing among community college students. First, attention is given to research suggesting that there are marked variations in knowledge about college and financial aid across different student groups. This line of inquiry can help explain why community college students who are eligible for aid are less likely to file a FAFSA than their peers attending 4-year institutions. The second section examines the literature pertaining to how the receipt of different types of financial aid affects persistence and attainment among community college students. Findings from this second line of inquiry highlight the need to ensure that community college students are benefiting from the need-based aid for which they are eligible.</p>
<sec id="section3-0091552112469251">
<title>Knowledge About College and Financial Aid</title>
<p>When making decisions about attending and paying for college, access to accurate and timely information is not equivalent across all student groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0091552112469251">Hossler, Schmit, &amp; Vesper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091552112469251">B. T. Long, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0091552112469251">Perna, 2006</xref>). The types of students most likely to enroll in community colleges (i.e., lower income students, ethnic minorities, first-generation college students) often have the most difficulty acquiring the information and guidance they need to make informed decisions about the college process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0091552112469251">Avery &amp; Kane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0091552112469251">Horn &amp; Chen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0091552112469251">Kezar &amp; Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0091552112469251">Perna, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0091552112469251">Vargas, 2004</xref>). In many cases, these students come from home environments that possess a very limited understanding of higher education in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0091552112469251">Vargas, 2004</xref>). This lack of “college knowledge” stands in stark contrast to the advantages enjoyed by students from more affluent socioeconomic backgrounds who have college-educated parents and whose home lives can offer a wealth of information that is valuable in making decisions about attending and paying for college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0091552112469251">McDonough, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to students’ demographic characteristics, variations across high school context can account for the varying levels of knowledge students have about college and financial aid. Higher income and private high schools, in comparison to lower income or urban public schools, typically provide students with greater resources and support that can help them make informed decisions about the college process. For example, students at higher income high schools are more likely to have immediate access to knowledgeable financial aid counselors, teachers, and peers who can offer guidance about college costs and financing strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0091552112469251">Perna, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0091552112469251">Stanton-Salazar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0091552112469251">Tierney &amp; Venegas, 2006</xref>). Conversely, lower income and large urban high schools may have structural constraints that make it challenging for students to obtain accurate and timely information about financial aid. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0091552112469251">McDonough and Calderone (2006)</xref> found that high school counselors who are the least informed about college planning are typically found in lower income schools, thus placing students at these schools at a disadvantage when seeking guidance on how to finance their college education.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings help explain why so many community college students arrive on campus lacking even the most basic understanding of the financial-aid process. A survey of community college financial aid counselors in California, Florida, and Texas revealed that two thirds of the counselors agreed or strongly agreed that their students do not understand what the term <italic>financial aid</italic> means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091552112469251">McKinney &amp; Roberts, 2012</xref>). Similarly, many community college students are unaware that financial aid programs exist and that funding is available to help make college more affordable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0091552112469251">Matus-Grossman &amp; Gooden, 2002</xref>). As several studies have suggested (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0091552112469251">Dynarksi &amp; Scott-Clayton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0091552112469251">B. T. Long, 2004</xref>), it is impossible for students to take advantage of financial aid that they do not even know exists.</p>
<p>Failure to procure accurate and timely information when planning for college can lead community college students to miss out on financial aid, primarily as a direct result of not filing a FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2011</xref>). Reports suggest that a large number of community college students do not file a FAFSA because they incorrectly assume they are ineligible for financial aid or because they lack information on how to apply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112469251">ACSFA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2011</xref>). Knowledge about the financial-aid process can also affect the timing of when students file a FAFSA. Examining data from a large community college in California, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552112469251">LaManque (2009)</xref> identified a direct relationship between knowledge of the FAFSA and timing of the FAFSA application. Students who reported greater knowledge of the FAFSA were more likely to apply early, therefore increasing their chances of receiving a better financial aid package. LaManque suggested that, “an early FAFSA filer with a good financial aid package will be more likely to succeed and persist in college than later FAFSA filers with exactly the same need and less financial support” (p. 6).</p>

<title>The Effects of Financial Aid on Community College Persistence</title>
<p>Several reports have underscored the need to improve the awareness and utilization of financial aid among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112469251">ACSFA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>). The assumption guiding the recommendations in these reports is that the receipt of financial aid, particularly need-based grants, positively affects persistence for students enrolled at community colleges. Previous studies have found that receiving grant aid is positively associated with persistence for community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112469251">Bettinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0091552112469251">Cofer &amp; Somers, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0091552112469251">Mendoza, Mendez, &amp; Malcolm, 2009</xref>). These findings are important for the present study, because many community college students who do not file a FAFSA would be eligible for a full or partial Pell grant as well as need-based grants from their state or institution.</p>
<p>Loans and work-study monies represent the other primary sources of financial aid disbursed to college students. The causal effects of loans on the persistence of community college students are inconclusive and contradictory. Although some researchers have found that loans do not affect the persistence of these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0091552112469251">Hippensteel, St. John, &amp; Starkey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0091552112469251">St. John &amp; Starkey, 1994</xref>), others have found negative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0091552112469251">Dowd &amp; Coury, 2006</xref>) and positive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0091552112469251">Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>). More research is clearly needed on this topic, particularly given recent debates about whether community colleges should be allowed to deny their students access to federal loans (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0091552112469251">Project on Student Debt, 2011</xref>). The effects of work-study aid on the persistence of community college students have received little attention, but this may be attributed to the fact that only a small percentage of community college students receive this type of financial aid.</p>
<p>Summarizing the extant research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0091552112469251">B. T. Long (2010)</xref> stated that, “while much more research is needed in this area to better understand how and what types of financial aid are most effective in supporting the persistence of community college students, the potential benefits of providing financial aid seem positive” (p. 52). Not filing a FAFSA and missing out on the opportunity to receive financial aid, especially grants, could have a negative impact on the success of community college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0091552112469251">Novak and McKinney (2011)</xref> found that among Pell-grant-eligible students, those who filed a FAFSA had 122% higher odds of persisting from the fall to spring semesters than their peers who did not file. The present study addresses a current gap in the literature by examining the relationship between FAFSA filing and persistence among students enrolled in community colleges. This line of inquiry is valuable given the fact that community college students make up the vast majority of FAFSA nonfilers every year who would have been eligible for need-based grant aid.</p>

<title>Conceptual Framework</title>
<p>The heterogeneity of the community college experience makes the development of a single, comprehensive theoretical model of community college student persistence a difficult undertaking. Several prior investigations of this issue have applied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0091552112469251">Tinto’s (1975)</xref> model of student retention to determine its relevance for studying community college students (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0091552112469251">Halpin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0091552112469251">Napoli &amp; Wortman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0091552112469251">Pascarella, Duby, &amp; Iverson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0091552112469251">Voorhees, 1987</xref>). In general, researchers have found that some constructs in Tinto’s model (e.g., educational expectations, academic experiences) are generalizable to students attending community colleges, while other constructs (e.g., social integration) are less relevant measures of persistence for these students. Moreover, although community colleges enroll large numbers of ethnic minorities, Tinto’s model has been criticized for not accurately capturing the experiences of these student groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0091552112469251">Rendon, Jalomo, &amp; Nora, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Several frameworks that have been used to examine community college persistence address some of these shortcomings. The model of nontraditional student attrition developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112469251">Bean and Metzner (1985)</xref> has proven useful because of the specific attention given to environmental factors (e.g., hours worked, family responsibilities, finances) that affect the persistence of many community college students (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0091552112469251">Xueli, 2009</xref>). In addition, theories of social and cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0091552112469251">Bourdieu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0091552112469251">Coleman, 1988</xref>) have been applied to better understand persistence among community college students from minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552112469251">Crisp &amp; Nora, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0091552112469251">Wells, 2008</xref>). In recent years, researchers have advocated the integration of multiple theoretical frameworks to examine college student persistence and attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552112469251">Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0091552112469251">Chen &amp; St. John, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0091552112469251">Kuh, Kinzie, Buckley, Bridges, &amp; Hayek, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the conceptual framework guiding this study was developed by integrating empirical findings on community college persistence with key constructs from several well-researched theories (i.e., Tinto’s retention model, Bean and Metzner’s model of nontraditional student attrition, and social and cultural capital). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0091552112469251">Figure 1</xref> provides a graphical representation of this framework. Factors that influence persistence among community college students have been reviewed extensively elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112469251">Hawley &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0091552112469251">Settle, 2011</xref>). Therefore, as a means of corroborating the applicability of the conceptual framework, the sections below focus on the variables examined in this study.</p>

<title>Demographics and Social and Cultural Capital</title>
<p>Gender has typically been included in prior studies because of its potential interaction with other key variables though there is little empirical evidence to suggest that gender alone is a significant predictor of community college persistence. In terms of ethnicity, findings have generally suggested that in comparison to their White peers, community college students from ethnic minority groups are less likely to persist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0091552112469251">Alexander, Garcia, Gonzalez, Grimes, &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0091552112469251">Strayhorn, 2012</xref>). In addition, social and cultural capital are often measured by the highest level of education obtained by the students’ parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0091552112469251">Perna &amp; Titus, 2005</xref>), which can serve as a proxy for knowledge about college and financial aid. Studies have found that first-generation college students attending community colleges are at greater risk for dropping out than students with college-educated parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112469251">Fike &amp; Fike, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0091552112469251">Wells, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0091552112469251">Wild &amp; Ebbers, 2002</xref>). Students’ primary spoken language can also represent a form of social and cultural capital, and findings have suggested that community college students for whom English is a second language may face additional barriers to remaining enrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112469251">Hawley &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Precollege and College Experiences</title>
<p>Students’ academic performance (e.g., high school grade point average [GPA], highest level of mathematics completed) before attending community college can have a strong effect on their persistence and degree attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112469251">Adelman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0091552112469251">Arbona &amp; Nora, 2007</xref>). Delaying enrollment into college after graduating from high school has been found to have a negative impact on degree or certificate attainment among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0091552112469251">Adelman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0091552112469251">Attewell, Heil, &amp; Reisel, 2012</xref>). Similarly, community college students who attend part time are less likely to persist than students attending full time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>). However, the effects of participation in remedial coursework on student persistence are mixed. Several studies have found that successful completion of remedial coursework is associated with higher rates of persistence among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0091552112469251">Bahr, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0091552112469251">Crisp &amp; Nora, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112469251">Fike &amp; Fike, 2008</xref>), while others have indicated that taking remedial coursework hinders persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0091552112469251">Grimes &amp; David, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0091552112469251">Worley, 2003</xref>). There is agreement among prior studies that a higher cumulative GPA earned at the community college is associated with increased odds of persisting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0091552112469251">Fike &amp; Fike, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0091552112469251">Settle, 2011</xref>). Findings also suggest that meeting with an academic advisor can increase persistence among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112469251">Bean &amp; Metzner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0091552112469251">Orozco, Alvarez, &amp; Gutkin, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Environmental Pull Factors</title>
<p>Compared to students attending 4-year postsecondary institutions, community college students are more likely to face pressures from environmental forces that pull them away from the institution and hinder their persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0091552112469251">Bean &amp; Metzner, 1985</xref>). Many community college students work 20 hours or more per week off campus, and this can have a negative impact on their persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>). Community college students are also more likely to be older than students enrolled at 4-year postsecondary institutions and have their own dependent children to care for. The demands of child rearing, in addition to being a college student, can serve as a barrier to persistence for these individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0091552112469251">Sorey &amp; Duggan, 2008</xref>). Finances undoubtedly play a critical role in the persistence of community college students because so many of these students come from low-income households. Lower income students are often dependent on financial aid to remain enrolled and persist to graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0091552112469251">Choy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0091552112469251">Heller, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0091552112469251">B.

In the present study, failure to file FAFSA, and therefore missing out on financial aid that could help pay for college, is hypothesized to have a negative impact on student persistence.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section10-0091552112469251">
<title>Data Source and Sample</title>
<p>The data source used for this study was the Beginning Postsecondary Students Study (BPS:04/06) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps/">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/bps/</ext-link>). This longitudinal data set is often used to examine students’ pathways through higher education. The BPS:04/06 survey sampled a cohort of students who began their college careers during the 2003-2004 academic year and whose progress was followed through 2006, 3 years after they first enrolled in higher education. A benefit of using BPS:04/06 for the present study, rather than institutional data, was that expected family contributions (EFC) for students who did not file a FAFSA were statistically imputed, using information gathered from telephone and web surveys. These data would not be available at the institutional level, because students who do not complete a FAFSA are not typically asked to report information about their family incomes.</p>
<p>Full and restricted samples were used to answer the two research questions guiding this study. The full sample consisted of first-year community college students who were enrolled in an associate’s degree or certificate program during the fall semester of 2003 and who were eligible to receive federal financial aid (unweighted <italic>n</italic> = 3,200).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0091552112469251">1</xref></sup> International students were omitted from the sample because in most cases they are not eligible for federal financial aid. The restricted sample included only those students from the full sample who were enrolled part time during the fall 2003 semester (unweighted <italic>n</italic> = 700).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0091552112469251">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>The dependent variable was whether the student persisted from the fall semester of 2003 to the spring semester of 2004 (0 = <italic>did not persist to spring</italic>; 1 = <italic>persisted to spring</italic>). The decision was made to examine within-year, rather than between-year, persistence, because research has found that financial concerns are more likely to cause students to drop out during the academic year, while academic factors are more often the source of between-year attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0091552112469251">Somers &amp; St. John, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0091552112469251">St. John, Musoba, &amp; Simmons, 2003</xref>). Students were classified as having persisted if they transferred to another institution midyear but were enrolled in the spring semester of 2004 at their new institution.</p>
<p>Selection of the independent variables was guided by the integrated conceptual framework. These variables were entered into the model in five categories: (a) demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity); (b) cultural and social capital (primary spoken language, parent’s level of education); (c) precollege variables (highest level of high school mathematics completed, high school GPA, delayed enrollment into college); (d) college experiences (attendance intensity, first-semester GPA, declared major, took a remedial course, met with an academic advisor); and (e) environmental pull factors (income status, hours worked per week, having a dependent child, filed a FAFSA).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0091552112469251">
<title>Analytic Methods</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were used to explore the association between filing a FAFSA and the likelihood of being retained to the spring semester after controlling for variables that, according to the conceptual model, have an influence on student persistence. Because the dependent or outcome variable was binary (i.e., persisted or dropped out) a logistic regression is the appropriate method for addressing these research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112469251">Cabrera, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112469251">Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091552112469251">J. S. Long, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0091552112469251">Peng, Lee, &amp; Ingersoll, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0091552112469251">Peng, So, Stage, &amp; St. John, 2002</xref>). Two logistic regression models were employed. The first model included the full sample of students, and the second model included only those students who were enrolled part time during the fall 2003 semester. The purpose of analyzing the restricted sample of only part-time students was to determine if there was an interaction among any of the covariates and part-time enrollment. This group was of particular interest because existing reports have found that part-time students are less likely to file a FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0091552112469251">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0091552112469251">King, 2006</xref>) and less likely to remain enrolled during their first year at the community college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>). If the magnitude of an odds ratio varies between the full and restricted samples, this indicates that the association between the covariate and persistence is different for part-time students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0091552112469251">Chen, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>A logistic regression predicts the natural log odds of Y from X. The odds of Y are ratios of probabilities (π) of Y happening (i.e., a student persisted from the fall semester to the spring semester) to probabilities of Y not happening (1-π). A logistic regression has the following general form:</p>

<p>where π is the probability of the outcome of interest (being retained to spring semester), α is the y intercept, β<sub>1 . . .</sub> β<sub>k</sub> are the regression coefficients, and | (approximately 2.72) is the base of the system of natural logarithms. Predictor variables (X) can be continuous or categorical, but the outcome (Y) is dichotomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0091552112469251">Cabrera, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0091552112469251">Hosmer &amp; Lemeshow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091552112469251">Long, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0091552112469251">Peng, Lee, et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0091552112469251">Peng, So, et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>A benefit of logistic regression is that the coefficients are easily interpreted as odds ratios. Odds ratios are obtained directly from the logistic regression model by exponentiating an independent variable’s coefficient. When an odds ratio is greater than one, the group of students represented by that predictor is—by a factor of one minus the odds ratio—more likely than the reference group to remain enrolled. If the odds ratio is equal to one, there is no difference between the persistence likelihood of the group represented by the predictor and the persistence likelihood of the reference group. Finally, if the odds ratio is less than one, the group represented by the predictor is—by a factor of one minus the odds ratio—less likely than the reference group to persist to their second year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0091552112469251">J. S. Long, 1997</xref>). Hypothetically, if males serve as the reference group, and the odds ratio for females is .75, this can be interpreted as females having 25% lower odds of persistence than males.</p>

<title>Weighting</title>
<p>As recommended with all complex or multistage cluster sample data sets, weights and design effects were used to account for the oversampling of certain groups and for clusters of homogeneity within sampling levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0091552112469251">Thomas &amp; Heck, 2001</xref>). Because BPS:04/06 was the data set used in this study, best practices recommended for analyzing NCES data sets were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0091552112469251">Hahs-Vaughn, 2006</xref>). The raw weight used in the analysis was the BPS:04/06 variable named WTA000. The raw weight was normalized by dividing WTA000 by its average (205.5717). Using the normalized raw weight helped account for the oversampling of certain student populations.</p>
<p>Because the analysis was conducted at a single level (in contrast to a multilevel model), design effects were considered to avoid underestimating standard errors—a problem that can emerge because of the clusters of homogeneity caused by multilevel sampling. A design effect for the outcome variable was computed using the NCES Data Analysis System (DAS) website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nces.ed.gov/das/">http://nces.ed.gov/das/</ext-link>). Because our outcome variable is derived from two different BPS:04/06 variables (ENRFALL and ENRSPR), the design effect was computed for each (ENRFALL = 1.6644, and ENRLSPR = 1.3903) using the estimate covariance analyses tool on the DAS website; to be conservative, the larger value was used. The normalized weight was divided by 1.6644. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 19.0 using the normalized weight and adjusted design effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0091552112469251">Hahs-Vaughn, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0091552112469251">2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of this study is the statistical issue of self-selection bias inherent when analyzing observational data. Accordingly, the analytical goal of this study is to describe the association between FAFSA filing and persistence for community college students rather than to assert causation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0091552112469251">Murnane &amp; Willett, 2011</xref>). The decision to file may be interrelated with family characteristics that influence persistence, and cross-sectional logistic regression analysis may not control for all of the numerous factors that influence a student’s decision to file a FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0091552112469251">Bettinger, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0091552112469251">DesJardins, Ahlburg, &amp; McCall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0091552112469251">DesJardins &amp; McCall, 2010</xref>). This statistical bias can potentially undermine the precision of estimates, the magnitude of effects, and sometimes even the direction of effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0091552112469251">Dowd, 2008</xref>). Due to potential bias from self-selection and omitted variables, it is beyond the scope of this study to assert causation among any of the predictor variables and student persistence.</p>

<p>In terms of student demographics and sociocultural capital, the full and restricted samples appear relatively similar. For example, across both samples students were more likely to be female, to be White, to have English as their primary language, and to have parents who did not obtain a 4-year degree. The two samples are also similar with regard to high school and college academic performance. In both samples, about one quarter of students did not take at least Algebra 2 in high school, and just more than one half of both groups earned a high school GPA that is above 3.0. The average college GPA was just below a 3.0 for both samples. Approximately 33% of both samples took remedial coursework during their first semester at the community college.</p>
<p>There are proportional differences between the two samples when considering college experience variables and environmental pull factors. The restricted sample of part-time students had a larger proportion of students who never met with their advisors and a larger proportion of students who had an undeclared major. The restricted sample of part-timers also had a greater proportion of students who delayed their enrollment after high school for at least a year. On average, students in both samples worked more than 20 hours per week, but the sample of part-time students had a higher average number of weekly hours worked.</p>
<p>There are also differences between the full and restricted samples in terms of the primary predictor of interest (i.e., FAFSA filing status) and the outcome variable. Regarding persistence rates, 9.82% of students in the full sample did not persist to their second semester, compared to 19.43% of the restricted sample. The restricted sample also had a lower proportion of students who filed a FAFSA. Only 60.71% of the restricted sample filed a FAFSA compared to 73.04% of the full sample. Despite similarities between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, sociocultural capital, and academic performance, part-time students were proportionally different than the students in the full sample in terms of their college experiences, FAFSA filing behavior, and persistence.</p>

<p>Results from the logistic regression indicate that for a majority of the predictor variables, the odds of persisting for the comparison group were not statistically different than the odds of persistence for the reference group. There was a negative association between delaying enrollment and persistence. In the full sample, students who delayed their enrollment had 42% lower odds of persisting compared to students who enrolled in the community college directly after high school. This relationship was similar for part-time students in the restricted sample, indicating that the negative association is not dependent on enrollment status. High school GPA was not a strong predictor of persistence for either the full or restricted sample, though college GPA was.</p>
<p>There was also a positive association between meeting with an advisor and within-year persistence. In the full sample, students who met sometimes or often with an advisor had 43% higher odds of persisting compared to students who never met with their advisors. This relationship was not statistically significant for the restricted sample, though, again, this is most likely due to the increased amount of uncertainty resulting from the smaller sample size.</p>
<p>Data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0091552112469251">Table 1</xref> indicate that the proportion of students who did not persist was larger in the restricted sample than in the full sample. The logistic regression confirmed this negative association between part-time status and persistence after controlling for other relevant predictors of persistence. In the full sample, students who enrolled part time had 77% lower odds of persisting compared to students who enrolled full time. Filing a FAFSA was positively associated with persistence across both samples. In the full sample, filing a FAFSA resulted in 79% higher odds of persisting after controlling for the other predictors in the model. The positive association between FAFSA filing and persistence was even stronger for the part-time students in the restricted sample. Part-time students who filed a FAFSA had 100% higher odds of persisting compared to part-time students who did not file.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>Results from our analysis suggest that failure to file a FAFSA negatively affects the ability of community college students, especially those attending part time, to persist from the fall to the spring semester during their first year of enrollment. By not filing a FAFSA, many students miss the opportunity to receive grant, loan, or work-study financial aid that could help them lower the total cost of attendance and persist to their second semester. For many nonfilers at the community college, the financial aid left on the table would have come in the form of Pell grants, which do not have to be repaid. Viewed in light of the conceptual model, missing out on financial aid is a factor that may pull students away from the community college soon after enrolling.</p>
<p>Before discussing the implications of these findings, it is worth giving attention to the other predictors in the model that were associated with persistence. In agreement with existing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0091552112469251">Hawley &amp; Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0091552112469251">Settle, 2011</xref>), delaying enrollment into the community college after high school and earning a lower cumulative GPA during the first semester of college were negatively associated with persistence for both samples. Students in the full sample who had met with an academic advisor during their first semester were more likely to persist than students who did not meet with an advisor. This finding also supports existing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0091552112469251">Bahr, 2008a</xref>) and underscores the need to ensure that community college students receive academic advising and counseling during their first semester of enrollment. Future studies should give attention not only to the frequency of contact with an academic advisor but also to the question of how different advising approaches and the quality of advising affect student persistence.</p>
<p>Compared to all other predictors in the model, FAFSA filing status had the strongest association with whether or not students persisted to their second semester. This underscores the importance of public policies and institutional practices that help increase FAFSA filing among community college students. In an effort to simplify the process of applying for federal financial aid, the federal government introduced a shortened version of the FAFSA in January 2010 and soon thereafter made it possible for FAFSA filers to seamlessly retrieve their relevant tax information from the Internal Revenue Service. Empirical research is needed to determine how these modifications to the application have affected FAFSA filing rates across different groups, including students attending community colleges.</p>
<p>Although simplifications to the FAFSA were intended to make filing easier for students, the additional administrative burden is often placed on financial aid offices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0091552112469251">Asher, 2007</xref>). For example, financial aid counselors at community colleges have reported spending considerable amounts of their time responding to requests to verify student information that is no longer provided on the new version of the FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091552112469251">McKinney &amp; Roberts, 2012</xref>). As they strive to serve students, community college financial aid offices already face multiple barriers, such as “limited space and resources, staff turnover, communicating effectively with a diverse and dispersed student populations, keeping technology up to date, and making sure the college is compliant with ever-changing regulations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>, p. 4). At many large community colleges, the counselor-to-student ratio in financial-aid offices can be 1:1,000 or higher, making it nearly impossible to provide each student with tailored advice and guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0091552112469251">McKinney &amp; Roberts, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these barriers, community colleges must make a concerted effort to facilitate FAFSA filing among all students who would be eligible for federal, state, or institutional aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>). Proactive strategies are needed to communicate with students before they even arrive on campus. Financial aid administrators can make presentations at local high schools and college fairs to provide students with early and accurate information about the FAFSA and paying for college. Students who apply early to the community college should receive email reminders about the FAFSA and information about where they can receive assistance to complete the application. But the open-admission process used at community colleges allows late registration with the result that many students will pursue financial aid after enrolling for classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552112469251">LaManque, 2009</xref>). Community college financial aid offices should be prepared to help these students complete the FAFSA during late registration. In addition, initiatives like the FAFSA H&amp;R Block Experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0091552112469251">Bettinger et al., 2009</xref>) and College Goal Sunday (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.collegegoalsundayusa.org/">http://www.collegegoalsundayusa.org/</ext-link>) hold great promise for improving FAFSA filing among community college students by offering early intervention and personalized assistance to students who are overwhelmed by the financial aid process.</p>
<p>The present study offers an initial investigation of the relationship between filing a FAFSA and the persistence of community college students, but there are many other questions worth addressing in future studies. To reduce potential self-selection bias, future research could utilize matching techniques (e.g., propensity scores) to develop equivalent groups of filers and nonfilers before comparing their within- or between-year persistence rates. Analyzing institutional data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0091552112469251">LaManque (2009)</xref> found that students who filed a FAFSA earlier were more likely to receive better financial aid packages than students who applied late. This line of inquiry could be replicated using nationally representative data to better understand how the timing of filing a FAFSA affects students’ financial aid packages. Finally, qualitative studies that explore why community college students who are eligible for Pell grants did not file a FAFSA would represent a useful contribution to the literature.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our nation’s community colleges will play a central role in the national completion agenda, which aims to increase by 50% the number of certificate and degree graduates by 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0091552112469251">McPhail, 2011</xref>). Findings from the present study suggest that increasing the number of students who file a FAFSA is an approach that could help facilitate persistence and degree attainment among community college students. At present, there is considerable room for improvement given that approximately 42% of community college students who would be eligible for a Pell grant do not file a FAFSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0091552112469251">Kantrowitz, 2009</xref>). Recent reports have emphasized the pressing need to dramatically improve the utilization of financial aid among community college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0091552112469251">ACSFA, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0091552112469251">College Board Advocacy and Policy Center, 2010</xref>), and the critical first step in this process is to ensure that every student who is eligible for financial aid completes a FAFSA. Realization of this goal could help minimize the financial barriers that often impede the persistence of community college students.</p>
