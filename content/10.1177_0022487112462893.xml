<abstract>
<p>In this article, the authors examine the effect of a National Writing Project professional development model on a group of middle school writing teachers. The authors examine how contact with other professionals in intensive week-long sessions as well as mentoring from the professional development coach affected the teachers’ concept of themselves as professionals, as writers, and as colleagues, as well as how this attitudinal change affected their classrooms and students. The authors begin with an overview of recent scholarship on teacher “empowerment,” efficacy, and the National Writing Project. The authors then explicate their methodology and findings from this 2-year study, including how advanced knowledge builds confidence, how autonomy sustains empowerment, and how support can strengthen teachers, whereas other disempowering forces can negatively affect teacher actions. Implications for other professional development models as well as for future National Writing Project endeavors are included.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the 1970s, American children learned about government, the English language, and other topics through <italic>School House Rock</italic>, a series of animated public service announcements. These tools paired catchy tunes with cartoons to capture kids’ imaginations, leaving each child with the admonition, “Knowledge is power.” If this statement were true, then teachers—presumably the most knowledgeable people in the country—should be among the most powerful. However, as a 2009 <italic>Washington Post</italic> column attests, knowledge alone may not make teachers powerful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022487112462893">Fine, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>What is power? Common understandings include physical, mental, or other types of strength, authority, as well as the ability to influence or act. Power, then, is a quality found both within individuals and tied to their relationships with others. It can be something one increases in oneself, like strength, but can depend on how other people can be persuaded, acted on, or directed.</p>
<p>Focusing on a group of teachers, we noted that their sense of power—their ability to act, their strength of self and self-worth, and their authority—seemed to change within a professional development context; we noticed an undercurrent within the interviews related to teacher autonomy, empowerment, and support. We then focused on their notions of their own power in the educational system, especially their classrooms, and how their understandings of power (or lack thereof) affect their students and others. Although we believe that usually these teachers constructed knowledge together, we could not overlook those instances when knowledge was exchanged as well.</p>
<p>In recent years, teacher “empowerment” has become a cliché, casting teachers as omnipotent beings striving to save the world. In our view, nothing could be further from the truth. Today’s teachers have incurred more restrictions, rules, and guidelines than in any previous era. Their boundaries grow ever smaller with each new mandate from administrators, legislators, and departments of education—not to mention the public and popular media. In addition, teacher empowerment has often been viewed as dictatorial: teachers as acerbic despots who wield authority to browbeat their subjects into subservience. This viewpoint is also largely unfounded. Most teachers scrape small nuggets of authority, autonomy, and collaboration in their attempts to help students succeed and enjoy learning. This perspective of teacher empowerment—small measures of authority and ability to act that teachers seize or are given to them—is the focus of our analysis.</p>
<p>Drawing from theorists who influenced the development of the National Writing Project (NWP; Moffett, Britton, Elbow, Emig, Graves, Zinsser, and so on) in its over 30 years as a leader in teacher writing instruction, we see teacher empowerment as the umbrella that shelters the main themes suggested in our research: gaining knowledge and finding voice can empower teachers, having choice and control of classroom practices can empower teachers, and creating networks of support can empower teachers. These three threads, based in the tenets of NWP, link through the potential to create confident professional educators.</p>
<p>While both researchers are affiliated with the NWP, whose state network hosted the Literacy Academies studied here, we attempted to see objectively what teachers stated about their perceived power within the educational system and possibly to determine how the Literacy Academies might have tempered those perceptions, if at all. We looked to published NWP researchers for models in remaining objective while connected to the subject. Authors such as Ann Lieberman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487112462893">Lieberman, &amp; Wood, 2002</xref>) and Linda Friedrich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487112462893">Lieberman, &amp; Friedrich, 2007</xref>) served as examples of how consultants associated with the NWP promote reasoned and insightful findings.</p>

<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation, educational researchers have focused on how standards-based reforms and test-based perceptions of education affect teachers, intending to increase support for educational programs and teachers. Part of this research targets conceptions of power, support, autonomy, and efficacy, all of which interlink, each one helping to shape the other. For instance, to feel empowered, teachers may need to feel supported, to feel they can make decisions affecting their own classrooms and students, and/or to feel they can make a difference in the lives of their students. This interweaving will be seen in our discussion of the literature.</p>
<sec id="section3-0022487112462893">
<title>Gaining New Knowledge, the NWP, and Empowerment</title>
<p>These “collective teacher efficacy” experiences appeared to parallel the NWP’s approach to professional development, which we have witnessed throughout our years of work with the NWP. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112462893">Blau (2003)</xref> does not use the term <italic>collective teacher efficacy</italic>, he articulates its functioning within the NWP:
<disp-quote>
<p>Having experienced what it means to learn in a community of learners, teachers are inclined to count such learning as more authoritative and authentic than any other and to think of such learning as the proper aim of their own instruction. They therefore become determined to turn their own classrooms into learning communities that will function like a Writing Project, where respect for the intelligence of every learner is the starting place for all activity, where every member is seen as a source of knowledge and expertise, and where all learners are expected and required to take responsibility for their own learning, as well as assisting others to learn. In such a community, learning entails the production of knowledge as well as its reception, and knowledge is always seen as provisional and subject to challenge and refinement. (p. 16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the teacher empowerment designs sound like tenets of the NWP: Every colleague is a potential helper; teachers should teach other teachers; teachers should contribute to the collective knowledge through public forums; learners should “own” their learning; learning should occur in practice and rapport; learning communities must have several entry points; teachers must reflect on their teaching, which occurs when they reflect on their learning; teachers should take a stance of inquiry; and teachers should individualize their professional identity and connect it to the professional community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022487112462893">Lieberman &amp; Wood, 2002</xref>, pp. 41-42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487112462893">NWP, 2012</xref>). The NWP states that it addresses “knowledge, expertise, and leadership” in American educators, seeking to promote growth in writing abilities, as its name suggests, and to advance learning at all levels, across the curriculum.</p>
<p>The NWP tenets echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022487112462893">Galen’s (2005)</xref> proposed strategies for administrators wishing to promote teacher empowerment, noting that learning communities are “a place where all participants—teachers, principals, parents and students—engage in learning and teaching” (p. 33). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112462893">Farrell and Weitman (2007)</xref> state that learning communities consist of considering every person as an expert with a given field and valuing every person’s expertise. This idea reflects the NWP motto, stressing every teacher has something of value to share: teachers teaching teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487112462893">NWP, 2012</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022487112462893">Lieberman and Friedrich (2007)</xref> state, NWP teachers are both teachers and learners.</p>
<p>This partnership design is an established model within NWP, at every level. Not only is NWP a nationwide network, but it also fosters relationships at the state level. In our home state of Missouri and in many other states, site directors and others affiliated with individual sites join forces in statewide networks, cooperating to build projects, seek funding, and liaison with state departments of education. The NWP also builds relationships with public universities, sharing equally in the responsibilities and rewards of housing a site on a university campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022487112462893">NWP, 2012</xref>). Many of these sites embrace a “shared directorship” model, with two or three professionals working together as the directors of that site. This cooperation extends to the teacher consultants working together in their “Summer Invitational Institute” (SI), in advanced and special topics summer institutes, wherein they share strategies, ideas, theories, and advice in navigating the political world of education. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022487112462893">Gallehr (1984)</xref> states, “We are not alone,” meaning everyone within the NWP umbrella has support—from directors supporting directors, to teacher consultants supporting other teacher consultants.</p>
<p>The NWP has built an infrastructure that builds teacher knowledge and support, and then uses that expertise and network. Teacher consultants become “teacher leaders,” providing professional development to schools in their geographic area. St. John and Stokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022487112462893">Inverness Research, 2008</xref>) state, “This group of leading teachers is not only encouraged to remain in the profession, but their skills are tapped and their energy harnessed as they serve their fellow teachers” (p. 15). These researchers also point out that 98% of NWP teacher consultants stay in education throughout their professional lives, bucking current trends in teacher retention, and that 72% remain in educational employment after retiring. These numbers imply that NWP consultants continue feeling passionate about education and have a system of support and a depth of content knowledge keeping that interest alive.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022487112462893">
<title>Teachers’ Voices and Empowerment</title>
<p>Before teachers can confer a sense of empowerment to students, they must first feel themselves to be strong and engaged professionally and personally. They must speak and write in confident and articulate voices, using principles of rhetoric and critical discourse analysis, such as specificity, emphasis, metaphor, repetition, syntactic variety, qualifiers, superlatives, and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112462893">Bizzell &amp; Herzberg, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>However, motivating and sustaining the rhetoric of confident voices is the teacher’s self-efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112462893">Enderlin-Lampe (2002)</xref> cites Bandura’s Self-Efficacy Theory, in which an individual’s certainty in his or her own capabilities leads to positive interactions with his or her environments. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112462893">Protheroe (2008)</xref> states, “A teacher’s sense of efficacy can lead to gains in the classroom” (p. 42). More simply, confident teachers are more likely to positively impact students and instill within them better self-confidence. (Confidence is often best observed in teachers’ voices.) But how does one develop self-efficacy? Denham and Michael (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112462893">Enderlin-Lampe, 2002</xref>) determined that efficacy results from a mixture of environmental factors, such as one’s education, peers, society, and administration. Teachers’ knowledge, then, teamed with the people surrounding them, determine in large part their level of efficacy.</p>
<p>Before discussing how these environmental factors might influence teacher efficacy, it may help to identify a teacher with efficacy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112462893">Protheroe (2008)</xref> states that teachers with strong efficacy plan and organize more, experiment, and listen to new ideas. More persistent and resilient, they are less judgmental of students and less likely to refer problematic students to special education. Implicit in this description is that these teachers have some ability to make decisions in their classrooms and perhaps in their school, district, community, or in the larger educational system, like in state or federal governments’ educational decisions. In addition, these teachers have a recognized knowledge base and are acknowledged as experts in their fields. Again, this inner and outer reflection of empowerment rises: To have some autonomy, teachers must feel confident in themselves as professionals and be recognized by others as experts.</p>
<p>Protheroe promotes the next level of teacher efficacy—collective teacher efficacy—stating that not only do individual teachers believe in their own abilities to make a difference, but that they also believe <italic>all</italic> teachers within their community try to exert a positive effect on student achievement. Looking at this influence in another light, collective efficacy means teachers work together—sharing ideas, talking about the process, motivating each other—to ensure students reach their utmost potential: a community of change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022487112462893">
<title>Social Context and Empowerment</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112462893">Farrell and Weitman (2007)</xref> propose teacher empowerment as three-pronged: teachers experiencing more access to decision making, achieving greater knowledge, and seeing improved teacher status. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112462893">Esposito and Smith (2006)</xref> assert teacher empowerment, especially used in action research, includes four elements: choice, design, sharing, and results. Within this context, teachers were able to choose subjects related to their content, rather than suffer a scripted classroom; design the method of their classroom practices; share positive and negative outcomes with appropriate personnel (administration or peers); and know results benefited their classrooms because they were linked to teacher- and student-identified needs. Empowerment includes an element of autonomy and a sense of efficacy; those choices will make a difference in the teacher’s and students’ lives.</p>
<p>Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487112462893">Allen (2004)</xref> finds teacher empowerment has four voices, each compelling more from teachers: a voting voice, an advisory voice, a delegated voice, and a dialogical voice. The first three are described as providing input, but unless that input is followed, they have little real power. The dialogical voice, the most complex of the four, entails reflection and divergent perspectives, amending instructional practices. Empowerment involves a give and take, a dialogue between the teacher and others, and what the teacher says will have impact on decisions—and the future. This intermixing of stimulus from within and without a person has been promoted as a key feature of empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487112462893">Chen, 2002</xref>), reflecting our definition earlier of empowerment’s root word, “power.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112462893">Davis and Wilson (2000)</xref> state empowerment consists of two types: relational and personal. Relational consists of all those outside forces as well as the individual’s effect on those forces, whereas personal is the “power to exercise one’s craft with confidence” (p. 349).</p>
<p>Overall, this internal and external dynamic reflects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022487112462893">Paulo Friere’s (2007)</xref> theories on empowerment:
<disp-quote>
<p>In problem-posing education, people develop their power to perceive critically <italic>the way they exist</italic> in the world <italic>with which</italic> and <italic>in which</italic> they find themselves; they come to see the world not as a static reality, but as a reality in process, in transformation. (p. 83, emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Friere’s notion of transformation—of “seeing reality as process”—applied to the highly successful teachers explored in <italic>UpDrafts: Case Studies in Teacher Renewal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022487112462893">Fox, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The teachers in the <italic>UpDrafts</italic> study, regardless of age or teaching experience, initially seemed to view their reality as static. When major changes occurred, like being assigned to teach a new grade level or taking a new position at another school, they dealt with feelings of <italic>personal t</italic>rauma. When major changes occurred in their personal lives, like the death of a sibling at a young age, they encountered feelings of <italic>professional</italic> trauma. One affected the other. These “ruptures” or “transformations” in teachers’ lives—professional and personal—necessitated they somehow renew themselves for the classroom. The guiding question of the <italic>UpDrafts</italic> study was, “How do teachers renew themselves for the classroom?” Their research revealed four main themes or processes, which appear relevant to our study, if readers keep in mind that “teacher renewal” and “teacher empowerment” are quite similar constructs. It is very difficult for one to exist without the other.</p>
<p>This perception of power and teachers’ influence on the world (and its influence on them) plays an essential role in teacher empowerment. This role is explored in several studies that connect teacher empowerment with student empowerment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022487112462893">Ingersoll (2007)</xref> finds schools where teachers exert more authority in their own classrooms, and within the entire school structure, generally experience fewer issues with student misconduct, have better cooperation between teachers and administrators, and sustain a lower rate in teacher turnover.</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022487112462893">Wallace’s (2006)</xref> study of teachers during a professional development series, much like the Literacy Academies, found teacher empowerment could be related directly to student empowerment. For instance, “Cordelia [a teacher in the study] saw that instruction in both reading and writing came down to empowering students with strategies to be successful on their own” (p. 153). As this teacher was strengthened in her content and her perception of ability to act (two facets of power’s definition), she transmitted that power to students by giving <italic>them</italic> options and strategies.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data for this article derive from a 2-year study of the Missouri Literacy Academy, professional development sessions coordinated by the Missouri Writing Projects Network (MWPN), and Missouri’s Regional Professional Development Centers (RPDC). The MWPN, a statewide consortium of NWP sites, provides quality instruction in the teaching of writing in Missouri schools; at the time of this study, these sites were funded through federal grant money, matched by funds from local institutions, usually colleges and universities. The RPDC, sponsored by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, operated offices in nine sites across Missouri, providing professional development for many educational needs, not just writing. In the 1st year, the sessions were held over 1 week during the summer, followed by four 1-day sessions during the school year at nine sites within Missouri. In the 2nd year, the academies were largely online modules, discussion groups, and one-to-one conferences with the Literacy Academy coach.</p>
<sec id="section7-0022487112462893">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>For this article, we focus on the 8 teachers who participated <italic>both</italic> years of the study, as the data from the other 28 participants reaffirm the findings associated with the smaller group. All participants were middle school teachers from across the state, teaching in Grade 5 through 9, in Missouri public schools. All 8 participants teach in rural locales, some hours away from any metropolitan area. Of them, 2 had earned a graduate degree, with the rest having earned bachelor’s degrees. At the beginning of the study, the participants’ teaching experience ranged from 2 years to 14 years, averaging 6.5 years. Although the original agreement with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education intended the academy teachers be from schools not making adequate yearly progress, the academy participants generally comprised teachers whose schools were at every level of proficiency in language arts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022487112462893">Figure 1</xref> provides more detailed information on the individual participants.</p>
<fig id="fig1-0022487112462893" position="float">

<caption><p>Participants’ number of years teaching experience, highest degree held, and school location</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022487112462893-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The participants in this study were asked to complete several tasks the 1st year: administer pre- and postwriting prompts for adjudication at a national scoring event, complete a survey during their Literacy Academy, and consent to be observed and/or interviewed in the fall directly following their Literacy Academy experience. Six interviewers, trained at a day-long session for norming purposes, conducted these interviews. For this article, the data analyzed only included the surveys, the interviews, the observations, and the informal communications between the researchers and the academies’ coaches.</p>
<p>In the 2nd year of the study, the requirements changed little; teachers administered pre- and postwriting samples for adjudication nationally, completed a survey in the spring, and were observed and interviewed in the spring. This time change from fall to spring may have been a critical factor in findings, as it allowed more opportunity for the Literacy Academy practices to be implemented, reflected on, and judged. An interviewer from the previous year conducted seven interviews, whereas an NWP teacher consultant, trained via video conferences and emails, conducted the eighth interview. Only the surveys, interviews, observations, and informal communications with the academy coach comprised the data being analyzed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022487112462893">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The extent to which participants and coaches were willing to share limited the data collected in the study. If they were unwilling to share or uncomfortable talking about events, then the study would have stalled. In addition, relying on others for data collection took some of the control for this research out of our hands. Thus, we were mindful that this situation also limited the data collection, seen in key questions going unasked during some of the interviews. However, it allowed a level of objectivity, as interviewers had little incentive to sway results; their only tie to the results derived from being NWP consultants within the MWPN.</p>
<p>The surveys provided little data concerning empowerment, autonomy, or support. These documents were referenced for information that might color the teachers’ perceptions and feelings, such as number of years teaching, other professional development taken, and level of education. All relevant data were compiled and analyzed before the 2nd-year interviews were conducted. This approach had the intent that the second set of interviews could include “support questions” unique to each individual as well as repeat questions asked during the previous year’s interview. These questions included queries into classroom practices, such as processes in teaching writing, purposes and audiences for student writing, specific practices from the academies being used in the classroom, and assessments. Other topics addressed the school climate and generated much of the data used here. These queries included the following items:</p>
<list id="list1-0022487112462893" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How do you sustain your professional growth as a writing teacher?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What professional development related to the teaching of writing, if any, have you participated in during the past 5 years?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What strategies from that professional development, if any, have you implemented in your classroom?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What support did you receive for implementing those strategies?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How would you describe your school climate?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How would you describe your collegiality with teachers in your department or across your school?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As mentioned previously, some interviews included follow-up questions unique to each interviewee based on the 1st year’s interview. In addition, the interviewer was allowed a measure of flexibility to follow tangents as she saw fit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022487112462893">
<title>Research Questions</title>
<p>Within the situated context of the NWP professional development model, with its major and overlapping components of increasing teacher knowledge while developing their feelings of support and autonomy/efficacy, we arrived at the following overarching question for this study: <italic>How do teachers renew themselves for the classroom?</italic></p>
<p>We developed the following subquestions:</p>
<list id="list2-0022487112462893" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How does additional knowledge gained from professional development influence teachers’ perceptions of their own power as professionals?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When teachers explain how their professional development experiences affected their own teaching, how does their “voice” reflect their own levels of confidence and success in the classroom?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What sources of support do teachers receive, and how does that support affect teachers’ professional lives?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What forces inhibit teachers from evolving in their profession, and how do these forces influence their perceptions of themselves as professionals?</p></list-item>

<p>Our primary data set is transcripts of interviews focusing on what the teachers implemented from knowledge they gained from the literacy academies. We were equally interested in how teachers applied their new knowledge as well as the roles played by their colleagues, administrators, and so on. Our analysis attempts to explore whether a more confident teacher provides other benefits to education. Although connecting empowerment of teachers to student writing performance cannot be proven here, certainly the implicit logic remains: More knowledgeable, more confident, more supported teachers make a difference, as the studies noted earlier suggest. In addition, we initially relied on a semigrounded theory approach, reading through the data and letting topics rise to the surface. Because this study grew out of a previous, larger study, some overlap occurred in the types of evidence we explored. This report includes the coding scheme used for each study (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022487112462893">Appendix A</xref>, “Coding Scheme for the Literacy Academy Study and the Teacher Knowledge, Voice, and Support Study”). For example, in the first study on teachers’ practices, the code “PD” was used to indicate “professional development” and “C” indicated “community of teachers.” By the second study, these two codes were collapsed into one: “collegiality.” Later, this category expanded back into two categories: “SE” and “SD”—“social empowerment” and “social disempowerment,” respectively. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0022487112462893">Appendix B</xref> contains a sample of a completed classroom observation sheet intended to record, as objectively as possible, what occurred in that classroom at that specific time (i.e., time intervals for each task or event, the teacher’s talk and actions, the students’ talk and actions, and general observations). In addition, please see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3-0022487112462893">Appendix C</xref> for a sample coded transcript of the current study only.</p>
<p>After the initial coding for the first study (by one of us as well as several other interviewers), we returned to the transcripts with a “semigrounded theory” approach to determine whether impressions of knowledge/social context and support/voice were valid. Next, we returned to the transcripts and “wrote out,” in more descriptive, cohesive phrases, what we were observing with these codes. Both researchers were in agreement by the final review of transcripts, accompanied by resolving minor differences in coding.</p>
<p>Once we settled on four themes, we analyzed data accordingly, striving to identify evidence for each theme, whether stated directly (as an assertion or simple declarative sentence) or strongly implied by the participant. We discussed any differences we may have had on any piece or instance of data and reached agreement. The following sections summarize our procedures for analyzing our three major constructs: knowledge, voice, and social context. The social context construct was categorized into two basic categories: “The teacher expresses support from others for her work” and “The teacher expresses a lack of support from others for her work.” Sometimes, one or more of these constructs were observable in the same piece of data.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022487112462893">
<title>Analysis of the knowledge construct</title>
<p>The analytical lens we used for participants’ discussion and reflection on the knowledge gained from their professional experience occurred in two levels—the first one direct and observable and the second one more subjective and implicit in nature. The first level consisted of a kind of simple and concrete “matching” between some or many of the approaches and activities taught during the literacy academies. For example, did the participants speak about asking their students to engage in prewriting, drafting, and revising? If so, how often? How much time was devoted to each? Or, did students read and respond to each other’s writing? Or, did the participants ask students to create “found poems” and other approaches to poetic language, such as the “ABC Fairy Tale” or the “Found Poem?” The second level of analysis involved our judging whether the teachers somehow grasped (stated or implied) the “spirit” or “governing theory” behind the teaching method. Most of the theories undergirding the academies (as well as those of the NWP) are constructivist in nature and grounded in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487112462893">Dewey (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022487112462893">Vygotsky (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022487112462893">Rosenblatt (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487112462893">Bruffee (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022487112462893">Moffett (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112462893">Elbow (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022487112462893">Smith (1997)</xref>, and so on.</p>

<sec id="section12-0022487112462893">
<title>Analysis of the voice construct</title>
<p>Teachers’ <italic>development of voice</italic> entails their expressive communication with colleagues as well as with themselves. Voice, then, means that teachers’ spoken and written discourse becomes more focused, authoritative, defined, and unique—more powerful. We believe that voice closely links to autonomy and confidence—the involvement, focus, and energy that teachers might bring to classrooms.</p>
<p>When analyzing participants’ voice, we used standard techniques of discourse and general semantics analysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022487112462893">Gee, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022487112462893">Hayakawa &amp; Hayakawa, 1991</xref>). Our language can often reveal whether we are “intensifying” something, “downplaying” something, or maintaining a balance somewhere between these two extremes. We focused on choice of words, metaphors, superlatives, or “intensifiers,” and level of specificity or generality—all of which usually occur at the word or phrase level. We examined teachers’ use of direct assertions, two-valued orientations, and contrasts, which typically occur at the sentence and paragraph levels. We agreed these language elements were most indicative of a teacher’s voice—whether strong and confident, hesitant and doubtful, or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Underlying this more visible construct of voice is “flow” experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112462893">Csiksentmihalyi, 1990</xref>). While certainly imprecise in this context, which largely involves “self-report” (we could not conclude anything about flow from the teacher observation sheets), teachers’ use of language suggested some degree of <italic>flow experiences</italic>—a deep involvement in their work, to the point that, when engaged, they are sufficiently challenged and motivated to the point that they become oblivious with the passage of time. Flow experiences can focus on teachers’ discipline, on their teaching of their discipline, and on their relationships with students and others.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0022487112462893">
<title>Analysis of the social context construct</title>
<p>S<italic>ocial context</italic> means that teachers’ ability to remain successful in the profession resides in their interactions with various communities—students, colleagues, administrators, fellow teachers at other schools, conference attendees, editors, and others—the “relational” construct noted earlier. In a few instances, we agreed to count virtual connections with “others,” including websites that teachers interacted with, such as the <italic>Online Writing Lab</italic> (OWL) website sponsored by Purdue University. We first identified all the participants’ passages that identified other people, whether by specific name of a person or group (e.g., “Mr. Jackson” or “the spring writing conference”), or by unidentified singular or plural pronouns (“she” and “they”). We saw that these avenues of support and the disempowering forces in the participants’ professional lives related directly to this construct. We were unable to further identify participants’ <italic>relationships</italic> to the people they noted.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the interviews, we noticed many empowerment-related statements. We then explored the data again using a semigrounded theory approach, allowing the topics to well-up from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112462893">Creswell, 2007</xref>). We next addressed each new piece of data with an empowerment mind-set. After several “passes” through these data, including two or three that were separated by weeks and months of time intervals, this open coding clarified four themes:</p>
<list id="list3-0022487112462893" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Knowledge can affect teacher power and confidence.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Teachers’ voices can indicate some degree of confidence and empowerment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Support and encouragement can strengthen teachers’ sense of power.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some forces can disempower teachers’ actions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>While these categories connect to one another, as noted earlier, their distinctions and what they reveal about teacher empowerment may benefit all educators. Although our three major constructs differ, they clearly link to each other and often occur simultaneously. Therefore, to be faithful to the natural context, to “keep things together which go together,” we present the following results as “pairs”: knowledge gains/voice and social context/voice.</p>
<sec id="section15-0022487112462893">
<title>Knowledge Gains and Confident Voices Demonstrate Teachers’ Power</title>
<p>As the literacy academies were intended to develop teacher knowledge in writing instruction, we analyzed the data—after our initial semigrounded theory approach—to identify instances where the teachers indicated they had learned something or benefited from new knowledge. We then reviewed the data to see what this new knowledge had wrought in the professional lives of the participants, finding that it seemed to lead to increased confidence and, to a lesser extent, a greater sense of power. Overall, participants’ discussion and reflection on their <italic>knowledge gained</italic> from their professional development experiences—and its association with their sense of confidence and voice—is this study’s most consistent finding.</p>
<p>That teachers focused squarely on their new knowledge is not surprising, as this question was asked first and most consistently throughout the 2 years of the study. However, what we discovered in our second study were some of the <italic>ways</italic> in which teachers framed and articulated their reflections on new knowledge: They often did so in confident, strong voices, as revealed in their language. In this excerpt, the underlining is ours:
<disp-quote>
<p>Each student keeps a journal and it has been <underline>great</underline> for me. They use their journals to write their responses to in-class stories and discussions. It has been <underline>most</underline> helpful for them to do book reports based on journal writing. They have to make three book reports each quarter [a curriculum requirement], and it was <underline>really</underline> hard to get <underline>more</underline> than a summary from them. Now they have to write three journal entries as they read their books. I set days when the journal entries for the book are due. <underline>Some</underline> students still write <underline>only</underline> a few lines, but <underline>most</underline> are now filling one to one-and-a-half pages. From these three entries, they have to go back and pick the most important parts to share in a final book report. I can <underline>really</underline> see differences. There is <underline>more</underline> original thought and <underline>less</underline> regurgitation in the reports. <underline>Plus</underline>, I am hearing <underline>more</underline> voices . . . <underline>more true</underline> voices in their writing. (Interview, November 25, 2007)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This teacher, Laura, focuses on the new knowledge that she gained from her professional development experience. She does so in a strong and empowering voice for a few somewhat overlapping reasons. First, the underlined words are her superlatives and intensifiers, which directly communicate confidence: <italic>great, most, really, only</italic>, and so on, as she emphasizes the positive elements.</p>
<p>Second, Laura uses a few ancient rhetorical devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112462893">Bizzell &amp; Herzberg, 1990</xref>), such as short sentences to emphasize her point, such as “I can really see differences.” Another rhetorical device for emphasis is repetition, as in “I am hearing more voices, more true voices.” Third, Laura focuses on <italic>specific</italic> elements of her teaching—not only “book reports” and “journal entries,” but the number required within a specific time frame. Not only is she specific about products but also about processes, focusing on <italic>when</italic> students make journal entries as well as the type of thinking and writing her students are generating (original thought with personal voice). When teachers speak and write in specifics, they are describing their world in a way that resides closer to real things, closer to reality, on the ladder of abstraction. Compare Laura with another teacher who might speak of her professional development in general terms: “My approach to learning has been enhanced.” When Laura speaks about three book reports and journal entries, we are confident that she knows what she is talking about. We are much less certain about the speaker of generalities. We believe communicating about new knowledge in tangible, concrete terms—in language we can see—is empowering in itself, because the speaker/writer’s linguistic “map” more closely matches his or her “territory” or actual reality. Such persuasive language tends to generate more of the same, adding to a sense of empowerment.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022487112462893">Figure 3</xref> clarifies Laura’s “before and after” contrasts, which serve to give her voice authority and power.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0022487112462893" position="float">

<caption><p>Laura’s contrasts</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022487112462893-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>When teachers use language devices (consciously or unconsciously) such as intensifiers, superlatives, short sentences, repetition, specificity, and vivid contrasts, their voices ring true and strong, embodying confidence and suggesting empowerment.</p>
<p>Of course, not all of the data denoting our knowledge/voice construct are as powerful as Laura’s, nor can we expect them to be. The differences are mainly ones of degree, as they, too, prove to be effective teachers. One key principle of No Child Left Behind Act is valuing “highly qualified teachers,” teachers who are skilled in content and classroom management. In addition, the more knowledge one attains generally leads to increased confidence. These teachers’ participation in the academies seems to have lead to amplified confidence within the classroom. Overwhelmingly, the teachers in each set of interviews indicated that the academies boosted their process knowledge and improved their confidence. For instance, Henry, in the following excerpt, uses some similar intensifiers and contrasts but with less specificity than Laura used, in the previous excerpt. Nonetheless, he stated that the academies sparked a transition in his teaching:
<disp-quote>
<p>Literacy Academy has really changed the way I teach in that I have learned that I can make things fun. I was very unsure of myself in that area before, but I’m trying . . . from that experience I came up knowing that it doesn’t have to be a big deal what you do with the kids. Little things can make the whole difference for them and can make it fun and can lead them into really good thinking projects, so it really changed the way I look at everything. (Interview, March 26, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Gwen had a similar experience, stating,
<disp-quote><p>I never would have [considered herself a writer] until I was asked to do this class [Literacy Academy]. My knowledge and abilities are becoming to where I can consider myself a writer. It’s been a wonderful element of this journey. (Interview, January 7, 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both of these teachers explicitly relate how the academies boosted their confidence by enlarging their information base and by giving them tools, such as sustained writing practice, strategies to teach writing, introductions to the latest research, time for lesson planning, and opportunity to test those tools before reflecting on their work in the follow-up meetings. These statements highlight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112462893">Protheroe’s (2008)</xref> conception of efficacy: The teachers feel confident in their own abilities and in how they can affect positive change in their students.</p>
<p>Self-confidence brought about by new knowledge was also observed in teachers who assumed authoritative stances, as Fran did, when arguing with the theorists: “Atwell has a lot of great ideas, but she also didn’t have the kind of challenges you get with 150 students from all backgrounds” (Interview, April 17, 2009). Thinkers must debate the proven leaders in the field, although this stance is not the only way these teachers asserted their confidence. Zoe, for instance, uses definitive statements to illustrate her confidence: “There are other ways to measure their learning” and “Some things work better in mine than other classrooms, and I’ve just got to find what” (Interview, December 6, 2007). In the latter example, Zoe is confident that a solution, a strategy, exists that will enable her students to succeed, and she is sure that she can find it. The confidence does not rest in her knowledge base but in her belief that she has the resources to find that solution. Likewise, Naomi’s knowledge validates what she sees as a teacher and the actions she takes: “If they don’t [get it], I have to redo or I can’t go on as a teacher . . . it’s my professional responsibility” (Interview, December 6, 2007).</p>
<p>Definitive expressions of confidence were also observed in Fox’s study (2000) of highly effective teachers. Like Fran, Zoe, and Naomi, who assumed authoritative stances with their acquisition of new knowledge and practice, teachers in Fox’s study developed their professional voice, when they distinguished how they were alike and different from their colleagues and communities. This process is known as “simultaneous differentiation and integration” (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022487112462893">Moffett &amp; Wagner, 1991</xref>). The assertive stances taken by Laura, Henry, Fran, Zoe, and Naomi use a confident tone, declarative statements, and qualifying phrases to articulate how they are alike yet different from the theorists they are studying as well as from other teachers. In general, new knowledge and information helps teachers to broaden their grasp of how they fit into larger contexts—how they are similar and how they differ.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these teachers reveal certainty in their knowledge and abilities by wanting to share ideas and strategies gained from the literacy academies with other teachers in their district. Will, for instance, discloses strategies that he feels may help other teachers in his building, especially his fellow English teachers: “I’ve shared things with some of the other teachers and Mrs. Smith, the freshman English teacher. We’ve both used things from the Literacy Academy to enhance our teaching” (Interview, March 13, 2009). In addition, he is confident enough to reach out to retired English teachers and practicing teachers at conference meetings to share techniques and create a more collaborative relationship (Interview, March 13, 2009). These examples reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112462893">Davis and Wilson’s (2000)</xref> ideas on personal and relational empowerment; in personal empowerment, teachers see the self as a writer working with other writers in workshop to improve each person’s craft, whereas in relational empowerment, they take teaching strategies back to other teachers in the school. Overall, these teachers gain varying measures of renewal through gaining new knowledge, trying it out in their classrooms, and articulating it in confident voices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022487112462893">
<title>Knowledge Gains, Confident Voices, and the Freedom to Choose Demonstrate Teacher Power</title>
<p>Another factor involved in teacher renewal, as observed through the participants’ expressions of newly gained knowledge and a confident voice (as well as “social context” explored later in this report), is the freedom to choose. When teachers gain new knowledge that they consider to be useful or meaningful, they expand their repertoire of instructional options, providing them more choices in what they do and how they do it. When people have the ability to choose, they usually feel more powerful. Making one’s choice clear is largely an act of a confident, empowered voice.</p>
<p>This status especially applies to teachers. Teachers within this study who felt that they had some control, within their classroom and school, demonstrated more empowered rhetoric. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112462893">Esposito and Smith (2006)</xref> detail, they have a voice, a determining factor, in decisions. In our study, several participants conveyed that they had some autonomy. Henry demonstrated his confidence, implying increased autonomy that may lead to empowerment: “I wouldn’t have started that story with my struggling students if I’d known just how hard it would be for them” (Interview, December 7, 2007). His assertion shows that he has the chance to try and fail. This “inferred empowerment” through choice is also reflected in Penelope’s words, “No one system is perfect; you have to figure out which pieces you like and make your own program. Try a million things, pick what works and stick with it” (Interview, December 12, 2007). Although a confident voice is a little more implied in Henry’s example, it is nonetheless present. Henry is confident enough and has established support that gives him the incentive to try new things. Accordingly, he is confident enough in his experience and knowledge to admit failure.</p>
<p>These examples reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112462893">Davis and Wilson’s (2000)</xref> personal empowerment concept, but other examples of autonomy suggest their relational empowerment notion. Teachers who profess a sense of autonomy within their classrooms and perhaps their school also seem to pass it on to students. Fran illustrates this point, conveying that she is free to focus on tailoring the lesson to augment each class’s weaknesses. However, she also conveys this ability to choose to her own students:
<disp-quote>
<p>As things go on through school, different things occur, and we just use those . . . [For instance] The ice storm we had, we missed almost a week and a half of school. So, when we came back, I said I want to know about the best story you have about the ice storm—you know, accidents, illnesses, damage you had, what a good time you had, whatever—something that had to do with the ice. So, they had another idea that they could write about . . . They choose what they want to choose. I give them a lot of choice. (Interview, April 17, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In another school with less freedom, such as schools that use scripted curriculum, the ice storm would go unexplored, but because Fran is free to choose assignments and the order of curriculum, she can then pass on that autonomy to her students through the choices they make for writing.</p>
<p>Ruth also has autonomy in her classroom, admitting that she had quit using a writing idea of author Tom Romano because she had become burned out: “I got the degree and then I was so tired of writing papers in English that I really didn’t ever want to teach it again” (Interview, April 22, 2009). However, the literacy academies reignited her passion to teach writing:
<disp-quote>
<p>When I went to the Literacy Academy it was like taking me back to where I was, and it was like “Oh, I kind of like this!” . . . I got to use some of the information I hadn’t used for years, and I started writing again. (Interview, April 22, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously, Ruth has control of instructional practices in her classroom, but it took the community of learners and being reexposed to ideas to reignite her passion. However, without the power to choose what happens in her classroom, she may have continued to be apathetic toward writing, eventually “burning out.”</p>

<sec id="section17-0022487112462893">
<title>Social Contexts and Confident Voices Demonstrate Teachers’ Power</title>
<p>Social context plays a large part in this study’s findings. It is the environment—the social context—that helps determine the empowerment and autonomy teachers experience and, thus, can help to rejuvenate or decimate teacher passion and voice. Accordingly, after we had culled our initial topics from the semigrounded theory approach, we went back to the data with social context as a lens, revealing it to be positive or negative. First, this section illustrates the positive ways that social context can influence teacher empowerment and how social situations are expressed in confident voices. The final part of this section shows the “dark side” of social environments—how they can also disempower teachers.</p>
<sec id="section18-0022487112462893">
<title>Social context as positive force for empowerment</title>
<p>Autonomy does not happen on its own; administration and faculty—and, to a lesser extent, the larger community—must support it. While some support appears conditional, such as Henry’s, “as long as they [administrators] consider it’s going to be good for kids” (Interview, March 26, 2009), most of all the statements from teachers showing empowerment also conveyed positive support from their social networks. For instance, Naomi stated, “I never get any ‘who told you that?’ No, she just leaves me alone and lets me do what I need to. She’s supportive” (Interview, May 8, 2009).</p>
<p>On other occasions, the teachers revealed a sense of nearly unconditional support from their administration because the teacher “forewarned” the supervisor of potential misunderstanding. Such was the case with Fran after returning from the literacy academies, afire to start writer’s and reader’s workshop in her classes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Last year I told my principal, “It is going to look like I’m not doing anything, but I am, but it is going to be completely different than what you’ve seen.” And he said, “Okay, go for it.” It has worked tremendously. The [next grade level] teacher . . . couldn’t believe the way some of these kids write and how much they write and how fast they can turn out a page and say, “I’m done.” And it is actually decent writing, so [the principal and colleague are] very big advocates of [workshop]. (Interview, April 17, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These statements describing support within the school reflect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112462893">Protheroe’s (2008)</xref> characteristics of teachers with strong efficacy, open to new ideas and experimentation, as well as being persistent and resilient.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022487112462893">Protheroe (2008)</xref> recounts, increased efficacy may lead to a collective efficacy within the school because teachers believe everyone impacts student learning as well as increases desire to connect with other professionals. The teachers expressed some form of networking to share ideas. Will collaborates with the other English teacher in his building as well as the special education teacher (Interview, March 13, 2009). Zoe helped her librarians to meet the state expectations. Penelope, likewise, worked with a local university—a faculty member and preservice teachers—to share ideas and improve student learning. Henry even sought and received support from parents.</p>
<p>This communal atmosphere reflects the connections the Literacy Academy tried to instill, so teachers were taking the networking from the academy and expanding it closer to home. For example, Will found that having a principal and a colleague in the academy with him was helpful: “It helps to have someone who is experiencing the same things I am” (Interview, November 25, 2007). Several of the teachers expressed their appreciation for the close, collaborative community the academies fostered. Zoe stated she found it reassuring the 1st year to have her Literacy Academy coaches “on call” (Interview, December 6, 2007). At the end of the 2nd year, she referenced her increased confidence as well as the benefit of networking:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was a very “unsure” writing teacher. I felt as though a lot of my lessons were “hit or miss.” Now I feel that I have more of a blue print or game plan for my writing instruction through the year. I also have a network of people and resources to call on when needed.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Will may have most aptly described this continuity of community. He cites numerous examples of sharing with other teachers in his building, having teachers wander into his room to look at student work posted on the walls, seeking out other teachers and retired teachers to gain a broader support system, and enjoying the camaraderie of sharing ideas while driving to meetings and conferences (Interview, March 13, 2009).</p>
<p>Ruth also continues this community but on a larger scale. She sees working collegially with other Literacy Academy participants as a supportive community:
<disp-quote>
<p>The networking within that and some of the people I was in the academy with, even after that on an informal basis we’ve been able to do some things and some sharing of things back and forth, get some ideas out there that I wouldn’t have had before. (Interview, April 22, 2009)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She also refers to connecting with a local university through its pedagogy instructors as well as its preservice teachers who work in her classroom. This connective community appears to have emboldened Ruth, for she says she tried out a multigenre article, which she felt was really challenging for her students, and although she worried that it was too much for her students, she was greatly pleased with the process and the results, and will try it again with future classes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022487112462893">
<title>Social context and confident voices</title>
<p>When we returned to the data to examine them for social context expressed in confident voices, we began to see how our earlier topics worked together to begin addressing our overarching question of renewal that through increased knowledge, teachers seemed to feel more empowered, experiencing a deepening confidence in their professional voice. When Laura was asked about the audiences for her students’ writing, her response illustrated not only her acquisition of new knowledge but also her network of support for her work, all expressed in a confident voice:
<disp-quote>
<p>Other students and some teachers come in just to see what [my] students have been writing, because everyone in the school can read what goes onto the outside bulletin board. I have upper classmen come in. Some of them say, “Wow, why didn’t we do that?” I tell them I didn’t know how to do that—that I’m learning, too . . . Having my principal, Mr. Jackson, involved in the Literacy Academy and attending workshops has been very helpful. He sees more what I am trying to do. The LA teacher across the hall is also doing the Literacy Academy. It helps to have someone who is experiencing the same things I am. The other teachers have been very supportive also. (Interview, March 13, 2009)</p>

<p>This new knowledge allows students opportunities to write on whatever topics they choose and to then “publish” their writing in many formats for all to see. The social context includes other students, especially her former students who are now upper classmen (and, we would assume, other teachers and administrators, and parents who read the public display). Laura’s support community also involves her principal, the teacher across the hall, and other teachers. The confident voice is apparent in her repeating the ostensibly exact comments made by students to her as well as her confidence in admitting that she, too, is a learner. All of these qualities appear to intertwine, creating a more positive environment for these Literacy Academy participants.</p>

<title>Social Context Can Disempower Teachers</title>
<p>Several teachers in the <italic>first</italic> interview indicated many layers of disempowering forces, not just mandated curriculum. For instance, Zoe noted that a lack of cooperation among teachers impeded her own students’ learning, such as the teachers not agreeing on a standard vocabulary, forcing each teacher to spend extra time reteaching, when a shared, common vocabulary would be less confusing for students. As Zoe stated, “I’m going against the grain of what their homeroom teacher has taught them” (Interview, December 6, 2007). Likewise, incomprehensible and contradictory policies leech power from teachers. Fran feels that she teaches to the test “even if their criteria doesn’t make sense” (Interview, November 16, 2007), and Naomi feels disempowered by her school blocking students’ access to Internet blogs, even though her after school program focuses on writing in this online genre. However, although the various disempowering examples in the 1st year interviews were numerous, only two examples appear in the second interviews.</p>
<p>Teaching is not all happy thoughts, wish fulfillment, and unbridled success. These teachers communicated that many elements disenfranchised them, such as school policies and curriculum mandates. In her first interview, Gwen cites her school’s mandate to use the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) program, a measurement system intended to monitor the literacy acquisition of students, as an impediment restricting her time for teaching language arts (Interview, January 7, 2008). However, even here (largely due to her participation in the academy), the teacher’s sense of confidence rises. In her second interview, Gwen admitted that she now has chosen to use only parts of the DIBELS program and implement more of her strategies from the academy (Interview, February 20, 2009). She has seized control despite directions from her superiors, showing greater confidence and efficacy, believing she can make greater strides using the academy strategies over the canned program.</p>
<p>This growth of confidence and decrease of references to disempowering forces appeared in nearly all the second interviews. In addition to Gwen’s comment, only one other participant referred to feeling disenfranchised, and Gwen’s comments only arose when she was directly asked about DIBELS as a follow-up from her previous interview. So, the reduction of allusions to feeling disempowered could simply be attributed to the nature of the questions. However, other than the direct follow-up questions, the questions used were nearly the same as those used the previous year.</p>
<p>What could cause this decrease in feeling disempowered expressed by teachers in their initial interviews? Several factors may contribute. As the surveys reveal, these teachers are more experienced and therefore more aware of their own capabilities as well as the expectations of their schools. Although this is logical, other reasons may exist, each tied to the literacy academies. Again, time and experience could be partly responsible. The first interviews were conducted in late 2007, soon after most of the participants had completed the initial Literacy Academy, whereas the second interviews were performed late spring of 2009. Roughly, 17 months had elapsed, giving these teachers ample time to test the teachings of the initial academies and add to that knowledge, testing more strategies from the 2nd year of academy instruction. This elapsed time also enabled them to reflect on what had worked in their classrooms that 1st year and what else they might change to improve their teaching. Fran reveals this reflective stance in her final comment on her 2nd year:
<disp-quote>
<p>This year’s academy was very beneficial. As a teacher that has taught for 11 years, I feel like the first six were a less than mediocre try at getting my students to achieve in writing. I had them write, but did not have the tools or the training to get them to write well. The ones that were naturally good writers received good grades; the ones that weren’t did not. But now I have the knowledge and experience to get even the traditionally “bad” writers to succeed and improve in their writing. My opinion is that these methods and techniques should be a part of teacher training throughout the state of Missouri.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, these teachers had further solidified their community within the academy as well as in their school, greatly increasing their support system and possibly raising their sense of power. This networking also extended to the coach. In the 1st year, the nine academies had a total of 18 coaches; in the 2nd year, the total number of coaches was only 1. Another change was that most of the contact went from face-to-face academy sessions to online meetings the 2nd year. This increase in one-to-one communication with the coach may have also boosted their sense of autonomy and confidence, lessening their sense of having no control.</p>
<p>Of course, these possibilities are just that, potential explanations. Further research into teacher empowerment and the affect professional development like the literacy academies have on a teacher’s sense of control and autonomy is needed. However, after witnessing the seeming transformations of these teachers, we can no longer rest on the idea that knowledge is power. Instead, we must also consider that knowledge—combined with support and an extended process of learning, not only how to teach writing but also how to be writers ourselves—can help us become confident, persistent, and powerful. In this era of increasingly scripted classrooms, teachers may need this sense of confidence and efficacy to step outside of what others think should be done and rely on our own knowledge and experience of “best practices.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through participating in the literacy academies, these teachers appear to have revived their interest in teaching and gained confidence in their expertise, which seems to link directly to their feelings of being able to make decisions and conduct their classes in ways to better help their students. Teachers’ increased knowledge may be the foundation for this change in attitude: The teachers have learned new theories and strategies that may make them feel more self-assured as professionals. As a community within the academies, they may also feel more supported, which may further enhance their self-confidence as a writing instructor.</p>
<p>The gains in new knowledge, expressed in confident voices and within a supportive social context, appear to not only present independently but also work collectively for teachers within this study. Each characteristic seemingly builds on the others. This symbiotic relationship parallels findings by other studies of professional development. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022487112462893">Garet, Porter, Desimone, Birman, and Yoon (2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487112462893">Garet, Birman, Porter, Desimone, &amp; Herman, 1999</xref>) study the Eisenhower Professional Development Program and find that a coherent program with active learning and a focus on content knowledge produces positive effects in teacher practice. This program for math and science educators is a long-term series that, to some extent, resembles the literacy academies: sustained professional development wherein the participants use active learning strategies (for the academies, this would be actual writing experiences), work together, and enhance their understanding of specific content. The researchers found, much as we do here, that the characteristics of their program worked collectively to promote better efficacy in math and science teachers:
<disp-quote>
<p>We find that activities with more positive structural features tend to provide professional development with more positive core features, which in turn tend of produce more positive teacher outcomes. In particular, activities of longer duration, both in time span and in contact hours, tend to place more emphasis on content than shorter activities, provide more opportunities for active learning, and provide more coherent professional development. Activities with more collective participation also tend to provide more opportunities for active learning and offer more coherent professional development. The three core features, in turn, all have independent effects on teachers’ reports of enhanced knowledge and skills. Teachers who participate in activities that place a major emphasis on mathematics and science content, for example, are substantially more likely to report enhanced knowledge and skills than teachers in activities that do not emphasize content. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022487112462893">Garet et al., 1999</xref>, pp. 7-9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, in further publications on their study, these researchers saw that support within the school, the district, the department, or the grade also contributed to positive outcomes.</p>
<p>Although our study does not examine the time span of the literacy academies’ impact on the outcomes, duration is an implicit factor in the academies: To create a community of support and trust within the academies, the participants must have time to form those relationships, to test their trustworthiness, and to cement the bonds of collegiality. Although having support within their department, school, or district certainly is a factor, an even greater one could be the collegiality developed within the academies themselves, especially when teachers—or administrators from the same department/school/district—participated together in the academies. For example, Gwen and Henry are from the same school, as are Naomi and Zoe; however, other participants indicated that their administrators may have visited the academies at least once, participating in that day’s events or beyond. Will indicated that his principal attended several of the academy sessions in the 1st year (Interview, March 13, 2009).</p>
<p>We believe knowledge can enhance feelings of power. However, this study suggests that knowledge itself is not enough to build power—at least not in this professional development model. Rather, we suggest that enhanced teacher knowledge in concert with support from various levels within the social context can create teachers with stronger voices, indicating an increased feeling of autonomy and power in their classrooms and possibly in other areas of education. While scripted classrooms may be the “trend” in education, knowledgeable, supported professionals can discover or recover their own confident voices. We suggest that the new trend in education should be sustained professional development creating communities of experts working together to improve their own teaching skills and, in the process, enhancing education at other levels. With more professional development like the literacy academies, teachers may set the course for others to follow.</p>
