<p>J. David Gillespie has produced an interesting discussion of third parties in the United States, both past and present. However, most of the work is historical, with only Chapter 4 discussing three floundering contemporary third parties: the Constitutionalists, Greens and Libertarians. This book is a suitable reference for students and academics interested in initiating the study of third parties in a country distinguished for its overall lack of multiparty competition.</p>
<p>In many ways, the book is an extension of the author’s earlier work <italic>Politics at the Periphery</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068812472766">Gillespie, 1993</xref>), which was also on the subject of American third parties, or the lack thereof. Unfortunately, the current volume, like the first one, provides mostly conjecture about the causes of third-party failure and the benefits of third-party inclusion. There is no systematic testing of the ideas brought forward. On the one hand, it may be that more descriptive tales of third-party electoral woes and early policy successes are in order. After all, the two-party duopoly which passes for electoral competition in the United States has yet to be exposed or challenged effectively. On the other hand, it may be time for academics to do more than simply re-tell the story of third-party failure in the United States and begin to identify the electoral arrangements most harmful to third-party success and the real-world consequences for policy-making and quality governance that are the result of partisan duopoly. Perhaps the public and policy entrepreneurs with third-party sympathies will pay more serious attention to the plight of third parties in the United States when academics move beyond storytelling to identify more specifically the causal mechanisms that explain third-party failure or success.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Gillespie makes clear that plurality rule elections and single-member districts stack the electoral deck in a manner that precludes sustained third-party success. He also makes it plain that many American states have written laws regarding ballot access, public financing, fusion practices, etc., that create an uneven playing field for third parties in election campaigns. What is missing is any attempt to quantify the effect different election rules or practices have on third-party disappointment. Third-party advocates often bemoan restrictive election laws seemingly with the vision that their removal will prompt good electoral fortunes. Yet, we know that in Florida and Maryland, where all ballot access restrictions for third parties were removed about 10 years ago, there still was (at the time of writing) no third-party representation in either state legislature, let alone national third-party legislators from these states. Gillespie’s book does not tackle this or the myriad other puzzles associated with third-party electoral failure in the United States.</p>
<p>Throughout the book there are references to third-party policy prowess. Gillespie notes an association between third parties and successful policy initiatives, such as the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage and the popular election of senators, but he fails to identify in even a rudimentary way the conditions whereby third parties can be expected to be most successful. Left unanswered are questions such as: Is representation in the national legislature required before third parties can effectively promote policy change? When third parties have been associated with policy change, has this resulted from an engaged public or perhaps from effective third-party leadership? Most directly, what level of third-party success is necessary or sufficient to allow third parties to establish a policy change agenda? Without answers to these questions it is difficult for reformers interested in third-party success to know where to focus their energies. Rather than tackle these admittedly tough questions, the author opts to simply re-tell stories about the glory days of third-party policy accomplishments. Admittedly, he does so with flair, which makes the book entertaining and infinitely readable.</p>
<p>Chapters 10 and 13 arguably provide the most in terms of a novel academic contribution to the discussion of third parties in the United States. Chapter 10 discusses the possibility that women and minorities may be ready-made potential third-party supporters. Their sometimes second-class treatment by status quo political arrangements might cause these groups to seek redress from a third party. This is an interesting theoretical perspective, one that warrants investigation, and a position that is not often discussed in other studies of third parties. Chapter 13 introduces the possibility of third parties gaining a foothold in American politics by establishing themselves first in state and local government. This is a perfectly logical contention. The federal system in the United States allows sub-unit governments to write their own election laws, which possibly creates real opportunities for third-party advocates. Regrettably, the chapter mostly addresses the history of old third parties that have had some success in state and local government and forgoes any prescription for how or under what circumstances third parties might expect to succeed in sub-national politics today.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Challengers to Duopoly</italic> is well written, informative and interesting it does not accomplish nearly enough. The author’s contentions in Chapter 2 about the cause of third-party electoral failure go untested. There is no systematic evidence brought to bear to support the contention that ‘third parties matter’, as suggested by the subtitle of the book. He provides anecdotes galore, which suggest that third parties can and do make a difference, but no systematic testing. It seems the time is ripe to move beyond effective narration to empirically scrutinize the contentions brought forward by third-party scholars to test their veracity. The recent Gillespie book fails on this count. Instead it provides yet another potpourri of historical anecdotes related to third parties that are always entertaining but unproductive from an academic perspective.</p>
