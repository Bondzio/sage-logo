<p>The main question addressed in David Art’s book <italic>Inside the Radical Right</italic> is the following: What explains cross-national differences in the radical right’s electoral persistence over recent decades? To answer this question, the author dismisses structural or institutional explanations, since factors such as globalization or immigration have similarly affected all West European countries and cannot account for much variation. Instead, he draws mainly on historical factors, the political and social environment and the number and type of activists.</p>
<p>The first important factor for radical right party development is the existence of historical legacies. It is argued that nationalist subcultures with their voluntary organizations and informal networks are beneficial for radical right parties. These pre-existing networks can provide the necessary resources for recruiting (moderate) candidates and building a party organization. Parties such as the French Front National (FN), the Vlaams Belang (VB) in Belgium or the Freedom Party (FPÖ) in Austria have profited from such a nationalist subculture. The second important factor is the reaction to the radical right from mainstream parties and civil society. Even in countries with a strong nationalist subculture such as Germany, the political and social environment might be too hostile for a radical right party to persist. A repressive climate implies a <italic>cordon sanitaire</italic> (i.e. political agreement not to cooperate with the radical right) that is established <italic>before</italic> the breakthrough of the radical right party and a hostile social climate in which radical right activists might lose their job or be physically threatened by anti-fascist movements. This was an environment that the German Republikäner (REP), the Dutch Centrumdemocraten (CD) and the Belgian Front National (FNb) were confronted with.</p>
<p>Art argues that a nationalist subculture and a permissive climate will lead to more and more moderate activists. In turn, this will benefit party coherence, competence and legitimacy and hence these types of parties will persist. The absence of a nationalist subculture and a repressive climate will lead to fewer (and more extremist) activists. If joining a radical right party will never result in power-sharing because of a <italic>cordon sanitaire</italic>, while implying the risk of losing one’s job, the odds are higher of attracting people who have little to lose. A lack of moderate and opportunistic members combined with a predominance of extremists such as neo-Nazis inside the party will lead to a lack of competence, coherence and legitimacy, which prevents the party persisting in the long run.</p>
<p>The developed model is subsequently tested for most West European countries including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands and Sweden. Radical right parties that received 5 percent of the vote in three successive national parliamentary elections are considered successful cases (e.g. FPÖ, VB, DF, AN), while the others are failure cases (e.g. REP, BNP, LPF, CD). By means of interviews with 140 radical right activists, an original dataset of radical right candidates and secondary sources, Art succeeds in shedding light on the roots and dynamics inside the radical right. Given the large number of cases that had to be covered by the author, the research design and presented evidence is without doubt impressive. This study also shows that, despite popular misconceptions, it is usually not a problem to interview radical right activists. The different case studies show nicely how the dynamics that Art outlined in his theoretical chapter played a role in our understanding cross-national differences in radical right success. The striking difference in Belgium between the successful Flemish VB, which profited from a nationalist subculture and a more permissive political and social climate, on the one hand, and the ephemeral Francophone FNb, with its lack of pre-existing networks and a very hostile political and social climate (making it difficult for FNb members even to meet), on the other, is compelling.</p>
<p>Art is not blind to the limitations of his approach and mentions three possible objections towards his own claims. The first is that the causality might be reversed: party organization is a result, rather than a cause, of electoral performance. The second is that some variables, in particular that of leadership, might have been omitted. The lack of charisma and internal leadership capacities of people such as Janmaat or Féret might be crucial to our understanding the demise of the CD or FNb. Third, one might argue that the causal chain does not go back far enough. Why is there a nationalist subculture in some countries and not in others? Since these objections are all treated and to some extent convincingly countered in the book, I would like to provide another three critiques and suggestions.</p>
<p>First, Art’s case selection might be contested. What appeared strange to me is why the Danish Progress Party (FrPd) was not included in the analysis, while the Norwegian Progress Party (FrP) was. To be sure, the FrPd is mentioned to explain the persistence of the Danish People’s Party (DF). It is argued that, despite the lack of a nationalist subculture, the DF has been able to persist because it could build on the experience and personnel of the FrPd. However, this leaves us with the question why the FrPd was (persistently) successful without any such foundation in the first place? Secondly, it is questionable whether parties such as the CD and the Lijst Pim Fortuyn (LPF) belong to the same party family. In fact, this is reflected in Art’s claims that the CD faced a <italic>cordon sanitaire</italic> and a repressive social climate while LPF did not have to deal with these. Why two radical right parties would be treated so differently within a single country (and hence similar legacy and environment) is not clear. I would argue that ideological and leadership variables should be included to explain this. Finally, while I applaud the focus on ‘supply-side’ variables it seems that the link with voting behaviour remains under-explored. Whether voters actually care about party coherence, legitimacy and flexibility is assumed rather than demonstrated. In fact, it seems that Art’s book provides some interesting hypotheses to be tested in further research.</p>
<p>In short, Art has developed an innovative ‘agency based’ theoretical framework and did a tremendous job in gathering in-depth information on the radical right in an impressive number of countries. It is a welcome contribution to a literature that is perhaps too much dominated by quantitative studies that yield diminishing returns in terms of knowledge. This book is moreover worth reading not only by people interested in the radical right but also by scholars whose focus is on electoral behaviour and party politics in general. At the same time, Art’s theory is clearly provocative and might need further adaptation and testing. It seems that in more recent work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354068812472768">De Lange and Art (2011</xref>) put more emphasis on ‘learning effects’ which might be a way forward. In addition, this book invites scholars to explore more how supply-side factors – such as party unity, competence and legitimacy – are perceived by voters and impact on voting behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354068812472768">Bos and Van der Brug, 2010</xref>).</p>
