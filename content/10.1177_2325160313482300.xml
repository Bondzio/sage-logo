<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>Your coaching program sounds like a very exciting and innovative strategy for improving diabetes care. Would you please tell us more about it?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>Allina Health is a not-for-profit network comprised of hospitals, clinics, and other health care services, providing care throughout Minnesota and western Wisconsin. In 2006, Allina Health’s 44 primary care clinics implemented numerous diabetes care improvement initiatives. By late 2007, with significant improvement in our system optimal diabetes control, it was noted that approximately 25% of the primary care providers (PCPs) were at risk of not achieving the system goal. Random chart audits revealed common trends that were lacking: treatment aggressiveness, appropriate timing of changes in treatment, use of quality reports, and involvement of other members of the care team to achieve goals.</p>
<p>To facilitate improvements in the diabetes care delivered by these PCPs, we piloted a PCP/Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) collaborative, targeting providers with at least 30 patients with diabetes and most likely to not meet the goal for optimal diabetes control.</p>
<p>Our objective was to improve optimal diabetes control through supported provider activation and to ultimately improve on the Minnesota Optimal Diabetes Measures (D5 measure) defined as a composite of five measures:
<list id="list1-2325160313482300" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A1C &lt; 8%</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>LDL &lt; 100</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>BP &lt; 140/90</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ASA use unless contraindicated</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Documented tobacco-free status.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Our expected outcomes were that those identified PCPs and their clinical assistants would identify positive changes in their work processes and the way they utilize their quality reports to identify patients in need of intervention. We also expected the PCPs would recognize the benefits of more timely and aggressive therapeutic changes. And ultimately, Allina Medical Clinic would achieve its goal for optimal diabetes control.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>How did you get the support to make this work?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>We were very fortunate in that diabetes education was already established and recognized for its contribution to diabetes care improvement as well as to DSME.</p>
<p>For example, an RN/CDE medication and insulin protocol was approved and in place to allow the RN/CDE to make adjustments.</p>
<p>We also had the support of our Chief Medical Officer and other physician leadership. I don’t think it is sufficient to have a “diabetes physician champion,” who may or may not be a recognized leader by his peers. Clinic or system leadership support is essential. The RN/CDE does not schedule time with the identified provider until a physician leader has discussed the program with him or her first.</p>
<p>Another contributor to our success was the transparency of data that were already in place. Prior quality improvement work led to internally published quality reports at the individual provider level. Many of the underperforming providers already had a level of discomfort about their reports, which made them more receptive to help.</p>
<p>A CME program on medication and insulin management was made mandatory for underperforming providers and was taught by an endocrinologist and an RN/CDE, which helped demonstrate the considerable expertise of the RN/CDE.</p>
<p>We also instituted point-of-care A1C testing, which enabled the provider to have a face-to-face discussion with patients who were not well controlled. We coupled this with our Insulin Quick Start program, which allowed for same-day initiation of insulin therapy.</p>

<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>How are the RN/CDEs selected and prepared to serve as a coach to PCPs?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>Two RN/CDEs serve in this role for us and have coached over 200 PCPs. One of them had extensive knowledge and experience in diabetes care and the other RN/CDE had nurse management experience in addition to her diabetes knowledge. They made a great team!</p>
<p>Duffee: This role is not for the novice CDE. When you take on a coaching role—and the PCPs certainly are not accustomed to being coached by nurses—some of them tend to challenge your knowledge and expertise.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>What about the outcomes of the program?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p>The outcomes of our program will be featured in the March/April 2013 issue of <italic>The Diabetes Educator</italic>. We were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in optimal diabetes control for the “at-risk” providers.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Q</speaker>
<p>Is the program ongoing?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>A</speaker>
<p><bold>Emerson:</bold> Yes. Our health system has added 10 more primary care clinics and continues to grow. We are beginning a new phase where we are training all of our CDEs in this work with the expectation that they will be able to provide ongoing help to their clinics.</p>
<p><bold>Duffee:</bold> When we work with a PCP, we work with their nursing assistant also. We have learned that their teamwork is essential to successfully achieving results.</p>
<p><bold>Frederick:</bold> This is exciting work for the RN/CDE. They are able to play a key role on the diabetes care team. As health care continues to move towards pay-for-performance, we can expect expansion of our roles.</p>
