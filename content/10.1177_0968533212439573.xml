<p>This paper undertakes a contextual analysis of the main aims of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, commonly known as the Patients’ Rights Directive (the PRD). The PRD itself does not aim to provide a new system for coordinating social security entitlements, leaving the regime laid down in (EEC) 1408/71 and later (EC) 883/2004 unaffected. Rather, it is intended that the PRD will supplement the rights that these instruments were intended to provide. The main aims of the PRD instead concern matters related to the prior authorisation of healthcare, the reimbursement of healthcare and the removal of unjustified obstacles from doing so. This paper explores how the Directive sets out to achieve these aims and analyses it within the context of other related European Union legislation and jurisprudence in the area. Alongside this primary aim of codifying European Court of Justice case law, the PRD also introduces novel initiatives aimed at fostering cross-border cooperation between various elements of national healthcare systems. These issues will be dealt with in detail in a subsequent paper.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper aims to undertake a contextual analysis of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, commonly known as the Patient’s Rights Directive (the PRD). It is the latest European Union (EU) initiative with regards to European healthcare and the single market. The PRD itself does not aim to provide a new system for coordinating social security entitlements, leaving the regime laid down in (EEC) 1408/71 and later (EC) 883/2004 unaffected. Rather, it is intended that the PRD will supplement the rights that these instruments were intended to provide. The main aims of the PRD instead concern matters related to the prior authorisation of healthcare, the reimbursement of healthcare and the removal of unjustified obstacles from doing so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0968533212439573">1</xref>
</sup> These efforts largely reflect the recent case law of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The content of the PRD can be divided into two principal areas. The first contains provisions intended to provide increased patient mobility related to the areas just described. The provisions in this area largely represent a codification and clarification of the jurisprudence of the ECJ.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0968533212439573">2</xref>
</sup> Alongside this, the second part<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0968533212439573">3</xref>
</sup> of the PRD also introduces several novel initiatives aimed at fostering cross-border cooperation between various elements of national healthcare systems. This paper will focus on the first area, with the intention of analysing the provisions involved in detail. The second area will be briefly outlined in this paper and will form the focus of a second paper to be published shortly.</p>
<p>It is not expected that as a result of the PRD cross-border patient flows will explode,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0968533212439573">4</xref>
</sup> as the vast majority of individuals will still prefer to seek healthcare in their Member State of Residence. Indeed, the PRD contains several elements that appear to have been included to allow Member States to prevent large numbers of their residents from being able to seek treatment in other Member States at their expense. However, in certain circumstances, it is envisaged that the PRD would be of assistance to individuals in obtaining cross-border healthcare. Examples of individuals that would hopefully benefit from the PRD include individuals who live in border areas or individuals who live in a different Member State than their families and who may desire to stay with them during or after their treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0968533212439573">5</xref>
</sup> The PRD attempts to facilitate greater opportunity for such individuals, whilst acknowledging the limited competence of the Union to act under the treaties. This paper will attempt to identify where the Commission, the Parliament and the Council were successful in the achievement of their aims or if, on the contrary, the initiatives it has taken will result in little change to the status quo. Overall, it seems that whilst the PRD represents an important step in terms of codification, its impact is weakened by certain measures that were included in order to secure the required agreement of a sufficient number of Member States. An analysis of such measures will be included in this paper together with a brief discussion of their effects. The aim of this paper is therefore to provide a well-rounded, contextual understanding of the PRD, together with an analysis of its likely impact on healthcare provision.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0968533212439573">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In attempting to provide a rounded and contextual analysis of the directive, ‘The institutional context of the directive’ will outline its legal context. This will involve a general description of EU competence with regard to healthcare matters outlined in the treaties forming the EU. Following this there will be a brief exploration of previous legislative initiatives that affect cross-border healthcare for Europeans together with the recent case law of the ECJ, each of which is important in understanding the need for, and the intentions behind, the PRD. ‘Analysis of the basic constituent elements of the Patients’ Rights Directive’ will briefly explore the main elements of the PRD whilst attempting to outline which initiatives represent codifications of ECJ case law and which represent novel initiatives. ‘The PRD and its application’ will describe the interaction of the directive with other instruments and areas where its functioning is excluded. ‘Substantive aspects of the PRD’ will attempt to describe the substantive aspects of the PRD in greater detail. The directive will be presented in terms of its obligations on both the Member State of Affiliation and the Member State of Treatment that arise out of the PRD together with a discussion, where appropriate, of the effects of the provisions concerned. The Informational and Procedural Requirements Placed upon the Member States will be analysed in ‘Informational and procedural requirements placed on the Member States’. The final part will present a conclusion based upon the paper’s contents.</p>

<title>The limited explicit competence of the European Union on matters of health</title>
<p>Healthcare is a sensitive political issue for every one of the 27 Member States of the EU. Elections are frequently won and lost on such issues. As a result of this, governments of Member States have been extremely reluctant to cede powers to the EU in this area.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0968533212439573">7</xref>
</sup> Doing so would leave them with a reduced level of control over activities that might have a significant effect on their political existence. This lack of desire to give the EU direct powers over healthcare can be seen in the treaties of the EU, the latest changes being brought about by the Lisbon treaty being no different. Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states that the Union’s role is limited to ‘complementing national polices’. In doing this, the Union is able to ‘encourage’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0968533212439573">8</xref>
</sup> cooperation between Member States on certain areas of public health.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0968533212439573">9</xref>
</sup> In order to encourage such cooperation, the European Parliament and the Council are able, acting in accordance with the normal legislative procedure, to release guidelines <italic>recommending</italic> measures that Member States should take in order to achieve such cooperation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0968533212439573">10</xref>
</sup>. Though the Union has no power to enact measures on healthcare directly, it is required to ensure the protection of human health in all of its other policies and activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0968533212439573">11</xref>
</sup> The Union must at all times respect the responsibilities of Member States to define their own health policy and to organise the delivery of health services and medical care. Such responsibilities include the management of health services and the amount of resources to be allocated to them.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0968533212439573">12</xref>
</sup> One can clearly see that the demarcation of the EU’s responsibilities in the treaties is done so in a manner that would provide a minimal level of competence for the Union in terms of healthcare. Under such a distribution of competence a Member State is free to define the structure of its healthcare system, what services exist, what charges are levied on individuals and the level of reimbursement that patients receive for such charges.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0968533212439573">13</xref>
</sup> The effective result of this limitation of competence at Union level is that there are in reality 27 different health systems across the Union, each unique in its own way regarding the services it provides and the way it pays for or reimburses citizens who avail themselves of such services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0968533212439573">
<title>Provisions related to the Single Market</title>
<p>Despite the limited explicit Union competence on healthcare in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the EU and its predecessors, the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Community (EC), have been able to intervene in health matters where it appears to be required in order to support and maintain the European Single Market (ESM). Indeed, the Union has intervened in matters of European healthcare in a manner that seems to show that it sees itself as primarily responsible for regulating market-based issues of healthcare, whilst more lofty human rights-based issues are left to other international organisations<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0968533212439573">14</xref>
</sup> such as the Council of Europe.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0968533212439573">15</xref>
</sup> The EU promotes and protects the ESM by extolling four key freedoms that are contained within the treaties. Two of these, the Free Movement of Persons<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0968533212439573">16</xref>
</sup> and the Freedom to Provide Services,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0968533212439573">17</xref>
</sup> have allowed the European institutions to act in ways that affect the provision of healthcare, despite healthcare not being itself a competence of the EU as defined in the treaties. The justification for this has been recognised on numerous occasions by the ECJ, namely that whilst it is up to Member States to decide their own healthcare policy framework, they must do so within the bounds of Union law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0968533212439573">18</xref>
</sup> The following section will describe how the EU institutions, including the ECJ on one hand and the Commission, Parliament and Council of Ministers on the other, have made use of these freedoms in order to make laws that impact upon the provision of healthcare in Member States. An understanding of this pre-existing ‘European constitutional context’ is important if one is to grasp what in reality is novel about the PRD and what is not.<sup>

<sec id="section5-0968533212439573">
<title>The Right to Free Movement of Persons</title>
<p>The Right to Free Movement of Persons (freedom of movement) within the treaties provided the original impetus for the Community/Union rules on the provision of healthcare to citizens who seek healthcare outside their Member State of Residence. Whilst the provision of social security (including healthcare) is a matter of competence for the Member States, the Union has a role in ensuring that individuals who move between Member States are adequately protected and do not ‘fall between the cracks’ by not being protected by any framework as a result of their movement from one jurisdiction to another. This has been termed the ‘Coordination of Social Security Rights’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0968533212439573">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The ‘Coordination of Social Security Rights’ includes the coordination of a range of rights called ‘benefits in kind’ that are normally available to individuals resident in a Member State who have qualified under domestic social security legislation to enjoy such rights. The provision of healthcare is one of such benefits in kind. It has been recognised that the non-availability of healthcare can act as an impediment to the freedom of movement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0968533212439573">21</xref>
</sup> Individuals would be less likely to travel to another Member State if it were not possible for them to access medical care should they fall ill. Whilst a literal right to freedom of movement alone (as in no frontier restrictions on movement) would in theory allow individuals to access healthcare in other Member States, individuals would be limited in reality by their ability to pay. Healthcare interventions are extremely expensive and are frequently outside the price range of most individuals. Most Member States have therefore created various social security mechanisms that will subsidise or completely pay for such interventions. The problem in terms of the free movement of individuals is that such schemes are usually linked to the residency of the Member State in question. An individual who finds himself in need of medical assistance whilst on a temporary stay in another Member State (the Member State of Treatment) may not be covered by the social security protection (or the benefits in kind) offered by that Member State. This would mean that the individual would be forced to bear the full and unsubsidised cost of the medical treatment alone. The risk of such a situation arising would act as a disincentive to individuals to travel to other member states as they could be liable for very large medical costs should they fall ill there. This disincentive would therefore provide an obstacle to the freedom of movement for individuals and therefore would, if left unchecked, be contrary to the provisions in the Union’s primary law, the treaties which guarantee freedom of movement.</p>
<p>As a consequence, in 1971 the Commission released Regulation 1408/71/EEC ‘On the Application of Social Security Schemes to Employed Persons, to Self-Employed Persons and to Members of Their Families Moving Within the Community’. This regulation allowed, inter alia, individuals to obtain the same treatment as that available to residents of the Member State of Treatment in which they find themselves, at the expense of the Member State of which they are resident if the need for such treatment arises during a temporary stay in that Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0968533212439573">22</xref>
</sup> This originally applied to workers and self-employed individuals but has subsequently been expanded to apply to all nationals of one Member State who are on a temporary stay in another Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0968533212439573">23</xref>
</sup> Additionally, protection was also extended to all legal residents of a Member State (assuming they are covered by that Member State’s social security arrangements) in addition to Union citizens.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0968533212439573">24</xref>
</sup> The result of this is that individuals, if they are covered by the social security system in their Member State of Residence, are entitled to treatment under the same conditions as residents of the Member State in which they find themselves. This will occur at the expense of the social security system of the Member State of Residence. Thus, individuals legally resident in one Member State should be able to have the peace of mind that if they fall ill during a temporary stay in another Member State they will be entitled to treatment on the same conditions (including price) as residents of that Member State. The result is (at least in theory) that reimbursement fears regarding healthcare should no longer provide an obstacle in terms of freedom of movement for those considering a temporary stay in another Member State.<sup>

<title>The Freedom to Provide Services</title>
<p>Regulation 1408/71/EEC and its subsequent amendments provide important protection for European residents seeking emergency healthcare, the need for which arises in another Member State. This protection is based on the notion of freedom of movement. However, these limited interventions fall a long way short of creating anything like an ESM in healthcare. This is apparent if one looks at the limitations of (EEC) 1408/71 and its successor (EC) 883/2004.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0968533212439573">26</xref>
</sup> Perhaps most important is that it applies only to healthcare that becomes necessary during a stay in another Member State. It does not provide a broad right to travel to another Member State to obtain treatment at the expense of the Member State of Affiliation. The regime started by (EEC) 1408/71 effectively provides only a form of emergency medical cover, valid during temporary stays in other Member States. It does not allow the right for individuals to opt to travel (and receive reimbursement) to another Member State for treatment for a pre-existing condition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0968533212439573">27</xref>
</sup> A totally free market in healthcare would allow patients to access healthcare in any Member State of the European Union. The freedom to provide services, as provided in the treaties<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0968533212439573">28</xref>
</sup>, would seem to support such a notion, notably that healthcare providers should be able to offer medical services to individuals resident in Member States other than the one in which they are based. The definition of what constitutes a ‘service’ is very wide and includes medical services (see point (1) below). Whilst it might seem that if freedom of movement exists, one would be able to go to another state to obtain healthcare (a medical service), the reality of the situation is again somewhat more complex for the same cost-based reasons that apply to issues of freedom of movement discussed above (i.e. lack of social security coverage). Importantly, the ECJ, several decades ago, highlighted in <italic>Luisi and Carbone</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0968533212439573">29</xref>
</sup> that the freedom to provide services does not just entail a freedom to provide services in another Member State, but also includes the rights for recipients of services to go to another Member State in order to receive services there. This important judgment allowed the ECJ decades later to develop case law that protected the rights of patients to seek medical services in Member States other than which they are resident.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0968533212439573">30</xref>
</sup> The ECJ has answered several important questions with regards to this issue, the result of which is that restrictions on reimbursement for healthcare in another Member State can, under certain conditions, constitute an illegal barrier to the free movement of services. The ECJ has made the following points:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Medical care can be categorised as a service. Despite their special nature, the ECJ confirmed in Smits and Peerbooms<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0968533212439573">31</xref>
</sup> that medical services can be classed as services for the purposes of the treaty. Certain Member States had contended that medical services could not constitute services as understood under the treaty given their special nature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0968533212439573">32</xref>
</sup> The court stated that ‘It is settled case-law that medical activities fall within the scope of Article 60<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0968533212439573">33</xref>
</sup> of the Treaty, there being no need to distinguish in that regard between the care provided in a hospital environment and care provided outside such an environment’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0968533212439573">34</xref>
</sup> In Watts<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0968533212439573">35</xref>
</sup> the court confirmed that despite the fact that medical services are often provided on a not-for-profit basis, that they may be reimbursed or that the patient may not pay himself does not detract from the fact that the patient is being provided with a service.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0968533212439573">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In Kohl<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0968533212439573">37</xref>
</sup> it was recognised that the requirement of prior authorisation is a barrier to the freedom to provide medical services. (EEC) 1408/71 and (EC) 883/2004 allowed individuals to obtain treatment in another Member State at the cost of their own security system, but only with the prior authorisation of the Member State in which they were resident. Such a barrier is not acceptable in the case of non-hospital-based treatment which does not call into question the same issues with regards to management of resources. Non-hospital costs are not likely to affect the balance of social security systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0968533212439573">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The requirement of prior authorisation may, however, be acceptable with regards to hospital services. This is because, according to the court, unlike non-hospital-based services, hospital-based services will require careful planning. The need for such planning may mean that prior authorisation may be justified by overriding reasons of general interest. This is so as to ensure that ‘there is sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high-quality hospital treatment…to assist in meeting a desire to control costs and to prevent, as far as possible, any wastage of financial, technical and human resources’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0968533212439573">39</xref>
</sup> The ECJ considered that it was important to eliminate such wastage given the considerable costs and financial resources involved in healthcare, meaning that such resources are finite. The ECJ acknowledged, however, that the distinction between hospital and non-hospital care could be difficult to make in reality.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0968533212439573">40</xref>
</sup> This can occur when one considers, for example, the case of outpatients who, though not ‘staying in a hospital’, may be undergoing complicated and expensive procedures.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Whilst authorisation is acceptable under appropriate circumstances it must be done in an objective and transparent manner. In Smits and Peerbooms the court stated that in order for prior authorisation to be justified it must be based on ‘objective, non discriminatory criteria which are known in advance, in such a way so as to circumscribe the exercise of the national authorities’ discretion so that it is not used arbitrarily…Such a prior administrative authorisation scheme must likewise be…dealt with objectively and impartially within a reasonable time and refusals to grant authorisation must also be capable of being challenged in a judicial or quasi-judicial environment’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0968533212439573">41</xref>
</sup> The court stated that in this case, where the healthcare insurance provider had contracted with a national medical service provider to provide procedures, authorisation could be refused if the procedures were available in a justifiable timeframe in the Member State of Residence.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In Vanbraekel<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0968533212439573">42</xref>
</sup> the court confirmed that reimbursement for treatment carried out in another Member State must be at the same level as that which would occur if the treatment had been carried out in the Member State of Residence. This is the case even if the Member State of Treatment has a less generous level of reimbursement under its own system. The Member State of Residence does not, however, have to reimburse more than the cost of the treatment.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This is the context in which the drafters of the PRD set to work. This was a context where both the Commission and the ECJ had already made considerable efforts regarding the accessibility of healthcare to individuals in one Member State when they are resident in another. This has been done with a ‘twin track’ approach. On the one hand, the Commission, acting under the guise of the <italic>freedom of movement</italic> enacted regulations (EEC) 1408/71 and later (EC) 883/2004. The aim of such instruments was to provide individuals with the confidence that they could obtain health assistance if required during a stay in another Member State at non-prohibitive prices, and thus removing an obstacle to their freedom of movement. On the other hand, the ECJ has forged another path using the <italic>freedom to provide services</italic> as a justification. In cases such as <italic>Smits and Peerbooms</italic> and <italic>Kohl</italic> the ECJ confirmed that freedom of movement provided, in general, a right to seek healthcare in another Member State, but that the right could be subject to prior authorisation in certain cases, including hospital care. It is under the guise of this second track that the Commission saw the need for the creation of the PRD.</p>

<title>Analysis of the basic constituent elements of the Patients’ Rights Directive</title>
<sec id="section8-0968533212439573">
<title>General principles</title>
<p>This section will briefly describe the PRD in terms of its various elements so as to aid conceptualisation of its various components. The contents of each of these elements will be dealt with in greater detail on subsequent pages. The main inspiration behind the PRD is to codify and clarify the innovations made by the ECJ with respect to the freedom to provide services as guaranteed under the treaty. It is intended to work in parallel with (EEC) 1408/71 and (EC) 883/2004, complementing these instruments but not affecting their implementation. It is these codifying and clarifying areas of the directive that are in reality concerned with individual ‘patient rights’. Additionally, whilst legislating on such matters the Commission has seized upon the opportunity to include novel elements, which, although they can be linked to cross-border healthcare, are neither part of previous ECJ jurisprudence nor strictly concerned with individual ‘patient rights’. The detail of each will be dealt with in subsequent pages. The PRD therefore represents a patchwork whereby several miscellaneous initiatives are bolted onto the core initiative concerned with the rights of individuals seeking cross-border healthcare. Another (somewhat simplified) distinction that can be made from the outset is that in matters of codification and clarification the measures in the PRD generally take the place of traditional ‘hard law legislation’ whereas many of the novel initiatives in the PRD (not concerned with individual patient rights) generally take the form of ‘soft law legislation’<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0968533212439573">43</xref>
</sup> (with some exceptions), inviting Member States and private organisations to act, but not compelling them to do so. These three (codification, clarification and also novel issues) elements are present in the PRD and can be summarised in the following manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0968533212439573">
<title>Codification</title>
<p>The most important and salient features of this directive are its acts of codification of ECJ case law described above. A primary aim of the PRD is to achieve ‘a more general and also effective application of the principles developed by the court of Justice on a case-by-case basis’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0968533212439573">44</xref>
</sup> Though judgments of the ECJ are binding upon national courts, placing some of their elements into a directive can have important benefits. Perhaps the most important is the sense of legal certainty that comes with the obligatory transcription into national law. The presence of rights and freedoms written into national law may be far more visible to certain individuals and organisations than the ECJ judgements themselves. Certain Member States had complained that the various healthcare institutions, including health insurance organisations, had trouble pinpointing exactly what the law was in terms of cross-border treatment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0968533212439573">45</xref>
</sup> In addition, framing requirements in the form of a directive will set out clear boundaries, within which Member States can act according to their needs and their policy inclinations. The following principles in the PRD are based primarily on ECJ judgements.</p>
<sec id="section10-0968533212439573">
<title>Prior authorisation is, in principle, a barrier to the freedom to provide medical services</title>
<p>The PRD clarifies that making the assumption of medical costs in another Member State by statutory social security systems subject to prior authorisation is, in principle, a barrier to the free movement of services. In addition, the PRD confirms that patients are entitled to receive at least the same benefits in another Member State as those provided for by the legislation of the Member State of Affiliation (at the expense of the Member State of Affiliation).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0968533212439573">46</xref>
</sup> The PRD codifies the jurisprudence that generally patients are entitled to receive at least the same benefits in another Member State as those provided for by the legislation of the Member State of Affiliation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0968533212439573">47</xref>
</sup> If such legislation does not specify the list of treatments available, treatment in another Member State should not be denied if it corresponds to benefits provided under the home Member States legislation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0968533212439573">
<title>Prior authorisation may be permitted under the PRD in cases of care requiring hospital treatment</title>
<p>This is in line with the ECJ’s finding that such authorisation schemes can be permitted as an overriding reason in favour of the general interest under certain circumstances. As stated in <italic>Smits and Pearbooms</italic>, such prior authorisation may be required as the number of hospitals, their geographic distribution, the way in which they are organised and the facilities they are able to offer are all matters for which high-level planning will be required.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0968533212439573">48</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the PRD confirms that, in principle, a patient who receives medical treatment in another Member State (and where the patient has received such authorisation if required) should be reimbursed by the Member State of Affiliation to the amount the equivalent procedure would have cost the social security system in that state.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0968533212439573">
<title>Required medical procedures not available in a justifiable timeframe</title>
<p>As with (EC) 883/2004,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0968533212439573">49</xref>
</sup> prior authorisation cannot be refused if the individual would be entitled to such care in the Member State of Affiliation and the healthcare in question cannot be provided on its territory within a time limit that is medically justifiable.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0968533212439573">
<title>Clarification of existing principles of ECJ case law</title>
<p>Whilst the case law delineated by the ECJ was significant, there were some significant ambiguities remaining that were in need of clarification. Important questions remained, examples being the exact level of reimbursement that should be paid and which country’s legislation and healthcare standards should apply when a patient goes to another Member State for treatment? Furthermore, the grounds for refusal for an individual’s treatment in another Member State were not clearly delineated in the case law, nor were the grounds on which a Member State could refuse access to individuals from other Member States to its healthcare system.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0968533212439573">50</xref>
</sup> The PRD intended to clear up these and other ambiguities. Such other ambiguities are as follows.</p>
<sec id="section14-0968533212439573">
<title>The clear delineation between hospital and non-hospital care for the purpose of allowing a prior authorisation procedure</title>
<p>This seemingly black-and-white delineation between hospital and non-hospital treatment, as the Commission had so interpreted from the ECJ’s case law, was not universally accepted. The UK, for instance, argued that the ECJ’s ruling had been more nuanced, stating only that it had ‘not yet’ seen any justification for an authorisation procedure for non-hospital care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0968533212439573">51</xref>
</sup> It was concerned that a number of expensive procedures carried out in the primary care environment could be misclassified under such a simplistic delineation. The UK therefore called for a more nuanced delineation to be developed. It claimed that such clarifications would be in the interest of both citizens and managing services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0968533212439573">
<title>The imposition of pre-treatment procedures is permitted</title>
<p>The PRD confirms that the Member State of Affiliation is permitted to impose certain pre-treatment procedures on individuals seeking reimbursement of treatment in another Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0968533212439573">52</xref>
</sup> This could include prior assessment by a health professional, for example, if that were the normal procedure before such a treatment in the Member State of Affiliation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0968533212439573">
<title>Important requirements concerning the prior authorisation procedure and its transparency and objectivity are outlined in the PRD</title>
<p>The aim of such requirements is to provide the individual concerned with the possibility of knowing whether he has a realistic chance of approval for such a request. Additionally, the PRD places similar requirements on reimbursement decisions of Member States when deciding how much they should reimburse a patient for a procedure that is to be, or has been, carried out in another Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0968533212439573">53</xref>
</sup> Member States are also not allowed to discriminate positively or negatively against patients from other Member States in terms of price. This decision seems to have been provoked by the fear of some Member States that healthcare providers might set lower prices for non-resident patients, creating problems of access for local patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0968533212439573">54</xref>

</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0968533212439573">
<title>Exceptions for the cost of treatment of expatriate pensioners</title>
<p>The PRD also outlines important exceptions regarding which Member State is liable for the cost of the treatment of pensioners. The issue of pensioners was a sticking point throughout the negotiations of the PRD and such exceptions were important to secure the support of certain Member States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0968533212439573">55</xref>
</sup> The exceptions require that the Member State of Origin<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0968533212439573">56</xref>
</sup> pays for healthcare that does not require prior authorisation if one of its pensioners returns there, even if that pensioner is resident in another Member State.<sup>

<sec id="section18-0968533212439573">
<title>Novel initiatives</title>
<p>The Commission used the occasion of the PRD to introduce a number of novel initiatives. Some of these are connected to the main focus of the PRD, that of patients seeking cross-border treatment, whilst others can be considered as somewhat miscellaneous initiatives that have been included in the directive. The first of these categories will be explored in this article whilst the second will form the subject of a subsequent paper and will be described only briefly here.</p>
<p>The PRD calls for the creation of National Contact Points,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0968533212439573">58</xref>
</sup> the availability of access to electronic records,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0968533212439573">59</xref>
</sup> the establishment of European Reference Networks,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0968533212439573">60</xref>
</sup> the mutual recognition of prescriptions<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0968533212439573">61</xref>
</sup> and the introduction of the Health Technology Assessment Network. National Contact Points should be capable of disseminating certain healthcare information on medical services in their territory. Member States are permitted under the PRD to decide the number and form of their own contact points. European Reference Networks will aid networking between healthcare providers and centres for expertise, in particular those for rare diseases. Electronic access to patient records should be provided so as to ensure that patients receive adequate treatment when they decide to obtain such care in a different Member State. The ability to access such records can therefore be seen as an important practical requirement for health professionals if cross-border treatment is to be encouraged. The mutual recognition of prescriptions will allow an individual to collect prescriptions in a different Member State to the one in which they were issued.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0968533212439573">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The requirement that Member States ensure that sufficient information is available for individuals in other Member States to make an informed decision on whether to seek treatment in that Member State also constitutes a novel initiative of the PRD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0968533212439573">63</xref>
</sup> This is despite the fact that it is connected to the central initiative of the PRD, that of boosting patient rights to reimbursement for healthcare received in another Member State. Unlike some of the other novel initiatives in the PRD, this requirement is obligatory, despite not being part of the ECJ’s jurisprudence. This is somewhat logical, however, given its importance to the PRD’s core raison d’être. Here, and in other areas such as access to electronic patient records, the Commission is attempting to put in place the conditions that are necessary for the legal possibilities outlined by the ECJ to be also practicable in reality for individuals. Without such action, legal rights might be frustrated by practical issues which the ECJ did not envisage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission aims to promote cooperation by Member States in the development of diagnosis and treatment capacity for rare diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0968533212439573">64</xref>
</sup> The PRD also establishes an e-health network.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0968533212439573">65</xref>
</sup> Here the Union aims to support and facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information among Member States working within a voluntary network connecting the various national authorities responsible for e-health. The Commission shall adopt the necessary measures for the establishment, management and transparent functioning of a network for these purposes known as the e-health network.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0968533212439573">66</xref>
</sup> It is intended that it will work towards bringing about sustainable economic and social benefits to European e-health systems, with a view to achieving a high level of trust and security, enhancing continuity of care and ensuring access to safe and high-quality care. Additionally, the PRD allows the establishment of a voluntary network to promote cooperation on health technology assessment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0968533212439573">67</xref>
</sup> The Commission will support and facilitate cooperation and the exchange of scientific information among the Member States. The Commission will adopt the necessary measures for the establishment, management and transparent functioning of this network.<sup>

<title>The PRD and its application</title>
<sec id="section20-0968533212439573">
<title>Legal basis and effect on other legal instruments (Article 2 of the directive)</title>
<p>The preamble of the PRD confirms that its appropriate legal basis is Article 114 TFEU as the directive has the primary aim of improving the functioning of the internal market. The PRD is intended to provide rules for facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare. It also promotes cooperation on healthcare between Member States, whilst fully respecting national competences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0968533212439573">70</xref>
</sup> Indeed, the PRD states explicitly that it shall in no way affect the decisions of Member States on whether to reimburse medical treatment, if that treatment occurred on their own territory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0968533212439573">71</xref>
</sup> In addition, in a nod to the Union’s lack of competence under Article 168 TFEU, the preamble confirms that whilst the PRD might provide the possibility for patients to receive cross-border healthcare, Member States retain the responsibility for providing safe, high-quality, efficient and quantitatively adequate healthcare to citizens on their territory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0968533212439573">72</xref>
</sup> Whilst a draft version of the PRD spoke of Member States having a ‘responsibility’ for ensuring that mechanisms are in place to ensure such standards, this was removed in the final version, probably because it was seen as overstepping the line of non-interference laid out in Article 168 TFEU.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0968533212439573">73</xref>
</sup> The PRD itself is not intended to ‘coordinate social security’. Rather, the aim of the PRD with regard to prior authorisation and reimbursement is to allow freedom to provide healthcare to the residents of other Member States than the one in which the service provider is located and to remove unjustified obstacles to that aim.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0968533212439573">74</xref>
</sup> It is also claimed that the ‘common values and principles in European healthcare systems’ inspire and allow a system of cross-border cooperation, as envisaged in the PRD to be formed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0968533212439573">75</xref>
</sup> In order for such values to be safeguarded, protection must be accorded to patients seeking treatment in other Member States, so as to ensure that individuals are ‘treated equitably on the basis of their healthcare needs, rather than on the basis of their Member State of Affiliation’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0968533212439573">76</xref>
</sup> In acknowledgement of the ECJ’s reasoning in <italic>Müller-Fauré </italic>the PRD is intended to apply to all forms of healthcare no matter how such forms are organised, delivered and financed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0968533212439573">77</xref>
</sup> The PRD does not, however, apply to the allocation of, and access to, organs for the purpose of organ transplants. Whilst this may potentially foster inefficiencies in the distribution of organs, it has been argued that preventing non-residents from being placed on national organ waiting lists is crucial in maintaining the system of trust on which organ donation schemes depend, otherwise notions of solidarity and a system of fair distribution might be seen to be compromised.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0968533212439573">78</xref>
</sup> The same exemption applies also to vaccination programmes against infectious disease, which are exclusively aimed at protecting the population living on the territory of that Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0968533212439573">79</xref>

<title>The exclusion of assisted living care from the PRD (Article 1(3)(a) of the directive)</title>
<p>In an important exception the PRD is deemed not to apply to services in the field of long-term care, which are intended to support people in carrying out routine everyday tasks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0968533212439573">81</xref>
</sup> This exception appears to be primarily aimed at individuals who find themselves in long-term care homes or using services deemed necessary in order to enable the person in need of care to live as ‘full and self-determined a life as possible’. Long-term care facilities, homecare services, and residential or nursing homes seem therefore to fall outside the scope of the PRD. This means that individuals wishing to obtain such services on a cross-border basis appear to be excluded from the protection the PRD offers to other types of non-hospital-based treatment. Although not specifically stated, the logic here appears similar to that used in excluding organ transplants and vaccination from the scope of the PRD (i.e. that these services can be extremely resource intensive<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0968533212439573">82</xref>
</sup> or may require a large amount of planning on behalf of the Member State involved).</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to be sure, this exception seems intended to reflect the judgment in <italic>von Chamier-Glisczinski.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0968533212439573">83</xref>
</sup> That case concerned a German resident who had requested that the Member State funded the cost of her staying in a care home in Austria. The result of this exclusion is that individuals will not be entitled to reimbursement for forms of ‘assisted living care’ in another Member State. This could include, for example, individuals who, through chronic conditions, face a long-term disability and require assistance with day-to-day tasks. Likewise, elderly individuals who suffer from physical or cognitive difficulties and as a result require assistance in day-to-day living would seem to be excluded. Additionally, the option to be reimbursed for a stay in a nursing home in another Member State would seem to be excluded. At first glance, an instinctive reaction might be that such individuals are extremely unlikely to want to seek such services in a Member State other than the one in which they are living, owing to their frailty and also the likely proximity to their families in their own Member State. Whilst this might be true for the vast majority of patients, there will, however, be a small minority of individuals who could have feasibly been able to benefit from such services being provided on a cross-border basis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0968533212439573">84</xref>
</sup> This is despite the fact that the PRD itself is especially intended to benefit those who live in border regions (which may often represent linguistic frontiers) and individuals who have family in another Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0968533212439573">85</xref>
</sup> It seems also that individuals requiring long-term living assistance would also benefit from such possibilities, but, according to the PRD, shall not be able to do so. Of course, such individuals still have the right to travel to another Member State to receive such services, but will have no right in Union law to have such treatment reimbursed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0968533212439573">86</xref>
</sup> This state of affairs therefore produces a protection gap for this category of individuals, a category of individuals that is only likely to increase in the coming decades as a result of the demographic problems that many Member States face. It is probably wise to remember that the PRD is in reality a balancing act intended to encourage integration of health systems, but an act that contains a number of checks and balances aimed at allowing national health systems to retain their own character. It could be argued that the exclusion of ‘assisted living care’ represents an important example of such a check that permits Member States to retain control over a large part of their social security budgets. It is also important to remember that moving to another Member State in order to access assisted living care there would likely involve taking up residence in that Member State. This point which was made in <italic>von Chamier-Glisczinsk</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0968533212439573">87</xref>
</sup> means that the link with the original Member State of Affiliation would be broken, which in turn would mean that that state would no longer be responsible for bearing the cost of the individual’s healthcare. This seems to be a somewhat intractable problem unless one could consider that individuals who travel to another Member State to receive assisted living care would not take up residence in that state no matter how long they stay there. The authors of this piece opine, however, that such a position would only create further legal problems as the individual’s lack of residence would probably deny them access to numerous other benefits in the locality that are determined by virtue of residence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0968533212439573">88</xref>
</sup> In any event, the exclusion of assisted living from the PRD has given ammunition to those critics who claim that the PRD is biased against those suffering from chronic diseases.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0968533212439573">89</xref>
</sup> Critics would also argue that any attempts to draw a conceptual line between health and social care are problematic as the two may often be very much intertwined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0968533212439573">
<title>Assisted living and e-health</title>
<p>Additionally, it appears likely that this exclusion would hamper some e-health-based projects that could be of use in providing assisted living applications to individuals who have difficulties due to conditions related to disabilities or old age. One could envisage here, for example, e-health applications designed to provide mental stimulation to house-bound or even bed-bound individuals. Such modern technological solutions to the problem of loneliness and isolation have been shown to reap psychological and health benefits for individuals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0968533212439573">90</xref>
</sup> Passive e-health-based monitoring applications have also been shown to improve the health of those living in assisted care and reduce further treatment related costs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0968533212439573">91</xref>
</sup> Such services would, furthermore, not seem to be caught by the ‘catch 22’ described above whereby a person wishing to access such services that were supplied in another Member State would probably become a resident of that state and lose the connection with his original Member State of Affiliation. Unfortunately, however, despite the fact that such services could feasibly provide tangible benefits, they will not be classified as ‘medical services’ for the purpose of the PRD. This could have unfortunate implications for individuals living in border areas or who find themselves in a Member State where they do not speak the recognised languages. In such instances, e-health-based methods of communication might allow such services to be accessed in a language that is intelligible to the individual concerned. The Commission<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0968533212439573">92</xref>
</sup> itself has even acknowledged that e-health-based applications would be useful in supporting improvements in a patient’s ‘health and quality of life’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0968533212439573">93</xref>
</sup> Such individuals will, regrettably, not be able to claim a right to reimbursement vis-à-vis the PRD and will have to depend on the national or local social security organisation agreeing to such reimbursement if they should wish to access such services on a cross-border basis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0968533212439573">94</xref>
</sup> The authors of this article would argue that the PRD adopts too much of a ‘broad-brush’ approach in this respect. A more nuanced approach could have been made by distinguishing between more traditional assisted care services services that would require the physical displacement of the individual (and a likely change of residency) and those, such as e-health-based assisted care, which do not.</p>

<title>Substantive aspects of the PRD</title>
<sec id="section24-0968533212439573">
<title>A general entitlement to reimbursement for non-hospital-based healthcare (Article 7(1) of the directive)</title>
<p>The general rule introduced in the directive, following the ECJ’s case law, is that the Member State of Affiliation has a general obligation to ensure that individuals are reimbursed for the costs of healthcare that was provided in another Member State if a patient would be entitled to receive such healthcare in the Member State of Affiliation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0968533212439573">95</xref>
</sup> This right does not affect a patient’s rights under (EC) 883/2004, which entitles individuals to access to treatment for health problems that occur during a temporary stay in another Member State on a similar basis to residents of that Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0968533212439573">96</xref>
</sup> This theme, which is stressed throughout the PRD, is important because of the parallel nature of the two regimes, as explained on page 7. The Member State of Affiliation is required to pay the costs of treatment up to those that it would have assumed if the treatment had been carried out in its own territory.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0968533212439573">97</xref>
</sup> The idea is that such a right will become available to all EU citizens rather than the present situation where it is currently available to only limited groups, depending upon the policy of their Member State of Residence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0968533212439573">98</xref>
</sup> A Member State of Affiliation has the option, <italic>if it so desires,</italic> to assume further costs, including higher costs of treatment and also travel and accommodation expenses. There is, however, no obligation to do this. Member States are required to have a transparent system for devising the costs that are to apply in cases of cross-border healthcare.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0968533212439573">99</xref>
</sup> Such a system must be based upon objective, non-discriminatory criteria, which are known in advance and applied at the relevant level of administration. Member States may place some limitations on the application of rules of reimbursement for cross-border healthcare but only for the same possible reasons of overriding general interest that are used elsewhere in the PRD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0968533212439573">100</xref>
</sup> Such actions, though, must be limited to what is necessary and proportionate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-0968533212439573">101</xref>
</sup> Member States are obliged to ensure that, in cases where prior authorisation is required and given, reimbursement actually occurs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-0968533212439573">102</xref>
</sup> At this point it is worth noting a strange provision of the PRD that appears to be in conflict with this primary principle. This is namely Article 4 (1)(a), which states that healthcare should be provided in accordance with ‘the law of the Member State of Treatment’. It seems that, given the jurisprudence of the ECJ, this was a major oversight by the drafters of the directive as it directly contradicts the principle that reimbursement can only be sought for treatment that would be available in the Member state of Affiliation. It seems likely and also logical that Article 4 is rather referring to the local rules that govern the provision of medical services and possibly also to indicate the law that would be applicable in disputes arising sue to malpractice.” It seems inevitable that given the direct and irreconcilable conflict involved here that further jurisprudence from the ECJ will needed to clarify this issue.</p>

<title>Pre-treatment procedures (Article 7(7) of the directive)</title>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-0968533212439573">103</xref>
</sup> This would be permitted if such procedures would be required if the treatment in question were to occur in the Member State of Affiliation. Such procedures may include an assessment by a local health professional or healthcare administrator providing services for the social security system or national health system of the Member State of Affiliation, such as the general practitioner or primary care practitioner with whom the patient is registered.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-0968533212439573">104</xref>
</sup> The PRD does not, however, allow the imposition of measures that are discriminatory or which would constitute an obstacle to the free movement of patients, services or goods.

<title>Measures to discourage discriminatory treatment in the Member State of Affiliation</title>
<p>The PRD encourages but does not oblige Member States to adopt legislation ensuring that patients who have availed themselves of the opportunities under the PRD for cross-border treatment are entitled to the same rights as if they had opted for treatment in their Member State of Affiliation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-0968533212439573">109</xref>
</sup> The rationale behind this lack of a general prohibition on discrimination would seem to be a respect for the Member States to organise the provision of healthcare on their own territories as they see fit, as envisaged in the TFEU. It would seem, however, that this is a strange justification for making such protection against discrimination in general by the Member State of Affiliation optional. This is because if a Member State were to allow measures that discriminate at home against individuals who had previously opted for treatment in another Member State, it would surely constitute a barrier to the freedom to provide and obtain services as described under the TFEU. This would probably be illegal, and therefore the EU would probably be able to legislate to prevent such matters. It appears, therefore, that if the main substantive measures of the PRD can be justified by reference to the freedom to provide services found in the TEU then one would be also be able to justify measures on a national level to prevent discrimination at home, in one’s own Member State. The optional nature of this article is all the more bizarre given that there are other, non-optional, requirements that exist elsewhere in the PRD that prevent discrimination. These include, for example, an obligation to allow follow-up treatment to individuals who have accessed healthcare in another Member State if such follow-up care would be available to individuals who had undergone similar treatment on the territory of the Member State concerned.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-0968533212439573">110</xref>
</sup> The optional wording of the PRD with regards to the issue of general discrimination seen in the light of the existence of more compulsory requirements on specific forms of discrimination elsewhere seems to indicate that the PRD does not aim to bring about a blanket ban on all forms of discrimination against individuals after their treatment in the Member State of Affiliation.<sup>

<title>The Member State of Treatment and the obligation of non-discrimination</title>
<p>Unlike the general requirement of non-discrimination, which encourages the Member State of Affiliation to avoid discriminating against individuals who have opted for treatment in another Member State, the measures with regard to discrimination by the Member State of Treatment are not optional and must be observed by that Member State. These rules relate to both non-discrimination of access and non-discrimination with respect to fees. With regards to non-discrimination of access, Member States must ensure that discrimination on the grounds of nationality is forbidden. However, Member States can allow forms of discrimination where it is justified by an overriding reason in the general interest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-0968533212439573">112</xref>
</sup> With regards to non-discrimination with respect to fees, Member States must ensure that comparable fees are applied to residents of another Member State as to residents of the Member State of Treatment in comparable situations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-0968533212439573">113</xref>
</sup> Providers may still set their own fees if they are so permitted by national legislation, but cannot charge differently on the basis of individuals being resident in a different Member State. If there is no national price available, prices must be charged according to objective, non-discriminatory criteria. Such a requirement of non-discrimination of fees serves to protect residents of the Member State of Residence in addition to non-residents seeking treatment there. This is because, if such a requirement were not in place, there would be little to stop providers setting lower prices for residents of other Member States in order to attract non-resident patients. This might give rise to concerns of ‘crowding out’ for resident patients.<sup>

<title>Exceptions primarily related to pensioners (Article 7(2) of the directive)</title>
<p>The issue of pensioners had formed a sticking point throughout the negotiation of the PRD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-0968533212439573">115</xref>
</sup> For some of the Mediterranean Member States, the risk of having to pay large healthcare costs for expatriate pensioners proved to be problematic. These Member States feared being forced to foot the bill for potentially large numbers of expatriate pensioners who, although resident on their territories, would opt to be treated in the familiar institutions of their Member State of Origin. This was particularly true of Spain, home to over a million pensioners from northern European Member States, most notably the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. Under (EEC) 1408/71, and its predecessor (EC) 883/2004, pensioners from one Member State of the EU have a right to move to, and reside in, another Member State and receive ‘benefits in kind’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-0968533212439573">116</xref>
</sup> This means, <italic>inter alia,</italic> access to local healthcare on the same basis as local pensioners. For this the Member State of Origin pays a fee, usually on a flat fee basis, to the Member State of Residence for each pensioner. Once the individual is resident in the new Member State, it is then up to that Member State to ensure that the individual in question is provided with ‘benefits in kind’, including healthcare, at its own expense. The reality here of course is that the amount paid by the Member State of Origin should compensate for this cost. The fear of the Spanish government was that it would be obliged to pay the healthcare costs of retired expatriates resident in Spain but who decided to return home for treatment in their home countries. This would then negate the very benefit (as far as Spain was concerned) of allowing individuals to be resident on its territory – that such individuals would bring with them money that could be used to invest in the Spanish healthcare systems, infrastructure and the economy in general. This issue had caused the progression of the PRD to stall in its legislative tracks, with Spain refusing to countenance a version that would leave it liable for such costs. In order to break the impasse several modifications were made to the original draft so as to, in effect, create an exemption to the principles of the PRD for expatriate pensioners.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-0968533212439573">117</xref>
</sup> These modifications, the effect of which is not immediately obvious upon first examination, have a large impact on requirements in terms of healthcare funding. Though not specifically described as being aimed at pensioners (the exceptions here could also, for example, affect individuals who would utilise their rights under the treaties to look temporarily for work in another Member State whilst unemployed), they were, in reality, created with expatriate pensioners in mind given the potential healthcare costs of that group.</p>
<sec id="section29-0968533212439573">
<title>The situation where rights to benefits still exist in the state of origin (Article 7(2) of the directive)</title>
<p>In order to achieve progress, a compromise was hatched, which attempted to retain the essential aspects of the PRD but assuage Spanish fears that it would be liable for masses of expatriates deciding to receive treatment in their home countries. This compromise can be seen in Article 7(2), which utilises Annex IV of Regulation (EC) 883/2004. This annex contains a list of several Member States that have declared themselves to be responsible for providing benefits to individuals on their territory if those individuals would be entitled to receive a pension from that Member State even if they are no longer resident there. This effectively means that if an expatriate living in, say, Spain, returns to his home state for treatment (if it is on the list)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-0968533212439573">118</xref>
</sup> then that state will be responsible for the costs. This exception does not, however, apply to states that are not present in Annex IV of (EC) 883/2004.<sup>

<title>Healthcare not requiring authorisation in one’s Member State of Residence</title>
<p>Furthermore, Article 7(2)b states that in the case of healthcare which does not need authorisation and the need for which does not arise during a temporary stay in another Member State, the costs of such treatment should be borne by the Member State on whose territory the treatment occurs if that state is, according to (EC) No 987/2009,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-0968533212439573">120</xref>
</sup> ultimately responsible for the reimbursement of the costs. What this effectively means is that if an individual returns to his original Member State for treatment and it is only in that Member State that his entitlement to a pension arises, then it is that State that must bear the costs of treatment. (EC) 987/2009 is an implementing regulation of (EC) 883/2004. The former (with reference to the latter) states that Member States may become responsible for individuals’ costs if individuals have made a claim for a pension from that Member State. As described above, pensioners who are resident in other countries and who would not normally be entitled to benefits in kind in that country are, according to (EC) 883/2004, entitled to benefits in kind by virtue of their residence. In terms of healthcare this means that pensioners are entitled to the same access to local healthcare as local residents if they become resident in another Member State. Whilst these services are provided by institutions in the resident Member State it is the relevant social security institutions in the individual’s home state that are ultimately ‘competent’ for the costs that arise as a result of this.</p>
<p>The purpose of these mechanisms is to redirect the cost of treatment of certain individuals to states other than the Member State of Residence. This is achieved in these sections of the PRD by not using the term ‘Member State of Affiliation’ to denote which state is ultimately responsible for costs. Elsewhere, this term is used throughout the PRD to determine which Member State must ultimately bear the costs of treatment. The definition of ‘Member State of Affiliation’ is defined as the state that would have the right under (EC) 883/2004 to authorise individuals resident upon its territory to obtain a pre-planned procedure in another Member State.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-0968533212439573">121</xref>
</sup> Within (EC) 883/2004 this is defined as the state containing the ‘Competent Institution’ (i.e. the institution that is responsible financially for the individual).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-0968533212439573">122</xref>
</sup> In the case of a pensioner resident in another Member State, however, an exception is made in (EC) 883/2004 in that it is not the individual’s ‘Competent Institution’ (i.e. the one in his Member State of Origin) that shall bear the cost of an ‘authorised’ treatment in another Member State, but the relevant institution in the Member State of Residence. Whilst at first glance this might seem unfair to the Member State of Residence, one has to remember that that state will be receiving a contribution from the pensioner’s state of origin designed to cover the cost involved in providing that individual with such ‘benefits in kind’, including healthcare, in the country of residence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-0968533212439573">123</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This definition used in (EC) 883/2004 is important as it is how one defines which state is the Member State of Affiliation, a definition that is used throughout the PRD. The exceptions described above create areas of operation for the PRD where it is not the Member State of Affiliation that is required to pay for the treatment in question. This prevents a situation where Member States would have to effectively pick up the bill if expatriate pensioners resident on their territory chose to return to their Member State of Origin. The exceptions in Article 7(2) were drafted to create situations where it was not the ‘Member State of Affiliation’ that must assume the costs of medical treatment. For states such as Spain this is important, as it essentially means that it will not be responsible for non-hospital-based treatment for pensioners who decide to return to the original Member State for such treatment. Without such an exemption, such Member States would have no way of controlling such costs. This is because non-hospital-based treatment does not require prior authorisation under the PRD, and therefore could not be limited for ‘overriding reasons of the general interest’, as would be the case for hospital-based procedures.<sup>

<sec id="section31-0968533212439573">
<title>Areas not included in the exceptions</title>
<p>The exceptions above are primarily focused on the cost of healthcare for expatriate pensioners who choose to have their treatment in the Member State of Origin. They do not seem likely, however, to apply to expatriate pensioners who choose to opt for treatment in third states, whether that is non-hospitalised treatment that does not require authorisation or hospital treatment that does. In addition, the exemptions above do not apply to authorised treatment in an expatriate pensioner’s Member State of Origin (unless that Member State of Origin is one of the nations listed in Annex IV of (EC) 883/2004). This means that such individuals will be able to apply for authorisation for hospital-based treatment in their Member State of Origin, and if such treatment is approved then it will be down to the relevant institution in the Member State of Affiliation (i.e. the Member State of Residence) to assume the costs involved. In terms of financial effects, however, this runs a far smaller risk than would be the case if a similar situation existed for procedures that do not require prior authorisation (i.e. non-hospital-based care). This is because the Member State of Affiliation will have the final say in the authorisation process and will be able to refuse procedures if there are overriding reasons of general interest. One can conceive of certain Mediterranean Member States making use of such overriding reasons of general interest where it was felt that too many individuals were attempting to avail themselves of hospital-based treatment procedures through the prior authorisation procedure making overall planning difficult.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0968533212439573">
<title>Instances where prior authorisation can be required (Article 8 of the directive)</title>
<p>According to the PRD, the instances where prior authorisation may be permitted are limited (if at least in principle).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-0968533212439573">125</xref>
</sup> The Member State of Affiliation must make information available beforehand on which types of procedure it will require prior authorisation for, in addition to information on the type of authorisation procedure to be used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-0968533212439573">126</xref>
</sup> Once again it is important to distinguish at all times the difference between the regime described in (EC) 883/2004 and that in the PRD. Indeed, the PRD makes use of the difference in the two regimes to provide an incentive to Member States not to refuse prior authorisation where it should have been approved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-0968533212439573">127</xref>
</sup> The regime of the PRD is to apply when authorisation has been sought and approved (meaning the value of the treatment up to that recognised in the Member State of Affiliation will be reimbursed). In instances where the patient was wrongly refused authorisation and yet continues to go ahead and have the treatment anyway, he or she should be entitled to have the cost of his treatment reimbursed in full as if he or she had been treated under the coordination route<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-0968533212439573">128</xref>
</sup> (that used for individuals needing medical treatment during a temporary stay in another Member State) and not the PRD route. The consequence of this is that if states wrongly fail to give authorisation, they may leave themselves open to something of a penalty as they will be required to reimburse according to the coordination route (i.e. the cost payable by a resident of the Member State of Treatment) and not the cost that would be payable by one of its own residents if the treatment had occurred on its territory. It would seem that this idea has been included as a sort of incentive to Member States because if they do not carry out the prior authorisation procedure correctly they will leave themselves open to potentially greater costs. This will obviously be a greater incentive for those Member States that have smaller healthcare budgets, as it is likely that procedures will be more costly in other Member States by comparison. On the other hand, it would entail great risk for an individual to leave and receive treatment in another Member State after a refusal of prior authorisation in a patient’s own Member State. This would be because if he failed to show that the authorisation had been incorrectly refused he would potentially be leaving himself open to large healthcare costs. Given this, it remains to be seen how much force such an incentive will have for Member States when carrying out the prior authorisation procedure. The fact that this notion is described only within the recitals to the PRD and not in its articles also adds to its dubious nature, by adding questions on its legally binding nature.<sup>

<sec id="section33-0968533212439573">
<title>Four situations in which a system of authorisation may or may not be permitted</title>
<p>First, there are situations where prior authorisation is needed to justify planning needs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-0968533212439573">130</xref>
</sup> As stated in <italic>Smits and Pearbooms</italic>, such prior authorisation may be required as the number of hospitals, their geographic distribution, the way in which they are organised and the facilities they are able to offer are all matters for which a high level of planning will be required.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-0968533212439573">131</xref>
</sup> Such treatment must fall under one of the following two criteria to justify this need: (i) it involves overnight hospital accommodation of the patient for at least one night or (ii) it requires the use of highly specialised and cost-intensive infrastructure or medical equipment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-0968533212439573">132</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In deciding whether prior authorisation of healthcare is necessary, the ECJ has stated that the criteria used should be limited to what is necessary and proportionate in light of the reasons of overriding general interest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-0968533212439573">133</xref>
</sup> Given that the impact upon each Member State may be different for reasons such as geographical distribution, language barriers, location of hospitals in border regions or size of the population and the healthcare budget itself, it should still be for Member States to set such criteria, so long as they are necessary and proportionate in light of the reasons of overriding general interest. It would seem, therefore, that each Member State has a large discretion, under (ii) above, in deciding what constitutes highly specialised and cost-intensive infrastructure or medical equipment. Such questions are likely to depend on the national or regional budgetary constraints of the Member State in question. Member States are required by the PRD to inform the EU Commission of categories of healthcare that fall into either (i) or (ii). In the draft versions of the PRD there was mention of a list that would be established and updated by the Commission,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-0968533212439573">134</xref>
</sup> but the final version of the PRD seems to have left this in the hands of the Member States. This was probably a wise decision, as, if the Commission was itself deciding which treatments were to be included in this category, it would probably interfere excessively with the responsibilities of the Member State, which has a far better understanding of the resource requirements of its own system, not to mention the right under the TFEU to run its own healthcare system.</p>
<p>Second, authorisation can be required in situations that involve treatments presenting a particular risk for the patient or population. This allows Member States to protect against specific concerns. One can imagine patients wishing to travel with highly infectious diseases, for example, or patients who have highly unstable conditions that might not allow them to safely make long-distance journeys. This provision therefore gives Member States the right to conduct a prior authorisation procedure on certain occasions where it is felt that with regards to a proposed procedure in another Member State the safety of individual patients or the population as a whole must be scrutinised.</p>
<p>Third, healthcare that is provided on a case-by-case basis and which could give rise to serious and specific concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care is also potentially subject to prior authorisation (this section does not apply to healthcare for which there is Union legislation ensuring a minimum level of safety and quality throughout the Union).</p>
<p>Finally, as with (EC) 883/1407,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-0968533212439573">135</xref>
</sup> prior authorisation cannot be required if the individual would be entitled to such care and the healthcare in question cannot be provided on its territory within a time limit that is medically justifiable, based on an objective medical assessment of the patient’s medical condition, the history and the probable course of the patient’s illness, the degree of the patient’s pain and/or the nature of the patient’s disability at the time when the request for authorisation was made or renewed.<sup>

<title>Four acceptable grounds for refusal of prior authorisation</title>
<p>If a Member State has decided to require authorisation, in addition to the right for a Member State to refuse prior authorisation for a reason of general overriding interest, the PRD provides several specific reasons that could be used to refuse prior authorisation. These include:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-0968533212439573">137</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Where the requested treatment would, with reasonable certainty, expose the patient to an unacceptable risk even taking the potential benefits of the treatment into account.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Where the cross-border healthcare in question would involve a substantial risk to the public. It seems likely that this power exists in order to prevent the spreading of dangerous infectious diseases that could result if the patient were permitted to travel to another Member State in order to obtain treatment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Where the standards of the requested healthcare provider raise serious and specific concerns over its compliance with standards and guidelines on the quality of care and patient safety. This can include aspects of provision and supervision. The standards that such concerns can be judged against may be laid down in the law of a Member State or produced through accreditation systems established by the Member State of Treatment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Where the healthcare can be provided in the Member State of Affiliation in a timeframe that is medically justifiable, taking into account the current state of health and the probable course of the illness of the individual concerned.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The inclusion of this last ground for refusal of prior authorisation appears to be based upon the<italic> Smits and Peerbooms </italic>case. The potential use of this option for refusal is extremely wide and, it is argued, will significantly weaken the general effect of the directive. This is because it will be likely that the vast majority of procedures available in another Member State will also be available in the Member State of Affiliation within a suitable timeframe. Most EU states have well-developed health systems that are able to offer a wide range of health services. It is therefore likely that a service in many of these Member States will be available in another. This criterion therefore means that unless there are administrative issues unjustifiably delaying an individual’s treatment, it is very likely that the Member State of Affiliation will be able to refuse prior authorisation. In most well-funded western European health systems one would expect such instances to be a small minority. Furthermore, where such a procedure is not available in a Member State of Affiliation, that Member State does not have to, under PRD, grant authorisation for it to take place in another Member State. It seems, therefore, that the PRD may present something of a ‘catch 22’ to patients in many cases. That is because the Member State of Affiliation is allowed to refuse prior authorisation if the treatment is available within a suitable period on its territory. In addition, if the treatment is not normally available in the Member State of Affiliation then that state does not need to approve reimbursement for treatment in another state. It would appear, therefore, first that the effect of these provisions of the PRD will be that individuals are only truly entitled to be granted authorisation for more complex treatments if those treatments are normally available in their own Member States and, second, that the provision of such treatment is unreasonably delayed in that state. This situation is only likely to exist in a small minority of cases and represents a severe dilution of the main principle of the PRD: that an individual should be allowed reimbursement for treatment in another Member State if that treatment is supported in the Member State of Affiliation. The inclusion of this potentially all-encompassing possibility of refusing prior authorisation is additionally somewhat bizarre given the careful references elsewhere to the general reasons of overriding interest that can be used to refuse individuals permission to obtain medical treatment in another Member State. It is also argued by the authors of this article that the inclusion of this provision in such a ‘catch all’ form is a misreading of the court’s findings in <italic>Smits and Peerbooms</italic>. Indeed, given the existence of this more blanket provision it seems a rather futile exercise to go to the trouble of defining such permissible reasons, if Member States can in any event simply refuse prior authorisation to receive treatment in another Member State if that treatment is available in a suitable time in the Member State of Affiliation. The inclusion of such a provision also seems inconsistent with the case law of the ECJ, which did not include any reference to such blanket grounds for the refusal of prior authorisation. In <italic>Smits and Peerbooms </italic>the court stated that prior authorisation may be refused where such treatment is available within the Member State of Affiliation and has been the subject of a contract of provision between the national health insurance organisation and national healthcare providers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-0968533212439573">138</xref>
</sup> The latter part of this reasoning is missing from the relevant provision in the PRD, despite the court consistently linking the two concepts. The provision decided upon in the PRD allows Member States to refuse prior authorisation if such treatment is available, even when the relevant national health insurance body has no contracts with healthcare providers to provide the type of treatment in question. The writers of the PRD therefore appear to have drafted this provision of the directive too widely. Given that ECJ case law was based primarily on an interpretation of the treaties, this may even go so far as to call into question the validity of the PRD. This may give rise to future legal challenges, especially in instances where the national health insurance body concerned does not have pre-existing contractual arrangements with national healthcare providers.</p>

<title>Informational and privacy-related requirements</title>
<p>In addition to the establishment of NCPs, the Member State of Treatment must also ensure<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn145-0968533212439573">145</xref>
</sup> that healthcare providers make available the necessary information to make an informed choice on treatment options, their availability, their quality and their level of safety. Member States will also have an obligation to ensure that healthcare providers make available information on price. In addition, each Member State will be tasked with ensuring that healthcare providers can provide information on the registration status, insurance cover and other means of personnel or collective protection with regard to professional liability. There will be obligations upon the Member States to ensure that adequate professional liability insurance exists in accordance with the risk of the treatment offered in the Member State of Treatment. Furthermore, transparent complaints procedures and mechanisms must be provided in order for patients to seek remedies in accordance with the rules of the Member State of Treatment if harm occurs as a result of the treatment.</p>
<p>The protection of privacy must be ensured by the Member States, with the protection of personal data being in conformity with national measures implementing Union provisions on the protection of personal data (in particular Directive 95/46/EC). This means that it will be necessary to ensure that the activities envisaged under the PRD are carried out according to Union provisions on Data Protection. This will place important limits upon areas such as access to electronic medical records<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn146-0968533212439573">146</xref>
</sup> and the verification of prescriptions. An important factor will be whether the exception allowed in Article 8(3) of the Data Protection Directive<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn147-0968533212439573">147</xref>
</sup> for the processing of medical data for medical purposes applies or not. The processing of a patient’s medical data (‘sensitive personal data’) is, in principle, forbidden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn148-0968533212439573">148</xref>
</sup> Article 8 (3) of Directive 95/46/EC, however, allows for the processing of sensitive personal data under three cumulative conditions:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn149-0968533212439573">149</xref>
</sup> the processing of the data must be ‘<italic>required</italic>’, and this processing takes place ‘<italic>for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment or the management of health-care services</italic>’ and the personal data in question must be ‘<italic>processed by a health professional subject under national law or rules established by national competent bodies to the obligation of professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent obligation of secrecy</italic>’. It will therefore be important that healthcare professionals who wish to process patient data under this exemption belong to a professional body with nationally recognised obligations of secrecy. This may create problems depending on the relevant law of the Member State in question, as in some states certain categories of medical professionals may be covered by binding rules on medical secrecy but not in others. This could create potential liability problems as a healthcare professional in one Member State may not know if his colleague in another Member State is bound by such rules. If he is not, the healthcare professional may be liable for damages if he transfers a patient’s data.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn150-0968533212439573">150</xref>
</sup> In addition, processing will have to be for the purposes described in italics above. Otherwise, explicit consent will have to be obtained by national authorities before the transmission of data occurs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn151-0968533212439573">151</xref>
</sup> It is not certain at this time whether such consent can be given on a ‘one-off’ basis prior to access or if it must be given on a case-by-case basis for each use. Jurisprudence from the ECJ may be required in order to clear up this issue in a definitive manner. Such issues will have to be resolved before healthcare professionals in another Member State are able to access patients’ data in the Member State of Residence on a routine basis. Some have also raised concerns that although the requirement of organisations to adhere to the principles of the Data Protection Directive does provide a basic level of protection to individuals, it does not guarantee that the rights they are entitled to in their own country will be protected.<sup>

<title>Requirements on the mutual recognition of prescriptions (Article 11 of the directive)</title>
<p>The PRD also attempts to create a system of mutual recognition of prescriptions, whereby prescriptions made in one Member State are recognised in another. This is intended to apply to products that are authorised to be marketed in the latter according to Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. Member States must ensure that prescriptions issued for such products in another Member State for a named patient can be dispensed in their territory in compliance with the national legislation in force.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn154-0968533212439573">154</xref>
</sup> This presumably means that the dissemination of the prescription must be according to the law of the state where a patient is attempting to obtain the medication. This will presumably include rules governing quantities, the language of the instructions and other similar issues. Such rules must, however, be compatible with Union law. Member States are not allowed to prohibit the recognition of prescriptions unless restrictions would be necessary and proportionate to safeguarding human health<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn155-0968533212439573">155</xref>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn156-0968533212439573">156</xref>
</sup> The PRD also allows a pharmacist, if national law allows, to refuse for ethical reasons to dispense a product that was prescribed in another Member State. Member States have a general duty to ensure continuity of treatment where prescriptions are made in other Member States. This only applies, however, if the medical product or device is available in that state.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The PRD can be thought of as representing an interface between two different sets of actors and their respective competences. One of these actors (the EU and its institutions) has been expanding its competence in recent years, primarily through innovative ECJ decisions, whereas the other (the Member States) is intent on preserving the general competence it has for such matters as much as possible. That the EU has been able to carve out for itself an area of competence on matters of healthcare in order to protect the four freedoms related to the single market is concerning for some who point to a clear and explicit reading of the treaties that appear to place competence for such matters in the hands of the Member States. In doing this, the ECJ has had to tread carefully, protecting both the Member States’ competence on matters of health whilst ensuring that individual rights in relation to the single market are respected. These innovations by the ECJ have engaged not only legal but political questions. The PRD represents a continuation of this balancing act whereby the EU is attempting to consolidate and build upon the innovations that the ECJ had made. Such a balancing act has been described as highlighting the tension between the traditional territorial nature of healthcare provision and the notion of a real Union citizenship based upon rights under a single market.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn185-0968533212439573">185</xref>
</sup> In some respects, the PRD extends and builds upon the ECJ’s jurisprudence, but in other areas it is more conservative. On the one hand, the clarifications the directive makes to ECJ case law are important and will reduce uncertainty and the need for litigation in the future. Such measures should facilitate cross-border healthcare-related activity. On the other hand, in other areas it seems that the PRD does not go as far as the ECJ’s jurisprudence might have allowed it to do so. In these areas it seems that the PRD has restricted its scope for political rather than legal reasons, as there was little in the ECJ’s jurisprudence to mandate such restrictions. That politics should play a part in the formation of the directive is hardly surprising given the tumultuous passage this piece of legislation has had in recent years.</p>
<p>In the areas of the PRD that one could describe as ‘conservative’, the directive opts for a formulation that may act to dilute its potency in achieving its general aim of facilitating access to cross-border healthcare across the EU. The presence of such elements in the PRD is probably the price that had to be paid in order to obtain a sufficient level of agreement on the part of the Member States. Perhaps the most important of these is the provision that allows prior authorisation for hospital-based or complex treatment to be refused if the healthcare in question can be provided in a timely fashion in the Member State of Affiliation. Most Member States of the EU are advanced economies with well-developed systems of healthcare. It is to be expected that most of these healthcare systems would be able to provide most treatments in a justifiable timeframe on their own territory. This means that in most instances one would expect that the Member State of Affiliation would be able to refuse prior authorisation for treatment because it is likely that its own healthcare system would be able to provide the treatment within a duration that could be deemed acceptable. It is argued that this provides an unjustifiably broad ground for refusal, one that negates the need for the well-developed grounds of overriding reasons of general interest that can be used elsewhere and which were developed by the ECJ in its case law. This provision of the PRD also represents too expansive a reading of the court’s ruling in <italic>Smits and Peerbooms</italic>, which referred to cases where national bodies had pre-existing contracts with national healthcare providers. This, unfortunately, weakens the PRD to an extent that its very purpose can be called into question. In reality this would seem a testament to the necessity to carefully balance the developments in the PRD with the expectations of control on the part of the Member States, expectations that are largely justified by the treaties. Another such exception, created in order to take account of the millions of pensioners resident in a Member State other than the one in which their entitlement exists, creates an important area of difference whereby questions of healthcare funding will be dealt with on the basis of different principles than those used for most other individuals. Under such circumstances the Member State of Residence will not be forced to foot the bill if expatriate pensioners resident on its own territory decide to return to their Member State of Origin to receive treatment not requiring prior authorisation. Such an exception, though likely to create further bureaucratic problems, was important in convincing certain Member States to agree to the PRD. Furthermore, the exclusion of assisted care from the PRD’s remit was clearly a decision born out of political necessities rather than legal ones. It does not seem that it was the ECJ’s case law which required such a restriction; rather, that certain Member States were concerned at losing control over individual access to such care given the enormous potential costs that could be involved. Retaining control over where its residents could go and receive reimbursement for such treatment was probably considered too important for national budgets to be compromised. It would, however, with the exception of telemedicine-based services, be difficult to imagine how a contrary position could be implemented as the provision of such services in another Member State would probably require a change of residence, and thus break the link with the Member State of Affiliation. In each of these situations it may be true to say that the PRD did not go as far as was legally possible, and that the PRD represents what was at the time politically possible rather than that which is legally possible. Given that, in the future, political priorities and expectations are likely to evolve, and that there are apparently no legal impediments to doing so, it might be possible that such limitations could be reduced or even removed. It is also conceivable that individuals could attempt to secure such rights through the courts as nothing in the ECJ’s jurisprudence appears to support such exceptions.</p>
<p>Where, however, the PRD did go beyond the ECJ’s existing jurisprudence, it does indeed provide a valuable contribution to defining the possibilities of European cross-border healthcare. Its clarifications on where, precisely, prior authorisation can be required provide important certainty for both those individuals contemplating cross-border healthcare and Member State bodies in deciding what they must reimburse. The ECJ’s jurisprudence, whilst representing an important innovation at the time, was not detailed enough and provided too simplistic a delineation between hospital- and non-hospital-based services. This position ignored the considerable cost that some outpatient services can have and would have risked potential strains on some Member States’ healthcare budgets, and also endangered the coordination of such services on its own territory. The PRD’s requirements on the existence of publicly available complaints procedures will provide an important reassurance to individuals contemplating having treatment in a hitherto unknown part of Europe. Furthermore, the requirements on Member States to establish NCPs providing information on the availability of treatments to residents of other European states will act to facilitate individuals in making an informed choice as to whether they should seek treatment in another Member State.</p>
<p>Whilst some had questioned the necessity for a directive,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn186-0968533212439573">186</xref>
</sup> its existence will result in the overt acceptance, vis-à-vis the process of transposition by the Member States, of the principles already outlined in recent case law from the ECJ. This will result in the increased visibility of such principles at the national level, and therefore an increased sense of legal certainty. The existence of such principles in national law will also serve as a stimulus to national social security and healthcare-providing institutions to implement the necessary reforms to make cross-border healthcare possible and practicable in reality. It will also remove some of the confusion that had existed on the part of patients and healthcare and insurance providers with regard to the state of the law prior to the PRD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn187-0968533212439573">187</xref>
</sup> These benifits have been described as representing the real added value of a directive which, on the whole, represents a codification of pre-existing case law.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn188-0968533212439573">188</xref>
</sup> Further peripheral elements of the PRD include the creation of the European Reference Network and initiatives on technology assessment. Though participation is not binding, the availability of such initiatives should hopefully provide the healthcare systems of the Member States with an important chance to coordinate certain key resource-intensive initiatives. Such cooperation should allow Member States, especially the smaller ones, to take advantage of the economies of scale that are available at the European level, and thus allow their healthcare systems to deliver more efficient services to their own individuals.</p>

<p>Data provided by the Member States have indicated that cross-border patient flows are at present ‘negligible’. There have been generally few requests for treatment in other Member States under the prior authorisation regime in (EC) 883/2004. As of 2004 the Member State with the highest number of requests has spent €3,445,470 or 0.03% of its budget on such care.

<p>Given this it can perhaps be argued that in addition to it not being permitted under Article 168 of the TFEU, there is also no need for the EU to legislate regarding general medical rights of Union citizens as the Council of Europe has already acted robustly on such issues. Union initiatives in this area could risk being superfluous as well as being legally and politically suspect.</p>

<p>Although, in reality, obstacles may still remain. An important one is the administrative hurdles individuals must go through in order to receive reimbursement. Other problems are associated with upfront payment. This could exist where, for example, the Member State in which the individual finds himself or herself normally demands payment upfront and later offers reimbursement. This could require the upfront payment of a large amount of cash, which the individual in question might not be in possession of. This will, for example, concern individuals who are resident in a Member State where no upfront payment is required and who find themselves needing treatment in a Member State where an upfront payment may be required.

In order to obtain benefits in kind the individual concerned must apply for an E121 form, as specified in (EC) 883/2004. ‘The individual applies for an E121 form in their home country so that their social rights are transferred from the social security system of the home country to the “receiving country”. Together with this transfer of rights, a lump sum of money, agreed upon in the Social Commission on Migrant Workers, is also transferred to the central government of the receiving country to cover costs for healthcare. The information is passed to the region or locality where the pensioner is planning to settle. The long-term resident receives a national health insurance card in the new country and is thus integrated into the system. No distinctions are made between older newcomers and any other member of the social security system.’ For a discussion of benefits in kind see section ‘The Right to Free Movement of Persons’.</p>

<p>The Dutch government felt that a Directive may have been superfluous; its function could be better served by the Commission instigating more cases against Member States that failed to follow ECJ rulings. See: <italic>Nederlands regeringsstandpunt in reactie op de mededling van de commissie in het kad van de raadpleging over communautaire maatregelen op het gebied van gezondheidsdiensten,</italic> p. 11. Indeed, the Commission had recently commenced legal proceedings against several Member States.
