<p><bold>Purpose:</bold> Long standing problems are apparent in professional nursing in Iraq. This is a critical point in time and feedback and input from nurses will be important in advancing the profession. <bold>Design:</bold> A questionnaire was used to explore the attitudes of faculty members about professional nursing, women’s roles and nursing, and the Iraqi Nurses Association. The questionnaire was administered to 31 faculty members at the College of Nursing, University of Baghdad. <bold>Findings:</bold> The respondents reported the poor image of Iraqi nursing and the relationship between physicians and nurses as the most immediate problems facing the profession. The respondents are not active in their professional association and believe that the association is not addressing current problems. Profound changes are needed in professional nursing before nurses can play significant roles in the Iraqi health care system.</p>

<body>
<p>The nursing profession in Iraq has faced many problems since the first formal nursing program was established in 1933. A long-standing concern is the chronic shortage of well-prepared nurses at the baccalaureate level, a problem that is exacerbated by the difficulties in recruiting qualified women into nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>). The low status of the profession, the social barriers faced by women, and traditional male–female relationships, all exacerbate the problems in the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611423825">Boyle &amp; Salman, 2003</xref>). In addition, there is a widespread agreement that problems in Iraqi nursing have been compounded by years of severe resource deprivation, three major wars, and international isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423825">Garfield, Dresden, &amp; Boyle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1963, the first baccalaureate nursing program in Iraq was established at the College of Nursing, University of Baghdad; a major goal of the program was to prepare teachers for schools of nursing and nursing administrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611423825">Boyle, 1989</xref>). Some of the college’s graduates went abroad during the 1960s and 1970s to obtain advanced nursing degrees in the United States and England and returned to take positions in education and administration. Many of these nursing leaders have emigrated in the past decade, whereas those who remained in Iraq now serve in scattered leadership positions throughout the country. In addition to the loss of nursing leaders, the numbers of nurses in general has sharply declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>). There are estimates that up to 75% of nurses have left their jobs since 2003, and perhaps half of these have gone abroad, further compounding the problems related to the shortage of nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611423825">International Committee of the Red Cross, 2007</xref>). There is little doubt that organized nursing has serious problems. Currently, national leaders, non-governmental organizations, and the World Health Organization (WHO) are interested in upgrading nursing education and the professional status of nursing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield and McCarthy (2005)</xref> stated that “a renewed appreciation of nursing now exists” (p. 180). Improvements in the health care system and the continued development of the nursing profession are essential for rebuilding Iraq.</p>
<p>The WHO is spearheading efforts in Iraq to develop a national strategy to advance nursing and midwifery development. This approach has resulted in a 5-year plan based on priorities in education, regulation, policy and planning as well as leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611423825">International Council of Nurses, 2003</xref>). The WHO is working with nurses from different sectors, and regions of the country on a plan of action to improve nursing. Al-Gasser, Senior Scientist for Nursing and Midwifery, WHO Headquarters in Geneva, and one of the nurses in the WHO team, stated, “It is not WHO or outside experts who will build nursing in Iraq but the Iraqi nurses themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611423825">International Council of Nurses, 2003</xref>, p. 199).</p>
<p>This article describes a pilot study at a college of nursing that asked faculty members about their views on problems and issues facing the profession. A secondary aim was to assess the faculty members’ perspectives of the role, and influence of the Iraqi Nursing Association as that is the official entity charged by the Iraqi government with representing the needs of professional nurses and achieving the goals of the profession.</p>
<sec id="section1-1043659611423825">
<title>Problems and Challenges Facing Iraqi Nursing: Relevant Literature</title>
<p>Articles and/or studies about nursing or nurses in Iraq can be classified into two distinct genres. First are the more recent articles and studies conducted by nurse-scholars, primarily Americans, who have visited Iraq, talked with nurses and observed and documented the problems faced by the profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611423825">Boyle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423825">Garfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>). These articles described the poor image of nurses, the low salaries, poor working conditions, and the absence of licensure and standards for clinical practice. In addition, they have noted that educational programs have obsolete materials and that textbooks are outdated in their approach to education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611423825">Boyle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>). Gender relationships both within Iraqi society and the nursing profession were described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611423825">Boyle, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423825">Garfield et al., 2003</xref>) as they have perpetuated barriers for female nurses that are immediately noticeable to outsiders. In addition, there is an overwhelming shortage of well-prepared nurses, and this shortage has been a concern for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423825">Garfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The numerous types of nursing programs can cause problems and confusion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield and McCarthy (2005)</xref> noted, “More than 60 high school programs train the largest number of skilled Iraqi nurses in three-year programs . . . Yet in a hospital all levels of graduates from nurses aides to professional nurses may do the same job” (p. 181). Nursing curricula are dated and until recently, curricula and teaching methods were strictly controlled by the Ministry of Higher Education. The use of information technology and other technological advances in education have been limited. Educational programs should include an emphasis on primary care, health administration, and public health education; attention should be given to providing current teaching materials, including web-based technologies, as well as audiovisual, and simulation equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second body of literature, Iraqi scholars conducted a number of studies focusing on major issues and/or problems in nursing. These studies occurred prior to the social, political, and military events that occurred during and after the Gulf Wars. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611423825">1982</xref>, Al-Daragee and Al-Dagistanee conducted a survey of 297 female nurses working in hospitals in Baghdad to identify problems of concern to female nurses. Twenty percent of the sample identified “working nights” as a problem whereas 16% stated that transportation to the site of employment was problematic. It is instructive to recall that Iraq is a country where women usually do not go out alone at night or interact with men who are not relatives, and many either do not drive or own an automobile.</p>
<p>Other studies conducted during this period of time focused on attitudes held by nurses toward their profession. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611423825">Sa’ed and Naji (1983)</xref> interviewed 230 male and female nursing students and found that both male and female students had negative attitudes toward their profession, and their attitudes became more negative as they progressed through their educational programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611423825">Al-Hassan and Shabo (1984)</xref> surveyed 190 nurses, both technical and college educated, to access how they viewed negative societal attitudes toward nursing. Sixty-one percent of the respondents indicated that society did not respect or appreciate nurses, and these negative views decreased the self-esteem and job performance of nurses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611423825">Wa’ad and Beko (1986)</xref> found that only 9% of 341 nurses working in 24 Baghdad hospitals expressed some satisfaction with their profession and current employment. Reasons for their widespread dissatisfaction included negative social attitudes about nurses and the lack of job mobility. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611423825">Al-Mashadaani (1985)</xref> surveyed 76 families in Baghdad to assess their attitudes about nursing; 53% of the families reported that they would not permit their daughters to become nurses because of the negative social views about the nursing profession. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611423825">Al-Ansaree (2005)</xref> used a survey to examine changing cultural values toward nursing among 100 families in a conservative neighborhood in Baghdad. Al-Ansaree’s findings indicated a positive shift in attitudes toward nursing as families were now willing to allow their daughters to enter the nursing profession. He suggested this shift has occurred because government employment (such as a nursing position) is now more valued because it provides a stable source of income.</p>
<p>In summary, nursing in Iraq has long been fraught with numerous problems including multiple levels of preparation, negative societal attitudes about nursing that are shared by nurses themselves, low salaries, and poor working conditions. Furthermore, studies have consistently documented a shortage of nurses, particularly female nurses. This is in addition to the problems created by the lack of standards and credentials, inadequate and/or outdated nursing educational programs and strategic planning. The Iraqi Nursing Association, the government organization that supposedly represents and advocates for nursing has not played an active role. After strict control by the Saddam Hussein regime, the organization needs to be revitalized as a strong and independent organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611423825">Salvage, 2004</xref>). There is generalized agreement that nurses must also play a major role in addressing the problems in their profession and restructuring the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611423825">Garfield et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>). Although the views of nurses in the Kurdish region of Iraq were elicited to aid in the reconstruction of the health care system and professional development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611423825">Squires, Sindi, &amp; Fennie, 2006</xref>), we lack information from nurses in the south of Iraq where most of the population live and where most of the violence during the current conflict has occurred. Surveys of these nurses and their views and opinions are important to the reconstruction of the health care system and to the development of the nursing profession.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1043659611423825">
<title>The Context of the Pilot Study</title>
<p>The pilot study was initiated at a time when violence was at an all time high in Baghdad, prior to the so-called U.S. Army’s “surge.” Travel was extremely dangerous from one section or campus of the University of Baghdad to the location of the College of Nursing. A larger study involving a more diverse sample was originally planned, but the lack of security forced us to scale back our plans. The conflicts and confrontations between religious militias and the overall generalized violence in Baghdad influenced the participation of the sample members. Some faculty members expressed concern about providing information that might link them to the study and after discussion with several individual faculty, we made a decision to not ask specific and/or personal questions regarding the social and individual backgrounds of the participants. The lack of demographic data about the sample participants compromised the findings of this pilot study. If secure conditions prevail in Iraq, we hope to be able to conduct a larger study with a sample that is more representative. Until then, the pilot study does provide information about how some Iraqi faculty members view the problems within their profession.</p>
<p>We interviewed members of the nursing faculty at the University of Baghdad for several reasons. First, the authors had established relationships with the college’s faculty and administrators and were fairly confident that faculty members would be willing to participate in a study. Second, travel to other parts of the country (outside of Baghdad) was not possible because of the violence; this limited opportunities to pretest the survey or invite other faculty members to participate in the study.</p>
<sec id="section3-1043659611423825">
<title>The Purpose</title>
<p>This pilot study was an attempt to ascertain the views of nursing faculty members at the University of Baghdad about selected problems and issues in nursing and how they might be addressed. The authors sought to obtain specific information about preparation for professional nursing, the influence of women’s roles on nursing and recruitment into the nursing profession. A secondary aim was to assess faculty members’ participation in the Iraqi Nursing Association, and faculties’ views about the role and influence of that organization on the advancement of Iraqi nursing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043659611423825">
<title>The Participants</title>
<p>At that time of the study, there were 50 faculty members at the College of Nursing: 52% were male and 48% were female. A total of 31 of the 50 faculty members—16 men and 15 women—responded by completing and returning the survey, a return rate of 62%. We do not know why the remaining 19 faculty members chose not to participate in the study. Reasons might range from apathy, fear of identification, or the possibility that faculty members were unable to safely come to the office on the day the survey was distributed. Seventy-four percent of the participants were in the 31- to 50-year-old age group and 81% indicated that they were married. Four of the participants did not address all of the questions. All of the participants were prepared at the master’s or doctorate levels and can be viewed as leaders in their profession. Participants held advanced degrees from universities within Iraq, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For purposes of clarity, the terms “participants” and “faculty members” refer to those faculty members who participated in the study by completing and returning the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1043659611423825">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The research design involved creating an exploratory survey to elicit information about preparation for professional nursing, women’s roles and their impact on the nursing profession, recruitment into nursing, and the influence of the Iraqi Nursing Association on the development of nursing. These categories were thought to be broad enough to bring out both macro-level and micro-level issues of concern to professional nursing as well as to address core problems faced by Iraqi nurses.</p>
<p>The final version of the survey collected minimal demographic data (sex, age, marital status) about the participants and had 21 questions, each with three or four choices, and an open-ended question soliciting general comments. Six questions specifically addressed the influence and responsibilities of the Iraqi Nursing Association. Survey design, data collection, and translation of results from Arabic into English were completed by the first author. The second author reviewed the analysis and was primarily responsible for the first draft of the manuscript. Both authors participated in the completion of the final manuscript.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043659611423825">
<title>Ethical Considerations</title>
<p>At the time of the study, no institutional review board was functioning at the University of Baghdad. The first author discussed the intent and purpose of the study with the Dean of the College of Nursing who was supportive of the project and explained the purpose of the research to the faculty. The first author distributed the survey to all faculty members; those who completed the survey returned it to a central location. Although we were sensitive to the impact and influence of the political situation and attempted to avoid intrusive questions, both cultural and social conditions increased the limitations of the pilot study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611423825">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The questions focused on preparation for professional nursing, women’s roles and nursing, and the Iraqi Nursing Association. Although there is some overlap, we report the findings under those headings.</p>
<sec id="section8-1043659611423825">
<title>Preparation for Professional Nursing</title>
<p>In total, 81% of the participants reported that obtaining a baccalaureate degree in nursing was the best qualification for entry into nursing and that the baccalaureate degree represented professional nursing. Nineteen percent of the participants disagreed with this statement. Some participants qualified their negative response by pointing out that many high school graduates were not prepared for college level work and if admitted directly into the baccalaureate degree program, they would become a burden to the faculty in the College. However, 13% percent of the participants believed that “professional nursing” included those individuals who were technically prepared in noncollegiate programs. One of the participants reported that he or she believed a technical education was sufficient for professional practice.</p>
<p>When the participants were asked if they thought that high school graduates might be reluctant to apply to the College of Nursing or enter the nursing profession, 65% of the participants gave a positive response. Thirty-five percent indicated that there would not be a problem. Eighty-four percent of the participants believed that women graduates were more reluctant to apply to the college than were men because of the stigma and poor image of nurses. Some 16% of the participants reported that women candidates were reluctant to enter the nursing profession because they would be required to work in close association with nonrelative males as well as working night shifts or late evenings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043659611423825">
<title>Women’s Roles and Nursing</title>
<p>To more clearly understand the reasons behind the reluctance of women to enter the nursing profession, the participants were specifically asked about women’s roles within nursing. Sixty-eight percent of the participants attributed women’s reluctance to enter nursing to the negative social attitudes about nursing and the low status of nurses. Some participants reported that the lack of respect and appreciation for nurses was responsible for women’s reluctance to enter nursing. Nearly all participants cited the negative aspects of nursing such as the shift work, especially, working during late evenings and nights. In addition, the participants noted that Iraqi society frowns on interactions between men and women outside of their own family members.</p>
<p>When asked what could be done to remedy the reluctance to enter nursing, 42% indicated that improved working conditions along with higher salaries, better working hours, and more control over nursing decisions, and the work environment would be helpful. Only 26% of the sample thought that raising the quality of education for nurses would enhance the professionalization of nursing and improve the image of nurses. Other faculty (23%) reported that all of the choices (improved working conditions, higher salaries, increased control over nursing decisions, and raising the educational standards and financial incentives) would be helpful to recruit women as well as more highly qualified candidates into nursing. Ten percent of the participants suggested that financial incentives for nursing students would attract a higher caliber of students into nursing.</p>
<p>There was a strong desire on the part of the sample members to recruit highly qualified women into nursing. In all, 94% of the participants indicated that they thought women should be strongly recruited into nursing because of the need for female nurses. Some (29%) of the participants reported that the traditional role of women involves caring and nurturing, and that makes nursing a “natural” profession for women. Several participants reported that women were thought to establish a “higher moral atmosphere” in patient care situations. Other participants (29%) indicated that certain procedures for female patients, such as catheterization or labor and delivery care, required a female nurse. A large majority (97%) of the participants indicated that female patients experiencing women’s health problems preferred female nurses.</p>
<p>The views of the participants on role differences between men and women were informative. For example, when asked if a female nurse performs her job just like a male nurse, 74% of the participants agreed. Twenty-six percent believed this was not the case. Seventy-seven percent of the participants indicated that female and male nurses differ in terms of the “level and quality” of their nursing practice, whereas 19% of participants thought there were no differences. Ninety percent of the participants thought that the performance of female nurses in the areas of women’s and children’s health was qualitatively better than the performance of male nurses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1043659611423825">
<title>The Professional Nursing Organization</title>
<p>Only 13% of the faculty participants indicated that they were active members of the Iraqi Nurses Association (INA), attended meetings and were involved in professional activities. Only 6% thought the INA was making positive contributions toward nursing, whereas 90% thought that the INA was ineffectual and failed to fulfill its responsibilities toward the profession. Eighty-six percent indicated that they did not believe the INA was actively pursuing solutions to the problems and concerns of Iraqi nurses, yet 55% indicated that there were numerous issues that needed to be addressed. There was little agreement on what the goals and priorities of the INA should be. Thirty-nine percent of the participants thought that improving the image of the nursing profession should be the first priority of the INA. Forty-five percent of participants thought the association had no clearly defined goals that would enhance or improve the profession.</p>
<p>When asked to prioritize two potential issues (the relationship between nurses and physicians and working conditions for nurses) that the INA should address, 39% of the respondents indicated that the INA should improve the relationship between nurses and physicians. Twenty-nine percent thought the INA should focus on raising salaries and improving working conditions. Twenty-three percent of the participants thought both of these issues were important and that both should be addressed by the INA. Overall, the participants thought the INA should identify and try to solve the most urgent problems of the profession.</p>
<p>When asked what they would identify as the most important concern of the profession, 39% of the participants indicated that improving the image of nursing as a profession was the most important issue facing professional nursing in Iraq. Another 29% thought that physicians’ dominance over the nursing profession was the most pressing concern that should be addressed.</p>
<p>Given three choices (lack of government support for the nursing profession, poor image of nursing by the public, and lack of leadership within the profession), 29% of the participants indicated that lack of government support for the nursing profession was a considerable obstacle facing nursing, and that this lack of support contributed to the low status of nursing. Nineteen percent thought the poor image of nursing held by the public was a considerable obstacle. Thirteen percent thought there were not sufficient nursing leaders to provide leadership for needed reforms. Thirty-nine percent thought all three items (lack of governmental support, poor image of nursing by the public, and lack of leadership) were important and all contributed to the low status of nursing. When asked if the next 10 years would bring positive changes to professional nursing, 45% of the participants indicated that they believed that the situation would not change at all, 35% thought there would be positive changes and 19% believed the situation would become worse.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043659611423825">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The majority of participants who responded to the survey agreed that professional nursing should be offered in a baccalaureate program based in a university setting. However, they also recognized that many high school graduates are not prepared for college entry into nursing. A small number of the participants indicated that professional nurses could be prepared in nonuniversity settings, such as high schools, or post–high school programs. This is a rather puzzling finding given that the participants in this pilot study were faculty members at the leading nursing program in Iraq. Perhaps they are accustomed to a system that has supported nursing preparation at technical levels. The former government issued numerous decrees to address the nursing shortage that mandated the establishment of nursing programs in high schools and other post–high school institutes. Exposure to international colleagues, current literature, and updated text books will be crucial in changing outdated ideas within the nursing profession about what is a “professional nurse.” An international presence is critical in raising the image of nursing in Iraq after 13 or more years of isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611423825">Garfield &amp; McCarthy, 2005</xref>, p. 184).</p>
<p>Professional nursing education at the baccalaureate level is one way to elevate the profession and improve the image of nursing; however, recruitment of quality students, particularly women, remains a problem. The participants described the many problems inherent in recruiting women candidates into nursing. Many high school graduates are not qualified for immediate entry into a university and potential students, especially women, are influenced by the negative stereotypes of nursing as well as the reality—difficult working conditions, inadequate salaries, and menial tasks. Although there is no one answer, nursing education at all levels in Iraq should be strengthened in the coming years and qualified students, both men and women, recruited to professional nursing in universities. The Ministries of Health and Education must work closely with the WHO, and other international agencies to improve the health care system and make certain that nursing has a decision-making role in improving the overall health of the Iraqi people. Nursing leaders must be involved in those decisions that improve the health care system and have input into decisions.</p>
<p>A difficult issue to address is how gender issues have played out in nursing with male and female nurses caring for male and female populations. Participants indicated that they believe there are real differences between male and female nurses in terms of the level and quality of their nursing practice, particularly in the area of women’s and children’s health. Women are believed to provide better care or at least more acceptable care to women and children because of their “natural traits.” Responses on the part of faculty members reflect traditional attitudes in Iraqi society and will take many years to change. It would be important in the future to recruit women into baccalaureate programs as it would be unfortunate if women were directed into technical education programs whereas men gravitated toward baccalaureate preparation. Women’s traditional roles pose real challenges as attitudes and beliefs about gender roles tend to be resistant to change yet they must be acknowledged in advancing the profession.</p>
<p>The majority of the participants are not active members of the Iraqi Nursing Association and do not believe that the association is actively pursuing solutions to the problems faced by the profession. The relationship between physicians and nurses and the low image of nursing were identified by the participants in the study as major problems in nursing. These are the very problems that could and should be addressed by a professional organization. Low social status, a poor professional image, low salaries and poor working conditions, lack of autonomy and cultural constraints for women, all contribute to the negativity surrounding nursing, and they can only be addressed by a united front of nurses themselves with strong government encouragement and support. The international community must also be involved in strengthening Iraqi nursing.</p>
<p>Many of the participants in this study do not have strong and positive views of their profession. It is probably worth reporting one observation that was noted during the process of conducting this research. Some working nurses who have baccalaureate degrees from the College of Nursing at the University of Baghdad introduce themselves as “physicians” rather than “nurses.” Although we cannot report with certainly that such attitudes on the part of nurses are themselves part of the problem, it seems likely that the low status of nursing and the poor professional image of nurses is a deeply rooted problem in Iraqi society, one that is inherent within nurses themselves, as well as physicians, patients and their families. Unfortunately, many participants in this study reflect negative attitudes and the poor image of nursing held by society at large.</p>
<p>Results of this study cannot be generalized to all nurses in Iraq, but it is sobering to note that the findings from this study are consistent with all of the other reports and studies of Iraqi nursing conducted during the past 25 years. If the health status of the people of Iraq is to improve over the next few decades, the nursing profession must change radically to provide the kind and quality of care that is needed. How to achieve these goals is not entirely clear. What seems apparent from the study presented here is that change must begin within the nursing profession itself. The Iraqi Nursing Association must function independently of the government and take vigorous actions to improve the professional image of nursing. Individual nurses, especially faculty members, and other strong nursing leaders must work to improve the image and low status of nursing. Raising the social status of nurses by redefining the role of nurses within the health care system can be initiated by including nurses in decision-making positions throughout the health care sector. Adequate compensation alters the negative views of nursing, both within the profession and the wider society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611423825">Al-Ansaree (2005)</xref> noted in his study that negative attitudes toward nursing have changed when nurses are able to earn a stable income.</p>
<p>Profound changes are needed in nursing education. Bringing some sense of order to the preparation of nurses by identifying and preparing two levels of nurses, the technical and professional, would be an important step. Last of all, educational curricula in nursing should change to reflect the preparation and education of professional graduates for significant roles in the Iraqi health care system. Addressing the long standing problems within Iraqi nursing will be a long and ongoing process. Feedback and input from Iraqi nurses will be critical in strengthening and changing the profession, and this pilot study is a small step in that direction.</p>
