<abstract>
<p>The study surveyed the agricultural information needs, information sources used and the awareness of the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA)’s products and services by the various agricultural stakeholders in Botswana. The survey covered 52 agricultural researchers/educators, 30 extension agents, 54 students, 12 commercial farmers, and 45 subsistence farmers. Data collection instruments used for the study were the questionnaire, interview and focus group discussions. The findings reveal that the agricultural stakeholders in Botswana had a wide range of information needs, especially on government programmes, farm problems and identification of market for agricultural products. The prominent information sources used were the Internet, journal articles and technical papers. The study also revealed that most of the stakeholders were not aware of CTA’s products and services and that the Spore magazine was the product mainly used. The Question and Answer Service was rarely used by the stakeholders. The study recommends that the Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) Library should be selected as the agency to provide agricultural information services to all the stakeholders in Botswana, given its rich information resources in agriculture, and that CTA should reappraise its services in Botswana by ensuring that its services are well utilized by agricultural information stakeholders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Agriculture is the backbone of the economy of most African countries. It constitutes the largest labour force and contributes substantially to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666911433117">Aina 1995</xref>). Botswana, located in the Southern African region, is one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. While agriculture provides the largest labour force in the country, its contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is negligible. Agriculture constitutes the highest active labour force in Botswana. The agricultural sector accounts for over 30 percent of the country’s labour force but the contribution of agriculture to the country’s GDP is about 2.4 percent. Livestock is the major sector of agriculture in Botswana; arable agriculture is on a limited scale. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666911433117">Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Agriculture in Botswana is largely at subsistence level. Botswana is a landlocked country. Most of the country is covered by the Kalahari Desert. Rainfall is poor and erratic. As a result, agricultural yield is very limited. Thus, food items are largely imported from the neighbouring South Africa. However, what Botswana lacks in higher agricultural yield is largely compensated for by the large diamond deposits in the country, which are the main foreign exchange earner for the country.</p>
<p>In spite of the low contribution of agriculture to its GDP, the government of Botswana attaches great importance to agriculture because it provides food and employment to most inhabitants in the rural communities. The private sector has minimum involvement in agriculture because it is very unattractive. It is therefore not surprising that the agricultural sector's contribution to the GDP of Botswana is minimal. Government institutions are mainly responsible for the dissemination of agricultural information in Botswana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666911433117">Aina 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Government is a major stakeholder in agricultural development. The Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for developing the livestock, arable agriculture, conservation and cooperative development sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666911433117">Ministry of Agriculture Headquarters 2006</xref>). Another major key player in the agriculture sector of Botswana, besides the Ministry of Agriculture, is the Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA), which is affiliated to the University of Botswana as the Faculty of Agriculture. This College is responsible for the training of employees in the agricultural sector at all levels. It offers training in various agricultural specializations. Other major stakeholders include: the Botswana Vaccine Institute (BVI), Botswana Meat Commission, (BMC), National Development Bank (NDB), Botswana Agricultural Marketing Board (BMB) and Botswana Technology Centre (BOTEC).</p>
<p>Agricultural extension management is devolved to six agricultural regions. These are Gaborone, Francistown, Maun, Kang, Selebi-Phikwe and Serowe. Within each region, there are district agricultural offices. In spite of government’s determination to increase agricultural productivity in Botswana, the result has not been satisfactory. A major factor responsible for the low agricultural productivity in Botswana is the inability of policy makers to clearly define the agricultural information needs of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666911433117">Aina 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been many interventionists aiming at improving agricultural information in Botswana. Prominent among these organizations are CTA (Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation), based in Wageningen, Netherlands, focusing on the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and the Southern African Centre for Cooperation on Agricultural Research (SACCAR). Although SACCAR ceased operations in the late 1990s, throughout its existence it provided programmes aimed at supporting national research systems in the region, including Botswana.</p>

<sec id="section2-0266666911433117">
<title>CTA in Botswana</title>
<p>CTA continues to play a prominent role in improving agricultural productivity in Botswana through its many products and services. Some of the services and products include a Question and Answer Service, which was launched in 2005 in Botswana. The main objectives include: to improve access to agricultural information in a timely and cost-efficient way and promote the use of information to improve food security. The Botswana College of Agriculture is the focal point for the Question and Answer Service (QAS) in Botswana. This service is expected to benefit extension workers and farmers. CTA has also provided CD-ROM/Internet databases on agriculture and rural development to the Botswana College of Agriculture and other research organizations in Botswana for the benefit of agricultural researchers. <italic>Spore</italic> magazine is an outreach extension magazine which is distributed to major agricultural and rural organizations and personnel in Botswana and other ACP countries. This magazine is useful to researchers and extension workers in Botswana. Other products and services include inviting stakeholders to CTA-organized seminars for researchers and extension workers and selective dissemination of information to researchers. The BCA is expected to coordinate some these of services.</p>

<title>The agricultural information environment</title>
<p>It is important to establish the information environment of agricultural stakeholders in Botswana. This will enable the researcher to identify areas that need to be strengthened in the provision of information to these stakeholders.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666911433117">Oladokun (2009)</xref>, the information environment “is viewed as the type of environment which individuals interact with either for purposes of providing or obtaining information for use in day-to-day living or to perform a task”. Thus, the information environment comprises the information needs and information seeking behaviour of individuals, information resources and services available to individuals and channels used by individuals in obtaining information, in order to perform a particular task.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666911433117">Aina (1995)</xref> listed agricultural information user populations in Africa as: policy makers and planners, researchers, extension staff, educators and students, agro-based industries and services staff and farmers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666911433117">Samaha (1985)</xref> stated that agricultural information is neglected in developing countries. He highlighted the problems of agricultural information management in Africa as: inadequate dissemination of research results, limited library and information services and inadequate communication of information to decision makers, farmers and other end-users. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666911433117">Kaniki (1992)</xref>, lamenting the state of agricultural information in Africa, stated that the information needs of agricultural researchers were not fulfilled and this has hampered the quality of research in Africa. In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666911433117">Kaniki (1995)</xref> identified the comprehensive perceived information needs of the different stakeholders in the agricultural sector in Africa. In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666911433117">Ragi, Day and Asaba (2006)</xref>, on knowledge sharing, information and innovation, the authors identified actors in communication for agricultural innovation as farmers, extensionists, persons in the private sector, researchers, educationists and policy makers. According to the authors, farmers need every type of information such as information on credit, transport, market prices, etc, while the extensionists need to have skills in digital communication. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666911433117">Russell (1983)</xref> reported that the wide range of the information needs of agricultural user populations poses a number of challenges to information specialists.</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666911433117">Woolston (1983)</xref> the ultimate aim of providing information in agriculture is to help farmers to produce more food. Information could either be provided directly to farmers in an understandable format or indirectly to agricultural extension workers who will interpret it for farmers or research workers. Research workers are expected to use information to develop more effective agricultural practices, or use information to improve the training of future generations of agricultural research workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666911433117">Oladele (2010)</xref> found, for example, that dissertations and theses, journal articles and the Internet were the major sources of information used by agricultural researchers in South Western Nigeria.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666911433117">Thapisa (1994)</xref>, who studied the information needs of the agricultural sector in Botswana, recommended that an agricultural research network (AGRINET) be made available to researchers locally and internationally. Also recommended was the need to integrate all the agricultural library services in the major agricultural organizations in Botswana into a centralized agricultural information system.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A survey of the different agricultural stakeholders in Botswana was carried out in 2007. The target population included 52 agricultural researchers/educators, 30 extension agents, 54 agricultural students, 12 commercial farmers, and 45 subsistence farmers. The data collection instruments used for the study were a questionnaire, interviews and focus group discussions. The questionnaire was used to elicit relevant responses from some of the stakeholders – researchers/educators, extension workers, commercial farmers and students. Focus groups discussion was used for subsistence farmers. The researcher conducted face-to-face interviews with the chief executives of selected agricultural institutions or their representatives. For the purpose of eliciting the opinions of stakeholders in agriculture, the heads of the following organizations were purposively selected to reflect the different sectors of agriculture in Botswana:<list list-type="bullet">

</p>
<p>An interview with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture could not be held because of the exigencies of office. An interview was scheduled several times, but there were last minute cancellations.</p>
<p>The academic staff at the Botswana College of Agriculture, the principal research centre in Botswana, provided the target audience of researchers and educators. The whole population of 81 lecturers in BCA was surveyed. Similarly, extension officers in the six agricultural regional offices in Botswana were surveyed. A sample of students at the Botswana College of Agriculture was also surveyed. In 2007 there were 1022 students, of whom 5 percent were purposively selected across the departments to complete the questionnaire designed for students. Some commercial farmers were purposively selected in the six regions of the country and surveyed using a questionnaire. However, for subsistence farmers and policy makers, different data collection methods were used. While focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with some subsistence farmers in six locations in the country, an interview schedule was the instrument used in collecting data from the policy makers.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The information environment of the different agricultural stakeholders in Botswana is reported in this section.</p>
<sec id="section8-0266666911433117">
<title>Agricultural researchers or educators</title>
<p>The data on researchers and educators are merged because they are involved in both agricultural research and training. Given the importance of research in any discipline, especially in agriculture, it is expected that researchers would always attempt to solve farm problems and the findings would then be made available to farmers. The researcher is involved in issues that relate peripherally to farm problems such as social development issues, policy issues, equipment sourcing, etc. To perform this task, there should be regular provision of information to researchers; hence they actively seek relevant information in order to do their work. The need to have information providers in the environment who will regularly supply information to them becomes critical.The total population of 85 researchers/educators at BCA as at 2007 were from five departments of: Agricultural Economics, Education and Extension, Agricultural Engineering and Land Planning, Animal Science and Production, Basic Sciences, and Crop Science and Production. These researchers were surveyed and provided the questionnaire on their agricultural information environment. Fifty-two of the 85 researchers/educators responded to the questionnaire – a response rate of 61 percent. There were 81 percent male respondents and 19 percent female. The majority of the researchers, (28 or 54 percent) had PhD degrees, while 12 (25 percent) possessed Masters' degree as the highest qualification, five had Bachelors' degrees and six, other qualifications. They were specialized in various aspects of agriculture. Most of them had worked for 10 years and more (77 percent). The major information needs of agricultural researchers in Botswana, as identified from their questionnaire responses and shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0266666911433117">Table 1</xref>
, were for information on development and funding programmes (84.6 percent), agricultural networks (84.6 percent), and farm problems (71.2 percent). The result is not surprising, given the importance of funding of research that will result in development, agricultural networks that will support their research tasks and the need to know the prevalent problems in the farms. Other less prominent areas mentioned include conferences and meetings, identification of markets, and market data.</p>

<title>Extension workers</title>
<p>A total of 30 extension personnel completed the questionnaire. They were scattered in the different regions of the country and were of different specializations. Two of them had a PhD degree, while five (16.7 percent) had either master’s or bachelor’s degrees as their highest qualification. Most of the extension workers (43.3 percent) had a diploma as the highest qualification, while four (13.3 percent) had a certificate in agriculture. They held positions such as principal agricultural officer, book keeping officer, district agricultural officer, regional crop production officer and principal scientific officer. They were quite experienced, as nine (30.0 percent) had served for more than 21 years, 13 (43.3 percent) had served for between 11 and 20 years and only seven (23.3 percent) had served for less than 5 years.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666911433117">Table 4</xref>
 shows that the information needs of extension workers were mainly for information on how to access available agricultural networks (73.3 percent), farm problems (66.7 percent) and development and funding programmes (66.7 percent). These results are similar to those obtained for agricultural researchers. The sources of information used by extensionists as revealed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0266666911433117">Table 5</xref>
 were technical/annual reports (80.0 percent), Ministry of Agriculture publications (76.3 percent) and fairs and exhibitions (73.3 percent).</p>

<p>Respondents were asked to indicate the methods used for disseminating information to farmers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0266666911433117">Table 6</xref>
 shows that personal contact was the method used by 90.0 percent, followed by agricultural shows (86.7 percent) and posters and leaflets (60.0 percent). Less than half of the respondents used radio and television as methods of disseminating information to farmers. This is surprising, given the fact that the major broadcasting stations in the country provide weekly programmes on agriculture.</p>

<p>When the extension workers were asked if they were aware of CTA, only 10 (33.3 percent) had ever heard of CTA. The respondents were aware of CTA publications (30.0 percent) <italic>Spore</italic> magazine (23.3 percent) and the Question and Answer Service (10.0 percent). These results are rather disturbing, given the fact that CTA is heavily involved in the development of rural farmers, especially through the distribution of <italic>Spore</italic> magazine, which contains information on agriculture and rural development, as well as the provision of its Question and Answer Service, which is meant to respond to any queries regarding agricultural problems. Thus, if extensionists do not utilize CTA products, it means that these services provided by CTA will not reach the farmers.</p>

<sec id="section10-0266666911433117">
<title>Students</title>
<p>Fifty-four students were surveyed. There were equal numbers of female (50 percent) and male (50 percent) students in the sample. All the departments in BCA were fairly represented in the sample. Most of the students who completed the questionnaire were third year (16.7 percent) and fourth year students (66.7 percent). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0266666911433117">Table 8</xref>
 reveals that the students' areas of greatest information need were for information on scholarships (85.2 percent) and job opportunities (83.3 percent); areas that are not immediately related to agriculture. This is not surprising as most students are generally interested in scholarship and job opportunities. However, identification of market of agricultural products, farm problems and market data were also prominently mentioned.</p>

<title>Farmers</title>
<p>Two categories of farmers were surveyed. These were 12 commercial farmers and 45 subsistence farmers. While the questionnaire was the data collection instrument used for commercial farmers, focus group discussions were held with subsistence farmers. Twelve commercial farmers in the six regions were randomly selected based on the Botswana Telephone Directory (Yellow Pages) for 2007. Those who completed the questionnaire were either the directors, owners or staff members. Five (41.7 percent) of the commercial farms had been in existence for less than 5 years, and five (41.7 percent) had been established for between 5 and 10 years. Only one farmer (8.3 percent) had been in business for between 11 and 20 years. One farmer did not respond. The farmers were involved in both crop and pastoral farming. Eight of the commercial farms had less than 10 workers. One farmer had more than 20 workers. Most of the farmers, as revealed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0266666911433117">Table 11</xref>
, indicated information on development (91.7 percent), government and international issues (91.7 percent) and identification of markets for agricultural products (91.7 percent) as their areas of greatest information need. Farm problems (83.7 percent) and market data (75.0 percent) were also significantly mentioned.</p>

<p>When commercial farmers were asked how often they were visited by extension workers, 6 (50 percent) mentioned once in three months, while 3 (25 percent) mentioned once a month.</p>
<p>Only one of the commercial farmers had ever heard of CTA, and he mentioned the use of <italic>Spore</italic> magazine and the Question and Answer Service.</p>
<p>Subsistence farmers constitute the largest proportion of farmers in Botswana. Given the large number of famers, it was decided that information would be elicited through focus group discussions (FGD). There were six FGD meetings in the country, one meeting in each agricultural region, as follows:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>FGD 1: There were nine farmers interviewed (4 female, 5 male). Seven were literate, while two were illiterate. All were involved in mixed farming, that is, both crop and pastoral farming. During rainy seasons they were involved in crop farming and engaged in cattle rearing during dry season. The farmers were also involved in other income-generating activities such as tailoring and preparing food in schools. They needed information on livestock diseases, marketing of their cattle and proper explanations by government agencies of matters of interest to farmers. They all agreed that they were regularly visited by extension officers, especially when they had problems on the farms. They mentioned a variety of methods used by extension officers in the provision of information. Personal contact was the most preferred method. Other methods included radio and leaflets. None of them had ever heard of CTA nor of any CTA products or services.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>FGD 2: There were nine farmers in this group (4 female, 5 male). They were all literate. They were all involved in arable and pastoral farming. They did not engage in any other activity besides farming. They needed information on rainfall, pests such as elephants, and on tractors (normally supplied by local councils). They were regularly visited by extension officers, and used personal contacts, radio, etc. as sources of information. They had never used or heard of any CTA product or service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>FGD 3: There were six farmers (2 female, 4 male). They were all literate and were involved in both arable and pastoral farming. Information was needed most on domestic animal diseases, pests and shortage of rainfall. They were regularly visited by extension officers.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>FGD 4: There were eight farmers in this group (3 female, 5 male). They were all literate. They were all involved in pastoral farming. They did not engage in any other activity besides farming. They needed information on rainfall, capital, animal diseases, land shortage, etc. They were regularly visited by extension officers, and used personal contacts, <italic>kgotla</italic> (village) meetings, etc. as information sources. They had never used or heard of any CTA product or service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>FGD 5: There were seven farmers in this group (5 female, 2 male). They were 3 literate and 4 non-literate. They were all involved in arable and pastoral farming. Some were involved in petty trading by selling fruits and provisions in tuck shops. Some were employed by government. They needed information on rainfall, soils, tractors, livestock theft, and animal diseases. They were visited regularly by extension officers, and used personal contacts, agricultural newsletters, etc. as sources of information. They had never heard of CTA and had never used or heard of any CTA product or service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>FGD 6: There were nine farmers in this group (4 female, 5 male). They were all literate. They were all involved in arable and pastoral farming. They did not engage in any other activity besides farming. They needed information on rainfall, pests such as elephants, tractors, etc. They were visited by extension officers regularly. They used personal contacts, etc. as sources of information, and had never used or heard of any CTA product or service.</p>

<title>Policy makers</title>
<p>The findings of the interviews conducted with heads of ten agencies connected with agriculture indicate that the information needs of policy makers in these agencies were related to social development issues, government and international regulations, farm problems and market data. The information sources used were mainly local and international documents, while the Internet was the most frequently used source. The libraries attached to agricultural and research organizations were also used as sources of information.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-0266666911433117">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is no doubt that agriculture in Botswana constitutes an important sector, given the large number of people involved in it, as well as its contribution to GDP. But from the findings, it is obvious that information is not considered an important factor in increased agricultural productivity in Botswana. Even though there is evidence that agricultural information stakeholders have a variety of information needs, it seems that the information needs of agricultural researchers and extension workers coincide, as development and funding programmes, agricultural networks, and farm problems were the areas prominently mentioned. Students' needs differ widely from those of researchers and extension workers as scholarships and job opportunities, identification of market for agricultural products, farm problems and market data were prominently mentioned as information needs by the students. The common feature among the three categories of agricultural stakeholders was farm problems.</p>
<p>Information sources mostly consulted by agricultural researchers were journal articles, the Internet, technical/annual reports and conference proceedings, but extension workers used annual reports, Ministry of Agriculture publications and fairs and exhibitions. However, students used the Internet, journal articles, newspapers and colleagues as their major sources of information. Most agricultural stakeholders were not aware of most CTA products, although <italic>Spore</italic> magazine was mentioned by some stakeholders. The Question and Answer Service, that was expected to be regularly patronized by farmers, was unfortunately not used by farmers as all those sampled indicated they were not aware of CTA and its products. It is surprising that a larger proportion of students than researchers were aware of CTA and its products, while the extension workers, who were expected to work more closely with CTA, had the least awareness of CTA among three categories of stakeholders. It is therefore not surprising when the farmers claimed that they were not aware of CTA and its products. The Question and Answer Service was one of the services least used by all the categories of agricultural stakeholders in Botswana.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0266666911433117">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The various agricultural stakeholders in the country have expressed a variety of information needs such as development and funding programmes, agricultural networks, and farm problems. But the resources for meeting these information needs are limited. There are no conscious efforts on the part of information providers to make agricultural information available to agricultural user populations in Botswana. For example, despite the role of CTA in assisting the various stakeholders in the provision of agricultural information, its services are hardly utilized by the stakeholders. The Question and Answer service, though recently introduced in the country, was hardly used by farmers and extension agents. This service has been reported to be very successful in providing agricultural skills development and training to farmers in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666911433117">Verster 2010</xref>). The service has empowered subsistence farmers, which has resulted in poverty alleviation and food security.</p>
<p>The rich resources in <italic>Spore</italic> magazine are not widely adopted by researchers, students and extension agents. Similarly, extension agents do not utilize a variety of methods in providing agricultural information to farmers. Also, efforts are not made to ensure that the regular broadcasts on television and radio are listened to by rural farmers, as the findings from the focus groups indicate that a large number of the farmers rarely listened to these programmes. Libraries, as information providers, were hardly used by all the user populations. Even though some of the policy makers indicated that they made use of their organizations' libraries, there was no evidence that they used the library for the purpose of seeking agricultural information. The Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) seems not to play a pivotal role in the provision and dissemination of information in Botswana.</p>

<title>Recommendations</title>
<p>The government of Botswana should pay special attention to the provision of regular information to all agricultural user information populations in the country, given the important role of information in increasing agricultural productivity. This will be in line with recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666911433117">Norman and Ntokotha (1990)</xref>, who in their study of the information needs of major agricultural information stakeholders in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region, emphasized a need to put in place a viable agricultural information system in the SADC region. There is the need for an agency that would be responsible for providing information to all agricultural information user groups in Botswana. The Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA) Library is best suited to provide various types of agricultural information services given its rich information resources in agriculture. Unfortunately, it does not possess adequate staff that will ensure that all the expected services are provided. It is hoped that if the government will show more commitment and ensure that BCA is well funded, so that the lack of adequate agricultural information to the various stakeholders in Botswana will be redressed.</p>
<p>The wide use of the Internet by agricultural researchers/educators, students and extension workers in Botswana should be encouraged. Thus government of Botswana should continue to improve the information and communications technology infrastructure in the country.</p>
<p>CTA should reappraise its services in Botswana as well as other countries in Africa to ensure that they are utilized by agricultural information stakeholders. The Question and Answer Service is not known in the country by most stakeholders, hence the use is minimal. It is recommended that the service should be well publicized to all agricultural stakeholders in Botswana so that they can benefit from it. The Botswana College of Agriculture (BCA), the focal point of the Question and Answer Service, should work closely with farmers in the various districts of Botswana so that they can use the service effectively.</p>
<p>Other CTA products such as seminars, publications and CD-ROM databases need to be patronized by agricultural stakeholders in Botswana because the agricultural information contained in these products can accelerate agricultural productivity in Botswana.</p>
