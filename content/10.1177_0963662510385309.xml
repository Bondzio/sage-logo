<abstract>
<p>Studies of the use of research-based expertise in the mass media often demonstrate how experts are used to confirm journalists’ angles on particular stories or how research-based knowledge claims are twisted. Both among practitioners and science communication scholars, such practices are often explained with reference to a pervasive “media logic.” “Media logic” is constructed as governing choices and interactions of researchers and journalists. This article critically examines the extensive use of the term “media logic” to explain choices, changes or content in media production, and presents Actor-Network-Theory as an approach that invites us to ask what takes place in practice without resorting to such generalizing explanatory devices. The article argues that a quick jump to “media logic” as an explanation may imply that we forget its contingency and ignore what actually takes place in journalists’ and researchers’ negotiations about texts and facts in the mass mediation of science.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>‘Media logic” is routinely used as a convenient term for explaining all sorts of editorial choices, transformations of content, and source relations in studies of the mass mediation of research. This article will argue, however, that when referred to as an abstract, general mechanism, the term is of little use in explaining concrete practices. Yet because it is widely used among researchers and media workers, as well as in media studies, it makes sense to take a closer look at the role it plays as a discursive figure or an actant that is performative in the sense that it guides practice. With a poststructuralist view of language and with inspiration from Actor-Network-Theory’s refusal to draw on abstract, invisible forces as explanations, the article works from the assumption that it is less analytically interesting to bring in “media logic” as an explanation of practices, and more interesting to explore how this phenomenon is brought into existence discursively and becomes an actant because people relate to it as actually existing. For instance, media training of researchers will teach them how to craft one-liners and simple stories that comply with various news values and “the media logic.” When researchers are taught those tricks of the trade, they often succeed in getting media coverage, and this becomes articulated as a matter of “understanding the media logic,” rather than learning a range of techniques. It might be that experience and expectations have guiding or constraining effects on journalistic selectivity, but translating these into a general media logic and using the concept as an explanatory device, we might lose sight both of how it is created in practice, and of the instances where journalists’ and researchers’ interactions are kept together by other types of entities. In this article I will give examples of how the empty signifier of “media logic” may be filled out with different meanings. Some researchers position themselves in opposition to the media logic, and as belonging to a domain governed by other logics than that of the media machinery. In other situations, it is used as a marker of prestige if a researcher is capable of understanding – and accepting – what the media logic demands. Conversely, researchers may accuse colleagues of not understanding or not behaving in accordance with the demands of the media logic. All this positioning work not only draws on, but also reproduces the concept. I also offer examples of journalists who are not particularly interested in news values and who go for complex stories. When they talk about their decisions, there is no talk about complying with or fighting against a media logic. In these particular cases, the media logic is non-existent. I will argue that when actors do not articulate media logic as important, media or science communication researchers should not introduce it to explain their actions.</p>
<sec id="section2-0963662510385309">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The article is based on four in-depth case studies exploring how media texts dealing with research-based social scientific knowledge are assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662510385309">Plesner, 2009</xref>). The case studies were conducted in accordance with Actor-Network Theory’s (ANT’s) principle of “following the actors” (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510385309">Latour, 2005</xref>). ANT is referred to as “a sociology of associations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510385309">Latour, 2005</xref>) because it holds that we must look at concrete processes through which the social is made – rather than assuming social structures or accepting familiar conceptions of social groups or interests. A fundamental research strategy of ANT is to follow how actors are enrolled in collectives through negotiations and how interests are translated so that they fit others’ projects. To construct a point from where I could trace the linkages made between entities in the mass mediation of science, I set out to construct a purposive sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662510385309">Denzin and Lincoln, 2000</xref>), seeking out settings and people where communication of research in the mass media was most likely to occur. I interviewed heads of communication departments at four Danish universities, and I interviewed editors at the two Danish newspapers that have the greatest amount of expert-based stories and the most extensive coverage of research. All the interviews were aimed at making these actors talk about the relations they were engaged in, and to give examples of cooperation with researchers that had resulted in specific texts. I followed the leads to researchers and specific texts, and from here I got new leads to new actors and new texts. In total, I conducted 19 interviews with editors, journalists and researchers, and analyzed the media texts that had come out of the cooperation between them. Besides these texts, I analyzed a range of other types of texts referred to by the interviewees: conference papers, email correspondence, letters to the editor, a journalist’s manuscript, researchers’ popular articles, discussion forums on the internet, minutes of meetings and communication policy documents. As indicated above, the aim of this was to explore how different actors and entities make up assemblages or collectives in and around mass media texts dealing with science. Together, the cases were considered as exemplars that contribute to a cumulative development of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662510385309">Flyvbjerg, 2006</xref>: 241) about the mass mediation of research-based knowledge. The stories told below, of the shifting positions of media logic, are made possible by the choice to interview media actors who are seriously engaged in the communication of social scientific research. They are either affiliated with more intellectual media outlets or have an area of specialization dependent on expert statements. Had the analysis been based on interviews with tabloid journalists or general reporters with little interest in research, media logic would probably have had another and possibly more stable status in practice. The purposive sampling of a particular type of journalist thus produces particular analytical accounts of media logic, and does not allow for a universalizing story of how media logic is performative throughout the journalistic profession.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963662510385309">1</xref></sup> This would also be at odds with the basic tenet of ANT informing this work, that we should give up universalizing aspirations and focus on the making of particular assemblages.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the sociology of associations, assemblages or collectives not only consist of humans, but also of non-human elements. The criterion for analytical inclusion in the assemblage is that an element makes a traceable difference for the other elements in the collective. With the idea of “traceable differences” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510385309">Latour, 2005</xref>), ANT strives to be analytically inclusive on one level and exclusive on another level. Inclusive in the sense that <italic>any type of element</italic> is seen as important for the analysis if it is articulated or physically present, and exclusive in the sense that invisible, abstract forces that can only be assumed in advance or deducted from the empirical material are kept out of the story. The elements that make a difference are called actants. This concept emphasizes that although the element makes a difference in a collective, it is contingent, i.e. dependent on its relations to the other elements. The analyses of the cases showed how different types of assemblages may consist of entities such as arguments, facts, experts, information and communication technologies (ICTs), ideals, anecdotes, experience, and actants such as “media logic” or “practice.” It was shown how these – and other types of entities – become enrolled in more or less solid collectives, through negotiations and translations. The present article zooms in on one of the frequently occurring entities across the interview material of the research project, namely “media logic.” The article does not claim to report on <italic>what media logic is</italic>, on the basis of interviews. Rather, it shows how this entity becomes linked to other entities by interviewees. This is in line with poststructuralist approaches to interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662510385309">Fontana, 2003</xref>), which emphasize that interviews do not give direct access to any reality outside of the interview situation, or to any underlying norms guiding individuals. Instead, interviews offer insights into how actors couple different entities together, i.e. how media logic is given meaning by practitioners. The analyses below should thus not be seen as an account of what the journalistic profession is like, but as a set of stories of how actors turn particular concepts into actants as they navigate within this profession.</p>
<p>In the main sections of this article, media logic is analyzed as a discursive, performative figure or an actant. When I talk about discursive, performative figures or actants, the point of the concepts are basically the same. Both discourse theory and ANT draw on poststructuralist theories of language, assuming that symbolic entities are not representations of reality, but actively shape reality. This means that when we refer to media logic, this does not denote an actually existing entity “out there,” but produces particular understandings of the profession of journalism (for instance, as constrained by unspoken rules) and the rationality of mass media institutions (as a kind of machinery that processes all input according to the same technical standards).</p>
<p>To situate this argument and frame the analyses that ensue from it, the article opens with a discussion of the ways in which “media logic” tends to be theorized and used in media and science communication studies. It then illustrates how discourse theory and ANT offer an inroad to unpacking the concept through the focus on how it is made up and used by media actors in concrete situations.</p>

<title>2. Media logic in theory</title>
<p>In media studies, the concept of the media logic is only one among a range of mechanisms and logics called upon to explain concrete occurrences or situations. Other common explanatory devices include “news criteria” and “professional identities.” They are constructed as entities that make a difference in actual media production processes. From the way in which they are applied either casually or as theoretical constructs, these entities seem to have been granted a role as an external force – much like an invisible hand – which influences practice, as part of a wider context. This is not to suggest that media scholars generally draw on essentialist or structuralist explanations. Media scholars have certainly been among the frontrunners of the poststructuralist movement, and most of them would probably argue that such a “thing” as media logic is contingent, i.e. culturally and historically specific, and constantly made up by actors. But still, in media analyses it tends to be taken for granted and left unpacked analytically, so the contribution of this article is to point out how such an unpacking can be done, and why it might be fruitful to do so. From a poststructuralist position informed by discourse theory and ANT, this article rests on the assumption that such external forces do not exist, and that “wider contexts” cannot be invoked to explain actual choices, alliances and practices in media work. The empirical material presented here does not, in itself, prove this ontological claim, but illustrates the kind of attention to concrete practices and performativity that a rejection of underlying structures or mechanisms leads to. In this section, I will offer a few examples of how the media logic has been conceived of in studies of media practices and products, and then suggest how a theoretical framework informed by discourse theory and ANT offers another take on such “logics” or “mechanisms’.</p>
<sec id="section4-0963662510385309">
<title>A dominating logic</title>
<p>The concept of media logic has different meanings and performs different explanatory functions in media studies texts. It may refer to the routine workings of a media machinery that processes all kinds of information according to a set of implicit and explicit rules. Often, these rules are depicted as overruling other “logics.” Hence in this version, the media logic is seen as a dominating force in society – or as an element in the trend towards the mediatization of society. Altheide and Snow’s early work on this topic has informed a large body of media theory that understands the media logic as dominant in various spheres. Altheide and Snow originally asserted that the mass media:
<disp-quote>
<p>have risen to a dominant position in the institutional network of society primarily because various institutions follow a media logic in the definition and solution of problems … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662510385309">Altheide and Snow, 1979</xref>: 236)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In line with this, a recent historical account of changing source relations draws on the concept of the media logic to account for the increasing power of journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662510385309">Albæk, 2007</xref>: 5). It is argued that “a political logic” has been replaced by “a media logic” whereby the requirements of the media have taken center stage and shaped the means by which political communication is played out. Control over news has shifted from the hands of newsmakers to the hands of journalists. Also in his later work, Altheide has portrayed the media logic as a general rationale that has come to govern various areas:
<disp-quote>
<p>Media culture is produced by the widespread application of media logic. Specifically, when media logic is employed to present and interpret institutional phenomena, the form and content of those institutions are altered. Studies document how sports, religion, news, and politics have changed to accommodate this logic. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662510385309">Altheide, 2004</xref>: 294)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within the field of science communication, this understanding of media logic seems to be taken for granted. For instance, it is mentioned casually, as an explanation for the media treatment of the human genome project. Because the human genome project can be seen as “meeting the media logic” in various ways, it got intensive media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662510385309">Rodder, 2009</xref>). In another study, it is used as a hypothesis (which is confirmed through the study). The author poses the question:
<disp-quote>
<p>have the narratives and knowledge of journalists taken over from those of scientists and experts in medical television programs, because of increasing media logic? The study started out from the mediazation hypothesis, which states that the narratives and knowledge of journalists have become more present in the media over the years than those of scientists and experts. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662510385309">Verhoeven, 2008</xref>: 464)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In such accounts, media logic is presented as an overarching framework that governs how a number of domains operate to comply with journalists’ practices of selecting and presenting media content. The media logic has also been portrayed as being in competition with other logics, such as “the gender logic” and “the war logic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662510385309">Klaus and Kassel, 2005</xref>). Here it is stressed how media logic makes a difference in relation to news content and the shaping of statements along with other logics, but in this work, too, there seems to be little interest in who enacts it and where decisions are taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0963662510385309">
<title>Governing choices in particular ways</title>
<p>Some scholars are a bit more articulate with regards to what media logic consists of. In some accounts it is linked to the elements commonly recognized to provide news value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662510385309">Harcup and O’Neill, 2001</xref>). In such cases, it may be portrayed as the inevitable result of increased media competition and as likely to result in an ever-decreasing quality of journalism:
<disp-quote>
<p>expressions of the media logic are certain storytelling techniques such as simplification, personification, polarization, intensification, concretion, stereotyping and enhancement. In a time marked by a surplus of information and a deficit of attention, there has been increasing competition among the different news media for people’s attention. One result is that the news media has come to adopt the media logic to a larger extent than before. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662510385309">Nord and Stromback, 2006</xref>: 94)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The concept may also refer to the special characteristics of a particular medium. In that case, it addresses the question of the constraining and enabling features of particular media technologies or media formats. Dahlgren has offered a definition of media logic in this sense, arguing that it points to:
<disp-quote>
<p>the particular institutionally structured features of a medium, the ensemble of technical and organizational attributes which impact on what gets represented in the medium and how it gets done. In other words, media logic points to specific forms and processes which organize the work done within a particular medium. Yet, media logic also indicates the cultural competence and frames of perception of audiences/users, which in turn reinforces how production within the medium takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662510385309">Dahlgren, 1996</xref>: 63, with reference to Altheide and Snow)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this wording, it is left as an empirical question what media logic is or does, but it is still “institutionally structured,” and it “organizes” media work in specific ways – hence it is not dependent on particular situations or actors. It is in also this sense that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662510385309">Deuze and Dimoudi (2002</xref>: 88) talk about “the media logic of the internet.” This is defined as a converging logic, affecting all existing media modalities with online presence and forcing them to adjust their existing production patterns to the internet. Another angle on the media logic in relation to new media is provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662510385309">Kluver (2002)</xref>, who argues that to unpack the idea of media logic, we might think of it as divided into three distinct types: the narrative logic, the database logic and the conversation logic. He wants to show how the database logic dominates new media formats, and speculate about the possible impact of this on international relations.</p>
<p>Often, “media logic” is referred to more loosely, for example as an explanation of source relationships or as an explanation of the transformation that statements or texts undergo in the course of media production processes. Or, it may be used casually to put forward arguments about other issues. For instance that the transnational character of climate change cannot be captured by media dominated by “the media logic of banal nationalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662510385309">Olausson, 2009</xref>: 422).</p>
<p>To sum up the above, there is a general tendency – in studies of media practices and content – to portray media logic as an actually existing force, and using this – often vague phenomenon – to explain relations, choices, changes or content in media production. In a sense, it acquires a phantom-like existence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0963662510385309">
<title>Towards an empirically grounded account of “the media logic’</title>
<p>The tendency to portray the media logic as an external, governing force or an explanation of phenomena implies that little attention is given to how it is constructed in and constitutive of concrete practices. In this way, discursive reproductions of the concept contribute to an image of the media as a huge machinery of abstract forces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662510385309">Couldry (2008a</xref>: 378) has characterized this as a general tendency within media studies, and has suggested that ANT offers a “demystifying approach” to the study of media practices and institutions. He proposes that to disturb common conceptions of media institutions and mediation as mystical or “natural” phenomena, we might conceive of them as constructed “technological–social hybrids.” Arguing from another theoretical position, namely that of Bourdieu’s field theory, Couldry has voiced a critique against claims about the media logic as one single type of logic that supersedes older logics across the whole of social space. In this connection he has argued that mediation is influenced by heterogeneous factors in ways that cannot be reduced to a single media logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662510385309">Couldry, 2008b</xref>). I share the idea that a major contribution of ANT to media studies is the encouragement to reject general statements about the media and espouse an analytical interest in the minute details of concrete practices. This means that rather than conceiving of “the media” as a sphere or social order governed by certain rules or regularities, we attempt to study the processes of assembling the heterogeneous elements that come together in relation to the production of specific media products. The purpose of doing this is to be able to grasp the complexities of, for instance, researcher/journalist relations and practices, rather than conceiving of them as conditioned by all-encompassing logics. At the same time, ANT has no ambition to <italic>deconstruct</italic> concepts that are central to actors’ practice or understandings. Rather, a central methodological point is to use interviewees’ contributions as a foundation for the analysis, and take them very seriously. Hence, media logic being <italic>a construction</italic> does not imply that it is not real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662510385309">Latour, 2005</xref>: 91). Well-known and widely agreed-upon entities such as media logic are constantly referred to by actors, and thus gain significance as entities that make a difference in practice. To steer between reifying and deconstructing an entity such as media logic, I shall maintain a focus on how it is performed or enacted by assigning it the analytical status of a discursive figure or an actant.</p>
<p>When talking about the media logic as a discursive figure, I am informed by a discourse theoretical perspective on language as performative. I am concerned with how we collectively reproduce discursive patterns, and with how discourses are constitutive of relationships, identities and ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662510385309">Laclau and Mouffe, 1985</xref>). From such a perspective on language, notions such as media logic is not a neutral description of a phenomenon, but carries assumptions and produces particular understandings about, e.g., how journalists work, what media organizations are governed by and what we should expect of media products. Discourse analysts have been accused of assuming that “everything is just a social construction” – and by this, critics have suggested that discourse analyses avoid saying anything about “real” phenomena or “reality.” My take on this is that the media logic is not merely a <italic>social construction</italic>. Rather, it is a collectively established <italic>construction</italic>, which we can research empirically by looking at how it makes a difference in practice, and which need not be reduced to an intangible social phenomenon. Although it is a discursive figure, it is certainly “real,” and has effects in a “real” set of practices. This approach is derived from ANT’s suggestion that we should pay analytical attention to any agent that – in particular situations – makes a difference in relation to other actors, no matter the character of the entity (human, non-human, symbolic, technical, etc). In so far as a particular entity becomes constructed as a significant part of practice, we will not conceive of it as a “social construction,” but as an actant. The concept of the actant is derived from Greimas’s model for literary analysis. In this model, positions can be filled out by any kind of actors or objects – the important thing is their relations to one another, and the agencies each element is endowed with. Analytically, neither elements nor positions are given in advance. This implies that abstract phenomena are not left out of the analysis on the grounds that they do not explain actions theoretically. Rather, they may enter the analyses if they are part of actors’ accounts of their practices and relations. They become significant as they are linked to a myriad of other entities.</p>
<p>In the following two sections, I will focus on two aspects of the media logic as it emerged in my empirical material. I will give examples of how it can become an element in professional identity constructions, and of how articulations of it make a difference in particular media production processes. Coding my material, my analytical strategy has been to include both instances where media logic is directly referred to and articulations that express the idea of an abstract force governing media production, making certain actions objectively necessary. This is because such articulations contribute to furthering the naturalization of the discourse of a media logic.</p>

<title>3. Media Logic as an element in identity constructions</title>
<sec id="section8-0963662510385309">
<title>A necessary divide between journalists and researchers</title>
<p>In my case studies, journalists are not only positioned by others as representatives of the media machinery and its media logic, but also position themselves as defenders of this media logic that people supposedly have to play along with if they want media coverage. In one of the cases of my study, I analyze the production of a radio debate on brain research. Here, an experienced journalist succeeds both in putting together participants and statements according to his definition of the logic of the media, and in convincing the producer (who has an academic background, and no experience with radio production) that the legitimate position is that of being faithful to the logic of the medium:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some things work, and some things do not work when you produce radio. That’s how it is. Those are the conditions of this type of medium, and you need to take that into consideration. Then you may discuss how much you need to be a slave to it, and how much you can accommodate a researcher who wants to add nuances.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963662510385309">2</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In my interview with the producer regarding the production process, she describes how she came to adopt a set of principles that had been foreign to her. She describes how she was inspired by the journalist’s views, for instance proposing that in relation to the communication of research, the media’s emphasis on conflict is good. Debaters should not agree, because arguments result in great radio sound. She also emphasizes how the journalist had served as an inspiration with his emphasis on the importance of predefined premises, clarity and clear-cut positions. Working on the production of the radio program, she came to identify with these elements to such a degree that researchers came to conceive of <italic>her</italic> as a “typical journalist,” disrespectful of complex knowledge. And although she positions herself as “part of two worlds at the same time,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963662510385309">3</xref></sup> she tends to align herself with the principles put forward by the experienced journalist:
<disp-quote>
<p>you know, [the researcher] sighed when I posed stupid questions. He wanted to include ALL the details, and I said you cannot include all details, you have 20 minutes to explain these five things. But he could not live with this kind of science communication.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963662510385309">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this case, both journalist and producer contribute to the discursive establishment of a set of elements that pertain to the media logic, and construct it as a necessity to respect these elements (of conflict, clarity, and so forth). Doing this, they also set up an outside position, namely that of the researcher who is unable to identify with their position. The position of the reluctant researcher, trying to avoid being enrolled in the media machinery, is widespread. Often, people describe it in quite categorical terms, as does a communication officer who has been asked to reflect upon the theme of science communication:
<disp-quote>
<p>But why are some researchers still reluctant about getting media coverage? … Time is an important parameter. But so is the evolution of the media. Stories are more narrowly focused and journalists need an expert who can legitimize their angle. Many researchers have the experience of being used.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963662510385309">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also, researchers take up the recognizable position of opposing journalists’ demands to comply with a media logic. One researcher talks about a fundamental opposition between researchers and journalists who are guided by a specific kind of thinking in terms of dualist structures:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is an opposition between the ways in which you communicate within journalism, and the ways in which you want to communicate certain kinds of research … because – as I have experienced journalists – they need some clear statements, they work a lot with oppositions, black/white, new/old knowledge, dramas, heroes/villains, etc. And if they can draw out these oppositions and create a story … they always talk about stories … they want to create stories out of everything. That makes them happy. And maybe your research results cannot be written into a dramatic story constructed around dualist structures. And if you want to work with complexities … and insist that the world cannot be understood as a singular phenomenon and in terms of dualistic oppositions, then you are in opposition to journalists, who have a criterion for success, which is to communicate in a simple language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963662510385309">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a journalist’s account of her experiences with this particular researcher, we see evidence of the effects it has when the researcher adjusts her language according to her image of what the media logic demands:
<disp-quote>
<p>because she tries to translate her own language she goes “in your journalist language, I guess you would say”… and then she tries to speak plain Danish. And she does not quite succeed – she still speaks researcher-Danish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963662510385309">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The attempt to adjust to an assumed media logic annoys the journalist. Recently, she has experienced an increase in researchers who demonstrate how savvy they have become in relation to the media by asking her “so what is your take on this?” She ascribes this to the media training courses they are sent to as part of the universities’ increasing concern with science communication, and finds it boring that researchers act mechanically on this basis. The expectations of journalists being governed by media logic have concrete implications for how she is met in her daily work.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0963662510385309">
<title>Compliant researchers</title>
<p>In line with this, some researchers readily offer their acknowledgement of the fact that journalists “have no time for all the lines of argumentation researchers often need to go through to arrive at some poor conclusion,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963662510385309">8</xref></sup> and that researchers need to be clear, get to the point, and refrain from coming up with reservations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963662510385309">9</xref></sup> They agree that the media’s own logic implies that researchers must be ready to provide one-liners and act as experience-based sources. This again means that some of the researchers in this case study do not position themselves as critics of the rule of media logic, even when they experience incorrect treatment of their statements in the media. Rather than attributing blame to journalists or “the logic of the media,” these researchers simply see journalists as doing their job in specific ways, because they need to sell papers. Researchers also articulate recognition of the ways in which the professionalism of big newspapers leads to a routine application of a trisection of experts/interest groups/conflict. The need for different kinds of sources to comment upon facts is constructed as a routine operation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0963662510385309">10</xref></sup> an image that is congruent with that of the media machinery. As mentioned above, journalists experience this respect for the media’s demands, for instance when researchers ask “what is your angle on this?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0963662510385309">11</xref></sup> Such statements indicate that researchers take for granted that journalists have a particular way of selecting statements when they cover science stories – but as this section has shown, this is not always used to position journalists as enemies of detail, complexity and abstraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0963662510385309">
<title>Strategic positioning and bracketing</title>
<p>Now, researchers have other ways of positioning themselves in relation to media logic than being aware of it and hostile towards it or aware of it and compliant with it. They may also act strategically in relation to it. As one communication officer expresses it, once researchers understand the logic of the media, they can render themselves accessible to the public:
<disp-quote>
<p>I always say that the stories that are brought up in the newspapers, they come from somewhere, and this is what you have to understand. If you want to appear in the newspaper, you have to understand those processes … Also the criteria, the three criteria of journalism, timeliness, prominence and identification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0963662510385309">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of my case studies treats the relationship between an editor and a researcher who often contributes to her paper. According to the editor, the researcher is able to get his articles printed with almost no editing because he “always delivers something perfectly nice and complete”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0963662510385309">13</xref></sup> The researcher has taken classes at a journalism school, prefers simple writing over “obscure language,” and finds it easy to interact with media professionals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0963662510385309">14</xref></sup> Some media scholars would take this as an indication of the media dominating the relation between social scientists and media actors. They hold that to get media attention, researchers have to frame science (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662510385309">Arnoldi, 2006</xref>: 63) so that it fits the media logic, or observe the rules of media staging in a public sphere dominated by the mass media by mimicking journalistic discursive strategies. As Fenton et al. write:
<disp-quote>
<p>Those social scientists who want to function in a public sphere dominated by the mass media must, for the most part, observe the rules of media staging. In this manner social scientific discourse filters into lay discourse to the extent that it has become popularised by social scientists who have learnt to mimic journalistic discursive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662510385309">Fenton et al., 1997</xref>: 20)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Contrary to this, I would argue that the construction of media logic is a joint accomplishment, and that researchers can relate to it in numerous ways. They can also bracket it or play with it. For instance, one researcher finds himself in the middle of a controversy played out in the media, but completely avoids attributing any blame to the critical, investigative journalist or “media logic.” In his account, the controversy is not a result of a clash between the language or logic of research versus the language or logic of journalism, but is part of an academic methodological discussion. Another researcher often manages to contribute with very complex ideas and concepts in the media, and (with the agreement of journalists) thus totally ignores the workings of “media logic.” At the same time, he sometimes feels obliged to occupy the expert position in a journalist’s news stories, e.g. when it would be difficult to find other experts with the same kind of research-based insight into specific problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0963662510385309">15</xref></sup> In such situations, he acknowledges this “routine operation of the media machinery.” When the researcher explicitly talks about the need to adjust his performance according to “a media logic,” this seems to contradict the argument that he manages to contribute with very complex stories and language use in the media. But this is only the case if we expect researchers to ascribe to stable positions and practices as either media darlings or high-flying abstract thinkers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0963662510385309">
<title>The discursive work of the media logic</title>
<p>On the basis of the above, I would argue that a lot of work goes into establishing the understanding of media logic as an element in the definition of pure professional categories – as for instance when researchers or journalists express understanding of how “the other” is different from themselves. However, it is also sometimes used as a basis for tearing down distinctions between journalists and researchers, both through their engagement with one another in practice and explicitly expressed:
<disp-quote>
<p>That fundamental anxiety … “them and us,” and “it’s a totally different world, I don’t understand the media logic at all,” and that kind of stuff, I would say that has been broken down over the last 3–4 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0963662510385309">16</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whether media logic is used as an element in professional positioning, as a matter of fact, or as a contested object, actors involved in the communication of science via the mass media still contribute to articulating it as an actually existing force, and as a consequence, it becomes performative. In the above, I have touched upon how media logic may become an element in identity work in concrete practices and negotiations. At another level, I will argue that its recurrent articulation ties in with widely circulating discursive constructions of how research must be rendered useful to society, and how mass mediation is instrumental in relation to making science visible and understandable. In a piece on the medialization of science, Peters et al. note that a general adoption of a media logic can be read off from “the high value accorded, both within organizations and among individual scientists, to science-related media communication” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662510385309">Peters et al., 2008</xref>: 88), and linked to the attempts to establish science as legitimate through the assertion of its socio-political relevance. The point is, if research is to be rendered useful and accessible, this is furthered by compliance to what is constructed as the logic of the media. And, by extension, if researchers strive to construct their positions as legitimate, this may be achieved partly through their articulation (and strategic use) of media logic.</p>

<title>4. Media logic as an actant in a concrete assemblage</title>
<p>Leaving the question of how researchers, journalists and others position themselves and each other in relation to media logic, I will give an example of how the concept is interwoven with other entities in concrete assemblages, and has concrete consequences for practice. I will return to the case of the production of the radio program briefly mentioned above, and I will show that media logic not only functioned as something to position oneself in relation to, but also served as an actant, making a difference for the configuration of elements that went into creating this radio program. The configuration of people, pre-recorded elements, brain research, anecdotes, and so on, was held together with some difficulties, because very diverse interests had to be aligned to make the radio program work according to its predefined premise.</p>
<p>As indicated above, professional journalists were called upon to guide an inexperienced producer who was to produce 4 hours of radio dealing with developments within brain research. The producer (Cecilie) had an academic background, and her lack of experience with radio meant that the journalists’ understanding of the right way to do radio became the rule of the game through their articulation of do’s and don’ts in relation to this particular medium. Recalling how the journalist (Simon) stated that “some things work, and some things do not work when you produce radio,” it can be argued that the co-produced idea of a media logic of broadcasting came to function as an actant governing how the production process unfolded. With broadcast journalists’ training and experience in radio journalism as well as continual collegial feedback, it is no wonder that they operate according to a well-established ideal of how radio should be produced. I conceive of their collectively articulated ideals as actants because they have consequences for a range of choices in their work lives. Understood in this way, ideals are not vague, flimsy ideas floating in the air, but discursive constructions with traceable effects. As noted above, ideals count as analytical entities when they are articulated by actors. This understanding is in opposition to some media sociologists’ take on intangible entities. For instance, a “news sense” is similarly understood as guiding journalists’ work, but it has been described as “a specifically journalistic cultural air tied to the occupational practices of journalism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662510385309">Schudson, 1996</xref>: 153–5), and tends to remain unpacked analytically, just like I argued was the case for the concept of media logic. In the analysis of the production of the radio program, the negotiations about what constitutes a proper radio program became visible because they were spelled out in the mentoring process of Cecilie, the inexperienced radio producer. From the interviews with both Simon and Cecilie, it appeared that she quickly became aligned in a common enactment of broadcast professionalism in conjunction with the vocational journalists. This enrolment happened through the evolving formulation of common ideals. For instance, it appears from her account that the producer’s thoughts about “the good radio debate” came out of discussions throughout the production process. In the interview, she tells – in a categorical manner – how debaters should not agree too much:
<disp-quote>
<p>because Carsten and I had never produced radio before, they hooked us up, extraordinarily, with an experienced journalist. You know, one we could evaluate with and ask questions. One who joined the editorial meetings. And then there was Simon, who was to be the host. He works in the debate section, he is really good at formulating a debate, at formulating questions for a debate, you know, what kind of guests should you invite? It’s no good to match two people who almost agree. That does not result in a debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0963662510385309">17</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When I as an interviewer do not comment on this, she goes on to explain that the notion of “a good debate” did not appear out of the blue, but was the result of negotiations, i.e. the attempt to reach agreement about a definition in the course of the production of the program:
<disp-quote>
<p>We also talked about … media products … what is a good debate? When is it good? Is it good because they fight or is it good because they agree in the end? Is it good when new things come up that you had not prepared for? I had no experience with those kinds of things.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0963662510385309">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seems from Cecilie’s account that the experienced journalist had succeeded in introducing and emphasizing the news criterion of “conflict” and giving it a specific form (i.e. the debate) in the co-constructed media text. We may consider the concept of “conflict” an actant because it plays a part in how media productions are constructed, and it becomes an element in the definition of the media logic. Conflict is also constructed as an important dimension in the journalist’s account, when he talks about fights as great radio, as he reports on the unfolding of the debate:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now, being totally unsentimental, you may say it makes great radio when someone gets angry. Eh, it is not the goal at all, and she felt bad afterwards, so that part of it was not so great. But in principle, it is okay that people provoke one another. And most experienced debaters get REALLY angry, and then when they walk out they go “Hey that was a pretty cool debate,” and then they have a coffee and a talk. They know it is a game. And I think that is the beauty of it, you are allowed to disagree. That is what makes it fun to live in a democracy … it is good to shed some heart-blood, and still show respect towards one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0963662510385309">19</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We may interpret a statement such as “it makes great radio” as a reference to the logic of the radio medium – it is taken for granted that this medium has a particular way of functioning, and that journalists have to act according to this logic. For the radio debate in question, this meant that questions were designed to emphasize conflict and probes led participants back to conflicts whenever they approached an agreement. From the analysis of the documents that served as background material for the broadcast, I would argue that they displayed many more points of agreement between the debaters, but this complexity was omitted through the production process. The necessity of this had also become clear to the producer. Although she has no background as a journalist, she has become capable of talking about the principles of radio dramaturgy: “when you talk about radio dramaturgy, you have to remember that you should not have too many voices to relate to.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0963662510385309">20</xref></sup> This principle not only informed the host’s way of posing questions, but also her selection of elements such as interviews, reports and facts to include in the program.</p>

<title>5. Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, I have argued that we need not conceive of media logic as an invisible force or mechanism governing media production. Instead, we may approach it analytically as an entity that is discursively constructed, and that has different kinds of effects on identities, relations and concrete media texts – depending on the collective it becomes part of in specific situations. In processes of mass mediating research, journalists, editors and researchers articulate and negotiate this entity as something actors have to relate to in particular ways. Throughout the empirical material of my study, it was remarkable how the empty signifier of “media logic” was constantly filled out with different meanings. Some researchers positioned themselves in opposition to the media logic, and as belonging to a domain governed by other logics than that of the media machinery. In other situations, it was used as a marker of prestige if a researcher was capable of understanding – and accepting – what media logic demands. Conversely, researchers depreciatingly accused colleagues of not understanding or not behaving in accordance with the demands of the media. All this positioning work not only drew on, but also reproduced the concept and its various articulations.</p>
<p>I have described how, in a particular media production process, different articulations of media logic had concrete consequences for the choices of interview questions, the debate format, participants, focus, and so on. The strength of media logic as an actant came from numerous reiterations of the demand of a particular media format: radio broadcasting demands clarity, conflict, simplicity, and so on. Journalists’ talk about how “we normally do” – i.e. what media logic demands – in mass mediation processes can be seen as performative, i.e. as an actant ensuring that this really is how things will be done in the future as well.</p>
<p>I believe that such types of empirical insights regarding articulations of media logic in practice not only adds critical reflections to media studies’ or science communication studies’ more or less casual analytical application of the concept. They may also be worthwhile considering for people involved in the mass mediation of social science as part of their work lives. These people might benefit from questioning how discursive figures work as actants in their daily practice of assembling media texts, and from seeing how professional categories are not fixed, but constructed through continuous positioning work around contingent categories and concepts.</p>
<p>The analytical inspiration from ANT led me to question media logic as a governing force, and to analyze it as “an agent that makes a difference in the course of another agent’s action.” The principle of including all such elements in an analysis means that abstract phenomena are not left out of the analysis on the grounds that they do not explain action theoretically, but enter the analyses if they are part of actors’ accounts of their practices and relations. In that way, we can observe them as significant because they are linked to a myriad of other entities, and do not serve as part of the observer’s causal explanations. This implies that the contribution of interviewees is treated as valid contributions to understanding their practice. In my analyses, I make use of the reflexivity of interviewees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662510385309">Lynch, 2000</xref>), who analyzed their own media performances, their compliance with media logic, their relationships and their situation, and explicitly positioned themselves as particular types of actors. My analytical approach has been to take these contributions seriously and see them as performative, rather than looking at them as instances of “false consciousness.” This treatment of interviewees’ accounts of their work practices and relations is in line with cultural studies interpretations of scientists’ accounts:
<disp-quote>
<p>That we can deconstruct the categories that scientists use to describe themselves, possibly even prove these to be erroneous constructions, is not the point here. We need to be able to understand scientists from their own perspective, and to do that we need to examine the values they ascribe to their activities, the source of these values, and the relationship that scientists have to others involved in similar enterprises. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662510385309">Erickson, 2005</xref>: 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To sum up, my interviewees demonstrated through their accounts of their practices how the idea of “media logic” is linked to a range of editorial choices, statements of researchers, and to the positioning of actors as legitimate or illegitimate. “Media logic,” in my analyses, is then not an actually existing force that explains actions, but a co-constructed entity woven into a web of relations to other actors. I believe that the analytical framework introduced above is particularly suited to capturing this complexity of relations and positions because it does not resort to generalizing explanations and it does not suggest that universal mechanisms produce general patterns to be discovered.</p>
