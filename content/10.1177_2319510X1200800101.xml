<p>Business world today is getting increasingly complex, diverse, hypercompetitive and sometimes, in the worst scenario, even invincible. Blue ocean strategy, based on technology-driven innovations and rarely practised by the frontline market players, is throwing open new challenges to the traditional competitors. Innovation, as it is widely known and acknowledged, is the creation of better or more effective products, processes, services, technologies or ideas that are accepted by markets, governments and the society at large. Some innovations are evolutionary and bring about incremental improvements—sometimes even transformational improvements—in productivity, quality, competitive positioning and improving market share. Other innovations impact—if rarely so—an entire industry and business ecosystem with the disastrous potential of dislodging well-managed and successful companies, who are leaders in their markets. But such trends, by no means, are a welcome proposition to the corporate world.</p>
<p>The last few years have witnessed some of the most unprecedented and challenging economic turmoil in the modern business world history. Today, despite the dwindling economic slowdown, businesses are starting to regain their apparently lost territory, taking in their stride the continued growth perspective with profitable revenues. Today’s cut-throat competitive environment requires new levels of innovation performance to drive growth rhythm: whether generic, profitable or partnered with shared vision. Companies should, therefore, not necessarily as a matter of choice, consider transitioning the existing innovation efforts from command-and-control based centrally situated approaches to a more rationally driven, diffuse and diverse one, preferably based on a firmed up social commitment to all stakeholders, if they wish to ensure that they can manage innovation at scale with balanced, harmonious and sustained growth.</p>
<p>Taking cognizance of the potential of business innovations as a critical success factor of the corporate world, the current issue of the <italic>Asia-Pacific Journal of Management Research and Innovation</italic> (APJMRI) incorporates eight selected research articles contributed by eminent researchers from different parts of the world in the fields of management. The first article contributed by Nikolaou et al. examines the implications of turning a voluntary management instrument such as Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) into a compulsory one. According to the authors, EMSs are voluntary operational management tools that can help firms to both reduce their impact on the natural environment and gain financial benefits as well (win-win strategy). The article particularly aims to examine the similarities and differences in the voluntary versus mandatory implementation of EMS, as demonstrated by conducting a case study in Greece by the authors in Germany.</p>
<p>The application of Economic Value Addition (EVA) model for measuring corporate performance becomes important because the management has to quantify the wealth created for the shareholders who have taken the risk of investing his/her hard-earned savings in the equity. The decentralisation of authority and responsibility are prerequisites for successful implementation of EVA model. Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) has successfully implemented EVA model and adopts the performance linked variables incentive scheme which is based on EVA—according to the recent study made by Gopu in Sultanate of Oman.</p>
<p>The article contributed by Xiaowen Tian et al. adopts a strategic management approach to address the issue of how to achieve both corporate profitability and corporate social responsibility in dealing with <italic>Guanxi</italic> in the Chinese business context. The approaches used in the study encompass environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implementation and strategy evaluation control which, according to the authors, should be the key components of strategic management of <italic>Guanxi</italic>. The article proposes a practical framework for managing <italic>Guanxi</italic> strategically in the emerging China market and illustrates the framework with cases in the real world.</p>
<p>Green Marketing is a new and evolving concept of marketing green and eco-products with well-defined eco-standards consisting of wide-ranging eco-friendly products, satisfying eco-labelling and eco-foot-printing standard norms. The article contributed by Sarkar focuses on the significance of green branding and eco-labelling, with stress on eco-innovations, for developing a sound and sustainable green marketing strategy. The article, inter alia, also covers the aspects of sustainability factor and eco-innovations which can help promote green consumerism.</p>
<p>Mehla and Goyal conducted an empirical study to examine the validity of weak form of efficient market hypothesis in two most popular indices of Indian stock market. Their results suggest that the Indian stock market does not show the characteristics of random walk and as such are not efficient in the weak form in daily and weekly returns meaning thereby that the investors can avail excess returns by predicting the future returns as all return series present an opportunity to investors to gain from the pattern.</p>
<p>Small and medium enterprises occupy a position of strategic importance in Indian economy by contributing 8 per cent to country’s GDP, 45 per cent to total industrial production and 40 per cent to the exports of the country. Commercial banks have been found as main source of finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The article contributed by Bhalla and Kaur analyses specifically the attitudinal aspects as well as decision-making criteria of commercial banks while extending credit to SMEs.</p>
<p>Business establishments currently are critically analysing the stress management disputes that contribute to lower job performance of employees, originating from dissatisfaction and high turnover ultimately affecting organisational goals and objectives. In life insurance business, in particular, the employees involved in the selling of life insurance policies are vulnerable to several workplace-related stresses due to varied reasons. Radhakrishnan and Jins Joy. conducted a study to see if gender difference, arising out of various sources of stress factors, could be tested to draw inferences. The study concluded that similarity exists between male and female employees in terms of responses to various stress-related factors in an insurance company under study.</p>
<p>We would like to express our sincere thanks and deep sense of gratitude to the contributors of the articles included in the Inaugural Issue of APJMRI, jointly brought out by the Asia-Pacific Institute of Management and SAGE Publications India Pvt. Ltd. We sincerely hope that our readers will find this issue of the Journal APJMRI quite absorbing and interesting.
