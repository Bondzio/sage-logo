<p>The rights of indigenous peoples have been at the forefront of human rights debates in recent decades. In the framework of the United Nations system, increased awareness of the need to address the rights of indigenous peoples is evidenced by the creation of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982 and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2000 and the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. The attempt to remedy the abuse, racism, and poverty experienced by indigenous peoples throughout the Americas is not a simple task and is long overdue. Despite the renewed interest in the protection and promotion of indigenous rights around the globe, indigenous populations continue to experience political, social, cultural, and economic oppression. However, as James C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492130">Scott (1990</xref>: 45) writes, “relations of domination are, at the same time, relations of resistance.” Thus, dominated indigenous populations resist their oppression. Because of the enormous diversity of indigenous peoples across Latin America, it is safe to say that the relationships between dominant and subordinate actors, between different subordinate groups, and within subordinate groups are multiple and varied.</p>
<p>The books reviewed here reflect the ongoing process by which indigenous populations in Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil appropriate and use global human rights discourse toward their own ends. After centuries of being pushed to the margins of society, indigenous actors are making rights-based claims through the international framework of universal human rights and deploying them at a local level. Each book adds to the growing field of study of indigenous rights and resistance, providing new theory (Gledhill and Schell), an assessment of rights use in the Maya region (Pitarch, Speed, and Leyva Solano), an examination of the use of rights language at the community level (Moksnes), and a detailed account of one indigenous woman’s struggle (Eber and “Antonia”).</p>
<p>Funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, <italic>New Approaches to Resistance in Brazil and Mexico</italic> collects 15 essays that emerged from seminars held in Brazil, Mexico, and the United Kingdom in 2007–2008. The essays, by historians and anthropologists, are divided into three parts: one on historical studies from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, one on religious institutions and movements, and one on contemporary ethnographic studies. As the title suggests, the contributors use case studies to think about resistance in new ways.</p>
<p>John Gledhill points out that, while resistance studies were immensely popular among academics in the 1980s, they became the target of many critiques in the following decade. One such critic, Sherry Ortner, “remained sympathetic to the idea that resistance studies possessed a worthwhile object of analysis but called for that analysis to become more theoretically nuanced” (1). Another, Robert Fletcher, was cautiously optimistic about the future of resistance studies, stating that “rethinking could resurrect a troubled but significant field of research” because resistance studies were effectively “concerned with the struggle for equality, the fight to end exploitation and achieve a more just and humane society” (1). The essays in this volume do offer new perspectives on resistance, although much of the discussion builds on previous work in the field such as Scott’s <italic>Domination and the Art of Resistance</italic> (1990). The contributors’ critiques revive a dialogue that reveals both enthusiasms and reservations about the study of resistance. The result is a highly nuanced volume that draws out the limitations and the usefulness of resistance theory for understanding how and why people struggle.</p>
<p>An important issue raised is that the complexity of resisting groups has been overlooked. Chapters in Parts 1 and 3 dismantle “essentialist assumptions” of a dominant-subordinate dichotomy and point to much more complex relationships that exist both within and between subaltern groups. Margarita Zárate’s essay about the independent rural Unión de Comuneros Emiliano Zapata (Emiliano Zapata Union of Communal Landholders—UCEZ) calls attention to the organization’s own understandings and uses of history, revealing tensions within three socially diverse communities that have a UCEZ presence. These tensions arise from the fact that “the past has been used as a resource in diverse ways, through selective construction that resonates with contemporary concerns” (217). The UCEZ was formed in the 1970s and anticipated the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (Zapatista Army of National Liberation—EZLN) uprising in 1994, both organizations reidentifying with their indigenous pasts. Although the UCEZ “took part in some of the meetings to support this new Zapatista movement” (219), it remains difficult to point to its motivations for organizing almost five years earlier.</p>
<p>Another question raised here is why some groups do not resist, particularly when outside observers believe that they should. Juan Pedro Viqueira’s chapter on the Cancuc Rebellion of 1712 reveals this uprising’s “enormous diversity of plans, designs, and actions” (63). When the Virgin appeared to María de la Candelaria, instructing her to build a chapel, the Spanish understood it as a challenge to their authority and ordered the chapel destroyed. A rebellion followed, but indigenous participation varied with social status and allegiances. The distinction between “Indians who in one way or another opposed the rebellion of 1712, who disagreed with the means used by its leaders, or who, in retrospect, declared themselves opposed to the uprising in order to gain favor with the Spanish” (78) shows the complexity of social relations within this small community. For the indigenous <italic>alcaldes</italic> (governors) who worked closely with the Spanish and owed their positions and communal status to their authority, “the uprising was not the inevitable consequence of objective conditions of oppression, but of a choice based on the interpretation of the situation at the time” (64).</p>
<p>At first the book may seem limited, covering only two countries, but the chapters have both breadth and depth, drawing from wide-ranging examples of resistance by indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants, and religious groups from the sixteenth century to the present. <italic>New Approaches</italic> shows the complexity of the relations between dominant and subordinate groups, between subordinate groups that resist, and even within subordinate groups themselves, but this complexity and the dependence on previous scholarship sometimes make it difficult to follow the discussion. For example, in the introduction Gledhill writes: “Moore draws on William Roseberry’s critique of Scott’s interpretation of Gramscian hegemony” (11), and in the previous sentence three more names are mentioned, including Foucault’s. Alan Knight’s conclusion attempts to clear up a number of concepts found throughout the book. He begins by explaining the difficulty of defining the term “resistance,” to which he refers as “a protean concept.” The versatility of the term and its ever-changing meanings seem to him to make it “unavoidable that we break it down into categories or subtypes” (329). His concluding remarks, full of definitions and numbered lists, fall short of providing clarity. Further, of the six essays in Part 3 four are devoted to Mexico and only two to Brazil. Scholars looking for a study on the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra (Landless Workers’ Movement—MST), perhaps one of the largest social movements in the Americas, will not find one here, most likely because Brazil receives less attention in this final section. In the end, however, this book is a welcome addition to the field and will be of interest to anyone studying revolutions, rebellions, and social movements in Latin America.</p>
<p>In the introduction to <italic>Human Rights in the Maya Region</italic>, Shannon Speed and Xóchitl Leyva Solano argue that “human rights discourse has dramatically replaced other potential discourses of resistance for indigenous peoples.” They point out, however, that not all the indigenous peoples examined in the collection find human rights discourse useful because some groups “render it incomprehensible or unworkable within a particular cultural worldview” (11). The collection demonstrates the highly complex ways in which Maya communities in Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, use human rights discourse to reach their goals. Speed and Leyva Solano’s concise introduction gives readers a framework in which to understand the issues faced by diverse Maya communities.</p>
<p>The collection begins with the essay “Cultural Rights and Human Rights,” by Rodolfo Stavenhagen, a respected scholar in the field of indigenous rights. Stavenhagen served as the first United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples from 2001 to 2008. Utilizing his expertise, he draws out the points of contention between Western and non-Western ideals (40):<disp-quote>
<p>Human rights policies are not entirely neutral because they are the result of the values shared by the majority or dominant culture in any given society at any one time. The fact that they are dominant does not necessarily make them universal. If culture is recognized as continuous practice—rather than a set “thing”—then the evolution of human rights thinking in different cultural contexts should be seen as an ongoing, dialogic process rather than an either-or scenario.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many of the contributors demonstrate Stavenhagen’s point that human rights policies are not neutral. Whereas Shannon Speed and Alavaro Reyes show how human rights discourse is used by the state as a means of continued domination, they also see potential gains for indigenous communities when rights rhetoric is used as a tool for resistance to state-sponsored violence. Other contributors, in contrast, see human rights not just as an imposition of Western ideals but as perhaps a new form of colonialism. Ramón Pitarch and Julián López García explain that human rights discourse may be incompatible with local Mayan cultures and thus question its true “universal” nature.</p>
<p>The contributors are authorities in their field and have published extensively about the contentiousness of the concept of rights in southern Mexico and Guatemala. They are careful to engage in a true debate about the limitations and the usefulness of human rights discourse in Mayan communities. Their studies do not focus on human rights shortcomings, nor are they overcelebratory about their successes. Several of the essays have been published elsewhere, some of them a decade earlier, and many of them fall short of offering analyses that would correspond to Stavenhagen’s view of “human rights thinking in different cultural contexts . . . as an ongoing, dialogic process.” This is not say that the pieces are outdated; they are still valid and useful in providing essential material for the continued study of the region. At the same time, while the founding of the Red de Defensores Comunitarios por los Derechos Humanos (Community Human Rights Defenders’ Network) described by Speed and Reyes has benefited indigenous communities in Chiapas, it might have been useful to incorporate new developments such as the increased intimidation, harassment, and even killing of these human rights defenders, presumably by state and paramilitary actors, that have been documented by the Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas Human Rights Center since 2006. That said, the essays in this volume offer a “variety of perspectives on how human rights are appropriated, resisted, or just plain ignored within Maya communities” (305). This book is obligatory reading for anyone who wishes to understand contemporary Mayan societies in Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Richard Wilson writes in the concluding pages of <italic>Human Rights in the Maya Region</italic> that, “given the heterogeneity of actual beliefs and practices within and among Mayan communities,” it is problematic to think of “Mayan culture as a whole integrated packet” (309). Heidi Moksnes presents an in-depth study of a single community in the Chiapas highlands. <italic>Maya Exodus</italic> provides a window on the way a progressive group of Catholic Mayas known as the Word of God in San Pedro Chenalhó is using global human rights discourse against the Mexican state in an effort to emancipate itself from poverty. Moksnes, building on previous scholarship about the role of the Catholic diocese in the lives of Maya groups in Chiapas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492130">Kovic, 2005</xref>), shows that it provides a framework in which local indigenous actors can connect with national and international networks to participate in the ongoing discourse on human and indigenous rights. Central to her study is the way Pedranos are forging a new identity through their belief in a universal God, which has led them to take up the banner of universal human rights. By conceptualizing rights discourse in this way they have reinterpreted their own poverty and suffering, effectively changing their subject position in Mexican society “from being loyal clients dependent on a patron to being citizens who have rights.” Moksnes provides historical background on the relationship between Pedranos and the corporatist Mexican state and goes on to offer insight into their reconfigured relationship with God and their community. Here she points out that what at first may seem to be a collectivity organized by the Catholic diocese is in fact based on traditional forms of community developed by the Maya over centuries.</p>
<p>Perhaps what is most striking about <italic>Maya Exodus</italic> is the clarity with which the author presents the shift toward a new collective identity for the Pedranos. In Chapter 6 she describes the new way in which Catholic Pedranos conceive of themselves, converting their poverty into a virtue. They imagine themselves as uniquely positioned within all of humanity to receive God’s love, and this new identity allows them to draw on universal human rights claims to seek justice in the face of state-sponsored violence. Since in-depth studies about the 1997 Acteal massacre exist (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492130">Bellinghausen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492130">Higgins, O’Sullivan, and Padden, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492130">Ruiz García, 1998</xref>), Moksnes does not go into a long explanation of that event but instead looks at the way Pedranos are responding to this violence. Since they no longer exchange political loyalty for government handouts, they are experiencing increased persecution by state and nonstate actors. They reject their previous identity as clients of the state and no longer view the Mexican government as an entity from which to seek favors. They now demand a rights-based citizenship, but Moksnes seems to have little optimism about this project. She describes the Pedrano Catholics’ new subject position as “trapped,” having “little success” and “severe limitations,” and having produced “few concrete outcomes.” Unable to find a true way out of poverty, they have begun to create new dependencies on nongovernmental organizations and other groups.</p>
<p>The book’s title, <italic>Maya Exodus</italic>, may be misleading. Whereas Christine Kovic’s book <italic>Mayan Voices for Human Rights</italic> (2005) tells of the actual exodus of Catholic Mayas from San Juan Chamula, Moksnes’s “exodus” is a conceptual departure from one subject position to another. This does not, however, seem to her to be the answer to the crushing poverty suffered by this Maya community, and she reports that some Pedranos are leaving for cities in Mexico and the United States in search of income. <italic>Maya Exodus</italic> presents an impressive analysis of one community’s struggle for social change, but the Pedranos’ new subject position has so far “provided little, if any, real material improvements,” and hope for it is waning. The lesson here may be that fightiing for social change in the face of government oppression is very difficult but there is hope as long as indigenous communities continue to seek new strategies for change.</p>
<p>Christine Eber and “Antonia” weave a story of the struggles and conflicts experienced by one indigenous group filtered through an individual Tzotzil woman’s voice in <italic>The Journey of a Tzotzil-Maya Woman of Chiapas, Mexico</italic>. What makes this book unique is that its stories are told in the first person by two different voices. Antonia’s voice reflects the fragmentation of resistance struggles. Shortly after the Zapatista uprising in 1994, Antonia remembers, “we began to divide because people didn’t know which way to go—which was good, which was bad. We were confused. Although we had learned about the Word of God, the Zapatistas and the Bees [<italic>Las Abejas</italic>] began to criticize each other” (71). As Antonia explains her situation, the reader gets a deep sense of the divisions in her community. Her story makes us aware that resistance is part of everyday life. No matter what her identity marker is at any given moment (a mother, a weaver, a Word of God Catholic, a Zapatista), she is in a position from which to be an agent of change. For example, in her role as a Tzotzil woman she participates in a long tradition of weaving. Inspired by the Zapatistas, she helped organize Xojobal K’ak’al (Light of the Day), a cooperative of about 15 women weavers. They sell their products and save the money they earn to be used for future projects. “Antonia did not need the Zapatista movement to open her eyes to male dominance,” writes Eber, “but discussions about the Revolutionary Women’s Law in her local support base gave her a formal context within which to join with women in her own and other communities to confront the negative aspects of traditional gender norms” (200).</p>
<p>A second important point that is explored throughout the book is the question of language. Eber discusses the decision whether to have Antonia speak in her first language, Tzotzil, or in Spanish. Because of her own admitted limitations in Tzotzil, the two relied heavily on Spanish. There are Tzotzil words and phrases throughout the text, because “Tzotzil has many qualities that convey experiences of life different than what can be conveyed in other languages” (xxii). For example, there is no word for “revolution,” but there is an expression for it that is loaded with historical significance. Native speakers of Tzotzil talk about resistance and revolution as the time of <italic>k’alal ich’ay mosoal</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492130">1</xref></sup> (when we stopped being crushed) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492130">Aubrey, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492130">Womack, 1999</xref>). The phrase points to the long process of sustained resistance finally culminating with the “disappearance of the servant,” when people became their own masters. Thus revolution in Chiapas must be understood through the Maya’s conception of their own history, and nothing is more representative of their local history than their language.</p>
<p>Like the Pedranos in <italic>Maya Exodus</italic>, Antonia is a Word of God Catholic. Unlike them, she is also a Zapatista. Rather than speaking of “indigenous groups” or “Maya peoples” in the abstract, <italic>The Journey of a Tzotzil-Maya Woman</italic> is an intimate portrait of an individual woman’s struggle for survival, giving the notion of resistance a very real, human dimension. Eber is able to step back from her study and reflect on the difficult moments of the relationship between the researcher and her object of study. She touches on familiar issues in anthropology such as becoming too involved with her human subject and asks herself who is benefiting from this relationship. She is conscious of her privileged position, but the disparity and inequality between her and Antonia is never quite resolved. In Part 3, Chapter 3, as Antonia prepares to leave the United States and return to Chiapas, the mood becomes somber. The text is accompanied by a photograph of Antonia at an airport looking out a window toward the runway, her head slightly cocked to the side as if she were contemplating the deep divide between the two countries. Eber writes about this moment with heartfelt clarity, describing the sadness and foreignness that Antonia felt during her stay in the United States. Demonstrating the difficulty of working with human subjects, she adds, “She is rarely this honest with me” (159). She is conscious of the fact that “we all use one another for our own as well as larger purposes” and, facing this aspect of a “humbling experience,” tells us that what matters is how we use each other (206); if the goal is truly helping another human being, academic work can be “inclusive, attentive, and powerful” in the promotion of social justice.</p>
<p>The four books under review all provide keen insight into varying forms of resistance and rights-based claims. Readers will learn how rights and resistance are understood and used by various actors as these ideas move from theory to practice, from abstraction to the specific case of a single individual. <italic>Human Rights in the Maya Region</italic> and <italic>New Approaches to Resistance in Brazil and Mexico</italic> stand out for their theoretical sophistication. <italic>Maya Exodus</italic> and <italic>The Journey of a Tzotzil-Maya Woman of Chiapas, Mexico</italic>, provide in-depth and focused analyses of particular communal, religious, and gendered experiences of rights-based activism. These works add to a growing field of research on the use of local, cultural understandings of rights-based resistance in the pursuit of autonomy and self-determination in the face of oppression.</p>
