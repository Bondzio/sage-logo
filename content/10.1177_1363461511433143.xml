<abstract>
<p>Stigmatization is commonly recognized as one of the main barriers to recovery and to social inclusion of people with mental illnesses. This exploratory study investigated the frequency, type, and sources of actual stigma and discrimination experiences among Polish psychiatric patients. A total of 442 people, treated in various psychiatric health care facilities in Warsaw, were interviewed with the use of the Consumer Experiences of Stigma Questionnaire (CESQ). Qualitative data regarding sources of experienced stigma were also obtained. The respondents reported relatively frequent experiences of stigmatization in everyday situations and interpersonal relations, but they seldom complained of any specific instances of discrimination. The most frequently reported source of stigma was employers and supervisors at work, followed by family, and general community members. Implications of the findings for clinical practice and policy are discussed.</p></abstract>

<sec id="sec1-1363461511433143" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since Erving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363461511433143">Goffman (1963)</xref> published his classic essay <italic>Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity</italic>, the concept of stigma has been applied to an enormous variety of human conditions. There is, however, agreement that mental illness is associated with particularly strong and ubiquitous stigma. Theoretical approaches to the stigma of mental illness are numerous and vary considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461511433143">Link &amp; Phelan, 2001</xref>) but two current conceptualizations are of particular importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363461511433143">Rüsch, Angermeyer, &amp; Corrigan, 2005</xref>). According to the social-cognitive model developed by Corrigan, stigma has three core components: stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461511433143">Corrigan &amp; Kleinlein, 2005</xref>). The model developed by Link and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363461511433143">Link &amp; Phelan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461511433143">Link, Yang, Phelan, &amp; Collins, 2004</xref>) conceptualizes stigma from a sociological perspective as the co-occurrence of labeling, stereotyping, separation, emotional reactions, status loss, and discrimination in a power situation. Thus, according to both of these models, stigma is a broader concept than discrimination (i.e., denial of rightful opportunities), which is only one of several components of the complex stigmatization process.</p>
<p>The negative impact of psychiatric stigma has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363461511433143">Corrigan &amp; Kleinlein, 2005</xref>). Indeed, according to Sartorius “stigma and discrimination are the most significant obstacles to the development of mental health care and to ensuring a life of quality to people suffering from mental illness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363461511433143">Sartorius, 1998</xref>, p. 1058). However, until recently, research on stigma has focused more on the perspective of the stigmatizers, that is, public opinions about and attitudes towards people with mental illness (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363461511433143">Angermeyer &amp; Dietrich, 2006</xref>), than on the perspective of those who are stigmatized, that is, the perceptions and experiences of people receiving psychiatric treatment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363461511433143">Angermeyer, 2003</xref>, for a review of the studies of the stigma of mental illness from patients’ point of view). Moreover, a considerable portion of the research conducted amongst patients concerns perceived or anticipated stigmatization, whereas the issue of actual stigma and discrimination experiences has been studied less often. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl (1999)</xref> notes, however, no other method can replace information about the experiences of those who actually have to deal with stigmatization in their everyday life.</p>
<p>As in other countries, in Poland stigmatizing attitudes of various social groups have been researched much more frequently than the subjective experiences of people with mental disorders. Poland has participated in the Open the Doors antistigma program of the World Psychiatric Association since 2000. The voice of Polish patients needs to be heard to a much greater extent in the planning and evaluation of antistigma campaigns, which, if they are to be effective, should be adjusted to specific local conditions and informed by the lived experience of those who are stigmatized because of their mental health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363461511433143">Sartorius &amp; Schulze, 2005</xref>). The way that stigma manifests itself in the everyday experiences of people with mental illness may depend to a significant degree on various social, economic, or cultural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363461511433143">Littlewood, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363461511433143">Weiss, Jadhav, Raguram, Vounatsou, &amp; Littlewood, 2001</xref>). It is difficult, therefore, to know how far to generalize the results of research conducted in specific countries or cultures. As well, the analysis of cultural variations in the experience of stigmatization by people who are undergoing psychiatric treatment may also contribute to a better understanding of the overall nature of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The aim of the study reported here was the evaluation of the frequency, type, and sources of actual stigma and discrimination experiences reported by people who receive psychiatric treatment in Poland. We used a mixed-methods study design with both quantitative and qualitative data collected.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1363461511433143" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1363461511433143" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants were recruited using a convenience sampling procedure from various mental health services in Warsaw, including two acute-inpatient wards, a psychiatric-rehabilitation inpatient ward, a day center and two outpatient clinics. All interviewed patients were over 18 and in stable condition (as assessed by their attending psychiatrists). Of the 544 patients who were approached with the invitation to participate in the research, 102 (19%) refused, so the final sample comprised 442 patients with a response rate of 81%.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-1363461511433143"><title>Instrument</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the frequency and type of stigma and discrimination experiences, the Consumer Experiences of Stigma Questionnaire (CESQ) was used. This instrument was devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl (1999)</xref> in cooperation with the members of the advocacy organization the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) for one of the largest (<italic>N</italic> = 1301) and most frequently cited studies on the experiences of mental illness-related stigmatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl, 1999</xref>). The questionnaire, in a slightly modified form, has been used by numerous researchers in various countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511433143">Bagley &amp; King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363461511433143">Burgener &amp; Berger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363461511433143">Charles, Manoranjitham, &amp; Jacob, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511433143">Dickerson, Sommerville, Origoni, Ringel, &amp; Parente, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461511433143">El-Badri &amp; Mellsop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363461511433143">Luoma et al., 2007</xref>). It also has served as the basis for the construction of new research instruments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363461511433143">Björkman, Svensson, &amp; Lundberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363461511433143">Chung &amp; Wong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363461511433143">Depla, de Graaf, van Weeghel, &amp; Heeren, 2005</xref>). The CESQ is recommended by the leading experts on stigmatization as a comprehensive and useful tool for measuring the experiences of stigma suffered by people with mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363461511433143">Link et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The CESQ has two main sections. The stigma section includes nine items concerning general stigma experiences in daily life. The discrimination section contains 12 statements regarding specific discrimination experiences in such areas as employment, education, housing, volunteering, and law enforcement. The responses to the questionnaire statements are scored on a 5-point scale that describes the frequency of each experience ranging from “Never” to “Very often.”</p>
<p>A Polish version of the CESQ was prepared by mental health professionals fluent in both Polish and English, using a back-translation procedure. The instrument was slightly modified for the purposes of this study. The term “consumers” was replaced by the phrase “people receiving psychiatric treatment” (or “I receive psychiatric treatment,” where appropriate), as “consumer” has different connotations in the Polish language, and could create confusion among participants. Additionally, one of the options in the discrimination section was given a wider meaning, so that it did not refer only to contacts with law enforcement officers but more generally also with other officials of both criminal and civil justice systems. Once both parts of the questionnaire were completed, the patients were asked to describe in more detail, in their own words, one situation of their choice, in which they experienced social rejection.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363461511433143" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The present study was approved by the Bioethical Committee at the Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology in Warsaw. All participants provided their informed consent. The CESQ was administered by an interviewer; however, the patients could also fill in the questionnaire personally if they volunteered to do so. The responses of the patients to the open-ended question at the end of the questionnaire were recorded through researcher field notes. The clinical and sociodemographic information was gathered from the interviews with participants and from their medical records.</p></sec></sec>

<p>Patients complained of specific experiences of discrimination much less often than they did of experiencing stigma. Just above half of those interviewed said that in their written applications for jobs, housing, school, or licenses of all types they often or very often avoided mentioning that they are in psychiatric treatment. Moreover, approximately 1 in 4 respondents said that their colleagues or superiors at work who knew about their mental health problems seldom or never were supportive and accommodating, and about 1 in 5 thought that representatives of the justice system had not treated them with consideration and kindness. Slightly less than 10% reported that they were often or very often turned down for a job, whereas 5% affirmed that the fact of having received psychiatric treatment was used against them in legal proceedings.

We compared background characteristics of responders and nonresponders. A chi-square test of independence revealed that responders were more likely to have a diagnosis of psychotic disorder than nonresponders (73.6% vs. 57.8%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 442) = 10.59, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Results from independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests indicated that responders were also more likely to have an earlier illness onset than nonresponders (<italic>M</italic> = 26.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.1 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 29.9 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 13.9), <italic>t</italic>(356) = −2.44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, longer duration of illness (<italic>M</italic> = 16.5 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.6 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 11.6 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.3), <italic>t</italic>(403) = 4.07, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and more psychiatric hospitalizations (<italic>M</italic> = 8.0, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.5 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 5.2, <italic>SD</italic> = 7.8), <italic>t</italic>(230.7) = 2.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Both groups did not differ in terms of sex, age, marital status, level of education, place of residence, living situation, duration of past employment, current employment status, or current type of mental health care (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05).</p>
<p>The results of the analysis of the sources of experienced stigma are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1363461511433143">Table 4</xref>. Most often, patients described situations which took place in the work context, complaining of rejection by their employers and superiors (28%), but also by their coworkers and colleagues (7%) (these percentages refer to the group of 148 patients who responded to the question at the end of the questionnaire). Stigma and discrimination at work took various forms. According to our respondents, they were often refused employment when they revealed the fact of being in psychiatric treatment. One of them said: “When I admitted that I was receiving psychiatric treatment during my job search, my CV was automatically thrown away” (45-year-old man). Some patients claimed that they lost their jobs because of their illness; one of our respondents said: “A year into my employment, when the company’s President found out that I was treated psychiatrically and I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, he fired me, with complete hostility and contempt” (47-year-old man). Other unfortunate consequences of the stigma of mental illness in a workplace were related to the worsening of interpersonal relations at work, as was the case with this patient:<disp-quote>
<p>When my older colleague found out that I was receiving psychiatric treatment she started treating me with great distance and hostility. She was surprised that I was allowed to work but then she comforted herself with the thought that it must be a sort of therapy for me. (38-year-old woman)

<p>The second most frequent source of stigma, mentioned by 24% of patients, was members of immediate family. The participants reported that in situations of family conflict their family humiliated them and treated them with contempt; they used their illness to hurt their feelings, for example by using derogatory words relating to mental illness. One of the patients quoted the words of her husband, who blackmailed her in their arguments: “It would be enough for me to show your hospital discharge forms and you’d be taken away, without a shadow of a doubt” (59-year-old woman). Other forms of stigma experienced from relatives, described by our respondents, included condescending and patronizing attitudes or disregarding their point of view. One patient said: “Members of my family often tell me to shut up and focus on my treatment” (27-year-old man). In some cases, stigmatization experienced from family members took radical forms, such as taking financial advantage or depriving a patient of their share of the family estate, physical aggression, or divorce demands motivated by the spouse’s illness. Some respondents perceived as stigmatizing some of their relatives’ behaviors, which were probably informed by good intentions. One respondent complained of the family’s attempts to shelter him from any forms of stress: “My family members prefer not to inform me of important family matters, for the fear of my mental condition getting worse. For example I was not told of my aunt’s death” (50-year-old man).</p>
<p>About 1 in 7 respondents (14%) reported negative responses from general community members, most often their neighbors, and also strangers in shops, public transport, Internet forums and the like. One patient even described offensive behavior and name-calling by children from his neighborhood.</p>
<p>About 10% of respondents, complained of stigmatization by officials of the justice system, mainly policemen (unjustified violence, humiliation, being ridiculed, and offensive language related to mental illness), and also by judges and prosecutors (unkind treatment and unjustified restriction of citizen or parental rights). Not all of the reactions of representatives of the justice system described by the respondents were unequivocally negative or hostile. Some merely indicated embarrassment, fear, and lack of knowledge of how to behave in contact with a person with mental illness. One of the patients wrote: “Last year I had a terrible fit in public. I sat by the tube entrance and screamed. A policeman approached me but he seemed scared and he left straight away” (25-year-old man).</p>
<p>Approximately 9% of our respondents described situations in which they experienced rejection by friends, who gossiped about them, avoided them, or talked about their illness in a stereotypical or hostile manner. One of the patients said: “I told my friend about my illness and she used it against me by spreading gossip about me” (46-year-old woman). Another person complained “Since I started my psychiatric treatment, quite a few of my so-called friends and acquaintances turned away from me” (27-year-old woman). Someone else noticed: “My colleagues were hostile towards me. They said that I suffered from split personality” (51-year-old man).</p>
<p>A similar proportion (8%) indicated that they had suffered stigmatization from employees of psychiatric health care. Patients above all complained of the overuse of force and violence, especially by hospital orderlies. Some of our respondents also considered less direct forms of stigmatization inflicted by mental health professionals to be upsetting and hurtful, which is well illustrated in the following example: “What happened to me was that a nurse who was a therapist advised my girlfriend, whom I had met in hospital, to get herself a healthy boyfriend. I think it was a form of discrimination. Everyone has the right to be happy. Even the mentally ill” (26-year-old man).</p>
<p>Relatively few people (5% or less) indicated general health care providers, representatives of authorities, and public office workers of various institutions, as well as the mass media, as sources of stigmatization.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1363461511433143" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our research indicate that in Poland many people receiving psychiatric treatment feel stigmatized in various areas of life. Although a clear majority of our participants reported efforts to hide their illness, many experienced various forms of stigma in daily interpersonal relations: over a third reported that they were often or very often treated as less competent, and over 20% complained that others often or very often advised them to lower their expectations in life or avoided contact with them. Significant proportions of the patients also complained about frequent instances of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl (1999)</xref> calls “indirect” stigma (i.e., which was not targeting them directly but was reflective of the stereotypes and prejudice widespread in the society), such as offensive media depictions or negative comments about people with mental illnesses. In this situation, it is difficult to say that the fears expressed by numerous participants about being perceived unfavorably by others are in any way unfounded.</p>
<p>In contrast to the experiences of stigma, our respondents rarely complained of any specific cases of discrimination. The only areas in which significant (albeit not very high) proportions of the participants reported discrimination were employment and contacts with the justice system. Similarly the discrimination section of the CESQ also revealed that the most frequent experience was not direct social rejection but avoidance of the disclosure of psychiatric treatment in various situations.</p>
<p>The qualitative analysis of the responses on the sources of stigma cast more light on the quantitative data obtained with the use of the CESQ. Respondents most often described situations relating to rejection by family members and employers or superiors at work. Complaints of inappropriate treatment by relatives are a frequent motif in the research on the subjective experience of the stigma of mental illness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363461511433143">Lee, Lee, Chiu, &amp; Kleinman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461511433143">Thornicroft, Brohan, Rose, Sartorius, &amp; Leese, for the INDIGO Study Group, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl, 1999</xref>). This is probably related to the frequency and intensity of contacts with the members of immediate family and the special status given to rejection by those of whom one expects understanding and support in the first place. On the other hand, discrimination in employment, even if it is not the most frequently experienced form of stigma by people with mental illness, is perceived as particularly painful and hurtful because it adds to their social and economic exclusion, loss of independence, and the restriction of possibilities for the realization of their life goals.</p>
<p>In order to give a full picture of the experiences of our respondents, it must also be noted that a significant proportion of them reported positive experiences in interpersonal relations: for example, most of them admitted that people who knew about their mental health problems treated them fairly, while their friends were understanding and supportive.</p>
<p>Taken together, the results of this research confirm that the social stigma attached to mental illness is a significant clinical and social issue in Poland. A direct comparison with the studies conducted among psychiatric patients in other countries is problematic due to differences in study designs, instruments used to measure experienced stigmatization, and characteristics of the surveyed populations. However, it seems that the pattern of our findings is roughly similar to that obtained in studies carried out in other settings with the use of the same stigma measure (CESQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511433143">Bagley &amp; King, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511433143">Dickerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461511433143">El-Badri &amp; Mellsop, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl, 1999</xref>). It is quite consistently found that expectations of adverse reactions from others (e.g., feeling the need to conceal one’s mental health problems or worrying about being viewed unfavorably by others) and reports of “indirect” stigma (e.g., overhearing negative comments or encountering offensive media accounts about people with mental illness) are more common than complaints about overt social rejection (e.g., being shunned or avoided by others or being turned down for a job). Another important finding emerging from all these studies is that interpersonal experiences of people with mental disorders are not universally negative—many patients do not feel strongly stigmatized in the areas covered by the CESQ or even report being treated in a fair or supportive manner.</p>
<p>The profiles of stigma and discrimination experiences reported by users of mental health services in Poland seem specific in two respects. Firstly, it is worth noting that a particularly high proportion of our participants utilized secrecy as a stigma-coping strategy in their daily interpersonal relations. As many as 61% indicated having often or very often avoided disclosure of their mental health problems outside the immediate family. By comparison, in American studies using the CESQ this percentage ranged from 31% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511433143">Dickerson et al., 2002</xref>) to 47% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl, 1999</xref>). It should be emphasized that the tendency to conceal one’s illness, so widespread among Polish psychiatric patients, corresponds well with the results of a recent general public survey carried out among a representative sample of adults (<italic>N</italic> = 1,037), which revealed that about three quarters of Polish citizens (76%) believe that mental disorders are shameful and should be kept secret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511433143">Wciórka &amp; Wciórka, 2006</xref>). The social climate in Poland seems then to be particularly unfavorable for disclosure of mental health problems. The situation can be assumed to have far-reaching implications for public health, since many people fearful of social stigma strive to hide their mental illness, which may result in their resistance to seeking professional help.</p>
<p>Our data differ in one more respect from those collected using the CESQ in other countries: namely, particularly small percentages of our participants endorsed the discrimination items of the questionnaire. In studies carried out in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511433143">Dickerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl, 1999</xref>), New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363461511433143">El-Badri &amp; Mellsop, 2007</xref>) or in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363461511433143">Bagley &amp; King, 2005</xref>), discrimination scores were clearly higher than in our study. It is difficult to say whether the low discrimination rates found in the present study reflect reality, or may be attributable to measurement bias. Public opinion surveys systematically conducted on representative community samples show that the social distance towards people with mental disorders in Poland, like in other countries, is high and has remained at a quite stable level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363461511433143">Wciórka &amp; Wciórka, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511433143">2006</xref>). However, the surveys suggest that attitudes towards people with mental illness within Polish society are not univocally negative, and compassion seems to be a more frequent and typical reaction to people with psychiatric disorders than fear or open dislike. It is particularly noteworthy that only one fourth of Poles share the stereotypic image of people with mental illnesses as dangerous and aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363461511433143">Wciórka &amp; Wciórka, 2006</xref>). This is in evident contrast to the results of public opinion polls in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363461511433143">Link, Phelan, Bresnahan, Stueve, &amp; Pescosolido, 1999</xref>), or the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363461511433143">Crisp, Gelder, Rix, Meltzer, &amp; Rowlands, 2000</xref>), where a vast majority of respondents believed people with schizophrenia or substance use disorder to be violent or dangerous. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461511433143">Thornicroft et al. (2009)</xref> published the results of a cross-sectional survey conducted by means of face-to-face interviews with 732 participants with schizophrenia from 27 countries including Poland. Polish patients as compared to respondents from other countries were found to have a medium level of anticipated discrimination and a rather low level of experienced discrimination. However, the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are limited because its main focus was not on detailed cross-country comparisons, and the sample size in every center was small.</p>
<p>Although there is some evidence that psychiatric patients in Poland relatively seldom experience overt discrimination, it would be premature to conclude that the level of social acceptance of people with mental disorders is higher in Poland than in other countries. It seems more likely that some of the situations described in the discrimination section of the CESQ have little or no reference to specifically Polish conditions. For example, the method of financing health care in Poland does not lead to major difficulties with access to health insurance or medical care as is the case in the United States, where the questionnaire we used was devised. Likewise, difficulties with renting a flat may be encountered by only a small proportion of Polish patients, since the vast majority of them live either with their families or in their own flats, and are characterized by the low rate of housing mobility typical of wider Polish society. Generally, while the stigma of mental illness experienced by people receiving psychiatric treatment in various countries may be quite similar in daily living situations and interpersonal contacts, discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, education, law enforcement, insurances, or social activity is much more site-specific and depends to a greater extent on a variety of social and economic factors.</p>
<sec id="sec12-1363461511433143"><title>Limitations</title>
<p>Limitations of this study include sampling and measurement. Our sample was biased towards inpatients with severe mental illnesses and was collected in only one geographical area in Poland. However, the large number of participants in the research, the high response rate and the inclusion of patients from various mental health facilities enhance internal validity.</p>
<p>A second limitation is linked to the instrument used in our research to measure stigma and discrimination experiences. We used the CESQ, a questionnaire developed in the USA, which is well known and recommended by prominent researchers. However, its psychometric properties have not yet been tested in Poland and it may not fully capture the whole of experiences of people receiving treatment for mental health problems in Poland. The discrimination section of the CESQ, in particular, seems to have a limited capacity to cover some of the more subtle manifestations of social rejection experienced by Polish patients. Qualitative research is needed to identify other areas in which patients in Poland experience significantly frequent discrimination. Moreover, it needs to be stressed that in the present study we focused only on one aspect of the complex process of stigmatization, namely actual stigma and discrimination experiences as reported by people with mental disorders. There are other important dimensions of stigma, which cannot be directly recorded by the CESQ, for example self-stigma or structural stigma.</p>
<p>Our data were self-reported and reflect the subjective perspective of people with mental disorders. Conceivably, not all the experiences reported by our patients had really resulted from stigmatization. Participants’ interpretation could be affected by their own psychopathological symptoms, such as depressed mood or persecutory delusions. In this context it should be noted though that in two studies using the CESQ the extent of stigma experiences was not predicted by the severity of the participants’ psychiatric impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363461511433143">Dickerson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363461511433143">Świtaj, Wciórka, Smolarska-Świtaj, &amp; Grygiel, 2009</xref>). It is also possible that at least some of the respondents tended to cope with limitations due to their illness by attributing their social problems to unfair treatment by others. On the other hand, some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363461511433143">Vlassoff et al., 2000</xref>) suggest that people belonging to stigmatized groups may cope with stigma by denying it. Finally, discrimination could be underreported in our study simply because it often occurs without the knowledge of the person being discriminated against (e.g., being passed over for a job in favor of someone without a stigmatizing attribute)—this is an inherent limitation of self-report measures. These reservations highlight the fact that, in order to minimize the risk of overestimating or underestimating the real impact of stigmatization, one should supplement psychiatric patients’ perspectives on stigma with the perspectives of those unaffected by mental illness.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1363461511433143" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion: Implications for clinical practice and policy</title>
<p>Our findings underscore the need to pay closer attention in the treatment programs to the ways in which people with mental health problems cope with the stigma. A clear majority of the participants of this study regarded their condition as something shameful, that might be viewed unfavorably by others and that needed to be concealed outside their immediate family. However, avoidance of disclosure protected our respondents from social rejection only to a limited extent. This coping strategy has also been found to be of little use in counteracting such negative effects of stigmatization as unemployment or demoralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363461511433143">Link, Mirotznik, &amp; Cullen, 1991</xref>), and evidence exists that concealing the stigma may be psychologically burdensome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363461511433143">Smart &amp; Wegner, 1999</xref>). Hence, it seems that helping patients to work out alternative strategies of coping with stigmatization should be one of the major objectives of all therapeutic interventions. One potential solution would be to develop counseling services aimed at helping psychiatric patients to deal with stigma through personal disclosure. Although coming out and actively confronting stigma may expose people with mental illnesses to a greater risk of social disapproval or avoidance by others, it may also have many benefits for them (e.g., removing the stress resulting from having to keep a secret or increasing self-esteem and sense of power over the experience of mental illness and stigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363461511433143">Corrigan &amp; Matthews, 2003</xref>). The decision about the disclosure manner and extent is always personal, but peer support and advice from other psychiatric patients who decided to talk about their illness publicly and want to share their experiences, may help in making the decision.</p>
<p>The present findings also highlight some of the dilemmas that can occur in mental health care. As in the original study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl (1999)</xref>, many respondents in our study considered the advice (given by their families and friends, as well as by the psychiatrists providing their treatment) that they should lower their life goals and expectations as stigmatizing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363461511433143">Wahl (1999)</xref> points out that such advice may be well intended and sometimes helpful, protecting the patients against unrealistic aspirations and challenges that exceed their capabilities. On the other hand, advice of this sort may reflect patronizing attitudes towards people with psychiatric disorders and the implicit assumptions about their incompetence or inability to deal with stress. Mental health care providers must be aware of this tension when planning treatment strategies for their patients, and take into account the patient’s own perspectives and expectations.</p>
<p>As far as implications of this study for public education campaigns are concerned, the crucial issue seems to be an attempt at changing the social image of mental illness as something shameful that should be concealed. Perhaps it would be useful to put more emphasis on educating the public that, contrary to popular belief, mental disorders are frequent and affect a large part of the community. Another promising strategy in this respect could be to persuade famous people or figures of authority that have experienced mental disorders and received psychiatric treatment to share their stories in public, and perhaps also consent to be the “faces” of antistigma campaigns.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study may also help in identifying populations, which should be targeted in antistigmatization programs. In view of the experiences of our respondents, the most important sources of stigma may be employers, people they work with, their family members, officials of the justice system, and media representatives. Health care professionals also emerged as potential sources of hurtful stigma. Further research is needed to explore in more detail the role of all the above-mentioned groups in the stigmatization process, so that well-oriented, target-specific antistigma interventions can be designed and implemented.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be emphasized that no interventions aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination can replace adequate financing of and support to therapeutic programs for people with mental illnesses. Many work- and family-related, as well as other social problems experienced by psychiatric patients are due not to stigma, but to disability, which only high-quality mental health services may alleviate. Policy makers should bear in mind that successfully combating stigma is only one aspect of the fight for improving quality of life in people receiving psychiatric treatment.</p></sec>
