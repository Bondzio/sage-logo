<abstract>
<p>Writing about the Other arouses questions of representation, and specifically the risk of Othering, that is, the risk of portraying the other essentially different, and translating this difference to inferiority. In this article the authors discuss the textual mechanisms that create Othering and suggest three modes of writing that have the potential to resist Othering: (1) narrative, which enables the retrieval of subjectivity; (2) dialog, which reveals the personal history of the research participant and her interpretation regarding it; and (3) reflexivity, which transforms the text by adding the author’s own feelings, experiences, and history as a vehicle to understand the research participant. The article presents the importance of resisting Othering in academic writing, exemplifies the three modes, and discusses their potential contribution.</p>

<body>
<p>Knowing the Other is one of the major motivations for doing qualitative research. The researcher wishes to know the Other in order to give a voice to people who were previously ignored or were the object of distorted conceptions. The motivation to know the Other is also beneficial for the research participants because, unlike other kinds of inquiry, in qualitative research they have the opportunity to experience recognition, acknowledgment, and empathy. In this respect, knowing the Other possesses a potential for emancipation from binding stereotypes. However, the desire to know the Other can be a potential source of dominance, when it becomes a mode of subduing her in a network of interpretations and representations. In this case, the Other is trapped in her uniqueness and is transformed into an icon of permanent Otherness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077800411433546">Levinas, 1969</xref>). Representing the Other is always a process of dominance and control, in which the person represented is reduced to an object. Research thus always performs in the arena of the politics of representation. The understanding that persons exceed their representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1077800411433546">Perpich, 2008</xref>, p. 63) and that any representation is always limited and partial creates new challenges for qualitative research that holds “liberatory, emancipatory commitments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411433546">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2008</xref>, p. X).</p>
<p>The crisis of representation has led researchers to deal with questions such as who can study whom and how and where? Who benefits from the research? Are representations that were “discovered” in research valid? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1077800411433546">Pillow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1077800411433546">St. Pierre &amp; Pillow, 2000</xref>). These questions point to the writing of research, that is, the process of creating the written representation, as a contested and loaded arena. The final status of “truth” given to the written research reinforces the power the researcher holds and the risks entailed by the process of the writing.</p>
<p>When studying people who belong to marginalized groups, in terms of their material, social, and symbolic resources, these risks become particularly acute. When the gap in social power between the researcher and the researched is very wide, the representational vulnerability of the research participants is great. Giving the researcher their stories has made the participants dependent on the latter’s interpretations, ideologies, and writing styles. This vulnerability forces the researcher to become fully aware of her choices during the research process and of the risks they entail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411433546">Armstead, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Laurel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson’s (1990</xref>, p. 12) question, “How do we write (explain, describe, index) the social?,” Michelle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411433546">Fine’s (1994)</xref> call to “work the hyphen between Self and Other,” and the discussions on critical methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077800411433546">Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411433546">Lather, 2007</xref>), we discuss in this article the representation of Other and Self in academic writing as a political act. We seek to contribute to the deconstruction of Othering produced by research, specifically regarding women in poverty, by investigating the ways research advances or resists Othering. The article starts with a brief review of the concept of Othering and continues with a demonstration and discussion of three strategies of resisting Othering—narrative, dialog, and reflexivity.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077800411433546">
<title>Othering</title>
<p>In psychoanalytic perspective the category of the “Other” is as primary as consciousness itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077800411433546">de Beauvoir, 1949</xref>). Through Othering the Self is distinguished from other people who are perceived as mildly or radically different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411433546">Riggins, 1997</xref>). In psychoanalytic terms “we” project upon the Other, that which is undesirable in ourselves or repressed and buried in our unconscious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077800411433546">Kristeva, 1991</xref>); thus, the term Other can refer to anything or anybody. However, in this article we use a sociological, rather than a psychological definition of Othering, which refers to Otherness as the process of attaching moral codes of inferiority to difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800411433546">Pickering, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800411433546">Schwalbe et al., 2000</xref>), the critical discursive tool of discrimination and exclusion used against individuals on the basis of their belonging to marginalized groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077800411433546">Boreus, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411433546">Riggins, 1997</xref>). The oppressive force of Otherness comes from the separating line or border created, and from its exclusionary effect, since to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077800411433546">Hall’s (1997)</xref> term, the Others are in effect sent into “symbolic exile.” In this context, Othering is associated with the notion of Eurocentrism, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1077800411433546">Said’s (1995)</xref> concept of orientalism, and with everyday racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077800411433546">Essed, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1077800411433546">Todorov (1984)</xref> identifies three dimensions of the relationship between Self and Other: value judgments (the Other is perceived as good/bad), social distance (the Other is perceived as distant psychologically and physically), and knowledge (the history and culture of the Other is relatively unknown). In the process of Othering, heterogeneous social groups are perceived as a homogeneous category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411433546">Riggins, 1997</xref>). The only exceptions are those few individuals who belong to the “Other” group but are known personally to the Self. However, their existence does not affect the perceptions and attitudes the Self holds with regard to other members of that group who continue to be marked as different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1077800411433546">Riggins, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Otherness is accomplished by means of rules of behavior and the mechanisms of discourse, interpretation, and performance set by hegemoneous groups. However, the process of Otherness is transparent and is accepted as natural. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1077800411433546">O’Barr (1994)</xref> claims that today, when language is supposed to be tolerant of diversity, lexical terms tend to mitigate and disguise Othering, and it is harder to find explicit lexical strategies that are evidence of hierarchy, subordination, and dominance.</p>
<p>However, analyzing Othering regarding women in poverty we find four major mechanisms at work: (1) <italic>Objectification</italic> of the research participants by the reduction and subjugation of their common humanity and their individual complexity and by ignoring of their personal perspectives. This turns them into stereotypes composed of inferior, mostly negative, features. (2) <italic>Decontextualization</italic>, a focus on behavior abstracted from the context in which this behavior was developed and continues to exist. Decontextualization can take various forms: Detachment from a general context of policy and socioeconomic structures (such as policies regarding health, housing, education, and the job market); detachment from a general context of symbolic structures, such as racism; or detachment from the immediate context of place and time in which the behavior occurs. Decontextualization contributes to the portrayal of certain behaviors as having no reason or rationality. Behaviors and occurrences become generalized features of many rather than specific characteristics or specific responses to particular circumstances. (3) <italic>Dehistorization</italic>, the focus on the present, which is based on detachment from the personal individual history of the research participants and the ignoring of its implications. This distorts the researcher’s understanding of the present situation. (4) <italic>Deauthorization</italic>, the creation of text that is supposedly autonomous, objective, and authorless. Representation without an author means the use of an omniscient narrator and of a perspective external to the research’s participants. This presents the research’s participants as “given” objects and not as a product of an author’s selective interpretation.</p>
<p>These mechanisms of Otherness produce alienation and social distance. We cannot find anything of ourselves in descriptions that are based on these mechanisms—because the one who is described is our antipode, the Other, someone we do not <italic>want</italic> to be and someone we never <italic>will</italic> be. We feel absolutely certain that if, as Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800411433546">Rainwater (1970)</xref> claims, we were in their situation, we would behave differently or would not survive at all.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1077800411433546">
<title>Modes of Writing Against Othering</title>
<p>Writing that resists the production of Othering aims to mitigate these mechanisms. It returns the participant and her history to the foreground; it is contextual, specific, and particular; it is written out of a situated position and uses reflexivity as an organizing principle. Writing against Othering serves to bring to mind social injustice, to remember, and to make a commitment to women who live in poverty.</p>
<p>Critical scholars, who use poststructuralist, feminist, postcolonial, and indigenous theories, call for a methodological transformation and exemplify various innovative ways of writing that have the potential to resist Othering. They bring to the fore participatory approaches (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077800411433546">Fine, Tuck, &amp; Zeller-Berkman, 2008</xref>), performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077800411433546">Denzin, 2008</xref>), multivocality of the text, reflexivity, and the acknowledgment of the positionality of the researcher and her vulnerability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077800411433546">Behar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077800411433546">Charmaz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1077800411433546">Richardson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article we wish to add to the developing body of critical methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077800411433546">Lather, 2007</xref>) three modes of writing that have a potential for resisting Othering: (1) narrative, which enables contextualization, historization, and the retrieval of the subjectivity of the Other; (2) dialog, which acts against objectification and dehistorization by bringing the presence of the Other’s personal history and knowledge; and (3) reflexivity, which acts against the authoritative stance of the text or the researcher. When the author turns to her own navel, metaphorically and literally, bringing to the forefront her own feelings, experiences, and history, she demonstrates her processes of interpretation. Reflexivity can both enhance the interpretation by adding a new source of knowledge and emphasize the status of the text as personal and partial.</p>
<p>Although we exemplify each strategy with one example, the examples are not exclusive, and each of them can apply to more than one strategy. The examples are derived from two research texts we wrote, on the basis of our relationships through practice and research with women who live in poverty. Both of us are social workers. Michal is a scholar who combines academic work on women in poverty and other marginalized groups with activist community endeavors. The excerpts exemplifying dialog and reflexivity are taken from her book <italic>Women in Poverty: Gender, Pain, Resistance, Life Stories</italic> (2006), which describes the life stories of women living in poverty from a critical feminist perspective. Mirit Sidi is the cofounder and codirector of “The Women’s Court” (<italic>Hachatzer Hanashit</italic>), a center for young women, Jewish and Arab, located in one of the poorest and most marginalized neighborhoods in Tel Aviv–Jaffa, Israel. The excerpt exemplifying narrative is taken from her MA thesis, in which she documents and conceptualizes the critical social work practice in the Women’s Court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1077800411433546">Sidi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Through our mutual work we became aware of the importance and of the complexities of representing the lives we witnessed. On countless occasions, we witnessed what we saw as the powerful, abusive, chauvinistic, classist, and hegemonic narrative of poverty used against women in poverty. We have witnessed it when seeing women in poverty encountering welfare and education research professionals and when talking about women in poverty with others. Reading some of the academic works on poverty, we have experienced similar estrangement, as if we see the picture of the women’s lives very differently from the way others view it. Although the past 20 years have brought about more than a few studies that describe the lives of women, men, and children in poverty in a more holistic, contextual, and even empathetic way (for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo &amp; Benjamin, 2010</xref>), most poverty research is still contaminated by Othering.</p>
<p>Adopting “skepticism toward how indeed we have been . . . speak[ing] and describe[ing] and read[ing] and write[ing]” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411433546">Macbeth, 2001</xref>, p. 37) women in poverty, we exemplify three modes of writing that resist Othering.</p>
<sec id="section3-1077800411433546">
<title>Narrative</title>
<p><italic>Narrative</italic> has become a general term used to describe the nature of thinking and knowing as well as the outlook of human being in the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077800411433546">Bruner, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077800411433546">Clandinin &amp; Connelly, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1077800411433546">McAdams, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1077800411433546">Polkinghorne, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson (1990)</xref> describes the narrative as a medium that “displays the goals and intentions of human actors; makes individuals, cultures, societies, and historical epochs comprehensible as wholes; humanizes time; allows us to contemplate the effects of our actions and to alter the directions of our lives” (p. 20).</p>
<p>We use “narrative” to describe the mode of presentation that locates the participant in the context of a story, giving her the role of the protagonist in the working out of events. Even if described very briefly as in the following example, the narrative mode puts the events in a context of time and place and usually includes more participants/characters, explicitly or implicitly. Through these, the reader receives information regarding the intrapersonal reality of the protagonist as well as of the intersubjective context in which she exists. A description of the protagonist that combines her subjectivity and the context of her real life, including its oppressive aspects, will reveal the relationship between the two—the participant and the social institutions in her context. The narrativization of the research participant enables us to explore women’s subjectivity both as influenced and created by the context of their real life as well as by her coping with it, either accepting it, partially accepting it, manipulating it, resisting it, or any combination of the above.</p>
<p>Narrativization, the location of the participant in a context of narrative, might be realized in various ways. For example, the research participant might be the one who writes the narrative on her own or with the researcher (as is the case in a participatory approach). In this case the research participant has the strongest ontological and epistemological status, since she serves not only as the protagonist but also as the writer, who defines the narrative’s content, form, genre, perspective, and point of view. But not every woman wants to write her narrative, for she and especially those living in poverty, might be too overloaded to invest the time and energy needed for writing. In this case, narrative might be written by the researcher herself. The key issue is not who writes the narrative but which point of view it reflects. It is possible for the researcher to expresses a point of view that is very close to that of the research participant, when a great closeness exists between the two of them. The narrative might be a life story, that is, a comprehensive account of a whole life, but it can also be limited to one period in life (e.g., childhood, old age) or to an aspect of life (illness story, employment story).</p>
<p>Very often narrative inquiry is based on interviews. The interviewee tells about her life, and the researcher uses what she heard in order to compose it into a narrative. However, the following short narratives were not written as a result of an interview, rather as the product of a long-term relationship with an ethnographic nature with a young woman. This relationship took place in the “Women’s Court,” but what stands at the center of the following narrative is not the relationship itself, its quality or impact, but the intimacy that characterized it and enabled Mirit to write the short narratives describing the real life of Lili.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>This morning Liora from the “Women’s Court” arrives to take Lili to the orthodontist. Lili suffers from severe dental disfigurement, the result of a dental condition that went untreated for many years. Today she has an initial appointment with the orthodontist, but repair will demand many more appointments over a long time period. Up until half a year ago, Lili thought her dental condition was never going to change, and now there is the doctor and the treatment; all of a sudden there is hope. Everyone says her condition is reparable and she will be beautiful. One day on their way to the doctor Lili said to Liora, “What do you think, I’ll be forever poor and ugly? At least I’ll be beautiful, and poor.”</p>
<p>On the same day, before the orthodontist’s appointment, they had to drop in at the local animal shelter. Lili has been looking for a home for her little dog for a long time now. She cannot stop crying. But there is no choice. She has nothing to eat for herself, let alone vaccinations and food for the dog. Her heart is torn, but she has no choice.</p>
<p>Yesterday she and her mother finally agreed to receive a food package from the soup kitchen. The delivery man was late and they waited, but in the end he didn’t show up. In the afternoon, Lili learned that in fact he had arrived, only to the wrong door. The neighbors from downstairs, a family who immigrated from Ethiopia, received the package and said nothing. Lili did not go to claim it from them. “They too have nothing,” she said, “so what, am I going to quarrel with them over food?” For the following 4 days, Lili and her mom had nothing to eat.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Through the lens of social work professional discourse, 17-year-old Lili would have been portrayed as a young woman who is involved in sex for money, uses drugs, is violent, has a criminal record, and is poor. Unlike the professional language that follows the scientific-logical discourse that breaks reality into predetermined universal categories, these episodes, exemplifying the “contextualized story method” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson, 1990</xref>) delineate her as a round, full human being, flesh out the context of Lili’s life and expose connections between events. The short narratives reveal her immediate problems, the context of poverty, and its impact on the way she perceives herself as a woman, her longing for her pet and the circumstances that prevent her from caring for it, her neighborhood, and her relationships with her neighbors. Although these are brief anecdotes, Lili herself, the main protagonist, is very present in them. Her perspective, that is, her point of view, is very evident too—she is cynical and sarcastic when referring to herself as “poor and ugly,” playing with the characterization as both a subjective image and an objective description; she expresses a sense of responsibility toward the little dog, when taking him to the animal shelter, although the act is in contrast to her wishes, and she is generous when making her neighbors’ dire need a priority despite her own similar destitution.</p>
<p>Despite their relative brevity, Lili’s narratives offer insight into the particularities of her subjectivity, agency, and the social, classed, and gendered context that is beyond her control. The few words describing Lili promote insights into the particularities of her life as well as to the nature of human experience in general. Lili’s subjectivity does not fall into either of the two hegemonic alternatives for women in poverty—the deviant woman or the miserable one—and also not to the romantic view reserved for people in poverty who made it against all odds. Lili is not a run-of-the-mill kind of heroine because she does not escape poverty. In fact, she does not fall into the conventional category of heroine at all. Nonetheless, through the detailed description of the everyday manifestations of poverty in her life, and of her response to these manifestations, the reader can appreciate her, and feel close to her, the way we can feel close to somebody who lives a different way of life than ours, but nevertheless her subjectivity resonates with us. This emotive impact of the narrative enables a bridge between different people, experiences, and worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson, 1990</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1077800411433546">
<title>Dialog</title>
<p>Dialog is the most appropriate literary form for expressing a variety of voices: These voices can agree with each other to create closeness, cooperation, and kinship, or they can disagree with each other and use give-and-take to uncover the nature, substance, and character of the disagreement in an effort to overcome it. A dialog, whether between two internal voices of the self or between two persons, is the foundation for self-awareness and attempts to put into play possibilities for change. Doubt, critical thinking, and questioning, all are necessary conditions for attaining self-awareness and personal and interpersonal change, can be expressed through dialog. Moreover, dialog affords the possibility of presenting a variety of perspectives and options so as to challenge the status quo and sketch the outline of an alternative to present reality. These characteristics turn dialog into a strategy with the potential of resisting Othering, since “the translation of difference into Otherness is a denial of dialogue, interaction and the possibility of change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1077800411433546">Pickering, 2001</xref>, p. 49).</p>
<p>However, dialog is also vulnerable to power relationships. Inspector Ohayon, a well-known Hebrew literary character, describes the difference between two dialog-based situations—psychoanalysis and a police interrogation—by asking his companion to imagine what he would feel when being asked by his psychoanalyst what he had done that day and what he would feel if he were asked the very same question during a police interrogation. We use Inspector Ohayon to demonstrate two types of power relationships and their possible influence on various types of dialogs. Although all dialogs and all social contexts involve power relationships, dialog remains one of the only viable routes to a democratic mode of expression.</p>
<p>The dialogic mode can be integrated into a qualitative research text in several different ways, two of which will be discussed here. The first is a direct representation in the writing of a dialog that had occurred in the interview, prior to the writing, and had invited the interviewee to interpret her own text. The second is a dialogic mode of writing in which the researcher/writer engages the reader of the text directly, referring to her interpretation and suggesting an alternative. These two dialogic modes are familiar to readers of literature. Here, we would regard them as specific forms of resisting Otherness, particularly when they focus on the process of interpretation of certain sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Our claim is that there are certain moments during an interview involving unequal power relationships, which are pitfalls for Othering. These moments occur when the interviewee either speaks or acts in a way that the interviewer finds hard to accept or understand because of her own values, class and ethnic background, or ideological beliefs. In such situations, researchers tend to treat this behavior as manifestations of Otherness, that is, as a manifestation of inferior behavior growing out of the interviewee’s membership in a certain social group. This usually happens instinctively: The researcher accepts her instinct as fact, “ignoring” basic interpreting procedures that are involved in the process. It is precisely in such situations that the researcher engages in Othering; that is, she perceives that the interviewee is acting irrationally, improperly, or in a way beyond her understanding. These are the interesting moments in an interview that demand special processing. If the interviewer records her interpretation of the moment in the research paper as if it were naked truth, she would be legitimizing her power as an interpreter and the writer of the research. In contrast, if she discusses it with the interviewee, her description would be richer and more complex and the text will be composed of a variety of voices and perspectives. In essence, the interviewee would not only provide information but would also be interpreting it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411433546">Keifer-Boyd (in press)</xref> writes about inviting research participants to respond critically to their stories as a feature of feminist qualitative methodology, and Nancy Naples (2003, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077800411433546">Keifer-Boyd, in press</xref>) similarly claims that “a reflective dialogic process can offer a context in which conflicts in interpretation are revealed and, more importantly, renegotiated in a more egalitarian fashion than is found in traditional social science methodology or in other approaches to activist research” Naples, (p. 201).</p>
<p>The second type of dialogic interaction might occur between the researcher and the reader of the research text. In this case the researcher/writer appeals directly to her readers and invites them to contribute their own interpretations, focusing their attention on the interpretive processes taking place in the text, carried out both by the researcher and her readers. This is a powerful rhetorical tool that exposes the mechanisms of the interpretational processes.</p>
<p>The following example illustrates the challenges involved in carrying out an interview in the arena of Othering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo, 2002</xref>) and writing about it. The writing will present the interview dialog on sensitive issues along with not only the researcher’s interpretation but also other possible interpretations that might be formed by readers who present the hegemonic perspective. The writer addresses her readers directly because she wants to warn them of the dangers of Othering, thus creating layers of dialog in the text.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is hard for me to hear Sarit saying, “If I get into a situation that I’m working and it doesn’t help, the wages from my work, I am capable of stealing, too,” because I believe her and because I assume that her “wages won’t help.” I feel her as a woman who fights for her life. Her wish to repair through her children the parts of her life she will never be able to repair can be stronger than the value “do not steal.” Her will to be for her children the kind of mother she did not have is based on the knowledge regarding the suffering and damage she went through in her relationship with her mother, who did not protect her and did not fight for her. Her decision to prioritize her children looks to me at that moment more moral than obedience to the law is. But while I understand her I become more and more worried:</p>

Why, when I was little, I would see kids hanging around with sweets, and I would be dying for some sweet, once a year they’d [Sarit’s parents] buy for me, I don’t want them [Sarit’s children] to be like me, I want it to be just the other way around, that other kids are jealous of them, that’s what I want, the opposite of what I was. As I was jealous of other kids, so I want that other kids to be jealous of them. That they wear the most beautiful clothes, that they are the neatest, the cleanest that I can. . . . Look here, I could now pay my rent for four months ahead [with the money she had received from the social welfare department] and get rid of this and have nothing to worry about, but no, I said, I’ll buy her a TV, I’ll buy her a video, that she can watch cartoons every day, that she can enjoy herself, that she doesn’t feel she doesn’t have it. <italic>Everything</italic>, no, not just TV, say “TV’s OK, she needs it,” but also video. I said, “Forget about it, I’ll spoil her, everything, whatever she wants, I’ll buy her.”</p>
</speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Will Sarit succeed in providing her children with everything they need without complications? I don’t know. I fear that this road may bring her and them to devastation. In my mind’s eye I can see the social worker’s criticism of her video purchase, classifying Sarit as “someone who doesn’t know how to budget,” the lack of willingness to continue providing her with a housing subsidy (because she hasn’t proven herself as deserving of this assistance), her desperation and aggressiveness, her objection to receiving help, the court appointment of a custody officer who will be responsible for looking after the children’s best interests, the increasing aggressiveness of both Sarit and the system. Does this difficult picture cause me to view Sarit in terms of serious psychopathology? Familial or social perversion? No. I also recommend that you not view Sarit as ill or deviant. I see in her as a woman who attempts to struggle against an established and organized social structure, much stronger than she is, one that determines whether she will have the right to an apartment or not, whether her children will remain in her custody or not. I see in her a woman who struggles against poverty and economic distress, memories of the past, depression, and an abusive husband, using the particular powers within her reach and despite certain weakness that are a part of her. Her choices, even when I may not approve of them, even when they seem ineffective or even destructive, seem to me logical within the complex context that she presents before me. The way in which she presents her choices does not seem to me shallow or superficial or lacking awareness or unintelligent. For certain, they do not seem to me to be an expression of a “culture of poverty.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo, 2006</xref>, pp. 93-95, translated from Hebrew)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When Sarit says that she gives her children unlimited chocolate, she is ready to steal so she can buy them “everything” and that she bought her daughter a television and VCR with rent money received from the Department of Social Welfare, she is providing troubling information. Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1077800411433546">Rainwater (1970)</xref> claims that for the middle class, the life stories of people living in poverty might be regarded as hostile information because it undermines their security within the existing social order. We call information that does not fit in with the ideology or values of the researcher/ interviewer <italic>troubling information</italic>, information liable to be interpreted to the research participant’s disadvantage, portraying her as an Other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1077800411433546">Sands &amp; Krumer-Nevo, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Situations that have the potential for such pitfalls require special attention during the writing of a research paper. The way this information is interpreted and presented in the research text should be sensitive, and attention should be paid to how readers will then interpret the interviewee’s behavior. By using the form of a dialog, various interpretations are represented, and a richer picture of the situation is obtained.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the interview Michal conducted with Sarit about the troubling information was an open dialog. Sarit was afforded the opportunity to describe her perspective on the information and to place it in the context of her personal history.</p>
<p>The dialog affords Sarit the opportunity to reflect on her choices and reveal the logic behind her seemingly “irrational” behavior. When she gives her children unlimited chocolate, it can easily be assumed that she is not aware of the possible ramifications on her children’s dental health or that she is not able to set them boundaries. But when she is asked to explain, to interpret this behavior, she ties it to her history and biography, as she describes it within the context of her childhood. Through such a dialog regarding sensitive questions, the interviewee, Sarit, explicitly analyzes her story, which includes both the material and social context of her life and the internal-psychological-emotional context. According to Sarit, giving her children chocolate whenever they ask is a means of providing them the feeling they are with an adult who can provide for their needs, who loves them, and is attentive to them.</p>
<p>Accordingly, buying a television and VCR is not a manifestation of her inability to budget or of poor judgment, but of her desire to provide her children with the cultural capital other children have, all the while realizing that the welfare authorities are obligated to help her find housing even if she has used the money they gave her for other purposes. The way she sees it, if she were to use the money to pay her rent, there would be no source for funds to buy a television and VCR in the foreseeable future. Legitimate knowledge is not usually attributed to people living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077800411433546">Beresford &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077800411433546">Lister, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1077800411433546">Tardieu, 1999</xref>), and they are especially not recognized as possessing theoretical and analytical capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077800411433546">Beresford, 2000</xref>). By revealing how Sarit analyzes her behavior, it is placed within the social context and in the context of her personal history and biography, which would not find expression in other types of writing.</p>
<p>Despite that a dialog of this type is carried out within the context of clear power relationships, it is open enough to allow space for two interpretations that are the polar opposites of each other. Obviously, in order for such a dialog to take place the interviewee must feel the interviewer is not criticizing her but is really and truly interested in understanding her position.</p>
<p>This complex dialog involves directly addressing the reader. The writing not only presents the interpretation processes of the researcher but also demands that the readers participate in the interpretation process. Thus, three different perspectives have been presented in the text—that of Sarit, that of the writer, and that of the implied readers.</p>

<title>Reflexivity</title>
<p>Reflexivity posits the interviewer/researcher inside the text—the object-subject of examination and study. It is a “provocative weave of story and theory” (Spry, 2001, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411433546">Humphreys, 2005</xref>) that reveals the researcher’s epistemological, ontological, methodological premises (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 1998, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411433546">Humphreys, 2005</xref>), her political/ideological agendas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1077800411433546">Richardson, 2000</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411433546">Humphreys, 2005</xref>), and her personality (Punch, 1998, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077800411433546">Humphreys, 2005</xref>). The look inward can be directed toward one’s self, one’s history and position, as an articulation of one’s analytically situated self, what Macbeth calls “positional reflexivity,” or toward the hidden, transparent, or unnoticed authorial and textual workings, “textual reflexivity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077800411433546">Macbeth, 2001</xref>). Usually reflexivity is a cognitive process that focuses on one’s own thoughts, memories, or sometimes, emotions. In this article we use reflexivity also to acknowledge bodily experience and analyze it as a response to the research encounter. In this case we understand the interview encounter as a place of interpersonal relationship where the interviewee transfers her feelings, emotions, or experiences not only through words but also through unaware communication. This use of reflexivity is similar to what is called in psychoanalysis projective identification, where the client projects upon the therapist her painful feelings as a way of communication, and the therapist struggles to use understanding and interpretation as the method of working through the mutual desire to act out the client’s core fantasies and feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1077800411433546">Waska, 1999</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077800411433546">Gemignani, 2011</xref>). In the following example, Michal uses reflexivity on her own responses in order to understand parts of Michelle’s life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’m interviewing Michelle, at her request, late Saturday evening, in her home. Her husband, once a drug addict who came clean, is currently serving a prison sentence. Michelle has 10 years of schooling, grew up with 7 siblings, in a family that she defines as “troubled”—an alcoholic abusive father, in a “bad neighborhood.” As a child she was “sexually abused,” as she says, by one of her brothers. When we made an appointment for the interview, she asked that I come late at night, “so that the kids would be sleeping and we’d have some quiet,” but in fact we are sitting and talking in her living room with Guy, the 18-month-old baby next to us in a carry-cot and Sheila, Michelle’s eldest daughter, an active, alert, curious, and intelligent child of 4 hovering around us. Sheila refuses to go to sleep, regardless of Michelle’s pleas, demands, or threats. She sits there listening to us, or plays by our side, or tries to draw our attention. She touches the taperecorder, asks questions, brings me a book, and tells me a story.</p>
<p>An opportunity to talk and tell about her life does not come Michelles’ way very often, and she plunges into her memories. She speaks with great openness about her adolescence and her early 20s, her drug addiction, about working in prostitution, and about the man who was then simultaneously her boyfriend and her pimp. After he was murdered, she felt that she “must fight for her life” and handed herself over to the police with the intention of being imprisoned and entering a rehabilitation program. She succeeded. In prison, she kicked her habit, and in the rehab program she met her husband and became pregnant.</p>
<p>The baby has fallen asleep in the meantime, but Sheila is still playing at our side, sometimes listening. Michelle ignores her, immersed in her story. When we are finished, it is close to midnight. She asks me to “give her a lift to the gas station close by to get some cigarettes.” Sheila asks to bring her some candy. We walk out. A 4-year-old little girl and her sleeping baby brother remain in the apartment. On our way to the car, I look up and see Sheila standing in the window and looking at us with a sad and worried gaze. Michelle buys cigarettes and candy and I take her back home. The ride there and back again takes several minutes.</p>
<p>What does the interview with Michelle address? What is its central content? Is it the story of deviation or psychopathology? Is it the story of poverty and deprivation? Or is it the story of motherhood as a vehicle for rehabilitation? I learn about the most disturbing nature of its content through my stomachache, which suddenly comes on after I arrive home. It records an experience of life endured with great pain. I feel it clearly, in a concrete way, in my stomach. The source of my physical pain is the combination of listening to Michelle’s story, becoming aware of the fragility of her motherhood, the fact that she does not prevent Sheila from listening to the grueling things she tells me, and the little girl’s pain, whose eyes, look at us with what seemed to me as great fear, haunt me as I read the transcribed interview. In her mutterings recorded on the tape, I discover direct responses to things that she heard and understood. There is pain in Michelle’s life, and there is pain in Sheila’s life. I am a witness to this pain, and I feel it forcefully for a moment, for a few hours or days. After the acute pain passes, a sense of responsibility remains, and with it arises the desire to write, to document, to draw conclusions, and first of all to share with others the sense of responsibility. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo, 2006</xref>, pp 72-73, translated from Hebrew)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The encounter with Michelle had a powerful effect on my, Michal’s, own body. It was a realization of my own full presence at what the ethnographers call “the field.” The <italic>stomachache</italic> was a metaphor as well as a literal response to Michelle and to the impact her story had on me. Similar in some ways to what happens through projective identification, I felt what she tried to share with me, explicitly or implicitly. Reflecting on my own bodily experience was not only a vehicle for the humanist experience of recognizing the other but a political experience of a gap in power relationships. In this case, the physical experience was both an experience of difference (because of its personal and intimate nature) and an experience of similarity and sameness (because I understood it to be a reflection of Michelle’s pain). This experience of simultaneity between difference and sameness is the source of solidarity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1077800411433546">Rorty (1989</xref>, p. 192) claims that “solidarity is not thought of as recognition of a core self, the human essence, in all human beings. Rather, it is thought of as the ability to see more and more traditional differences (of tribe, religion, race, customs, and the like) as unimportant in comparison with similarities with respect to pain and humiliation—the ability to think of people wildly different from ourselves as included in the range of ‘us’” (p. 192). Solidarity between “same people” denies the psychological and sociological distances between people; solidarity between totally different people is not possible. A sense of connectedness between people who are simultaneously similar and different is what we call solidarity.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Although Othering is considered in psychology as an essential part of the process of differentiation of the Self from Others, we adopt a more specific definition of Othering, namely, as the attribution of inferiority to difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1077800411433546">Schwalbe et al., 2000</xref>). Using this definition, we charge Othering with political significance, moving it from psychology to sociology, from that process of developing a sense of self that occurs in the arena of interpersonal relationships to the process of developing a sense of self that occurs in the arena of hierarchical social order. We claim that the attribution of inferiority to certain social groups appears not only in the media or in public discourse but also in academic writing. As Richardson shows, the conventions of academic writing reflect the historic domination of certain paradigms. “<italic>How</italic> we are expected to write affects <italic>what</italic> we can write about,” says <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson (1990</xref>, p. 16). What are considered legitimate academic genres, vocabulary, and rhetorical strategies, influence the participants and issues of our writing, and in our case, brings about the exclusion of women who live in poverty from being treated as “one of us.”</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo and Benjamin (2010)</xref> analyze the production of Othering in various theoretical and ideological streams of academic poverty knowledge and claim that Othering might be produced even in critical poverty knowledge. However, Othering can be decreased by certain research traditions, such as participatory action research, or under certain conditions in ethnography. In this article, we examined the contributions of three well-known modes of writing— narrative, dialog, and reflexivity—to the mitigation of Othering in poverty knowledge. We call for texts to avoid or resist Othering by containing the following aspects: It should reconstruct the context of the lives in poverty and the history of the people described; it has to make space for research participants’ voices and knowledges, giving particular attention not only to their experiences and emotions but also to their theories and analyses regarding their circumstances and relationships (on the differentiation between “voice” and “knowledge,” see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077800411433546">Krumer-Nevo, 2009</xref>); the author’s presence as an interpretative authority should be part of the text. By the realization of these elements in the presented examples, we hope that the text researchers write will give an embodied sense of the lived experiences of poverty, which will affect our readers both cognitively and emotionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson, 1990</xref>) and will create a meeting between those who never meet across the great divide between their social positions.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that in order for these modes to resist Othering they have to be built upon a critical understanding of poverty and inequality, that is, that poverty is a condition that is brought about by structures and organizations and not by any faults of the people themselves. Once a researcher wishes to contribute to the body of critical poverty knowledge, these strategies can be helpful in the avoidance of Othering. Otherwise, without a critical stance regarding poverty, these strategies are not sufficient to resist Othering, and in fact, one can use them even to contribute to constructing people in poverty as Others: A narrative can tell a flat story, which is built only on psychological determination; a dialog can be a manifestation of the participant’s “wrong” attitudes, opinions, and way of thinking; and reflexivity can be used for narcissistic purposes, giving no new insights regarding the people the researcher meets. Moreover, Othering is only partially in the hands of the researcher. A significant part of Othering is in the eyes of the readers and not under the control of the author. Changing time and social conventions of discourse may portray certain ways of writing as contributing to Othering, although they were not considered that way originally.</p>
<p>However, an analysis of writing practices can provide some protection from Othering. This analysis is evidence of self-awareness and of an absence of naïveté in the textual stance (Derrida, 1982, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1077800411433546">Richardson, 1990</xref>). The efforts to increase self-awareness and unveil the absence of naïveté cannot serve as a definitive solution for the problems and challenges of representation and are not always successful.</p>
<p>Although we cannot completely avoid Othering, we choose to write. We look for ways that will preserve our ethical commitment despite the inevitable power relationships that the representation issue inevitably reflects. We choose to “work the hyphens” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077800411433546">Fine, 1994</xref>) between the Self and the Other, to describe the complex reality of relationships and involvement in a way that provides opportunities for the growth of a novel awareness of the “object” of the research.</p>
