<abstract>
<p>On their first class day, introductory psychology students took a 14-question multiple-choice pretest on several principles of memory including primacy, recency, storage, retrieval, counterbalancing, and the free-recall method. I randomly preassigned students to come at one of two different times to the second class, 2 days later, when they either participated in a free-recall demonstration/debriefing or heard a lecture on comparable material. In the third class, five days later, they took a posttest identical to the pretest. On the posttest but not the pretest, students participating in the demonstration/debriefing significantly outperformed those hearing only the lecture.</p>

<p>Considering that psychology is a social science grounded in research, many psychology instructors include demonstrations, experiments, and other research-related activities in their courses. Although previous literature has generally provided detailed information on how to implement a given demonstration (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0098628311430170">Benjamin, Nodine, Ernst, &amp; Broeker, 1999</xref>), the reported methods of evaluating the activity have varied considerably. Regarding demonstrations of cognitive concepts, for instance, in some reports the evaluation has consisted of statistics showing a reliable replication of a particular cognitive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0098628311430170">Chaffin &amp; Hermann, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0098628311430170">Forsyth &amp; Wibberly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0098628311430170">Katz, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0098628311430170">Motes &amp; Wiegmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0098628311430170">Thieman, 1984</xref>). In other reports, the authors have used students’ subjective ratings of how much they learned from the activity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0098628311430170">Clump, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0098628311430170">Kelley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0098628311430170">Merwin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0098628311430170">Miserandino, 1991</xref>). Some reports have included objective evaluations of learning based on a comparison of pretest and posttest performance on test questions related to the topic of the demonstration. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0098628311430170">Bugg, DeLosh, and McDaniel (2008)</xref> found that students performed significantly better on multiple-choice questions about semantic processing after participating in a depth-of-processing experiment than they did before participating.</p>
<p>Some recent reports have further shown that, compared to lecture-only control groups, introductory psychology students participating in a classroom feature-present/feature-absent experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430170">Balch, 2010</xref>) and also a classroom pinhole-camera demonstration with cognitive implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks, 2005</xref>) scored significantly higher on a posttest but not on a pretest. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430170">Kahan &amp; Mathis (2007)</xref> found similar results in evaluating an online short-term memory (STM) scanning demonstration. However, they used only posttests and not pretests in comparing the demonstration group with reading-only and graphing-activity controls. These results suggest that some demonstrations have objective learning benefits that instructors (in considering whether to use the demo) might weigh against the costs of extra in-class or out-of-class time for students and extra preparation time for instructors that the demos often entail.</p>
<p>Such demonstrations may also involve other costs instructors need to consider. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0098628311430170">Copeland, Scott, and Houska (2010)</xref> have pointed out that demonstrations tend to focus on illustrating basic effects rather than on improving higher level or theoretical understanding. If a demonstration takes place outside of class, these authors also note, students might not want to expend much additional effort in studying relevant supplementary material, such as reading assignments. Copeland et al. compared the test performance of students in a cognitive psychology course under two randomly assigned conditions: either computer-based demonstrations (e.g., attentional interference and the Stroop effect) plus reading, or reading only. There was no significant difference between these conditions regarding scores on quiz (fill-in-the-blank and short-answer) questions. On exam (multiple-choice) questions and essay questions, in fact, reading-only students scored higher than did demonstration-plus-reading students. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0098628311430170">Elliott, Rice, Trafimow, Madson, and Hipshur (2010)</xref> found no difference in performance on a multiple-choice posttest between introductory psychology students who participated in an out-of-class research experiment/debriefing versus students in a lecture-only control condition. However, both groups showed learning benefits in terms of pretest-to-posttest improvement.</p>
<p>The literature described above suggests that demonstrations may be most effective when instructors implement the demonstrations in introductory psychology courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430170">Balch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430170">Kahan &amp; Mathis, 2007</xref>) in which the emphasis is on students’ learning of basic knowledge. Classroom demonstrations may also be more effective than out-of-class demos, in which the extra time students spend may discourage them from other related study (Copeland et al., 2010). Accordingly, my rationale in developing a free-recall demonstration was to provide a brief classroom activity for introductory psychology students, illustrating some basic memory principles. In keeping with recent practices (e.g., Elliott et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks, 2005</xref>), I evaluated the learning benefits of the demo by comparing two randomly assigned instructional conditions (demo/debriefing versus lecture only) on pretest and posttest performance.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>One hundred fifty-six students in my two Fall 2010 morning sections of introductory psychology participated for extra credit. Each section met twice a week for 75 min. The statistical analyses excluded an additional 17 students who were absent on 1 or more of the 3 class days involved in this study. The demo/debriefing (52 women and 26 men) and lecture-only (51 women and 27 men) instructional conditions each consisted of 78 randomly assigned students. This feature differed from the nonrandom assignment of intact classes to conditions involved in Balch’s (2010) aforementioned study.</p>

<p>Based on class lists, students then received random assignments to instructional conditions. Without identifying the nature of the conditions, I asked students assigned to each condition to come to the next class at different times. The order of arrival times for each condition was counterbalanced across the two introductory psychology sections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0098628311430170">
<title>Demonstration/debriefing</title>
<p>On the 2nd class day, 2 days later, students in this condition participated in a free-recall demo. Because the recency effect is small with visually presented items (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0098628311430170">Beaman &amp; Morton, 2000</xref>), I presented the words orally. To counterbalance word orders, I tested three subgroups separately at 10-min intervals: first, students with birthdays ending with 1 to 10; second, those with birthdays ending with 11 to 20; third, those with birthdays ending with 21 to 31. Each subgroup heard me read, in one of three orders and at the rate of one word every 3 s, the following words: <italic>radio</italic>, <italic>notebook</italic>, <italic>cigarette</italic>, <italic>lettuce</italic>, <italic>airplane</italic>, <italic>chalk</italic>, <italic>dish</italic>, <italic>wheel</italic>, <italic>flute</italic>, <italic>elephant</italic>, <italic>lightning</italic>, <italic>street</italic>. In each order, each third of the list occurred in a different position (first, middle, or last). After reading the last word, I used a bell sound to signal students to begin recalling. Students in each subgroup wrote the words in any order they wished on a different-colored recall sheet. <italic>Radio</italic>, <italic>dish</italic>, and <italic>street </italic>were the first, middle (seventh), or last words, respectively, for the students with blue sheets; <italic>dish</italic>, <italic>street</italic>, and <italic>radio</italic>, respectively, for those with green sheets; and <italic>street</italic>, <italic>radio</italic>, and <italic>dish</italic>, respectively, for those with tan sheets. After 90 s of the 2-min recall period, I gave students a retrieval cue, <italic>animal</italic>, and asked them to write any additional word that they may have recalled. Students in each subgroup left their recall sheets face down on their desks after being tested and left the classroom. The demonstration required about 5 min per subgroup, with another 5 min allowed for the transition between each subgroup. All the students reconvened for a debriefing during the last 10 min of the 40 min designated for this condition.</p>
<p>In the debriefing, I had shows of hands reveal how many recalled the word <italic>elephant </italic>only after I said <italic>animal </italic>(illustrating an item probably stored from the list but retrieved only with the cue), how many recalled <italic>elephant </italic>without the cue (illustrating storage with spontaneous retrieval), and how many did not recall <italic>elephant </italic>(illustrating an item probably not stored from the list). Next I told students the first, middle, and last word for each of the three recall sheets; had shows of hands reveal how many remembered each word; and wrote the resulting numbers on the blackboard by the words <italic>first</italic>, <italic>middle</italic>, and <italic>last</italic>. As I wrote key terms (<italic>storage</italic>, <italic>retrieval</italic>, <italic>primacy</italic>, <italic>recency</italic>, etc.), I explained the memory principles while referring to the demo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0098628311430170">
<title>Lecture only</title>
<p>In this condition, exactly as in the demo/debriefing, I explained and wrote on the blackboard the same key terms. Because the students did not participate in the free-recall demonstration, I described the typical results of such a demonstration. To illustrate storage and retrieval, I used the same example of the word <italic>elephant </italic>and the retrieval cue <italic>animal</italic> as well as the same explanations for not remembering <italic>elephant</italic>, for remembering it without the cue, and for remembering it with the cue. Likewise, I referred to a hypothetical list including the words <italic>radio</italic>, <italic>dish</italic>, and <italic>street</italic> to illustrate primacy, recency, and counterbalancing. I read from a prepared statement, worded as similarly as possible to the statement I used in the debriefing of the demo/debriefing condition. The lecture required about 15 min, approximately the same as the demonstration (5 min) plus the debriefing (10 min).</p>

<p>On the 3rd class day, 5 days after the demonstration/debriefing or lecture only, students took a posttest identical to the pretest.</p>

<sec id="section8-0098628311430170">
<title>Results</title>
<p>To evaluate learning benefits of the demo/debriefing, I performed a 2 × 2 (Instructional Condition × Time of Test) analysis of variance in which instructional condition (demo/debriefing or lecture-only) was defined between participants and time of test (pretest or posttest) within participants. The criterion for statistical significance was <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, and η<sup>2</sup> (a generalization of <italic>r</italic>
<sup>2</sup>) measured effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0098628311430170">American Psychological Association, 1994</xref>, p. 18).</p>
<p>A modest Instructional Condition × Time of Test interaction reflects the learning benefits of the demo/debriefing relative to that of the lecture, <italic>F</italic>(1, 154) = 11.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .07. Post hoc comparisons reveal that demo/debriefing students answered more questions correctly (<italic>M</italic> = 10.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.04) compared to lecture-only students (<italic>M</italic> = 9.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.28) on the 14-question posttest, <italic>t</italic>(154) = 3.70, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Yet on the identical pretest, demo/debriefing (<italic>M</italic> = 8.29, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.04) and lecture-only scores (<italic>M</italic> = 8.15, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.99) did not significantly differ, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 1, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10. Combined across instructional condition, however, posttest performance averaged significantly higher (10.19) than pretest performance (8.22), <italic>F</italic>(1, 154) = 131.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .46, suggesting that overall both instructional conditions were teaching effective.</p>

<sec id="section9-0098628311430170">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In developing and evaluating my free-recall demonstration, I tried to adhere to what recent literature on cognitive demonstrations suggests are some elements of sound design, such as the use of a control group (e.g., Copeland et al., 2010), both pretest as well as posttest assessments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430170">Balch, 2010</xref>; Bugg et al., 2008), and random assignments of participants to groups (e.g., Copeland et al., 2010; Elliott et al., 2010). The evaluation of my demonstration is most similar to that of the aforementioned demo of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks (2005)</xref>, in that the design included all those elements. Moreover, in both cases, the participants were introductory psychology students and the demonstration or lecture occurred in class.</p>
<p>Even when statistically significant, the learning benefits of demonstrations over lecturing can be relatively small. For instance, in my evaluation and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks (2005)</xref>, the effect sizes of η<sup>2</sup> = .07 and η<sup>2</sup> = .11, respectively, for the learning benefits of the demonstration/debriefing over the lecture-only control are significant but modest. Yet the main effects of pretest-to-posttest improvement, whether it was from the demonstration/debriefing or lecture only, are considerably larger, with effect sizes of η<sup>2</sup> = .46 and η<sup>2</sup> = .49, respectively.</p>
<p>As with other cognitive demonstrations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0098628311430170">Balch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0098628311430170">Prull &amp; Banks, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430170">Kahan &amp; Mathis, 2007</xref>), my free-recall demonstration might be most appropriate when used in introductory courses to illustrate basic effects. In addition, classroom demos may be particularly suitable. Among three evaluations of online or other out-of-class activities (Copeland et al., 2010; Elliott et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0098628311430170">Kahan &amp; Mathis, 2007</xref>), only the latter showed learning benefits of the demonstration condition compared to nondemonstration controls. Classroom activities, such as my free-recall demonstration, allow direct interaction between instructor and students as well as a social environment due to group participation in the demo. Perhaps one or both of these features helps provide the kind of student engagement and motivation that facilitates learning.</p>
<p>Instructors could modify this free-recall demonstration to suit their particular classes or to save time. Unless teachers wanted to compare a demo/debriefing condition to a lecture-only control as I did, they need be concerned only with the demo/debriefing. In addition, instructors might wish to use only one word order for the free-recall test, simply mentioning that counterbalancing would rule out effects of individual words. Although not novel, my demonstration provides a relatively efficient illustration of a few of the basic principles that instructors often teach in the memory portion of introductory psychology courses (e.g., the free recall method, storage, retrieval, primacy, recency, and counterbalancing). The free-recall demo takes about 5 min per word order, and the debriefing takes about 10 min. Thus the demo/debriefing could make a short, teaching-effective supplement to an instructor’s coverage of memory.</p>
