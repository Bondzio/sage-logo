<p>José A. Pagola’s book is a refreshing and easily accessible resource that has brought a wealth of scholarly discussion on the person of Jesus to the general public. The preface states clearly Pagola’s intent in undertaking this project, namely, ‘to “approximate” Jesus with historical rigor and in simple language, to bring his person and his message closer to today’s men and women’ (p. 16). This he accomplishes with clarity and style.</p>
<p>Pagola’s work depicts a Jesus who was born into a non-landowning family that lived in an impoverished village of Galilee under the indirect rule of the Roman Empire. Jesus is represented as a ‘non-conformist’ (p. 319), whose sole purpose is to spread of the news of God’s present, yet still ensuing reign. This message is expressed though his rejection of Jewish legalism, the mistreatment of marginalised peoples, and the exclusion of women. According to Pagola, Jesus’ radical actions (specifically the temple disturbance) caught the attention of the Jewish priesthood, who were ultimately responsible for his death (pp. 322-3). Pagola describes Jesus as having understood his death ‘as a service to God’s reign’ (p. 335), not an immolation to God for the sake of humanity. Pagola’s final chapters include detailed reconstructions of Jesus’ torture and execution, along with a thought provoking section on the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Pagola’s <italic>Jesus: An Historical Approximation</italic> makes no attempt to lay out bold new claims or contribution to biblical studies. It is better understood as a slightly ‘heavier’ than usual introduction to historical Jesus study. Pagola’s is a gifted communicator who pulls from his deep well of scientific, historical, and archaeological knowledge to create a historically plausible scene for the modern reader. His account of the social, religious, and economic realities of various geographical locations helps the reader to understand Jesus from the first century context. The body of the text, combined with an incredible collection of resources in the appendix and bibliographical material, mark Pagola’s work as a valuable asset for individuals at all levels of interest in the historical Jesus.</p>
<p>Pagola is very cautious to qualify his historical approximations in nearly all instances, and he remains faithful to the scholarly works he cites, though he does, on occasion, claim general or universal historical acceptance of Biblical and ancient passages which may still be the subject of disagreement (p. 138). Also, his argument that the lack of material concerning Jesus’ pre-ministry life in the gospels must indicate the absence of a wife/family is unconvincing (p. 70). Though in actuality Pagola may be correct about Jesus’ marital status, his argument is weak. Surely, it is equally plausible that the gospel authors considered such a detail as unimportant/unrelated material to Jesus’ ministry, and thus neglected.</p>
<p><italic>Jesus: An Historical Approximation</italic> represents a successful attempt by José A. Pagola to make the life of Jesus and the historical figure, both meaningful and interesting to the everyday reader. His invitation to readers from all religious persuasions and educational backgrounds is well founded, as there is surely something here for everyone, whether informational or inspirational.</p>
