<p>Works dealing with the Waffen SS are a popular perennial, although most tend to plough the same furrow of merely narrating Waffen SS operations with a minimum of analysis or referencing. John A. English's <italic>Surrender Invites Death</italic> provides a welcome exception to this general rule by providing both, addressing the question of ‘who were the Waffen SS’ at the outset before moving on to compare and contrast the performance of the Waffen SS formations deployed in Normandy with their Allied counterparts. Unsurprisingly, given his service background in the Canadian Land Forces, English's approach is a little Canadian-centric although none the worse for it; his interest in the subject was sparked by researching the fighting between the Canadian Army and 12th SS Panzer Division ‘Hitlerjugend’ in the initial stages of the Normandy campaign, and the title of the book is lifted from an address about engaging Waffen SS troops by Lieutenant General Henry Crerar, commander of the Canadian 1st Army, delivered on 5 August 1944.</p>
<p>Overall the work is physically well presented, consisting of an introduction and conclusion in addition to ten chapters. The latter are well footnoted, with each chapter containing between 14 and 36 entries, mostly to secondary sources, although these are leavened with some primary material and translated Waffen SS unit histories by high-ranking SS veterans. All this is supported by an extensive and properly configured bibliography, a useful index, and two appendices, one dealing with the characteristics of the tanks, anti-tank weapons, and artillery employed by both sides, and the other providing rank comparisons for the Waffen SS, SA, Heer, and British and US armies; gratifyingly, English uses the correct Waffen SS ranks throughout rather than substituting better known but frequently less accurate Allied equivalents. There are also eight clear and legible maps inserted throughout to illustrate the accompanying text, although a separate list of these in the table of contents would have been useful.</p>
<p>The first two chapters are intended to set the scene for what follows. Chapter 1 examines the roots, establishment, growth, and employment of the Waffen SS in some detail up to Operation Barbarossa, and makes the argument that it was the integration of Theodor Eicke's Totenkopfverbände concentration camp organization into the Waffen SS that changed its character for the worse. Chapter 2 details and analyses Waffen SS deployment on the eastern front and the impact this had upon its subsequent development, drawing the valid conclusion that the Waffen SS experience amounted to a relative handful of tactical successes outweighed by overall strategic defeat.</p>
<p>The remaining chapters address the fighting in Normandy between June and August 1944, from the Allied perspective, in eight chronological steps. Chapters 3 and 4 thus examine the initial clashes with the Waffen SS and between the Canadians and the Hitlerjugend, in particular in the first few days after the invasion, and Operation Epsom and the encounter between Obersturmführer Wittmann of Schwere SS Panzer Abteilung 101 and elements of the British 7th Armoured Division at Villers-Bocage respectively. The fighting to secure the western approaches to the city of Caen is detailed in chapter 5, while chapter 6 deals with Operation Goodwood and the attacks from the east that finally secured the city. Chapter 7 covers the subsequent Canadian push south from Caen and the US Cobra break-out at the western extremity of the Allied beachhead, while chapter 8 details the German counter-attack at Mortain; chapters 9 and 10 cover the Canadian attack toward Falaise, and the battle to seal the Falaise Gap respectively. All this is rounded off nicely with a comprehensive conclusion that ties together the various analytical threads running through the operational narrative by objectively examining first the performance of the Waffen SS in Normandy and then that of its Allied opponents.</p>
<p>Overall, the work hits its intended target by providing a well written and comprehensive account of the fighting against the Waffen SS in Normandy that backs cogent analysis and objective argument with properly researched and referenced evidence. A bit more primary source material would perhaps have lent more weight in places, and on occasion the author appears to be less than sure of his ground. A reference to the Red Army finally getting the measure of blitzkrieg at the time of Stalingrad suggests lack of awareness of Soviet deep battle doctrine and that the German version was arguably a less capable post-dated adaptation, for example. There is also arguably too much emphasis upon the role of Tiger and Panther tanks in Waffen SS combat effectiveness, given the larger number of less powerful tanks, assault guns, and anti-tank guns employed by the SS formations in Normandy. Perhaps the major flaw is the work's brevity, which in places obliges skimping where expansion is merited; the contention that the character of the Waffen SS as a whole was degraded by the integration of the Totenkopfverbände is a case in point. Nonetheless, <italic>Surrender Invites Death</italic> provides a very useful starting point and primer for further research into the Waffen SS and the Normandy campaign alike.</p>
