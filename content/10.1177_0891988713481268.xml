<abstract>
<p>Previous studies suggested that patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia can have impaired and declining financial skills and abilities. The purpose of this study is to test a clinically applicable method, based on the contemporary legal standard, to examine directly the mental capacity to make financial decisions and its component decision-making abilities among patients with MCI and early dementia. A total of 90 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), 92 participants with MCI, and 93 cognitively normal control participants were recruited for this study. Their mental capacity to make everyday financial decisions was assessed by clinician ratings and the Chinese version of the Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-Making (ACED). Based on the clinician ratings, only 53.5% were found to be mentally competent in the AD group, compared with 94.6% in the MCI group. However, participants with MCI had mild but significant impairment in understanding, appreciating, and reasoning abilities as measured by the ACED. The ACED provided a reliable and clinically applicable structured framework for assessment of mental capacity to make financial decisions.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>As in many parts of the world, with the aging population in Hong Kong, the number of persons with cognitive impairment or dementia is also increasing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891988713481268">1</xref>
</sup> Patients with dementia are vulnerable to the loss of decision-making capacity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891988713481268">2</xref>
</sup> Proper assessment of mental capacity in making financial decisions can contribute to protection of their welfare, prevention of elder financial abuse, and promotion of their autonomy.</p>
<p>The capacity to manage financial affairs has been conceptualized as drawing on a group of related domains, comprising a broad set of simple and complex abilities, including financial conceptual knowledge, counting coins/currency, making daily purchases, managing a checkbook, making investments, and exercising financial judgement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891988713481268">3</xref>
</sup> Studies have suggested that patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia can have impaired and declining financial skills and abilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481268">4</xref>

</sup> There is a pressing need to develop and test a clinically applicable tool that allows clinicians to identify these impairments quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>Decision-making capacity is generally conceptualized as having 4 component abilities that include understanding the relevant information, appreciating the information, reasoning with the information, and expressing a choice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891988713481268">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891988713481268">10</xref>
</sup> In Hong Kong, under the policy of “One Country, Two Systems,” the common law principles of the English courts, such as <italic>Re C </italic>(Adult: Refusal of Treatment),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891988713481268">11</xref>
</sup> on mental capacity remain relevant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891988713481268">2</xref>
</sup> Following these legal principles, mental capacity assessment in Hong Kong generally requires assessment of all the 4 component decision-making abilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891988713481268">12</xref>
</sup> This approach is consistent with contemporary legal requirements for mental competence, as exemplified by the mental capacity standard in section 3 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 of the United Kingdom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891988713481268">13</xref>
</sup> The importance of directly assessing decision-making capacity based on these criteria is increasingly recognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891988713481268">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891988713481268">15</xref>
</sup> The goal of this study is to test a clinically applicable method, applying this standard, to directly examine the mental capacity to make financial decisions and its component decision-making abilities among patients with MCI or early dementia. The relationship between these decisional abilities and cognitive and functional measures are also examined.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>In this study, 90 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), 92 participants with amnestic MCI, and 93 cognitively normal control participants were recruited from local social centers and residential hostels for the elderly in Hong Kong. The participants were all volunteers older than 60 years who responded to announcements and advertisements at the centers and hostels. They were recruited for a study of mental capacities for making everyday life decisions and treatment decisions among community-dwelling Chinese patients with MCI and mild dementia. All participants were assessed by a trained geriatric psychiatrist, and 3 groups of patients were recruited. Cognitively normal controls were neurologically intact, cognitively normal older adults with an absence of medical and psychiatric conditions that could compromise cognition. Participants with amnestic MCI were diagnosed using the criteria for MCI that were locally adapted by our research team, including (1) subjective memory complaints, (2) objective memory impairment, based on delayed recall of list learning test scores 1.5 standard deviations (SD) or more below the norm obtained from cognitively intact patients (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] = 0) in the corresponding age and education group in a local epidemiological study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891988713481268">16</xref>
</sup> and (3) clinically not demented. These criteria have been found to be comparable to the original Mayo criteria<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891988713481268">17</xref>
</sup> for the local older age population. The CDR staging<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891988713481268">18</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891988713481268">19</xref>
</sup> was used to evaluate the severity of dementia. If a participant had a CDR of 1 (mild dementia), the diagnosis of AD was established based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable or possible AD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891988713481268">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The exclusion criteria included a CDR of 2 or above or the presence of profound communication difficulties. One of the research team’s psychiatrists explained the details of the study and obtained written informed consent from each participant. The study was approved by the institutional ethical review board.</p>

<p>The Assessment of Capacity for Everyday Decision-Making (ACED)<sup>

</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891988713481268">22</xref>
</sup> was used to measure the 4 decision-making abilities. It was developed for the assessment of everyday decision making in a Western population of older adults with very mild to moderate late-life cognitive impairments.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891988713481268">22</xref>
</sup> This tool was translated into Chinese with back-translation and minor modifications with excellent interrater reliability and internal consistency.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891988713481268">23</xref>
</sup> Two focus groups were organized to evaluate the comprehensiveness, relevancy, and cultural appropriateness of the Chinese ACED. The Chinese ACED, like the original ACED, has 3 versions for different activities of daily living. These include preparing meals, managing medications, and managing money. In this study, the version on money management was used. Before the ACED interview, the patients’ functional ability was evaluated. The patients and their close relatives or caregivers of the social centers and residential hostels were asked to report any evidence of the patients’ financial management difficulties in everyday life. The information regarding these functional deficits was collected to allow the ACED instrument content to be tailored to each patient. For patients without identified money management problems, a standardized hypothetical scenario, which described a patient with dementia and difficulty in managing everyday financial issues, was used. Hypothetical scenarios have been used extensively in capacity assessment studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891988713481268">24</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891988713481268"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0891988713481268">26</xref>
</sup> for research on specific diagnostic groups. The interviewer used the structured format of the ACED to discuss the patient’s everyday financial management activities and possible approaches to managing his or her financial problems and employed standardized rating criteria for patients’ responses.</p>
<p>The Chinese ACED was administered to each patient by a trained research assistant, who was blind to whether the participants were classified as cognitively normal, MCI, or mild AD. Relevant nonverbal communication was recorded and the ACED ability scores were generated. The Chinese ACED evaluates mental capacity along 4 dimensions including <italic>understanding</italic>, which is the ability to comprehend basic information about a problem, its potential solutions, and the risks and benefits associated with those solutions; <italic>appreciation</italic>, which is the ability of a person to recognize how a problem or solution pertains to his or her specific situation; <italic>reasoning</italic>, which is the ability to process the information in a logical fashion toward a decision; and <italic>expressing a choice</italic>, which is the ability to communicate his or her decision. Each dimension yields a respective ability score. The full ability score for understanding is 10, appreciation is 8, reasoning is 10, and expressing a choice is 2. The ACED total score is usually not calculated because significant enough deficits on even 1 dimension may result in mental incompetence, even when performance on other dimensions is intact. However, in order to better understand the performance of ACED in this sample, the ACED total score was calculated by the addition of all 4 component ability scores. To determine interrater reliabilities, 93 ACED interviews were audio-recorded digitally and rated by an independent rater.</p>

<sec id="section7-0891988713481268">
<title>Clinician Ratings</title>
<p>To evaluate the clinical significance of ACED scores, the mental capacity to make financial decisions was independently assessed by a geriatric psychiatrist blind to the ACED scores and to whether the participants were classified as cognitively normal, MCI, or mild AD. The psychiatrist was asked to assess whether the patient was mentally capable to decide on daily financial arrangements such as paying bills. The clinical judgment was based on the criteria in section 3 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 of the United Kingdom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891988713481268">13</xref>
</sup> The Act stipulates that the persons are unable to make decisions for themselves if:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item>
<p>they are unable to understand the information relevant to the decision;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>they are unable to retain that information;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>they are unable to use or weigh the information; or</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>they are unable to communicate a decision.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This standard was adopted in our study because it is an explicit and contemporary legal standard of mental capacity, which is being used in a country with common law systems similar to Hong Kong for assessment of capacities related to a variety of decisions, including financial decisions.<sup>

</sup> The patients were rated as “Mentally competent” or “Mentally incompetent.” A total of 20 patients were interviewed independently by 2 geriatric psychiatrists for interrater reliability; the κ value between the 2 raters was 0.7, which indicated substantial agreement<sup>

<p>For each ACED ability score, linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate whether correlated variables were predictive in each participant group and for all participants. The ability score was entered as a dependent variable, with the corresponding summary score of the MacCAT-T, the CDAD total score, the MMSE score, CVFT score, age, gender, and education entered as independent variables. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0891988713481268">Table 4</xref>. The relationships among these measures account for 36.4% (in reasoning) to 51% (in understanding) of the variance of the ACED scores across all participants. Summary scores of the MacCAT-T were found to be significant predictors of corresponding ACED ability scores. The results for the total ACED score are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0891988713481268">Table 5</xref>, where the MacCAT-T total score is used instead of summary score.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, decisional capacity for financial decisions and the 4 component decision-making abilities were assessed by clinician ratings and the ACED, respectively. In our study, the interrater agreement of clinician rating was substantially higher than that in Marson et al’s study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891988713481268">40</xref>
</sup> where agreement was assessed among neurologists, a geriatric psychiatrist, and geriatricians. This difference may be related to the fact that all our clinician raters are geriatric psychiatrists from the same research team and similar training background. Based on the clinician ratings, we found mental incapacity for financial affairs in a significant portion (more than 46%) of patients with mild AD. These patients demonstrated substantial and significant impairment in all the 4 component decision-making abilities as measured by the ACED. Our findings are consistent with studies using another measure of financial capacity<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891988713481268">3</xref>
</sup> and support the conclusion that mental incapacity with regard to financial decisions in early stages of dementia affects a significant proportion of patients with dementia.</p>
<p>At the same time, we found that more than 50% of patients with mild AD appeared to be mentally competent in making everyday financial decisions. Thus, a diagnosis of dementia does not necessarily mean that persons lack capacity to make decisions. Their autonomy should be maximized and respected. These findings highlight the importance of early and proper assessment of capacity to manage financial matters in this group of patients.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the ACED ability scores of the MCI group demonstrated mild but significant impairment when compared with the cognitively intact comparison group. Mild impaired performance in another financial capacity measure has also been reported in patients with MCI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481268">4</xref>
</sup> However, we do not find any significant difference in the proportion with impaired mental competence for financial decisions based on clinician ratings. These findings may suggest that these patients with MCI appear to function normally in activities of daily living; given that decisional capacity for financial matters is a higher order function, its impairment may be difficult to detect on clinical examination without more focused assessment.</p>
<p>The proportion of mental incapacity in making everyday financial decisions appears to be lower when compared with treatment decision making in the MCI group as well as the mild AD group. We can suggest several possibilities to explain these findings. The mental capacity required for making treatment decision may be higher than that required for everyday financial decisions, which would support the task-specific nature of mental capacity. It is also possible that our clinician raters were more experienced and knowledgeable in assessing mental incapacity for treatment decisions, so that the impairments in mental capacity for treatment decisions were more readily detectable. Another possibility is that the guidance to clinician raters for assessing capacity may not have been sensitive enough to allow them to detect impairment in financial decision making. All these possibilities reflect the need for an objective and structured assessment tool for mental capacity in financial decisions.</p>
<p>The Financial Capacity Instrument, based on a task-domain-global conceptual model, provides a comprehensive structured assessment of financial ability for persons with AD and MCI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891988713481268">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891988713481268"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891988713481268">5</xref>
</sup> It has sound psychometric properties and allows assessment of financial capacity in different domains. However, it requires between 30 and 50 minutes for administration.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891988713481268">41</xref>
</sup> The ACED in this study, which focuses on direct evaluation of the 4 important component decisional abilities, demonstrated good applicability to clinical practice. Most of our participants could complete the interview within 15 minutes. There was no marked difficulty reported in administering the ACED to patients with dementia in our study. Its ability scores directly describe the participants’ abilities to understand, appreciate, reason, and express a choice about how they solve financial problems. It would be useful to evaluate the relationship between these 2 assessment tools and study whether they may address different domains and hence can complement each other.</p>
<p>Although assessing the psychometric properties of the ACED was not a primary purpose of the study, interrater reliability as measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient was satisfactory. The ACED’s reliability may be related to its detailed interview manual and explicit rating criteria. Internal consistency for the 3 dimensions of the ACED (understanding, appreciation, and reasoning) ranged from 0.64 to 0.78, indicating that the items included were highly consistent and suggesting that a single construct was being measured within each of these dimensions. Convergent validity of the ACED was supported by comparison with clinicians’ dichotomous ratings of competence, which significantly correlated with all component ability scores.</p>
<p>Multivariate regression was used to assess the power of the corresponding MacCAT-T decision-making scores, cognitive measures, functional performance, age, sex, and education in predicting the ACED ability scores. The MacCAT-T scores, which assess capacity for treatment-related decisions, were significant predictors of all ACED ability scores across all participants, suggesting that decision-making abilities may generalize substantially across different types of decisions.</p>
<p>Close relationships between cognitive measures and mental capacity have been reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891988713481268">10</xref>
</sup> This relationship appears to be evident for financial decisions. Among the correlated variables, the MMSE score was found to be the strongest predictor of the ACED ability score of understanding, and CVFT score was found to be a significant predictor of the ACED ability scores for appreciation and reasoning. The findings of CVFT also reflect the significant influence of executive dysfunction on decisional abilities in making financial decisions. However, the distinctness of predictor profiles for each component ability score suggests that they may be affected by diverse aspects of cognitive functioning.</p>
<p>The finding that age was a significant predictor of scores on the ACED’s scale for ability to appreciate financial issues is interesting. In the ACED, patients are asked to understand standardized money management problems and suggest options to solve problems. It is possible that different generations might have different concepts of money management, and older patients may face more difficulty in appreciating these options. This difference suggests that social and cultural factors may influence one’s financial capacity and also highlight the task-specific nature of mental capacity assessment.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. Financial management encompasses a range of decisions and functional abilities. This study focused on decision-making abilities in making everyday financial decisions. The patients’ financial experience, socioeconomic status, and premorbid level of functioning were not evaluated in this study of a convenience sample. However, our sample is well characterized and consistent with epidemiological samples in terms of demographic and cognitive variables<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891988713481268">1</xref>
</sup> and relatively large among studies of mental capacity. By demonstrating the feasibility of direct and reliable assessment of decision-making abilities for financial decisions in older populations, we anticipate that these data will help to stimulate future research in this area.</p>
<p>In our study, the correlation between the 3 ability scores of the ACED (understanding, appreciation, and reasoning) and the clinician ratings was moderate in strength.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891988713481268">42</xref>
</sup> Although mentally competent participants tend to have higher ACED scores, the utility of these scores alone to predict competence needs to be further evaluated. Cairns et al showed that the MacCAT-T in combination with a clinical interview can produce a highly reliable judgment of mental capacity for psychiatric inpatients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0891988713481268">43</xref>
</sup> It is worthwhile to investigate whether the ACED, like the MacCAT-T, can serve as a useful adjunct to the clinical judgment of patients’ financial capacity.</p>
<p>There is no universal standard for evaluating financial capacity. To maintain ecological validity of an assessment, the assessment should be tailored and individualized to the required task. The ACED used by our study provides a useful and clinically applicable standardized framework to assess mental capacity to make decisions regarding various everyday financial matters. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate its application in different contexts and different clinical populations.</p>
